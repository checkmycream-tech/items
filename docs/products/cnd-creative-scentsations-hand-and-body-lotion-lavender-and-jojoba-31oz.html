            <li> Product is exactly what I wanted. Will definitely order this again from seller. Product was taped nicely so no leaks or breaks. Very happy!</li>
            <li> Love the product and the service;) thank you</li>
            <li> i order for my sisterinlaw, she loves it</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  It does and smell strong nor is it greasy.</li>
            <li> love thew sent and the silkiness!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Not happy with shipping preparation. UPS placed in a USPS Priority envelope that was too small and broke pump nozzle. Use the one from my prior bottle.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time and adore it. It makes my skin smooth and supple smells great and is therapeutic all around. I need to order soon again. I don&#x27;t want it to disappear</li>
            <li> I will reorder from this company from now on. Excellent!  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Nice moisture and you can&#x27;t beat lavendar scent! Very relaxing! My husband, who is a mechanic, uses it too! I can tell by the scent!</li>
            <li> Been using it since it hit the shelves.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent for dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;has a great relaxing scent.&lt;br /&gt;My husband likes using it as well.&lt;br /&gt;we use it all summer long&lt;br /&gt;Gives your skin a smooth soft feeling and&lt;br /&gt;hides and repairs dry summer skin.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  My manicurist uses if for hand massages and I noticed the unusual, but very pleasant scent.  I got the large size and use it all over after the shower.</li>
            <li> The pedicure place that I go to uses this lotion. I since then purchased it on amazon and love it. I have been trying for years to find a scent equivalent to Bath&amp;Body Works &amp;#34;Sleep&amp;#34; lotion because theirs is so expensive. The lavender scent is perfect, not overpowering but still gives you the relaxing scent. The lotion is not thick like Bath&amp;Body Works but not too runny either. Overall it is a great inexpensive lotion.</li>
            <li> Great  size and price but more than that it&#x27;s my Wife&#x27;s favorite so I&#x27;m happy with it but package better for shipping next Time</li>
            <li> I Love this lotion, smells great and lasts all day. Would purchase again, worth the money. Nice fresh clean scent.</li>
            <li> Love this!!!  I use it as a body lotion and it smells so good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for years.  I usually get very tired of scents of creams and colognes but I keep on buying this one.  There are other lovely scents but the cream itself is silky and so nice.</li>
            <li> It shipped fast and is wonderful lotion that lasts forever, and the bottle is really pretty for the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  Some spa place I had gone to had it and I just fell in love with the scent - I&#x27;ve been using it now for several years.  It&#x27;s not an overpowering smell and just is fresh!  Hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it.</li>
            <li> I love the product, and have used it for years.  However, the seller packaged it for the end of the world.  There was so much tape and layers of wrapping, it took me ten minutes to cut it out of the packaging.</li>
            <li> Very nice scent, creamy lotion but not sticky.</li>
            <li> CND makes great products and this is one of them.  The Lavender and Johoba lotion smell amazing!  The lotion goes on smoothly and absorbs right away.  There is no greasy after effects at all and your hands are baby soft for sure.  I have one at work and a huge one on my night stand.  This is for sure a keeper of a product.  Eventually I will try another scent but currently this one is heavenly.  There is a reason all good salons use this brand.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I had used it for several years and bought it from my nail technician.  Then I moved and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  So I googled it and low and behold there it was.  This bottle will last about six months so it&#x27;s a great buy.  Feels great on your skin and the fragrance is very nice indeed.  I use this all the time instead of perfume.  Highly recommend this product!!  I haven&#x27;t tried any other fragrance but I&#x27;m sure they are quite  nice as well.</li>
            <li> My nail tech uses this at the end of my service and I bought some.  Now keep a bottle in almost every room in the house!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion; my manicurest uses it and I had to buy some for myself at home!</li>
            <li> Smells so good and is a great light lotion for summer....just don&#x27;t use it and go right out to work in the yard. It smells so much like natural lavender, I think, that the insects were loving it.</li>
            <li> I have tried three different scents of this lotion and this is my favorite (other scents: black cherry and nutmeg; coconut mango).  The scent is a wonderfully clean smelling scent.  Fragrant lavender without being overwhelming the nose. And beyond that it is a wonderfully moisturizing lotion.  Lasts long; absorbs fast without being greasy.</li>
