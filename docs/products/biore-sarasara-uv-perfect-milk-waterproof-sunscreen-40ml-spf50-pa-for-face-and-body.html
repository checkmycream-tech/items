            <li>Great.</li>
            <li>This sunblock works amazing and is not sold on the island of Oahu!</li>
            <li>Good for oily skin.</li>
            <li>It is a good product.</li>
            <li>Its the kind of size good for carrying in your purse.</li>
            <li>Perfect for oily skin, this dries quickly and leaves a smooth satin finish, making it a great primer for face makeup.  </li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen!  </li>
            <li>I was introduced to this by my daughter-in-law and love it!  </li>
            <li>The oil control is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Nice size bottle and</li>
            <li>Nice lotion.</li>
            <li>Great protection, great formula, water/sweatproof, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>So this drips out like milk (did I say that already?) and goes on and feels like a matte kind of liquid</li>
            <li>so my face burns very easily.</li>
            <li>very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>and she said everything in Japan was good no matter how cheap they are.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this the best sunscreen I ever used .thin and glides in ur skin .</li>
            <li>but I liked the Biore Watery Essence much better</li>
            <li>Easily one of my favorite sunscreens!</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll be fine!</li>
            <li>It is a very light sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very light and truly waterproof.</li>
            <li>this sunscreen protected our faces during two weeks in Hawaii with no burning even after most of the day in and out of the sun, swimming, snorkeling, etc.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Now I know better about &amp;#34;you get what you paid for&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I had tried so many sunscreen like Clinique, neutrogena, etc.</li>
            <li>This summer I traveled to Japan and purchased cleanser and exfoliator, tried them couple times and my skin was OK.</li>
            <li>if you pay more, you get more satisfy.</li>
            <li>Also, the shipping take more than 2 weeks to arrive because it is from Thailand.</li>
            <li>There are a lot of greater and cheaper sunscreen products out there.</li>
            <li>What could be better?  </li>
            <li>the Watery Essence has a magical feeling to it</li>
            <li>Recieved product but wish I would have been more &amp;#34;aware&amp;#34; of product size.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on how makeup goes on top of it.</li>
            <li>Very light weight, not greasy absorbs easily.  </li>
            <li>Also the customer service is extremely friendly!</li>
            <li>I ordered this in June 2015 and received the new PA++++/2015 formula despite what the image shows, which was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>I only use it on my face - and I&#x27;ll be more than happy to reorder when I&#x27;m running out.</li>
            <li>the liquid disappear very quickly, I am thinking maybe there is some alcohol mixing in it, so I don&#x27;t dare to put on my face to try.</li>
            <li>The people who said they didn&#x27;t break out are very lucky.</li>
            <li>oil.&lt;br /&gt;It is waterproof and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say if this product is too strong for someone</li>
            <li>biore perfect milk isn&#x27;t sticky or oily like other sun protection products once it is applied!</li>
            <li>Additionally, its really light and not oily it rubs into your skin really easily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely light weight and works as well as any sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Comfortable wear.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li>If anyone has sensitive skin like me, you can try products made in Japan or Korea which is good too.</li>
            <li>good for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>(but I&#x27;m pretty sure its light.)</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>Biore Sarasara Uv Aqua Rich Waterly Essence Sunscreen</li>
            <li>However, this is why I love it so much.</li>
            <li>I have extremely fair skin and like to wear a daily sunscreen on my face under my makeup.</li>
            <li>and it has not broken me out at all like most sunscreens do.</li>
            <li>It also has a fragrance that smells more girly, but the fragrance fades fast too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It quickly vanished into my skin.</li>
            <li>make sure where the seller/vendor is located at, and make sure you do further research on the price, don&#x27;t repeat my mistake!</li>
            <li>but it drys really quickly</li>
            <li>Great physical sunscreen and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This is such an amazing sunscreen.</li>
            <li>This really is a great product for after the shower and I repeatedly buy online since it&#x27;s not easy to find in the US.</li>
            <li>Also, your doctor can recommend the right brand for you.</li>
            <li>Some sunscreens only cover certain uva/uvb so read the product description carefully and find the one that best suits your needs.  </li>
            <li>I usually start within about 30 seconds, so that&#x27;s pretty great stuff.</li>
            <li>Very gentle and non sticky.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34; I highly recommend buy this as a tester and then buying a larger size if you liked it.</li>
            <li>It has a delicate texture, it is light and easy to apply, easily spread, rapidly absorbed, without grease.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers mentioned, the consistency is very runny, kind of like greasy, alcohol-scented milk, but it dries quickly with a matte finish.  </li>
            <li>This is my current favorite, go-to sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>be aware - rates is changes.</li>
            <li>They all irritated my skin by the first time use.</li>
            <li>so you won&#x27;t even really care or notice once it is absorbed and dired.    </li>
            <li>It absorbs VERY quickly and does not leave any white residue.</li>
            <li>I certainly will buy it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely more cosmetically elegant than the western sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried but as someone with oily skin it leaves me a little greasy.</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight which I really like.</li>
            <li>I have very acne prone skin</li>
            <li>I was surprised how well this sunscreen absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li>It blocks sunlight very well when I am doing outdoor exercise.</li>
            <li>I bought this without doing research, and was thinking order fast and can get it from Amazon within 2 weeks, so I can bring it to a vacation.</li>
            <li>, the same price can enable me to buy 2 to 3 bottles with free shipping instead of one bottle here.</li>
            <li>I learn the lesson.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is very watery.</li>
            <li>It is indeed &amp;#34;milky&amp;#34; and you have to shake it up, and it comes out fast.</li>
            <li>but the product really does have a &amp;#34;milk&amp;#34; finish.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it does go on greasy and is super liquid-y, but after it dries, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>I got this because I thought it contained more, which it probably does but due to the fact that this runs out like liquid milk, I will probably use it up faster.</li>
            <li>I really like this product so far, but compared to the non-waterproof version of this sunscreen it&#x27;s pretty greasy.</li>
            <li>I live in hot Tx and need to wear high SPF all the time</li>
            <li>Not ideal if you&#x27;re going for a dewy skin look, but great if you are trying to minimize an oily appearance.</li>
            <li>sunscreen usually breaks me out across my forehead but this one doesn&#x27;t and is effective through hour-long runs in swampy, humid weather and in outdoor pool workouts alike.</li>
            <li>Barely enough for one full body application, face and body?</li>
            <li>My skin is super acne-prone, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any clogged pores or breakouts from this sunscreen, even after using it for several months.</li>
            <li>If it is not shaken well, it will be more of a transparent white, instead of an opaque white.</li>
            <li>I also haven&#x27;t noticed any irritation from the high alcohol content or silicones in the product.</li>
            <li>When I first used this sunscreen, I thought the consistency was strange - exactly like liquid milk.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make me sweat more or feel heavy.</li>
            <li>No complaint about the product.</li>
            <li>The shipping is from Japan so delivery takes about a month with normal shipping.</li>
            <li>Normally, my face gets shiny and sweaty by midday, but even in super humid weather, this sunscreen keeps my skin perfectly dry until evening.  </li>
            <li>would recommend that if you are going into direct sun with little ones, you research more than one product to maximize the sun protection for yourself and your family.  </li>
            <li>new products rated P++++</li>
            <li>The bottle is a bit small, so I ordered 2 at a time to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li>I was a big fan of the version of this that comes in the white bottle (I can&#x27;t remember what it&#x27;s called), and I&#x27;ve used the Bright Face version in the pink bottle as well; both are excellent sunscreens, but the white leaves too white of a cast for me now that I&#x27;ve gotten a bit of a tan, and the pink comes out in an actual pink fluid that doesn&#x27;t work well with my naturally flushed complexion, for some reason.</li>
            <li>It sinks into the skin quickly and does not seem to leave a greasy residue.  </li>
            <li>but I really can&#x27;t fully say because it is winter, I don&#x27;t go in direct sunlight and wear a hat often if I am going outside.</li>
            <li>You are buying old stock.</li>
            <li>It does go on very watery if you&#x27;re used to the regular sunscreen you buy at the store.</li>
            <li>This is because my face and neck are usually sensitive to Titanium dioxide and Zinc Oxide.  </li>
            <li>It seems like it is lasting decently -</li>
            <li>As long as you don&#x27;t get excited and do the &amp;#34;hard squeeze&amp;#34; first dispense from memory with thick, sludgier formulas-</li>
            <li>but it clearly isn&#x27;t because I totally ignored the \\&quot;Milk\\&quot; title.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Asian and my skin is really sensitive.</li>
            <li>Nice to have a goto sunscreen for the face that doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or thick.  </li>
            <li>It leaves a true matte finish-- on me, at least.</li>
            <li>During one outdoor event, I got a slight sunburn on my shoulders and chest (despite using heavy duty outdoor sunscreen) but my face was fine.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because of the high SPF and some reviews said it goes on without a white finish (while other reviews said it did).</li>
            <li>I needed a sunscreen for my little one that was not greasy and this has worked very well.  </li>
            <li>This stuff feels like really good lotion, doesn&#x27;t smell bad and seems to protect my skin from excess sun.&lt;br</li>

            <li> It is very lightweight which I really like.</li>
            <li> I have very acne prone skin</li>
            <li> I was surprised how well this sunscreen absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li> It blocks sunlight very well when I am doing outdoor exercise.</li>
            <li> I bought this without doing research, and was thinking order fast and can get it from Amazon within 2 weeks, so I can bring it to a vacation.</li>
            <li> , the same price can enable me to buy 2 to 3 bottles with free shipping instead of one bottle here.</li>
            <li> I learn the lesson.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is very watery.</li>
            <li> It is indeed &amp;#34;milky&amp;#34; and you have to shake it up, and it comes out fast.</li>
            <li> but the product really does have a &amp;#34;milk&amp;#34; finish.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it does go on greasy and is super liquid-y, but after it dries, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> I got this because I thought it contained more, which it probably does but due to the fact that this runs out like liquid milk, I will probably use it up faster.</li>
            <li> I really like this product so far, but compared to the non-waterproof version of this sunscreen it&#x27;s pretty greasy.</li>
            <li> I live in hot Tx and need to wear high SPF all the time</li>
            <li> Not ideal if you&#x27;re going for a dewy skin look, but great if you are trying to minimize an oily appearance.</li>
            <li> sunscreen usually breaks me out across my forehead but this one doesn&#x27;t and is effective through hour-long runs in swampy, humid weather and in outdoor pool workouts alike.</li>
            <li> Barely enough for one full body application, face and body?</li>
            <li> My skin is super acne-prone, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any clogged pores or breakouts from this sunscreen, even after using it for several months.</li>
            <li> If it is not shaken well, it will be more of a transparent white, instead of an opaque white.</li>
            <li> I also haven&#x27;t noticed any irritation from the high alcohol content or silicones in the product.</li>
            <li> When I first used this sunscreen, I thought the consistency was strange - exactly like liquid milk.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make me sweat more or feel heavy.</li>
            <li> No complaint about the product.</li>
            <li> The shipping is from Japan so delivery takes about a month with normal shipping.</li>
            <li> Normally, my face gets shiny and sweaty by midday, but even in super humid weather, this sunscreen keeps my skin perfectly dry until evening.  </li>
            <li> would recommend that if you are going into direct sun with little ones, you research more than one product to maximize the sun protection for yourself and your family.  </li>
            <li> new products rated P++++</li>
            <li> The bottle is a bit small, so I ordered 2 at a time to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> I was a big fan of the version of this that comes in the white bottle (I can&#x27;t remember what it&#x27;s called), and I&#x27;ve used the Bright Face version in the pink bottle as well; both are excellent sunscreens, but the white leaves too white of a cast for me now that I&#x27;ve gotten a bit of a tan, and the pink comes out in an actual pink fluid that doesn&#x27;t work well with my naturally flushed complexion, for some reason.</li>
            <li> It sinks into the skin quickly and does not seem to leave a greasy residue.  </li>
            <li> but I really can&#x27;t fully say because it is winter, I don&#x27;t go in direct sunlight and wear a hat often if I am going outside.</li>
            <li> You are buying old stock.</li>
            <li> It does go on very watery if you&#x27;re used to the regular sunscreen you buy at the store.</li>
            <li> This is because my face and neck are usually sensitive to Titanium dioxide and Zinc Oxide.  </li>
            <li> It seems like it is lasting decently -</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t get excited and do the &amp;#34;hard squeeze&amp;#34; first dispense from memory with thick, sludgier formulas-</li>
            <li> but it clearly isn&#x27;t because I totally ignored the \\&quot;Milk\\&quot; title.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian and my skin is really sensitive.</li>
            <li> Nice to have a goto sunscreen for the face that doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or thick.  </li>
            <li> It leaves a true matte finish-- on me, at least.</li>
            <li> During one outdoor event, I got a slight sunburn on my shoulders and chest (despite using heavy duty outdoor sunscreen) but my face was fine.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because of the high SPF and some reviews said it goes on without a white finish (while other reviews said it did).</li>
            <li> I needed a sunscreen for my little one that was not greasy and this has worked very well.  </li>
            <li> This stuff feels like really good lotion, doesn&#x27;t smell bad and seems to protect my skin from excess sun.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, you will definitely have to use a separate moisturizer.</li>
            <li> For everyday use this small quantity would be used up quickly.</li>
            <li> one downside is that as another reviewer said it does take a long time to ship (40+ days for me).</li>
            <li> This blue bottle leaves only a very slight white cast and is mattifying without making me look like I smeared on foundation or something.</li>
            <li> The bad thing is it dries too quick and you need to spread it around fast.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this that long, but so far my sensitive skin hasn&#x27;t broken out.</li>
            <li> It may be a little bit stick at first when i just put on, but just give it 5 min to set, there is no more stickness.</li>
            <li> This is the prfect sunscreen for oily skin, I suffer from dry skin so it makes me look too powdery and dry</li>
            <li> And even though it includes physical sunblock ingredients, it doesn&#x27;t leave a ghostly whitish cast on my dark skin, although I do notice that it lightens up my face just a tad (although not really noticeably so).  </li>
            <li> and I expected it to feel a little different as a waterproof sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t break me out and dried instantly when applied.</li>
            <li> I could no longer stand the thickness and sticky feeling of other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> The small size it comes in makes this product &amp;#34;for face and neck only.</li>
            <li> This has also outperformed other SPF50 products.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, I&#x27;ve found that other sunblock when used on my face will irritate my eyes, but not this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive-acne prone skin..</li>
            <li> So, my advise is to be very careful to research where</li>
            <li> I bought this expecting it to be as good as the &#x27;waterly essence&#x27; sunscreen, but was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> However, my little one prefers this to any other product and the protection has proved great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually sit in front of a fan for ~2 minutes or so, just to get it to dry quicker.</li>
            <li> It is like water when it comes out, but feels a little oily when I applied it on my face.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s thin and there&#x27;s no white cast.</li>
            <li> The bottle is very small but that didn&#x27;t influence my review one way or the other.</li>
            <li> Because the seller is outside of US, if there is anything wrong with the product, you have to pay the shipping fee in order to return the product.</li>
            <li> I will use it on my hands from now on, so I won&#x27;t waste my money over my mistake...ha!</li>
            <li> Size is indeed small, like a small lotion bottle, but I just ordered two to compensate.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s small for this price in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is a small bottle and a comparable size to the water essence.</li>
            <li> It is a little on the thin side, but that is because I am used to thicker sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> It does not cause some side effects or negative reactions.</li>
            <li> And doesn&#x27;t feel like a thick layer of screen protector on your face; it feels lighter than a lotion (oil like?)</li>
            <li> I am always forgetting to put sunscreen on my arms because it takes so long to put the other brands of sunscreen on (have to rub it in viciously and then wait otherwise</li>
            <li> If you pay less, you won&#x27;t get any crap.</li>
            <li> but needless</li>
            <li> I paid $30 for the useless shiseido products which I ended up giving to friends and family for them to try.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it on my body because I am afraid it will run out faster.</li>
            <li> These are very expensive &amp; you have to wait for them.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen doesn&#x27;t make me disappointed.</li>
            <li> And at $8 a bottle you can&#x27;t go wrong!!</li>
            <li> If you hate sunscreens that make your face sweat, then try this one out.</li>
            <li> I broke out so bad after one use!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice size bottle and this sunscreen protected our faces during two weeks in Hawaii with no burning even after most of the day in and out of the sun, swimming, snorkeling, etc.</li>
            <li> This is such an amazing sunscreen. It is very lightweight which I really like. I could no longer stand the thickness and sticky feeling of other sunscreens. I can confidently go outside and know that I am protected from the sun even though it does not feel like I am wearing sunscreen at all!</li>
            <li> Nice lotion. Stays on through lots of sweating as I train for a marathon. I know it&#x27;s still on because when I take a shower it takes a while to feel like it&#x27;s off. It isn&#x27;t greasy and I can&#x27;t prove this, but I think it&#x27;s improving the quality of my skin.</li>
            <li> I needed a sunscreen for my little one that was not greasy and this has worked very well.  It sinks into the skin quickly and does not seem to leave a greasy residue.  It is a little on the thin side, but that is because I am used to thicker sunscreens.  However, my little one prefers this to any other product and the protection has proved great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend that if you are going into direct sun with little ones, you research more than one product to maximize the sun protection for yourself and your family.  Some sunscreens only cover certain uva/uvb so read the product description carefully and find the one that best suits your needs.  Also, your doctor can recommend the right brand for you.</li>
            <li> The product IS in a milk-like consistency, as it claims. And doesn&#x27;t feel like a thick layer of screen protector on your face; it feels lighter than a lotion (oil like?) The small size it comes in makes this product &amp;#34;for face and neck only. &amp;#34; I highly recommend buy this as a tester and then buying a larger size if you liked it. My skin is not prone to breaking out or irritation so I can&#x27;t say if this product is too strong for someone (but I&#x27;m pretty sure its light.)</li>
            <li> This is my current favorite, go-to sunscreen.  As other reviewers mentioned, the consistency is very runny, kind of like greasy, alcohol-scented milk, but it dries quickly with a matte finish.  The oil control is amazing.  Normally, my face gets shiny and sweaty by midday, but even in super humid weather, this sunscreen keeps my skin perfectly dry until evening.  It&#x27;s waterproof so it doesn&#x27;t come off when I sweat, unlike the Biore Watery Essence sunscreen  And even though it includes physical sunblock ingredients, it doesn&#x27;t leave a ghostly whitish cast on my dark skin, although I do notice that it lightens up my face just a tad (although not really noticeably so).  My skin is super acne-prone, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any clogged pores or breakouts from this sunscreen, even after using it for several months. I also haven&#x27;t noticed any irritation from the high alcohol content or silicones in the product.</li>
            <li> be aware - rates is changes. Instead of P+++ (3pluses) new products rated P++++ (4pluces). You are buying old stock.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this that long, but so far my sensitive skin hasn&#x27;t broken out.</li>
            <li> sunscreen usually breaks me out across my forehead but this one doesn&#x27;t and is effective through hour-long runs in swampy, humid weather and in outdoor pool workouts alike.</li>
            <li> Easily one of my favorite sunscreens! Perfect for oily skin, this dries quickly and leaves a smooth satin finish, making it a great primer for face makeup.  This has also outperformed other SPF50 products.  During one outdoor event, I got a slight sunburn on my shoulders and chest (despite using heavy duty outdoor sunscreen) but my face was fine.  I will definitely be repurchasing!</li>
            <li> The best waterproof sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t even feel like you have anything on!. I got this after reading all the great reviews. It does go on very watery if you&#x27;re used to the regular sunscreen you buy at the store. However, this is why I love it so much. It absorbs VERY quickly and does not leave any white residue. I am always forgetting to put sunscreen on my arms because it takes so long to put the other brands of sunscreen on (have to rub it in viciously and then wait otherwise anything you touch will have sunscreen on it). I live in hot Tx and need to wear high SPF all the time so this is a great product that is convenient to apply and feels great. The bottle is a bit small, so I ordered 2 at a time to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> I have extremely fair skin and like to wear a daily sunscreen on my face under my makeup. This is the only product I&#x27;ve found- after extensive searching, that doesn&#x27;t have a sunscreen smell or feel greasy. It&#x27;s extremely light weight and works as well as any sunscreen. I also consider it a moisturizer that is non greasy. Definitely worth the money! Only wish it came in a larger size.</li>
            <li> It has a delicate texture, it is light and easy to apply, easily spread, rapidly absorbed, without grease. The product is waterproof.</li>
            <li> This is the prfect sunscreen for oily skin, I suffer from dry skin so it makes me look too powdery and dry but needless it would be great for oily skin</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I hate greasy sunblocks that make dirt stick to your face, this is great and always goes on matte.</li>
            <li> Product wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting, packaging was in Japanese...literally</li>
            <li> When I first used this sunscreen, I thought the consistency was strange - exactly like liquid milk. I knew that the product name said milk in it, but wasn&#x27;t expecting that. Once it dries, it is totally matte and almost powdery, not at all greasy like American sunscreens. Not ideal if you&#x27;re going for a dewy skin look, but great if you are trying to minimize an oily appearance. It didn&#x27;t leave a noticeable white cast on me at all, but I am fair-medium skin tone. I have very acne prone skin and it has not broken me out at all like most sunscreens do. The only possible downside is that it has alcohol in it and is not moisturizing at all. If you have dry skin, you will definitely have to use a separate moisturizer. This is a chemical/physical combination sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how well this sunscreen absorbed into my skin. It is like water when it comes out, but feels a little oily when I applied it on my face. It quickly vanished into my skin. I didn&#x27;t noticed any shininess or an oily feeling.  The bad thing is it dries too quick and you need to spread it around fast.It is good for humid weather too! It didn&#x27;t make me sweat more or feel heavy. It is a very light sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a ball inside, so you can hear it when you shake it. If it is not shaken well, it will be more of a transparent white, instead of an opaque white. It also has a fragrance that smells more girly, but the fragrance fades fast too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if this was meant for women, but I like it. I did get a rash on my neck though, but not my face. This is because my face and neck are usually sensitive to Titanium dioxide and Zinc Oxide.  The Biore Sarasara Uv Perfect Milk Waterproof Sunscreen 40ml Spf50+ Pa+++ for Face and Body has Titanium dioxide in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I use this on my face and ears. I don&#x27;t use it on my body because I am afraid it will run out faster. If you hate sunscreens that make your face sweat, then try this one out.</li>
            <li> Now I know better about &amp;#34;you get what you paid for&amp;#34;. Yes, it&#x27;s thin and there&#x27;s no white cast. But it irritates my eyes and it&#x27;s either non-water proof or the PA+ doesn&#x27;t work at all. BTW, I re-applied every 2 hours when I was out there on vacation. Not recommendated, won&#x27;t buy it anymore.</li>
            <li> It blocks sunlight very well when I am doing outdoor exercise. It does not cause some side effects or negative reactions. I WILL BUY IT AGAIN!</li>
            <li> This sunblock works amazing and is not sold on the island of Oahu! I&#x27;m in the sun daily so I&#x27;ve tried every sunblock on the market including the over priced shiseido facial block which comes off in the water.  biore perfect milk isn&#x27;t sticky or oily like other sun protection products once it is applied! And at $8 a bottle you can&#x27;t go wrong!! I paid $30 for the useless shiseido products which I ended up giving to friends and family for them to try.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen doesn&#x27;t make me disappointed. It is very light and truly waterproof. I&#x27;m Asian and my skin is really sensitive. I had tried so many sunscreen like Clinique, neutrogena, etc. They all irritated my skin by the first time use. This summer I traveled to Japan and purchased cleanser and exfoliator, tried them couple times and my skin was OK. So now I realize I can only use products made in Japan (I think it is because Japan products made based on Asians&#x27; skin structure). If anyone has sensitive skin like me, you can try products made in Japan or Korea which is good too. My niece is studying in Japan and she said everything in Japan was good no matter how cheap they are. if you pay more, you get more satisfy. If you pay less, you won&#x27;t get any crap.</li>
            <li> This stuff feels like really good lotion, doesn&#x27;t smell bad and seems to protect my skin from excess sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says &amp;#34;milk&amp;#34;, and that is the appearance, both in color and consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped from Japan, but arrived in a timely fashion. It seems like it is lasting decently - I only use it on my face - and I&#x27;ll be more than happy to reorder when I&#x27;m running out.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! It doesn&#x27;t give you an oiled appearence. If you have brown skin, you will need a little makeup, because it gets your skin a little white, but it&#x27;s not terrible like other sunscreens. I certainly will buy it again![[ASIN:B000FQMY4Y Biore Sarasara Uv Perfect Milk Waterproof Sunscreen 40ml Spf50+ Pa+++ for Face and Body]]</li>
            <li> I bought this without doing research, and was thinking order fast and can get it from Amazon within 2 weeks, so I can bring it to a vacation. I was wrong. It was my mistake of purchase something without further research. Also I didn&#x27;t dig further to understand the seller is from Thailand, I thought every things sell at amazon are within US. It was my mistake also. I felt regret later after hearing a friend telling me there were cheaper price that I can buy some where else. I search on e-bay, the same price can enable me to buy 2 to 3 bottles with free shipping instead of one bottle here. Also, the shipping take more than 2 weeks to arrive because it is from Thailand. Because the seller is outside of US, if there is anything wrong with the product, you have to pay the shipping fee in order to return the product. So, my advise is to be very careful to research where the seller located at whenever buying from Amazon. I learn the lesson.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is very watery. I pour it to apply on my hand, it looks like white flour mix with a lot of water. the liquid disappear very quickly, I am thinking maybe there is some alcohol mixing in it, so I don&#x27;t dare to put on my face to try. I will use it on my hands from now on, so I won&#x27;t waste my money over my mistake...ha! There are a lot of greater and cheaper sunscreen products out there. make sure where the seller/vendor is located at, and make sure you do further research on the price, don&#x27;t repeat my mistake!</li>
            <li> I take a lot of acne medications so my face burns very easily. This sunblock works great, and I&#x27;ve never burned with it on.  Additionally, its really light and not oily it rubs into your skin really easily.  Additionally, I&#x27;ve found that other sunblock when used on my face will irritate my eyes, but not this stuff.  Cannot recommend enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one downside is that as another reviewer said it does take a long time to ship (40+ days for me).</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen!  Very light weight, not greasy absorbs easily.  I was introduced to this by my daughter-in-law and love it!  Also a great price!</li>
            <li> I ordered this in June 2015 and received the new PA++++/2015 formula despite what the image shows, which was a pleasant surprise. Size is indeed small, like a small lotion bottle, but I just ordered two to compensate. Great protection, great formula, water/sweatproof, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Sunblock that doesn&#x27;t run into and sting your eyes!  Also doesnt feel sticky or greasy on your face!  What could be better?  I used this exclusively when I lived in Singapore (after testing every brand I could get my hands on).  I get this online now that I am in the US because I don&#x27;t want to give it up.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this the best sunscreen I ever used .thin and glides in ur skin . Already purchased another one .</li>
            <li> I was a big fan of the version of this that comes in the white bottle (I can&#x27;t remember what it&#x27;s called), and I&#x27;ve used the Bright Face version in the pink bottle as well; both are excellent sunscreens, but the white leaves too white of a cast for me now that I&#x27;ve gotten a bit of a tan, and the pink comes out in an actual pink fluid that doesn&#x27;t work well with my naturally flushed complexion, for some reason. This blue bottle leaves only a very slight white cast and is mattifying without making me look like I smeared on foundation or something.</li>
            <li> Used this at the beach for four days and never got a hint of burn. Works great under makeup.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t break me out and dried instantly when applied. Gave face a matte-like texture.</li>
            <li> No complaint about the product. It&#x27;s fine. The shipping is from Japan so delivery takes about a month with normal shipping. However I advise you to pay attention to the SIZE of this product. Its only 40 ml. That&#x27;s small for this price in my opinion. Its the kind of size good for carrying in your purse. For everyday use this small quantity would be used up quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this expecting it to be as good as the &#x27;waterly essence&#x27; sunscreen, but was very disappointed. These are very expensive &amp; you have to wait for them. I have extremely sensitive-acne prone skin..I broke out so bad after one use! The people who said they didn&#x27;t break out are very lucky. This one didn&#x27;t last 1 day for me. The &#x27;waterly essence&#x27; for some reason did not do that. I wish I had bought 2 bottles of that instead..</li>
            <li> Good for oily skin. However it contains alcohol which is why I&#x27;m staying away from it now</li>
            <li> good for my sensitive skin. very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Comfortable wear. It gave me about 2 hours before starting to burn. I usually start within about 30 seconds, so that&#x27;s pretty great stuff. It is indeed &amp;#34;milky&amp;#34; and you have to shake it up, and it comes out fast. As long as you don&#x27;t get excited and do the &amp;#34;hard squeeze&amp;#34; first dispense from memory with thick, sludgier formulas- you&#x27;ll be fine!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent sunscreen but I liked the Biore Watery Essence much better and I would recommend that over this Perfect Milk.    This is a small bottle and a comparable size to the water essence. I got this because I thought it contained more, which it probably does but due to the fact that this runs out like liquid milk, I will probably use it up faster. Also I thought it was like the watery essence but it clearly isn&#x27;t because I totally ignored the \\&quot;Milk\\&quot; title.    So this drips out like milk (did I say that already?) and goes on and feels like a matte kind of liquid but it drys really quickly so you won&#x27;t even really care or notice once it is absorbed and dired.    If you are debating between this and the [[ASIN:B004LRO7DO Biore Sarasara Uv Aqua Rich Waterly Essence Sunscreen 50g Spf50+ Pa+++ for Face and Body]], I would recommend the Watery essence over this because (IMO) the Watery Essence has a magical feeling to it and you don&#x27;t even feel or sense it being applied (almost)</li>
            <li> I really like this product so far, but compared to the non-waterproof version of this sunscreen it&#x27;s pretty greasy. It&#x27;s definitely more cosmetically elegant than the western sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried but as someone with oily skin it leaves me a little greasy. Overall, it&#x27;s a great product and I expected it to feel a little different as a waterproof sunscreen. I haven&#x27;t actually swam in it yet but it stays in place when I sweat and doesn&#x27;t run into my eyes.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this sunscreen! I was looking for a physical sunscreen as I&#x27;m on Retin-A and sometimes the chemical ones hurt my dear face. My only complaint is that it does go on greasy and is super liquid-y, but after it dries, it&#x27;s amazing! I usually sit in front of a fan for ~2 minutes or so, just to get it to dry quicker. It leaves a true matte finish-- on me, at least. Great physical sunscreen and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> $11 for such a small bottle is absolutely a joke! How can you apply this on your body and face? Is it one time use only product?</li>
            <li> This is a liquid type sunscreen product. It just look like milk and it has no smell. It is a good product. It may be a little bit stick at first when i just put on, but just give it 5 min to set, there is no more stickness. Very gentle and non sticky. No shine . Great.</li>
            <li> Recieved product but wish I would have been more &amp;#34;aware&amp;#34; of product size. I believe the description stated for face and body...the tiniest bottle arrived today. Barely enough for one full body application, face and body? This is a joke.</li>
            <li> One of the reasons i like to use this product is that it makes your face matte and controls oil.&lt;br /&gt;It is waterproof and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product! Also the customer service is extremely friendly!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I am using Retin A and HAVE to wear sunscreen. I bought this because of the high SPF and some reviews said it goes on without a white finish (while other reviews said it did). It does leave a white finish. I am lighter Caucasian and there is a white finish. I like that it is a matte finish but the product really does have a &amp;#34;milk&amp;#34; finish. I think it works well but I really can&#x27;t fully say because it is winter, I don&#x27;t go in direct sunlight and wear a hat often if I am going outside. I can&#x27;t comment on how makeup goes on top of it. The bottle is very small but that didn&#x27;t influence my review one way or the other.</li>
            <li> Nice to have a goto sunscreen for the face that doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or thick.  This really is a great product for after the shower and I repeatedly buy online since it&#x27;s not easy to find in the US.</li>
