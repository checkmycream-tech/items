            <li>In fact, I found a Body Shop lavender lotion in an airport about 15 years ago and had been looking for something that smelled as good.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell!</li>
            <li>This oil is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice smell.</li>
            <li>I love to give massages to my wife and I needed something really good</li>
            <li>But any goods differ from man to man, I hope you choose according to their own situation to make the arrangements.</li>
            <li>The lavender aroma is so nice and relaxing</li>
            <li>I checked out the reviews before and liked what was said.</li>
            <li>It does have a very strong lavander scent, however, so if you&#x27;re not keen on lavander, this may not be for you.</li>
            <li>This one works the best, in our opinion, and after the massage, it just seems to absorb naturally into the skin.</li>
            <li>Great right before bed after a loooong day at work.</li>
            <li>However, it is understood that brand goods are good, it is worth to be recommended.</li>
            <li>This product is way better than its Bath and Body works counterpart.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>My wife and I love using it and it almost puts you to sleep.</li>
            <li>I saw some reviews about the Lavender scent having a bite to it, which honestly isn&#x27;t that true.</li>
            <li>Super relaxing and makes your skin feel amazing</li>
            <li>If that particularly strong lavender scent is what you are after, then give this a shot.</li>
            <li>You have to slightly squeeze the bottle in order to get the oil which is perfect because it protects from accidental spills.  </li>
            <li>You should have smelled my oil before, now that had a real bite to it and that is what I liked about it.</li>
            <li>Not overly strong smell, feels good when work out the knots on the back of my neck.</li>
            <li>This oil is super comfortable and soothing.  </li>
            <li>This particular oil has a very strong lavender cast to its smell, and really seemed to push me out of the mood of using it more than &#x27;calming&#x27; or &#x27;relaxing&#x27; me.</li>
            <li>smells good, relaxing specially after a long day of work.</li>
            <li>This oil has a stronger Lavender scent, but it also has hints of sweetness that I didn&#x27;t get from my other oil with is pleasant too.</li>
            <li>good!The Body Shop Divine Calm</li>
            <li>The Body Shop Divine Calm</li>
            <li>I like the size of bottle and its product was worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super green and fresh smelling...perfect for rubbing on my neck and shoulders right before bed.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is a decent size, i guess.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hard to get out at all</li>
            <li>Can be a little strong though.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll have a hard time staying awake after a nice back rub with this oil.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the perfect consistency, not too thin or too thick.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried other massage oils, but this one has just the right consistency.</li>
            <li>Lastly, the oil is not heavy (comparable to Johnsons baby oil) on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It has a slightly sharper smell than the other brand, which is really what I&#x27;m looking for when I need to calm down.  </li>

            <li> If you buy an unscented lotion (I use Aveeno), you can squeeze a few drops of this into the bottle and have the same relaxing smell in your lotion!</li>

            <li> that was super thin and surprisingly hard to get out of the bottle.</li>

            <li> Love the smell! Super relaxing and makes your skin feel amazing</li>
            <li> Great for all applications. Not too greasy at all. Nice smell.</li>
            <li> I love to give massages to my wife and I needed something really good and my wife loved the sent. And looks forward to it every day</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing. I use to have this Lavender oil that my mom got forever ago that was super thin and surprisingly hard to get out of the bottle. I had to shake it just to get the stuff out. I put oils in my bath for relaxation as well as massage. This product is amazing. It&#x27;s not hard to get out at all and it&#x27;s the perfect consistency, not too thin or too thick. Perfect. I saw some reviews about the Lavender scent having a bite to it, which honestly isn&#x27;t that true. It&#x27;s there, but it&#x27;s sweeter. You should have smelled my oil before, now that had a real bite to it and that is what I liked about it. This oil has a stronger Lavender scent, but it also has hints of sweetness that I didn&#x27;t get from my other oil with is pleasant too.</li>
            <li> oil is great for massage, I got something that would smell and feel relaxing and my wife loves it alot!</li>
            <li> I like the size of bottle and its product was worth the cost. Not overly strong smell, feels good when work out the knots on the back of my neck.</li>
            <li> it smells good!The Body Shop Divine Calm Relaxing Massage Oil, 3.3-Fluid Ounce is nice...........5 star! good for couples The Body Shop Divine Calm Relaxing Massage Oil, 3.3-Fluid Ounce</li>
            <li> Not duly arrived, so, choose to return a refund. However, it is understood that brand goods are good, it is worth to be recommended. But any goods differ from man to man, I hope you choose according to their own situation to make the arrangements. Want to give advice to help you.</li>
            <li> cant be found in stores  she loved it</li>
            <li> This product is way better than its Bath and Body works counterpart.  You have to slightly squeeze the bottle in order to get the oil which is perfect because it protects from accidental spills.  The 5 stars are not for the container but the smell and feel. It has a slightly sharper smell than the other brand, which is really what I&#x27;m looking for when I need to calm down.  Lastly, the oil is not heavy (comparable to Johnsons baby oil) on my skin.  I have to massage my arms twice a day because of tendonitis and this oil is a great multi-tasker:  great for the massage and de-stressing.</li>
            <li> Some lavenders smell like my grandma&#x27;s closet.  Not this one!  It&#x27;s super green and fresh smelling...perfect for rubbing on my neck and shoulders right before bed.  In fact, I found a Body Shop lavender lotion in an airport about 15 years ago and had been looking for something that smelled as good.  They had discontinued that fragrance, but this is identical.  If you buy an unscented lotion (I use Aveeno), you can squeeze a few drops of this into the bottle and have the same relaxing smell in your lotion!</li>
            <li> Divine scent.  My wife loves the aroma.  A little goes a long way.  Excellent product.  Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> smells good, relaxing specially after a long day of work.</li>
            <li> The best oil to put you to sleep at night. Great for the face too!! Just rub into temples at night.</li>
            <li> The lavender aroma is so nice and relaxing you&#x27;ll have a hard time staying awake after a nice back rub with this oil. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This oil is super comfortable and soothing.  My wife and I love using it and it almost puts you to sleep.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment.  I use this oil on my scalp after washing my hair.  Thank you</li>
            <li> This particular oil has a very strong lavender cast to its smell, and really seemed to push me out of the mood of using it more than &#x27;calming&#x27; or &#x27;relaxing&#x27; me. If that particularly strong lavender scent is what you are after, then give this a shot.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using this for years. We&#x27;ve tried other massage oils, but this one has just the right consistency. Other oils are either too sticky, and leave a residue, or dry out mid-way into the massage. This one works the best, in our opinion, and after the massage, it just seems to absorb naturally into the skin. It does have a very strong lavander scent, however, so if you&#x27;re not keen on lavander, this may not be for you.</li>
            <li> Great right before bed after a loooong day at work.</li>
            <li> Very soothing. I checked out the reviews before and liked what was said. It does have a calming aroma and helps muscle relax.</li>
            <li> Smells quite pleasant. Can be a little strong though. The bottle is a decent size, i guess. Works wonders on sore muscles.</li>
