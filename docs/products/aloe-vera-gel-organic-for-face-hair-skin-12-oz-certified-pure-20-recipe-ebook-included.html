            <li>the seller provided! :)</li>
            <li>I just love their products.</li>
            <li>It was interesting and</li>
            <li>I love that that product is grown and produced in the USA.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, for what it is, but pricey.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll order it again, but for those who love it, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s worthwhile.</li>
            <li>This is the best especially after a day in the pool.</li>
            <li>This aloe vera gel feels excellent in your skin, especially after a day out in the sun.  </li>
            <li>I love the texture of this gel.  </li>
            <li>and the product came with spray top or squeeze top.</li>
            <li>There are so many uses and recipes that I didn’t know exist</li>
            <li>Overall, I am thoroughly impressed about this product and cannot wait to use it for more things!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say thank you enough for the offer since this was what she was needing to make her extremely happy!!</li>
            <li>I love Aloe Vera anything because of the healing affects.</li>
            <li>It comes with both a pump and a flip top for easy use.  </li>
            <li>As of today, August 30, 2015; I&#x27;m proud to say, that my scalp is clear!  </li>
            <li>Aloe vera has to be one of my most favorite natural ingredients to use besides mint, I grew up around both and living on my own and having my own family</li>
            <li>So far I have been happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Great for after sun, natural eyebrow gel and eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>I got this free to try and I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and it really felt good and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s organic and made from a real aloe vera plant and feels so good on your skin.</li>
            <li>am taking this with me this summer on vacation, the bottle is easy to store, and does not get sticky from leaks like competitors.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to set up and easy to pour out.</li>
            <li>so aloe is a really good friend when you have any kind of sunburn, rashes, dry skin or itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now I can easily screw on the original lid to insure nothing</li>
            <li>It absorbs rapidly, leaving your skin smooth and silky, and has no oily or sticky residue.&lt;br /&gt;Aloe</li>
            <li>Aloe Vera Gel goes on smooth and dries leaving my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to try some of the recipes in the free e-book</li>
            <li>did receive this product for free but the experience and opinions expressed in this post</li>
            <li>Works great for my essential oil recipes!</li>
            <li>The additives in this gel are ingredients I feel comfortable using.</li>
            <li>This gel is great - have used it for numerous products I make.  </li>
            <li>Great for hair and skin, especially in the summer.</li>
            <li>Vera Gel is light and has cooling effect.</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>first an immediately noticed that my skin felt so much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>This aloe vera gel seems fresh, like it just came from the plant!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for your skin when you have been in the sun too long.  </li>
            <li>Really excited to get creating with this gel.</li>
            <li>Clean ingredients.</li>
            <li>I use this on burns mostly because it is one of the only effective ways I know of relieving burn pain.</li>
            <li>This came in good shape and as usual very pleased with LaLune product.</li>
            <li>This aloe from La Lune is pretty good overall and love that it has a pump included.</li>
            <li>Nice clear gel.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and not too sticky at all.</li>
            <li>last and most favorite thing about that they give you options for how you can use or dispense the product.</li>
            <li>Non greasy and soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li>It is the real deal!!</li>
            <li>aloe smells fresh, the company has out done themselves by sending 3 options for lids with the bottle.</li>
            <li>- just 0.25% preservatives to keep it fresh.  </li>
            <li>I like this product, cool crisp scent.</li>
            <li>are my own unbiased opinion and my only compensation was this product.</li>
            <li>La Lune Naturals make me smile.</li>
            <li>Top Quality natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I took the offer more for my 88 year old mother who used to work in a health food store and used aloe vera for years.  </li>
            <li>That’s right</li>
            <li>Very very soothing and easily absorbed</li>
            <li>Glides on easily and isn&#x27;t very sticky but it really smells of the ascorbic acid that is used.</li>
            <li>So, if you are looking for real, organic Aloe Vera, this is exactly what you need!</li>
            <li>Very soothing on sunburns!</li>
            <li>This is my first purchase of organic aloe vera gel.</li>
            <li>and I definitely will be ordering more of this gel</li>
            <li>There are many different things you can do with aloe gel you can google them if you are interested.</li>
            <li>The real test will happen this winter after some time in Ohio!</li>
            <li>This Aloe Vera Gel is a watery consistent, and non drying.</li>
            <li>Came with a regular lid, a pump, and a pop top lid.</li>
            <li>This aloe Vera gel is very convenient and not sticky!</li>
            <li>This gel is better than another brand I bought recently.</li>
            <li>definitely recommend this brand, as I have used and loved several of their products</li>
            <li>(The .25% of other ingredients, in this 99.75% Organic product, may not seem like anything to get excited about, but they are important if you have allergy problems.)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Having a smooth, clean &amp; unblemished complexion is big time confidence booster for me.</li>
            <li>I’ve always used the aloe that you purchase directly from the drug store to soothe our skin, however I’ve found that it leaves us tacky and barely soothed for more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel really good especially after I have been in the sun too long.</li>
            <li>I like that it is 99.75% pure Organic Aloe Vera</li>
            <li>I would recommend  this product to anyone that like an almost pure aloe vera gel as the one you make at home.</li>
            <li>Instead it absorbed quickly and left my skin feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li>I have used it straight out of the bottle and also I&#x27;ve mixed it in with homemade body butters to make them slightly less oily and it works great.  </li>
            <li>This is the real deal - pure aloe gel.</li>
            <li>Vera is a huge skin and haircare staple, especially with me going to school in California.</li>
            <li>This Aloe Vera is wonderful many uses especially in California after a bad sunburn.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using the pump because it helps when I am trying to use specific portions on my hair or skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it dries fast.</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>I tried some on irritated skin and the Aloe Vera Gel helped very much.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I really appreciated this</li>
            <li>Included recipes are really appreciated.</li>
            <li>I recently got to try this Aloe Vera Gel for free through Tomoson as part of a product trial.</li>
            <li>have used it to help combat an itchy scalp and in salve recipes and it performed very well in both applications.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>That said, the bottled LaLune Aloe Vera Gel is a much thinner consistency than what comes from the leaf of the plant.</li>
            <li>This product also came with a very helpful ebook.  </li>
            <li>So I ordered this Aloe Vera gel before going to Hawaii, because I knew that no matter how much sunscreen I put on, I would still burn.</li>
            <li>The whole family used it for treating sunburnt skin and relieving bug bites.</li>
            <li>It is moisturizing and really comforts parched and irritated skin.</li>
            <li>when I gave her the product she is very cautious with ingredients found on the shelves of pharmacies and supermarkets.</li>
            <li>It is always nice especially if I need some aloe on my back and don&#x27;t want my clothes sticking to my skin.</li>
            <li>When I got home my husband put this aloe gel on my red skin and not only did it feel nice, but it&#x27;s been a week</li>
            <li>I do own a plant that I occasionally tear apart to use, but you have to give it time to regrow and so having this gel on hand is the next closest thing.</li>
            <li>Usually found in smaller bottles, this comes in a large size and pump bottle which is great.</li>
            <li>I used other La Lune products and love them.  </li>
            <li>Those other brands felt more like a gel consistency.</li>
            <li>This aloe works better on my skin than any other aloe product I have used.  </li>
            <li>my husband and i use it to prevent razor bumps, it works better than other store bought brands.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s full potential yet, but I have used it on my sunburn and it worked miracles on my skin.</li>
            <li>It instantly feels cool and soothing on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like being able to choose how I want to use it as aloe vera is something that I sometimes use just a little on my skin or other times more in homemade skin care products.</li>
            <li>I like being able to choose how I want to use it as aloe vera is something that I sometimes use just a little on my skin or other times more in homemade skin care products.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li>I love that it contains nearly 100% organic aloe (0.25% other for preservatives).</li>
            <li>When I woke up, the cut had completely vanished!!</li>
            <li>and I also am pleased that the bottle is a dark color which ensures the product to stay fresher as opposed to a clear bottle.&lt;br /&gt;That</li>
            <li>I live in Ohio 7 or so months of the year and SC the remaining months.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, and psoriasis on my legs, and even aloe vera gel sometimes irritates it, but not this brand!</li>
            <li>The second thing I noticed is that this product doesn’t leave me overly sticky compared to so many of the other products on the market.</li>
            <li>I use it to make homemade hand sanitizer &amp; it leaves my hands soft!</li>
            <li>It is not very thick nor watery.</li>
            <li>I have super pale skin, and I always burn a ton when I am in the sun for more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Only after one use, my skin was hydrated and very soft!!</li>
            <li>In my natural hair regimen, I also use aloe vera gel as a pre-poo to combat dandruff and keep my hair moisturized before shampooing.</li>
            <li>I also use it on mosquito bites that whelp up and sting on my sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Personally I would much rather have thicker gel on my sunburn.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin both to skin care products and the sun</li>
            <li>This Aloe Vera gel keeps my hair strands soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I use natural products for skin moisturizing.</li>
            <li>When I went to the Bahamas a few years ago I used a more commercial aloe vera and my burns did not heal nearly as quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I go south and after a week my skin is completely cleared up, soft, no ugly red dry patches.</li>
            <li>, this bottle is large enough that it will last you through the summer.</li>
            <li>She said her skin is making her feel baby soft and has made a big improvement on her callused feet.</li>

            <li> It was interesting and</li>
            <li> I love that that product is grown and produced in the USA.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, for what it is, but pricey.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll order it again, but for those who love it, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s worthwhile.</li>

            <li> Overall, I am thoroughly impressed about this product and cannot wait to use it for more things!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say thank you enough for the offer since this was what she was needing to make her extremely happy!!</li>
            <li> I love Aloe Vera anything because of the healing affects.</li>
            <li> It comes with both a pump and a flip top for easy use.  </li>
            <li> As of today, August 30, 2015; I&#x27;m proud to say, that my scalp is clear!  </li>
            <li> Aloe vera has to be one of my most favorite natural ingredients to use besides mint, I grew up around both and living on my own and having my own family</li>
            <li> So far I have been happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great for after sun, natural eyebrow gel and eye makeup remover.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s organic and made from a real aloe vera plant and feels so good on your skin.</li>
            <li> am taking this with me this summer on vacation, the bottle is easy to store, and does not get sticky from leaks like competitors.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to set up and easy to pour out.</li>
            <li> so aloe is a really good friend when you have any kind of sunburn, rashes, dry skin or itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now I can easily screw on the original lid to insure nothing</li>
            <li> It absorbs rapidly, leaving your skin smooth and silky, and has no oily or sticky residue.&lt;br /&gt;Aloe</li>
            <li> Aloe Vera Gel goes on smooth and dries leaving my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try some of the recipes in the free e-book</li>
            <li> did receive this product for free but the experience and opinions expressed in this post</li>
            <li> Works great for my essential oil recipes!</li>
            <li> The additives in this gel are ingredients I feel comfortable using.</li>
            <li> This gel is great - have used it for numerous products I make.  </li>
            <li> Great for hair and skin, especially in the summer.</li>
            <li> Vera Gel is light and has cooling effect.</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> first an immediately noticed that my skin felt so much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> This aloe vera gel seems fresh, like it just came from the plant!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for your skin when you have been in the sun too long.  </li>
            <li> Really excited to get creating with this gel.</li>
            <li> Clean ingredients.</li>
            <li> I use this on burns mostly because it is one of the only effective ways I know of relieving burn pain.</li>
            <li> This came in good shape and as usual very pleased with LaLune product.</li>
            <li> This aloe from La Lune is pretty good overall and love that it has a pump included.</li>
            <li> Nice clear gel.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and not too sticky at all.</li>
            <li> last and most favorite thing about that they give you options for how you can use or dispense the product.</li>
            <li> Non greasy and soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li> It is the real deal!!</li>
            <li> aloe smells fresh, the company has out done themselves by sending 3 options for lids with the bottle.</li>
            <li> - just 0.25% preservatives to keep it fresh.  </li>
            <li> I like this product, cool crisp scent.</li>
            <li> are my own unbiased opinion and my only compensation was this product.</li>
            <li> La Lune Naturals make me smile.</li>
            <li> Top Quality natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I took the offer more for my 88 year old mother who used to work in a health food store and used aloe vera for years.  </li>
            <li> That’s right</li>
            <li> Very very soothing and easily absorbed</li>
            <li> Glides on easily and isn&#x27;t very sticky but it really smells of the ascorbic acid that is used.</li>
            <li> So, if you are looking for real, organic Aloe Vera, this is exactly what you need!</li>
            <li> Very soothing on sunburns!</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of organic aloe vera gel.</li>
            <li> and I definitely will be ordering more of this gel</li>
            <li> There are many different things you can do with aloe gel you can google them if you are interested.</li>
            <li> The real test will happen this winter after some time in Ohio!</li>
            <li> This Aloe Vera Gel is a watery consistent, and non drying.</li>
            <li> Came with a regular lid, a pump, and a pop top lid.</li>
            <li> This aloe Vera gel is very convenient and not sticky!</li>
            <li> This gel is better than another brand I bought recently.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this brand, as I have used and loved several of their products</li>
            <li> (The .25% of other ingredients, in this 99.75% Organic product, may not seem like anything to get excited about, but they are important if you have allergy problems.)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Having a smooth, clean &amp; unblemished complexion is big time confidence booster for me.</li>
            <li> I’ve always used the aloe that you purchase directly from the drug store to soothe our skin, however I’ve found that it leaves us tacky and barely soothed for more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel really good especially after I have been in the sun too long.</li>
            <li> I like that it is 99.75% pure Organic Aloe Vera</li>
            <li> I would recommend  this product to anyone that like an almost pure aloe vera gel as the one you make at home.</li>
            <li> Instead it absorbed quickly and left my skin feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have used it straight out of the bottle and also I&#x27;ve mixed it in with homemade body butters to make them slightly less oily and it works great.  </li>
            <li> This is the real deal - pure aloe gel.</li>
            <li> Vera is a huge skin and haircare staple, especially with me going to school in California.</li>
            <li> This Aloe Vera is wonderful many uses especially in California after a bad sunburn.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using the pump because it helps when I am trying to use specific portions on my hair or skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it dries fast.</li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> I tried some on irritated skin and the Aloe Vera Gel helped very much.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I really appreciated this</li>
            <li> Included recipes are really appreciated.</li>
            <li> I recently got to try this Aloe Vera Gel for free through Tomoson as part of a product trial.</li>
            <li> have used it to help combat an itchy scalp and in salve recipes and it performed very well in both applications.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> That said, the bottled LaLune Aloe Vera Gel is a much thinner consistency than what comes from the leaf of the plant.</li>
            <li> This product also came with a very helpful ebook.  </li>
            <li> So I ordered this Aloe Vera gel before going to Hawaii, because I knew that no matter how much sunscreen I put on, I would still burn.</li>
            <li> The whole family used it for treating sunburnt skin and relieving bug bites.</li>
            <li> It is moisturizing and really comforts parched and irritated skin.</li>
            <li> when I gave her the product she is very cautious with ingredients found on the shelves of pharmacies and supermarkets.</li>
            <li> It is always nice especially if I need some aloe on my back and don&#x27;t want my clothes sticking to my skin.</li>
            <li> When I got home my husband put this aloe gel on my red skin and not only did it feel nice, but it&#x27;s been a week</li>
            <li> I do own a plant that I occasionally tear apart to use, but you have to give it time to regrow and so having this gel on hand is the next closest thing.</li>
            <li> Usually found in smaller bottles, this comes in a large size and pump bottle which is great.</li>
            <li> I used other La Lune products and love them.  </li>
            <li> Those other brands felt more like a gel consistency.</li>
            <li> This aloe works better on my skin than any other aloe product I have used.  </li>
            <li> my husband and i use it to prevent razor bumps, it works better than other store bought brands.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s full potential yet, but I have used it on my sunburn and it worked miracles on my skin.</li>
            <li> It instantly feels cool and soothing on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like being able to choose how I want to use it as aloe vera is something that I sometimes use just a little on my skin or other times more in homemade skin care products.</li>
            <li> I like being able to choose how I want to use it as aloe vera is something that I sometimes use just a little on my skin or other times more in homemade skin care products.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I love that it contains nearly 100% organic aloe (0.25% other for preservatives).</li>
            <li> When I woke up, the cut had completely vanished!!</li>
            <li> and I also am pleased that the bottle is a dark color which ensures the product to stay fresher as opposed to a clear bottle.&lt;br /&gt;That</li>
            <li> I live in Ohio 7 or so months of the year and SC the remaining months.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, and psoriasis on my legs, and even aloe vera gel sometimes irritates it, but not this brand!</li>
            <li> The second thing I noticed is that this product doesn’t leave me overly sticky compared to so many of the other products on the market.</li>
            <li> I use it to make homemade hand sanitizer &amp; it leaves my hands soft!</li>
            <li> It is not very thick nor watery.</li>
            <li> I have super pale skin, and I always burn a ton when I am in the sun for more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Only after one use, my skin was hydrated and very soft!!</li>
            <li> In my natural hair regimen, I also use aloe vera gel as a pre-poo to combat dandruff and keep my hair moisturized before shampooing.</li>
            <li> I also use it on mosquito bites that whelp up and sting on my sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Personally I would much rather have thicker gel on my sunburn.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin both to skin care products and the sun</li>
            <li> This Aloe Vera gel keeps my hair strands soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I use natural products for skin moisturizing.</li>
            <li> When I went to the Bahamas a few years ago I used a more commercial aloe vera and my burns did not heal nearly as quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I go south and after a week my skin is completely cleared up, soft, no ugly red dry patches.</li>
            <li> , this bottle is large enough that it will last you through the summer.</li>
            <li> She said her skin is making her feel baby soft and has made a big improvement on her callused feet.</li>
            <li> Often you buy the commercial aloe vera gels at the store and when you read the ingredients they are full alcohol and unnecessary chemicals to color or preserve the aloe vera.</li>
            <li> All signs of red, dry, patchy rash gone.</li>
            <li> It is a thin gel that is not sticky and absorbs into the skin rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never actually tried organic aloe and it&#x27;s so much better than the fake green gel.</li>
            <li> used it on myself as well as my husband and kids after a long day at the beach, and use it on myself for my eczema.</li>
            <li> I received the promotional offer for this product as long as I gave a review on the product.  </li>
            <li> Unlike most aloe vera gel we have use in the past this one didn’t leave a sticky residue behind.</li>
            <li> and my skin has turned tan and no sign of peeling or dry itchiness that comes with sunburned skin.</li>
            <li> The bottle comes with a standard lid to open and pour a lot, a flip open cap to pour less or a pump to squirt out just a little.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased and amazed that the face staring back at me from the mirror wasn&#x27;t the usual red, flaky, disturbing mess I usually saw after a couple months in an Ohio winter.</li>
            <li> I normally do not see this information on aloe Vera</li>
            <li> It is not as thick and goopy as the commercial brands, but thinner like the natural gel should be with less chemical additives to thicken it up.</li>
            <li> The consistency is much thinner, but not as thin as aloe juice.</li>
            <li> husband was cutting some of our aloe plant up the other day to get the flesh for a refreshing green drink.</li>
            <li> A little Aloe Vera Gel, goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other items from La Lune Naturals</li>
            <li> I have tried other aloe products before</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t give me a sticky feeling like the other gels leave.</li>
            <li> Worked wonders on a spot of chronic eczema only after a few days of use!</li>
            <li> I got this gel, as well as an ebook with recipes and other uses and tips.</li>
            <li> This past January I&#x27;d gone to Charleston and had to meet with potential contractors for a project.</li>
            <li> but I know there&#x27;s 1 or 2 other ingredients besides just aloe gel in the product....</li>
            <li> I look forward to purchasing there other products as well.  </li>
            <li> I like that this product is organic and has very minimal ingredients.</li>
            <li> I got some really bad sunburns but they healed very quickly after using this on them.</li>
            <li> Dark bottle protects gel.</li>
            <li> Just a little fyi.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes I put a dab of organic coconut oil over the aloe.</li>
            <li> husband complained that it didn&#x27;t look green like the other aloe vera we had until I showed him that the other one was only green because it had artificial color in it.</li>
            <li> I applied a small amount on my foot before bed.</li>
            <li> Usually I peel even if I turn tan after a burn I still end up peeling.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding one that didn&#x27;t have additives I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I hated using the commercial aloe veras on my last sunburn</li>
            <li> so I took an Aloe leaf from the freezer, opened it and spread the thick gel over my skin.</li>
            <li> I have seen Aloe Vera gels at health food stores and other places that had ingredients that made me uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> She suffers from extremely dry skin because of her diabetes</li>
            <li> That morning I used the plain aloe gel and a tiny bit of coconut oil as a makeup base.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a thin consistency and spreads well.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t your thick, green, discount store type of aloe, so if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re hoping for, you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is a little expensive but it is organic and doen&#x27;t have any bad ingredients for your skin.  </li>
            <li> La Lune seemed very thin than what I am used to.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the water or the(out doors)winter cold and heated inside environment or what, but my facial complexion is horrible in Ohio in Winter.</li>
            <li> all the work of cutting up the plant.</li>
            <li> I used to use Aloe Vera by cutting the plant and collecting the juice.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry buying this!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know if those additives would irritate my skin or make me sick if I got some in my mouth; I don&#x27;t feel that way about this product.</li>
            <li> I hated trying to pack pump bottles, they tend to leak everywhere while packed in the car.</li>
            <li> Also with spending the summer in the south, it has come to my relief for those dreadful bug bites!</li>

            <li> Aloe Vera is known to be excellent on skin, a natural and very safe moisturizer, and a skin softener. It absorbs rapidly, leaving your skin smooth and silky, and has no oily or sticky residue.&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Vera is a huge skin and haircare staple, especially with me going to school in California. After showering, I like to apply aloe vera gel to my skin to seal in moisture, then I apply sunscreen and then I am set for the day! In my natural hair regimen, I also use aloe vera gel as a pre-poo to combat dandruff and keep my hair moisturized before shampooing. Also with spending the summer in the south, it has come to my relief for those dreadful bug bites! This aloe vera gel seems fresh, like it just came from the plant! I enjoy using the pump because it helps when I am trying to use specific portions on my hair or skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided to me at no cost. All thoughts are unbiased and of my own opinion.</li>
            <li> I always try to keep aloe around the house as I use it quite often. I also use it on mosquito bites that whelp up and sting on my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aloe smells fresh, the company has out done themselves by sending 3 options for lids with the bottle. I hated trying to pack pump bottles, they tend to leak everywhere while packed in the car. Now I can easily screw on the original lid to insure nothing will leak out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep my aloe in the fridge so that is has a cooling effect, this bottle is large enough that it will last you through the summer. I like that La Lune Naturals has an information panel about the ingredients. I normally do not see this information on aloe Vera bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am taking this with me this summer on vacation, the bottle is easy to store, and does not get sticky from leaks like competitors. I was glad to receive and try this product, in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I love this aloe vera gel!  I have used it straight out of the bottle and also I&#x27;ve mixed it in with homemade body butters to make them slightly less oily and it works great.  I like that it is 99.75% pure Organic Aloe Vera - just 0.25% preservatives to keep it fresh.  I also like that this came with a pump AND a squirt top (in addition to a regular twist off top).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a quality product and a quality brand.  I&#x27;ve purchased other items from La Lune Naturals and I&#x27;ve been impressed and very pleased with all of them.  I would definitely recommend this product. It&#x27;s a great quality and it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;____________________&lt;br /&gt;Sold by: LaLuneNaturals&lt;br /&gt;Shipped by: Amazon LLC&lt;br /&gt;Delivered: 3 days after order date</li>
            <li> Love this!  Even better than FCO!</li>
            <li> This is wonderful and I like that it&#x27;s not thick and it dries fast. It&#x27;s great for your skin when you have been in the sun too long.  I used other La Lune products and love them.  Great job.</li>
            <li> Great Aloe, I use it on my skin, feels wonderful!</li>
            <li> Very soothing on sunburns! It absorbs quickly and not too sticky at all.</li>
            <li> So, I was selected to receive Lalune Naturals Aloe Vera for free in exchange for an honest review. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!! This product is AMAZING! Only after one use, my skin was hydrated and very soft!! I am pretty sure it healed a cut I had in my foot over night!! I applied a small amount on my foot before bed. When I woke up, the cut had completely vanished!! This is some good stuff! There is no water, color, aloin, fragrance, alcohol, or oil added!! I will also be taking this on vacation with me for after sun care. So, if you are looking for real, organic Aloe Vera, this is exactly what you need! It is the real deal!!</li>
            <li> Aloe Vera Gel is one of those products that should be kept in everyone’s house at all times. In my family we use it for everything from mosquito bites to sunburns. Unlike most aloe vera gel we have use in the past this one didn’t leave a sticky residue behind. Instead it absorbed quickly and left my skin feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I&#x27;ve never actually tried organic aloe and it&#x27;s so much better than the fake green gel. After I put it on my skin felt cooled and there is zero stickiness after applying.</li>
            <li> I decided to review this product I got for free for my own honest opinion.  I have tried other aloe products before so I wanted to see if La Lune aloe was any different. There was a difference I noticed. The fruit of the earth and banana boat aloe was thicker than La Lune. Those other brands felt more like a gel consistency. La Lune seemed very thin than what I am used to.  It almost had a water consistency. Personally I would much rather have thicker gel on my sunburn. I do like how my skin felt after putting it on. It didn&#x27;t give me a sticky feeling like the other gels leave. It is always nice especially if I need some aloe on my back and don&#x27;t want my clothes sticking to my skin. This aloe from La Lune is pretty good overall and love that it has a pump included.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I have not used it to it&#x27;s full potential yet, but I have used it on my sunburn and it worked miracles on my skin. Usually I peel even if I turn tan after a burn I still end up peeling. But this product had arrived just days before an outdoor event I went to and got sunburn because I forgot to apply sunscreen to myself after I took care of my kids. When I got home my husband put this aloe gel on my red skin and not only did it feel nice, but it&#x27;s been a week and my skin has turned tan and no sign of peeling or dry itchiness that comes with sunburned skin. This product also came with an ebook with more suggestions and recipes on what you can do with aloe gel and I plan to use some of the hair conditioning recipes on my own hair and scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I received this Aloe Vera Gel for free to try and review; regardless this is my 100% honest opinion. I like that this product is organic and has very minimal ingredients. Often you buy the commercial aloe vera gels at the store and when you read the ingredients they are full alcohol and unnecessary chemicals to color or preserve the aloe vera. I do own a plant that I occasionally tear apart to use, but you have to give it time to regrow and so having this gel on hand is the next closest thing. Aloe vera has to be one of my most favorite natural ingredients to use besides mint, I grew up around both and living on my own and having my own family I have tried to always have both around. I have sensitive skin both to skin care products and the sun so aloe is a really good friend when you have any kind of sunburn, rashes, dry skin or itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband was cutting some of our aloe plant up the other day to get the flesh for a refreshing green drink. Before he disposed of the skin I rubbed the inside all over both mine and the kids skin so I can confirm that this aloe vera gel smells just like the natural aloe and feels very similar as well, minus all the work of cutting up the plant. It is not as thick and goopy as the commercial brands, but thinner like the natural gel should be with less chemical additives to thicken it up. After seeing this comparison I believe the claims of the smaller ingredient list. This is definitely a product I would purchase once this bottle runs out. I hated using the commercial aloe veras on my last sunburn you could feel the alcohol in them make my skin burn even more. Not kewl when you are already burned and in pain. Aloe vera gel should be soothing and cooling, not add to the pain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last and most favorite thing about that they give you options for how you can use or dispense the product. The bottle comes with a standard lid to open and pour a lot, a flip open cap to pour less or a pump to squirt out just a little. I like being able to choose how I want to use it as aloe vera is something that I sometimes use just a little on my skin or other times more in homemade skin care products.I like being able to choose how I want to use it as aloe vera is something that I sometimes use just a little on my skin or other times more in homemade skin care products.</li>
            <li> I really love the aloe vera gel. This is one of the best face moisturizers you will find. I use it every night and every morning.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal - pure aloe gel. I have an aloe plant and when I compared the 2 gels they looked, felt and smelled the same. Dark bottle protects gel. Comes with pump as well as a flip top cap. Quality product, quality packaging. The e book included with their products have some good formulas for masks, exfoliants, etc.</li>
            <li> Very smooth consistency. Nice clear gel. Clean ingredients.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!&lt;br /&gt;The Aloe Vera Gel goes on smooth and dries leaving my skin hydrated. It has no smell. I tried some on irritated skin and the Aloe Vera Gel helped very much.&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived packaged nicely, with both a flip-top cap and a pump dispenser. I really appreciated this and I also am pleased that the bottle is a dark color which ensures the product to stay fresher as opposed to a clear bottle.&lt;br /&gt;That this Aloe Vera Gel is organic and produced in the USA is also a plus.&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Vera is good for the skin--this one is a quality product and I am happy to recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of organic aloe vera gel. It is a lot thinner than the sunburn care varieties I have bought before in Walmart and Target. It is a thin gel that is not sticky and absorbs into the skin rather quickly. I used it after I shaved my legs and it really felt good and moisturizing. I have used it on my hands as well and like the non sticky feel. It does seem to sooth my eczema patches on my hands and legs too. So far I have been happy with this purchase. Glad the hand pump was included.</li>
            <li> This is great, not sticky but smooth and absorbs into my skin quickly. Great for after sun, natural eyebrow gel and eye makeup remover.  The ideas in the Ebook look great too,</li>
            <li> Glides on easily and isn&#x27;t very sticky but it really smells of the ascorbic acid that is used. It worked well in one of the LaLune face mask recipes.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product that has many uses. La Lune Naturals is my go-to online store for aloe vera.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this Aloe Vera Gel. Included recipes are really appreciated. Thank you for including the 2 options for dispensing. That goes above &amp; beyond.</li>
            <li> Really excited to get creating with this gel. I love that it contains nearly 100% organic aloe (0.25% other for preservatives). This isn&#x27;t your thick, green, discount store type of aloe, so if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re hoping for, you&#x27;ll be disappointed. The consistency is much thinner, but not as thin as aloe juice. I&#x27;ll be using it in my homemade shaving gel, body lotion and even mascara. Love that it&#x27;s made in the USA too!</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell.  Worked wonders on a spot of chronic eczema only after a few days of use! Can&#x27;t wait to try some of the recipes in the free e-book the seller provided! :)</li>
            <li> La Lune never disappoints.  I literally have every product they sell. This Aloe Vera is wonderful many uses especially in California after a bad sunburn. Great for moisturizing. I just love their products.</li>
            <li> I like this product, cool crisp scent. I like all the products I have gotten from this company</li>
            <li> I recently got to try this Aloe Vera Gel for free through Tomoson as part of a product trial. I got this gel, as well as an ebook with recipes and other uses and tips. It was interesting and informative.&lt;br /&gt;I loved this gel and have already used it alot. It&#x27;s organic and made from a real aloe vera plant and feels so good on your skin. It came with a hand pump as well as a lid that has a pop up spout so you can use whichever you prefer.  It is so easy to set up and easy to pour out. It&#x27;s got a thin consistency and spreads well. I don&#x27;t need a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I used it on myself as well as my husband and kids after a long day at the beach, and use it on myself for my eczema. It instantly feels cool and soothing on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this brand, as I have used and loved several of their products and I definitely will be ordering more of this gel soon!&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product for free but the experience and opinions expressed in this post are my own unbiased opinion and my only compensation was this product.</li>
            <li> I got this free to try and I absolutely love this stuff. It makes my face feel really good especially after I have been in the sun too long. I use this on burns mostly because it is one of the only effective ways I know of relieving burn pain. I love that that product is grown and produced in the USA. There are many different things you can do with aloe gel you can google them if you are interested.</li>
            <li> The quaility of the Aloe Vera gel is very good. I used it to add to some lotion I made.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Especially love that it is certified organic This aloe works better on my skin than any other aloe product I have used.  I like how La Lune Naturals includes both a flip spout cap and a dispensing pump.  I also like that the company includes an electronic ebook with recipes and uses for the gel.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and not too sticky.  Works great for my essential oil recipes!</li>
            <li> Really great product! I am very happy with the Aloe Vera Gel which is actually real Aloe Vera! Great brand! Keep on doing what you doing!</li>
            <li> I would have liked the Aloe Vera get that I ordered but I received Coconut Oil instead, which I didn&#x27;t need.  Judith</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this Aloe Vera Gel! I had a hard time finding one that didn&#x27;t have additives I didn&#x27;t like. The additives in this gel are ingredients I feel comfortable using. I have seen Aloe Vera gels at health food stores and other places that had ingredients that made me uncomfortable. I didn&#x27;t know if those additives would irritate my skin or make me sick if I got some in my mouth; I don&#x27;t feel that way about this product. (The .25% of other ingredients, in this 99.75% Organic product, may not seem like anything to get excited about, but they are important if you have allergy problems.)&lt;br /&gt;I have used it to help combat an itchy scalp and in salve recipes and it performed very well in both applications.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, for what it is, but pricey. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll order it again, but for those who love it, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s worthwhile.</li>
            <li> This gel is great - have used it for numerous products I make.  It is smooth and feels very nice.  It comes with both a pump and a flip top for easy use.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great buy on this product. Usually found in smaller bottles, this comes in a large size and pump bottle which is great. I use aloe vera gel for a lot of DIY products with essential oils--after sun gel, sunscreen, etc.  This came in good shape and as usual very pleased with LaLune product.</li>
            <li> La Lune Naturals make me smile. Top Quality natural ingredients. This aloe gel is soothing and very pleasant, The recipes provided are simply wonderful. Great for hair and skin, especially in the summer. I will be trying all the recipes soon.</li>
            <li> This is the best especially after a day in the pool.</li>
            <li> I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE</li>
            <li> Great product - love that the pump was included!! Quick delivery also!! Will order again for sure!</li>
            <li> I live in Ohio 7 or so months of the year and SC the remaining months. Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the water or the(out doors)winter cold and heated inside environment or what, but my facial complexion is horrible in Ohio in Winter. I go south and after a week my skin is completely cleared up, soft, no ugly red dry patches. This past January I&#x27;d gone to Charleston and had to meet with potential contractors for a project. I only had 3 days to cure my skin issues! Yikes!  Horror! The creams and Dermatologist prescribed potions weren&#x27;t working so I took an Aloe leaf from the freezer, opened it and spread the thick gel over my skin. After a few minutes I put a dab of organic coconut oil over the aloe. Went to bed praying for a miracle. I was very pleased and amazed that the face staring back at me from the mirror wasn&#x27;t the usual red, flaky, disturbing mess I usually saw after a couple months in an Ohio winter. I used nothing besides the aloe &amp; coconut oil &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; till the morning of my meeting. That morning I used the plain aloe gel and a tiny bit of coconut oil as a makeup base. My skin drinks both those things in by the way. Just a little fyi. All I needed was some cover up, mascara &amp; lip gloss! Viola! All signs of red, dry, patchy rash gone. Having a smooth, clean &amp; unblemished complexion is big time confidence booster for me. That said, the bottled LaLune Aloe Vera Gel is a much thinner consistency than what comes from the leaf of the plant. I don&#x27;t have the bottle in front of me but I know there&#x27;s 1 or 2 other ingredients besides just aloe gel in the product....for convenience sake I mixed a batch of gel and coconut oil for my nightly facial. I&#x27;ve also added a vitamin C serum prescribed by the dermatologist. ..so far so good. The real test will happen this winter after some time in Ohio!</li>
            <li> There are several Aloe Vera Gels to choose from.  I purchased this product based on the reviews.  I&#x27;m so glad I did!  This Aloe Vera Gel is a watery consistent, and non drying. I like that this bottle comes with different caps.  This product also came with a very helpful ebook.  I purchased this product in June 2015.  As of today, August 30, 2015; I&#x27;m proud to say, that my scalp is clear!  This Aloe Vera gel keeps my hair strands soft and manageable.  A little Aloe Vera Gel, goes a long way.  This is a great product from a great company!  I look forward to purchasing there other products as well.  Thank you, La Lune Naturals for a great Aloe Vera Gel.</li>
            <li> Came with a regular lid, a pump, and a pop top lid. I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more!</li>
            <li> I use natural products for skin moisturizing. I used to use Aloe Vera by cutting the plant and collecting the juice. Now I do not have to do it any more.&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Vera Gel is light and has cooling effect. It is especially good after shower in a hot summer day. I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> This aloe Vera gel is very convenient and not sticky!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Non greasy and soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li> This aloe vera gel feels excellent in your skin, especially after a day out in the sun.  I love the texture of this gel.  It is not very thick nor watery. It came with two dispensers and the bottle is a good quality plastic. It is a little expensive but it is organic and doen&#x27;t have any bad ingredients for your skin.  I received a discount in the purchase of this product for my review.  I would recommend  this product to anyone that like an almost pure aloe vera gel as the one you make at home.</li>
            <li> I have super pale skin, and I always burn a ton when I am in the sun for more than a few minutes. So I ordered this Aloe Vera gel before going to Hawaii, because I knew that no matter how much sunscreen I put on, I would still burn. I was really impressed with this Aloe Vera. I got some really bad sunburns but they healed very quickly after using this on them. When I went to the Bahamas a few years ago I used a more commercial aloe vera and my burns did not heal nearly as quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband complained that it didn&#x27;t look green like the other aloe vera we had until I showed him that the other one was only green because it had artificial color in it. None of that here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample to review but all opinions are my own!</li>
            <li> my husband and i use it to prevent razor bumps, it works better than other store bought brands. Comes in a gel form. and the product came with spray top or squeeze top. no chemical smell or no smell what so ever.</li>
            <li> I took no chances and ordered and packed this product on a recent trip to Mexico. The whole family used it for treating sunburnt skin and relieving bug bites. I have extremely sensitive skin, and psoriasis on my legs, and even aloe vera gel sometimes irritates it, but not this brand! It is moisturizing and really comforts parched and irritated skin.</li>
            <li> We are a family of gingers. That’s right, I said it, gingers. And what happens when we go into the sun? We burn. No amount of sunblock can save us. After a wicked weekend of hanging out in pools for the holidays we were all feeling crispy and pained. I’ve always used the aloe that you purchase directly from the drug store to soothe our skin, however I’ve found that it leaves us tacky and barely soothed for more than 5 minutes. Today I received this 100% Organic Aloe Vera and I needed to try it ASAP. I applied it to myself first an immediately noticed that my skin felt so much more comfortable. The second thing I noticed is that this product doesn’t leave me overly sticky compared to so many of the other products on the market. The scent isn’t overwhelming either which is a great thing for my daughter whose asthma tends to over react to overpowering smells. The company also sent me a book about the aloe which included the 20 miracle uses for Aloe vera. There are so many uses and recipes that I didn’t know exist, I can’t wait to start using them all! Overall, I am thoroughly impressed about this product and cannot wait to use it for more things!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this item in exchange for my review, however my opinion is my own*</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;m so glad I discovered this company! This gel is better than another brand I bought recently. I use it to make homemade hand sanitizer &amp; it leaves my hands soft! You won&#x27;t be sorry buying this!</li>
            <li> I received the promotional offer for this product as long as I gave a review on the product.  I took the offer more for my 88 year old mother who used to work in a health food store and used aloe vera for years.  She suffers from extremely dry skin because of her diabetes so I thought this might help relieve some of those issues. She was so delighted when she read details listed on your item I printed all that when I gave her the product she is very cautious with ingredients found on the shelves of pharmacies and supermarkets. She had to try it immediately and has been raving about it ever since.  I can&#x27;t say thank you enough for the offer since this was what she was needing to make her extremely happy!! She said her skin is making her feel baby soft and has made a big improvement on her callused feet.</li>
            <li> I love Aloe Vera anything because of the healing affects. I will say La Lune Naturals has excellent quality products.</li>
            <li> Thank you La Lune for making great products!</li>
            <li> Using it to moisturize here in the heat of Barbados. Very very soothing and easily absorbed</li>
