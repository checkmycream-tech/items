            <li>In closing: LOVE IT.</li>

            <li>I was also able to get some color</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safe for the skin without all the chemicals, and toxic stuff.</li>

            <li>This is the best physical sunblock for the money.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t swim and I sat in the shade under an umbrella for most of the day</li>
            <li>Its ok.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is maybe OK for use on your hands.</li>
            <li>ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions.</li>
            <li>and that is okay.  </li>
            <li>say more than the kids version did.  </li>
            <li>I researched online looking for safe sunscreen products.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen met those requirements because it has zinc oxide in non-nano particles and it is ocean safe.  </li>
            <li>My kid used this and turned a pretty impressive bright shade of red by the time we were finished kayaking.</li>
            <li>I was in the water for a couple hours with just one application and it worked pretty good</li>
            <li>My husband even liked it and he is super picky when it comes to lotions as he hates a greasy feeling on his skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK to use for light oudoor activity and by the pool.</li>
            <li>The Burnout Sunscreen was a healthy step-forward in our family&#x27;s ability to enjoy the sun and sand.</li>

            <li>Burnout&#x27;s Ocean Tested mix has some organic ingredients but this is not an acceptable mix although it offers higher ZO than their best selling mix which has 18.9% ZO and selling for almost twice as this Ocean Tested mix on Amzon.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had cancer before and was looking for a fantastic healthy product.  </li>
            <li>To be honest I rarely go out and everytime I go out</li>
            <li>You get tremendous mileage out of a 3.4 oz tube and the more you use it, the better you get at gauging quantity/coverage.  </li>

            <li>It does take some scrubbing and more than a day to wash off, but well worth it!  </li>
            <li>Easy to rub on, no smell, and lasts for hours.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and does not leave pasty look like some zinc sunscreens.</li>
            <li>Washes off easily with soap.  </li>
            <li>We are a very health conscious family and we consult the EWG website each year to find the best rated sunscreen for ourselves and for our children.</li>
            <li>I chose it because it was rated as very non-toxic from some sunscreen review place, and because zinc-based ones are supposed to be the most effective.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m incredibly fair skinned, practically albino, and I live in Florida.  </li>
            <li>I am absolutely ordering more!</li>
            <li>I cover my face with huge sunglasses and always wear a hat, so</li>
            <li>We did not get burned, bus also did not spend a huge amount of time in the sun.</li>
            <li>Neither product is cheap</li>
            <li>We found that it went on smoothly and there is no odor.  </li>
            <li>This is a great physical sunscreen containing zinc oxide.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff - you can go out in the sun right after applying.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li>Reef friendly, face friendly, user friendly.</li>
            <li>My wife and son have sensitivities to just about anything but water, and nothing in the BurnOut product presented any difficulty (of course, physiology is individually unique, so not a broad-spectrum claim, just a two-outta-two thumbs</li>

            <li>On the market again for an eco friendly non toxic screen to protect us.</li>
            <li>Very easy to put on and not thick at all.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m giving this product two stars instead of one, because if you get the old formula, it is amazing</li>
            <li>Seems effective over hours of intermittent exposure, have not used in continuous direct sun.</li>
            <li>There are several similar products available through Amazon and the marketplace, but the BurnOut product seemed to be best value (quantity and performance per dollar)</li>
            <li>True to my statement</li>

            <li>True to my statement</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good physical, mineral sunblock, this is it!  </li>
            <li>Good coverage but leave white residue and make my eyes burn.</li>
            <li>It leaves a white cast even when rubbed in good.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly and blends right in.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients had separated when I first received it but after squeezing the tube and shaking it was easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>For 2 years now I&#x27;ve been using Solar Rx, a very high quality physical sunscreen and have been happy with it&#x27;s performance.  </li>
            <li>It made my husband look a bit purple, but luckily the color went away almost immediately.</li>
            <li>Though it is mild</li>
            <li>Worked great on the whole family this last spring break to the Caribbean.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly but does leave a bit of a shine.  </li>
            <li>A competitor to the BurnOut product performed well, too, but cost about $1.50 more per ounce and left more residual white-film.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super greasy going on and does make me look shiny, which I like.  </li>
            <li>Our favorite sunscreen to use and rated high on not having toxins and chemicals.</li>
            <li>VERY PLEASED, and next summer, we will have nothing but BurnOut in the beach bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /</li>
            <li>VERY PLEASED, and next summer, we will have nothing but BurnOut in the beach bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It goes on pretty smooth.  </li>
            <li>I picked up this sunscreen at Whole Foods yesterday, because it was the only one there that had a good EWG (Environmental Working Group) score.</li>
            <li>rarely write review.</li>
            <li>Fairly Light in EM, lightest or 2nd lightest in most d/s foundations in winter and 1 - 2 shades darker in summer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find this to be the most readily-absorbed sunblock from the natural section that I have found.</li>
            <li>I make my own sunscreen but for times when I do not, I need the same formula as I use in my organic sunscreen mix with fewer ingredients.</li>
            <li>Eco friendly and works very well.  </li>
            <li>Let say that I start on my right side of my forehead</li>
            <li>Right after my sunscreen, I put on my make up</li>
            <li>The ingredients were recognizable and natural for the most part.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got both the waterproof and the regular kind, and for the first time in my life I can go out on the boat all day without being dressed for a northern winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I drove for 3 hours in the heaviest sun of the day with the top of my Jeep down and didn&#x27;t get more than a splash of sun through the sun block.</li>
            <li>Solar Rx has a mild scent that I don&#x27;t like that much -- somewhat like the smell of clay.  </li>
            <li>A bit pricey, but spread it out over total use and it&#x27;s totally worth the money for safe kids.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say this product is easy to apply, but it does go on clear.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to the good old coppertone.</li>
            <li>It is a funny color at first.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a first for zinc oxide sunscreens on my body.</li>
            <li>I at the end of my second tube, and am ordering more today from Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s be on for days unless you hot shower it off.</li>
            <li>Got this after checking/ pouring over the Skin Deep website to find out about a safe sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t oily and goes on pretty clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For four out of the six beach days, we used the BurnOut physical sunscreen on our fair-skinned 12 year-old and even after 2-3 hours in sand and water; reapply then 2-3 more</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff!at equal</li>
            <li>This has proven to last longer and protect them better than sunscreen sticks.  </li>
            <li>Used this sunscreen for the first time over 2 weeks surfing in El Salvador.  </li>
            <li>for the one we went to, sunscreen was not checked, but I&#x27;ve heard that at many, they check and regular brands are excluded as they might harm the cenotes.</li>
            <li>Sorry to see such a great product go, but my family&#x27;s health is more important.</li>
            <li>I am very smell sensitive and the smell is just fine.  </li>
            <li>We will have to get back to using Goddess Garden Sunscreen or just simply try something else with good ratings on the EWG website.</li>
            <li>It does go on clear and it does have good ingredients - but watch out and be careful.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face pretty much  every day of the year that I go out of my house.  </li>
            <li>DeVita was my favorite for long time until they changed their formula.  </li>
            <li>Definitely be aware that this is a sunblock that really needs to be rubbed in.</li>
            <li>It absorbs easily and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin looking white.  </li>

            <li>I spend a lot of time playing beach volleyball and needed a sunscreen that could stand up to the strong Southern California rays.  </li>
            <li>Burnout does not specify certified organic or the percentage of organic in their mix but certainly dumps a lot of ingredients in the mix.</li>
            <li>Strong and lasts pretty long in the water.</li>
            <li>The reason I do this is because it is kind of thick and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>But I use far less of this than most other sunscreens and get excellent protection that lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>We used the Kids Burnout on our two kids, and they were fine further proving the Burnout Ocean Tested does NOT work.  </li>
            <li>A little chalky but it was effective for preventing tropical sunburn.</li>
            <li>For that reason, choosing a formula with the least amount of ingredients but high ZO is the best solution so one needs to read the ZO percentage as well as the rest of the ingredient, since it is the whole mix which counts not the high percentage of ZO only.</li>

            <li>I bought this for the whole family.  </li>
            <li>I will purchase again and I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>This works very well.</li>
            <li>It was the only mineral sunscreen I&#x27;d found that was (note the word WAS) light, non-greasy, and non-white.  </li>
            <li>The market is filled with goopy white mineral sunscreens.</li>

            <li>How fun is that for 6 year old on the beach???</li>
            <li>absolutely disgusting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin still turned slightly pink if I was in the sun for more than an hour with it on.</li>
            <li>and I am ready to go.</li>
            <li>This seller needs to get his facts straight since the product description is misleading, check out Burnout Website for the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to others!</li>
            <li>Very water-proof.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really tan either</li>
            <li>and it had a good EGW rating and to make a long story long</li>
            <li>Applies fairly easily, and without looking too white (not as good as some others, but I&#x27;m willing to compromise this a little for the performance, low health risks, and environmental</li>

            <li>This product has larger &gt;100nm particles according to EWG, goes on smoothly, and has protected my child effectively for the past two weeks outdoors all day at camp.  </li>
            <li>Compared to some other zinc oxide sunscreens I tested this year, this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone interested in not smothering themselves in harsh chemicals while enjoying the sun.</li>
            <li>It feels lighter than many natural products though, until it&#x27;s on for too long.</li>
            <li>(I was careful to dispense my usual amount into my hand first than add in some of my Eucerin Q10 sensitive skin moisturizer and then add more SS to counteract any potential reduction in effectiveness resultant of adding in moisturizer &#x3D; required a bit more rubbing in, but results so worth in.</li>
            <li>Maybe a slight stickiness, but not bad, and well worth it.  </li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend Burnout products.</li>
            <li>high zinc oxide %.</li>
            <li>Highly rated, and i can see why.</li>
            <li>Additionally it left no white residue like many of the other chemical free sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>many, high ZO will not work since it will be too heavy.</li>
            <li>many, high ZO will not work since it will be too heavy.</li>
            <li>not even a light pink spot on either one of us.  </li>
            <li>not even a light pink spot on either one of us.  </li>
            <li>However when the kids came out of the water, they were white in certain places,  it clearly ran right off them.  </li>
            <li>The only one that is worth keeping is the Burnout SPF 30 for kids.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly the Burnout Ocean was not as described.</li>
            <li>So consider this one of such rare occasion,</li>
            <li>I have tried many other sunscreens - most are too sticky, ghostly, or not long lasting enough.</li>
            <li>kind of thick...</li>
            <li>However, based on the new ingredient list alone, I will not recommend this product to anyone anymore.  </li>
            <li>Now I will like to find a safe (ingredients base) and good face cleaner.</li>
            <li>It is more expensive than my other brands (Neutrogena, Blue Lizard, Natures Gate...), but it does such a good job that it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>Maybe you have to apply it more generously compared to other (chemical vs physical) products.</li>
            <li>This is the first sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever tried that actually WORKS.  </li>
            <li>We have been avid sunscreen users for years but have recently become more ingredient conscious and health-smart; looking for products with few, natural ingredients that perform as/better than chemical stews.</li>
            <li>Organic, in this case, refers to organic chemicals that can break down under UV irradiation and create cancer causing free radicals.  </li>
            <li>ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the second year I have used Burnout and will continue, as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>SolarRx gets really tacky and when I dive in the sand I have a really hard time getting the sand off because it sticks strongly to SolarRx.  </li>
            <li>By comparison Burnout has a slightly smoother and more fluid consistency than Solar Rx</li>
            <li>It goes on a little bit like a moisturizer or lotion, but that&#x27;s better than being matte, especially on my tan skin.</li>
            <li>It can come out a little white, but make sure to apply it liberally and rub it in.  </li>
            <li>It goes on clear just like the Kids version so</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive nose</li>
            <li>I only do so when I am very dissatisfied with a product.</li>
            <li>Whole Foods had a tube of this to sample, and an introductory low price.   </li>
            <li>I tried this one and Natural Elements and preferred this one.  </li>
            <li>From what I can tell, if you want to seek out the old formula, it&#x27;s the bottle that has the cartoon picture of a person--this one seems to always have the old formula.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seller is fast and reliable, this is review only for the sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts.</li>
            <li>My husband and I had a weekend getaway and used an entire tube in one beach day (to give you an idea of how much we reapply...</li>
            <li>The larger zinc particles in physical, non-nano sunscreens cannot be absorbed through the skin so they don&#x27;t make their way into blood, organs, and tissues.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most that I&#x27;ve tried have been so thick, greasy and pasty that I don&#x27;t even want to use them.  </li>
            <li>It does leave skin feeling a bit tacky, but it&#x27;s far superior in terms of environmental friendliness, efficacy, price, and sheerness than any of the absurdly expensive brands.  </li>
            <li>what good does that do if everything else just fails right?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is super thick and stays exactly where you put it.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast on the skin as other chemical free sunscreens do.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many different mineral based sunblocks on my kids (they both have sensitive skin and usually complain that sunblock \\&quot;burns\\</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on clear right away, but it does end up clearer then all the other zinc products.  </li>
            <li>This got a high rating on EWG last year.  </li>
            <li>a major reason people get melanoma!</li>
            <li>Hands down, it stayed on better than the other (homemade and competitor) products.  </li>
            <li>Obviously this years choice was the Burnout Ocean Tested Sunscreen (last year we had Goddess Garden Kids Natural Sunscreen which was fabulous but went down in health rating according to EWG).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I live in Hawaii and use this daily...</li>
            <li>My complexion is fair, and it&#x27;s not too difficult to rub in the product until the white residue is gone.</li>
            <li>I am as pale as they come with light eyes and freckles, I burn in about ten minutes unprotected.</li>
            <li>has 22% ZO which is not organic but conventional even with higher amount of ZO than organic brand like BADGER with 18.5% ZO</li>
            <li>BABO has 22% ZO which is not organic but conventional even with higher amount of ZO than organic brand like BADGER with 18.5% ZO</li>
            <li>Generally, after a week in the sun, he looks like an art project gone awry or a box of Neopolitan ice cream-  </li>
            <li>Also, as I stated in my primary review-  a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li>Also, as I stated in my primary review-  a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li>I could barely tell I had been in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>But whenever we use this with our daughter at the beach she gets completely burned on her back and arms.</li>
            <li>, now I have a 6 year old burned from head to toe even after multiple applications</li>
            <li>I love this, but it did leave my face a little white compared to their other sunscreens that are almost identical.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway - we live in coastal GA which means we have lots of sun and long summers.</li>
            <li>A little tingly on the face when I first apply.</li>
            <li>The tubes that I received had a completely different ingredient list that would definitely cause EWG to change its rating from &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;not so great&amp;#34;  Now the company is using new CHEMICALS with very limited safety data, and they are far from natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>rather quickly - takes only slightly longer than my regular facial moisturizers - w/ no residual tackiness left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All other products leave a very visible white pasty look.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or white residue and you can barely notice it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li>we were burnt to a crisp from less than 3 hours in the sun with reapplication!</li>
            <li>it is a little white and greasy at first.</li>
            <li>After the first day, we used a little bit of traditional (absorption) SPF 15 on his nose and cheeks, then topped it with the BurnOut product.</li>
            <li>Burnout&#x27;s smell is similar to a fragrant or essential oil that is very subtle but more</li>
            <li>To boot, the sunscreen is super thick and leaves you looking purple.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thicker and does leave a slight white cast, but really just needs to be worked in.</li>
            <li>Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks.</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t protect my skin like other products do, and I had to wash it off after too long.  </li>
            <li>Hard to find so worth the order.</li>
            <li>I was a believer in burnout in its early days - developed at the university in my hometown, recommended by our local dermatologist for us little junior lifeguard sunworshippers.</li>

            <li> This is the best physical sunblock for the money.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t swim and I sat in the shade under an umbrella for most of the day</li>
            <li> Its ok.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is maybe OK for use on your hands.</li>
            <li> ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions.</li>
            <li> and that is okay.  </li>
            <li> say more than the kids version did.  </li>
            <li> I researched online looking for safe sunscreen products.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen met those requirements because it has zinc oxide in non-nano particles and it is ocean safe.  </li>
            <li> My kid used this and turned a pretty impressive bright shade of red by the time we were finished kayaking.</li>
            <li> I was in the water for a couple hours with just one application and it worked pretty good</li>
            <li> My husband even liked it and he is super picky when it comes to lotions as he hates a greasy feeling on his skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK to use for light oudoor activity and by the pool.</li>
            <li> The Burnout Sunscreen was a healthy step-forward in our family&#x27;s ability to enjoy the sun and sand.</li>

            <li> Burnout&#x27;s Ocean Tested mix has some organic ingredients but this is not an acceptable mix although it offers higher ZO than their best selling mix which has 18.9% ZO and selling for almost twice as this Ocean Tested mix on Amzon.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had cancer before and was looking for a fantastic healthy product.  </li>
            <li> To be honest I rarely go out and everytime I go out</li>
            <li> You get tremendous mileage out of a 3.4 oz tube and the more you use it, the better you get at gauging quantity/coverage.  </li>

            <li> It does take some scrubbing and more than a day to wash off, but well worth it!  </li>
            <li> Easy to rub on, no smell, and lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and does not leave pasty look like some zinc sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Washes off easily with soap.  </li>
            <li> We are a very health conscious family and we consult the EWG website each year to find the best rated sunscreen for ourselves and for our children.</li>
            <li> I chose it because it was rated as very non-toxic from some sunscreen review place, and because zinc-based ones are supposed to be the most effective.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m incredibly fair skinned, practically albino, and I live in Florida.  </li>
            <li> I am absolutely ordering more!</li>

            <li> We did not get burned, bus also did not spend a huge amount of time in the sun.</li>
            <li> Neither product is cheap</li>
            <li> We found that it went on smoothly and there is no odor.  </li>
            <li> This is a great physical sunscreen containing zinc oxide.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff - you can go out in the sun right after applying.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> Reef friendly, face friendly, user friendly.</li>

            <li> On the market again for an eco friendly non toxic screen to protect us.</li>
            <li> Very easy to put on and not thick at all.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this product two stars instead of one, because if you get the old formula, it is amazing</li>
            <li> Seems effective over hours of intermittent exposure, have not used in continuous direct sun.</li>
            <li> There are several similar products available through Amazon and the marketplace, but the BurnOut product seemed to be best value (quantity and performance per dollar)</li>
            <li> True to my statement</li>

            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good physical, mineral sunblock, this is it!  </li>
            <li> Good coverage but leave white residue and make my eyes burn.</li>
            <li> It leaves a white cast even when rubbed in good.</li>
            <li> It goes on so smoothly and blends right in.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients had separated when I first received it but after squeezing the tube and shaking it was easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> For 2 years now I&#x27;ve been using Solar Rx, a very high quality physical sunscreen and have been happy with it&#x27;s performance.  </li>
            <li> It made my husband look a bit purple, but luckily the color went away almost immediately.</li>
            <li> Though it is mild</li>
            <li> Worked great on the whole family this last spring break to the Caribbean.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly but does leave a bit of a shine.  </li>
            <li> A competitor to the BurnOut product performed well, too, but cost about $1.50 more per ounce and left more residual white-film.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super greasy going on and does make me look shiny, which I like.  </li>
            <li> Our favorite sunscreen to use and rated high on not having toxins and chemicals.</li>
            <li> VERY PLEASED, and next summer, we will have nothing but BurnOut in the beach bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /</li>

            <li> I picked up this sunscreen at Whole Foods yesterday, because it was the only one there that had a good EWG (Environmental Working Group) score.</li>
            <li> rarely write review.</li>
            <li> Fairly Light in EM, lightest or 2nd lightest in most d/s foundations in winter and 1 - 2 shades darker in summer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find this to be the most readily-absorbed sunblock from the natural section that I have found.</li>
            <li> I make my own sunscreen but for times when I do not, I need the same formula as I use in my organic sunscreen mix with fewer ingredients.</li>
            <li> Eco friendly and works very well.  </li>
            <li> Let say that I start on my right side of my forehead</li>
            <li> Right after my sunscreen, I put on my make up</li>
            <li> The ingredients were recognizable and natural for the most part.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got both the waterproof and the regular kind, and for the first time in my life I can go out on the boat all day without being dressed for a northern winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I drove for 3 hours in the heaviest sun of the day with the top of my Jeep down and didn&#x27;t get more than a splash of sun through the sun block.</li>
            <li> Solar Rx has a mild scent that I don&#x27;t like that much -- somewhat like the smell of clay.  </li>
            <li> A bit pricey, but spread it out over total use and it&#x27;s totally worth the money for safe kids.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this product is easy to apply, but it does go on clear.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to the good old coppertone.</li>
            <li> It is a funny color at first.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a first for zinc oxide sunscreens on my body.</li>
            <li> I at the end of my second tube, and am ordering more today from Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s be on for days unless you hot shower it off.</li>
            <li> Got this after checking/ pouring over the Skin Deep website to find out about a safe sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t oily and goes on pretty clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For four out of the six beach days, we used the BurnOut physical sunscreen on our fair-skinned 12 year-old and even after 2-3 hours in sand and water; reapply then 2-3 more</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!at equal</li>
            <li> This has proven to last longer and protect them better than sunscreen sticks.  </li>
            <li> Used this sunscreen for the first time over 2 weeks surfing in El Salvador.  </li>
            <li> for the one we went to, sunscreen was not checked, but I&#x27;ve heard that at many, they check and regular brands are excluded as they might harm the cenotes.</li>
            <li> Sorry to see such a great product go, but my family&#x27;s health is more important.</li>
            <li> I am very smell sensitive and the smell is just fine.  </li>
            <li> We will have to get back to using Goddess Garden Sunscreen or just simply try something else with good ratings on the EWG website.</li>
            <li> It does go on clear and it does have good ingredients - but watch out and be careful.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face pretty much  every day of the year that I go out of my house.  </li>
            <li> DeVita was my favorite for long time until they changed their formula.  </li>
            <li> Definitely be aware that this is a sunblock that really needs to be rubbed in.</li>
            <li> It absorbs easily and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin looking white.  </li>
            <li> &quot; their skin)This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that is easy to put on -</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of time playing beach volleyball and needed a sunscreen that could stand up to the strong Southern California rays.  </li>
            <li> Burnout does not specify certified organic or the percentage of organic in their mix but certainly dumps a lot of ingredients in the mix.</li>
            <li> Strong and lasts pretty long in the water.</li>
            <li> The reason I do this is because it is kind of thick and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> But I use far less of this than most other sunscreens and get excellent protection that lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> We used the Kids Burnout on our two kids, and they were fine further proving the Burnout Ocean Tested does NOT work.  </li>
            <li> A little chalky but it was effective for preventing tropical sunburn.</li>
            <li> For that reason, choosing a formula with the least amount of ingredients but high ZO is the best solution so one needs to read the ZO percentage as well as the rest of the ingredient, since it is the whole mix which counts not the high percentage of ZO only.</li>

            <li> Many sunblocks run when wet and burn your eyes.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the whole family.  </li>
            <li> I will purchase again and I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This works very well.</li>
            <li> It was the only mineral sunscreen I&#x27;d found that was (note the word WAS) light, non-greasy, and non-white.  </li>
            <li> The market is filled with goopy white mineral sunscreens.</li>
            <li> It works well doesn&#x27;t take too much to rub in</li>

            <li> and I got really burnt.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It protected my husband on a s.c. Boating trip very well though.</li>
            <li> How fun is that for 6 year old on the beach???</li>
            <li> absolutely disgusting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin still turned slightly pink if I was in the sun for more than an hour with it on.</li>
            <li> and I am ready to go.</li>
            <li> This seller needs to get his facts straight since the product description is misleading, check out Burnout Website for the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light.</li>
            <li> /&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to others!</li>
            <li> Very water-proof.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really tan either</li>
            <li> and it had a good EGW rating and to make a long story long</li>
            <li> Applies fairly easily, and without looking too white (not as good as some others, but I&#x27;m willing to compromise this a little for the performance, low health risks, and environmental</li>
            <li> There are other products with good ratings on EWG which are reasonably priced and they actually work!</li>
            <li> A good sunscreen formula should not have more than a handful ingredients, at least 95% certified organic, protect skin from sun, with no gums, no thickening agents, no perfumes, no alcohol, no restricted ingredients by any other countries, no chemicals, no additives and no softeners.ple, a person wearing SPF15 can be exposed to the sun without reddening for 15 times longer - 150 minutes.</li>

            <li> This product has larger &gt;100nm particles according to EWG, goes on smoothly, and has protected my child effectively for the past two weeks outdoors all day at camp.  </li>
            <li> Compared to some other zinc oxide sunscreens I tested this year, this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone interested in not smothering themselves in harsh chemicals while enjoying the sun.</li>
            <li> It feels lighter than many natural products though, until it&#x27;s on for too long.</li>
            <li> (I was careful to dispense my usual amount into my hand first than add in some of my Eucerin Q10 sensitive skin moisturizer and then add more SS to counteract any potential reduction in effectiveness resultant of adding in moisturizer &#x3D; required a bit more rubbing in, but results so worth in.</li>
            <li> Maybe a slight stickiness, but not bad, and well worth it.  </li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend Burnout products.</li>
            <li> high zinc oxide %.</li>
            <li> Highly rated, and i can see why.</li>
            <li> Additionally it left no white residue like many of the other chemical free sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> many, high ZO will not work since it will be too heavy.</li>
            <li> many, high ZO will not work since it will be too heavy.</li>
            <li> not even a light pink spot on either one of us.  </li>
            <li> not even a light pink spot on either one of us.  </li>
            <li> However when the kids came out of the water, they were white in certain places,  it clearly ran right off them.  </li>
            <li> The only one that is worth keeping is the Burnout SPF 30 for kids.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly the Burnout Ocean was not as described.</li>
            <li> So consider this one of such rare occasion,</li>
            <li> I have tried many other sunscreens - most are too sticky, ghostly, or not long lasting enough.</li>
            <li> kind of thick...</li>
            <li> However, based on the new ingredient list alone, I will not recommend this product to anyone anymore.  </li>
            <li> Now I will like to find a safe (ingredients base) and good face cleaner.</li>
            <li> It is more expensive than my other brands (Neutrogena, Blue Lizard, Natures Gate...), but it does such a good job that it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li> Maybe you have to apply it more generously compared to other (chemical vs physical) products.</li>
            <li> This is the first sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever tried that actually WORKS.  </li>
            <li> We have been avid sunscreen users for years but have recently become more ingredient conscious and health-smart; looking for products with few, natural ingredients that perform as/better than chemical stews.</li>
            <li> Organic, in this case, refers to organic chemicals that can break down under UV irradiation and create cancer causing free radicals.  </li>
            <li> ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the second year I have used Burnout and will continue, as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> SolarRx gets really tacky and when I dive in the sand I have a really hard time getting the sand off because it sticks strongly to SolarRx.  </li>
            <li> By comparison Burnout has a slightly smoother and more fluid consistency than Solar Rx</li>
            <li> It goes on a little bit like a moisturizer or lotion, but that&#x27;s better than being matte, especially on my tan skin.</li>
            <li> It can come out a little white, but make sure to apply it liberally and rub it in.  </li>
            <li> It goes on clear just like the Kids version so</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive nose</li>
            <li> I only do so when I am very dissatisfied with a product.</li>
            <li> Whole Foods had a tube of this to sample, and an introductory low price.   </li>
            <li> I tried this one and Natural Elements and preferred this one.  </li>
            <li> From what I can tell, if you want to seek out the old formula, it&#x27;s the bottle that has the cartoon picture of a person--this one seems to always have the old formula.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seller is fast and reliable, this is review only for the sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts.</li>
            <li> My husband and I had a weekend getaway and used an entire tube in one beach day (to give you an idea of how much we reapply...</li>
            <li> The larger zinc particles in physical, non-nano sunscreens cannot be absorbed through the skin so they don&#x27;t make their way into blood, organs, and tissues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most that I&#x27;ve tried have been so thick, greasy and pasty that I don&#x27;t even want to use them.  </li>
            <li> It does leave skin feeling a bit tacky, but it&#x27;s far superior in terms of environmental friendliness, efficacy, price, and sheerness than any of the absurdly expensive brands.  </li>
            <li> what good does that do if everything else just fails right?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is super thick and stays exactly where you put it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast on the skin as other chemical free sunscreens do.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many different mineral based sunblocks on my kids (they both have sensitive skin and usually complain that sunblock \\&quot;burns\\</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go on clear right away, but it does end up clearer then all the other zinc products.  </li>
            <li> This got a high rating on EWG last year.  </li>
            <li> a major reason people get melanoma!</li>
            <li> Hands down, it stayed on better than the other (homemade and competitor) products.  </li>
            <li> Obviously this years choice was the Burnout Ocean Tested Sunscreen (last year we had Goddess Garden Kids Natural Sunscreen which was fabulous but went down in health rating according to EWG).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I live in Hawaii and use this daily...</li>
            <li> My complexion is fair, and it&#x27;s not too difficult to rub in the product until the white residue is gone.</li>
            <li> I am as pale as they come with light eyes and freckles, I burn in about ten minutes unprotected.</li>
            <li> has 22% ZO which is not organic but conventional even with higher amount of ZO than organic brand like BADGER with 18.5% ZO</li>
            <li> BABO has 22% ZO which is not organic but conventional even with higher amount of ZO than organic brand like BADGER with 18.5% ZO</li>
            <li> Generally, after a week in the sun, he looks like an art project gone awry or a box of Neopolitan ice cream-  </li>
            <li> Also, as I stated in my primary review-  a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> Also, as I stated in my primary review-  a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> I could barely tell I had been in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> But whenever we use this with our daughter at the beach she gets completely burned on her back and arms.</li>
            <li> , now I have a 6 year old burned from head to toe even after multiple applications</li>
            <li> I love this, but it did leave my face a little white compared to their other sunscreens that are almost identical.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway - we live in coastal GA which means we have lots of sun and long summers.</li>
            <li> A little tingly on the face when I first apply.</li>
            <li> The tubes that I received had a completely different ingredient list that would definitely cause EWG to change its rating from &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;not so great&amp;#34;  Now the company is using new CHEMICALS with very limited safety data, and they are far from natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> rather quickly - takes only slightly longer than my regular facial moisturizers - w/ no residual tackiness left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All other products leave a very visible white pasty look.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or white residue and you can barely notice it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> we were burnt to a crisp from less than 3 hours in the sun with reapplication!</li>
            <li> it is a little white and greasy at first.</li>
            <li> After the first day, we used a little bit of traditional (absorption) SPF 15 on his nose and cheeks, then topped it with the BurnOut product.</li>
            <li> Burnout&#x27;s smell is similar to a fragrant or essential oil that is very subtle but more</li>
            <li> To boot, the sunscreen is super thick and leaves you looking purple.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thicker and does leave a slight white cast, but really just needs to be worked in.</li>
            <li> Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks.</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t protect my skin like other products do, and I had to wash it off after too long.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find so worth the order.</li>
            <li> I was a believer in burnout in its early days - developed at the university in my hometown, recommended by our local dermatologist for us little junior lifeguard sunworshippers.</li>
            <li> I like that this has a high 18% zinc content (less chemicals), and it also blends in well.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it!!  </li>
            <li> I reapplied every once in a while just to be cautious so not sure exactly how long it would have lasted but have I have no doubt it works as described.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a physical sunscreen after getting strange itchy bumps from using drugstore sunscreen (Neutrogena, Banana Boat).</li>
            <li> I can only obtain online &#x3D; minor inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this many years later, but was a little wary having read the reviews.</li>
            <li> it produces any day as long as I am protected.</li>
            <li> conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;Buying this product was a complete waste of money for us.</li>
            <li> account to order in case you&#x27;re wondering why it is not marked as Amazon verified</li>
            <li> This stuff is thick and pasty (like all non-nano zinc products) but it you apply it correctly and evenly, the ghastly hue quickly fades and a little bit of product goes A LONG WAY.&lt;br</li>

            <li> This family can travel to tropical places like Mexico, spend all day at the beach and in the water and barely get any sun, much less get burned.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Do yourself a favor and go with a different product, especially if you have little children and are planning on having them use this product.</li>
            <li> - EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep i decided to dump the brand name sunscreen i have and go with ones that are less harmful.</li>
            <li> This is a topical sunscreen so it will rub off, but the water and general sand contact did not affect performance in the least.  </li>
            <li> I usually wear only physical blocks.  </li>
            <li> Small price to pay for something much less toxic than normal sunblock you buy at the drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The batch we made at home with a few simple ingredients performed well and was very cost-effective, but it was greasy and sticky and all-around unpleasant on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I will take the little bit of white cakiness</li>
            <li> If you are not familiar with non-nano products, do your homework and understand the benefits that equal the seemingly high-cost.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> , I only got a little sunburned.</li>
            <li> Seemed to take a few minutes to work into the skin to avoid white cast.</li>
            <li> After using Burnout for a few weeks have decided to switch for several reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;(4) sinks into my skin</li>
            <li> Spent 8+ hours in full-sun with no burn while on a boat.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is that the cap doesn&#x27;t snap closed tightly enough</li>
            <li> but you need to use a lot because it is not very creamy.  </li>
            <li> I have been searching for a more natural sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t have all the nasty chemicals in it that traditional sunscreens do.  </li>
            <li> no burn; not even a hint of pink.  </li>
            <li> (normally we never get burned when using other sun blocks).  </li>
            <li> Used this in Mexico as you can only use a few formulations to go into Cenotes.</li>
            <li> The formulation was partially separated on arrival, and was greasy.</li>
            <li> Burn Out Sunscreen is the real stuff--not false assurance against the dangers of sunshine exposure.</li>
            <li> non toxic and vegan, stays on in the water, works on my irish pale skin</li>
            <li> Other family members used the spray on type stuff for wet skin and fried also, just as reported by EWG.</li>
            <li> There is very little white residue, if any.  </li>
            <li> For the past several years I have been in a bind -- I did not want to put chemical sunscreens on my child, but I did not trust the emerging nano particle zinc and titanium products either.  </li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t usually with our regular sunscreen.</li>
            <li> If price isn&#x27;t any option this product beats all other mineral based suncreens.</li>
            <li> Due to health concerns and some advice from a healthcare-affiliated friend, my family has joined the non-nano zinc, topical/physical sunscreen ranks.</li>
            <li> and this has never happened with any other sunscreen before)&lt;br</li>
            <li> For a small investment, sunscreens may offer me the possibility of avoiding sun burn, pain, cancer, medical bills, pain killers, etc.</li>
            <li> For a small investment, sunscreens may offer me the possibility of avoiding sun burn, pain, cancer, medical bills, pain killers, etc.</li>

            <li> a little pink, a little brown and  a little white here, there and everywhere.</li>
            <li> Also, the tube seemed a bit \\&quot;light\\&quot; when i got it, as if the tube is half empty.</li>
            <li> I think that is the only negative on the product.  </li>
            <li> It is not melting in into your skin but leaves thick white mask.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and sticky and my kids have complained that the new formula runs into their eyes and stings.  </li>
            <li> Not much of the pale greasy appearance you can get with the zinc sunscreens.</li>
            <li> ingredient is interacting with my wives silver jewelry which leads to black marks all over her skin wherever her bracelet gets in contact with sunscreen treated skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> all of the other products I&#x27;ve tried are very thick and leave a white film on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Burnout sunscreen is a sunscreen that is not full of chemicals that can damage your skin and burn your skin when you are out in the humidity.  </li>
            <li> Pretty disappointing.</li>

            <li> This is very thick and goes on white.  </li>
            <li> I was a little shocked at the price: almost 20 bucks, but you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>

            <li> Our usual sunscreen (Goddess Garden Sunscreen) has gone down in rating on the EWG website which is why we went for the Burnout</li>
            <li> It went on thick and after a little rubbing it did not give me the ghost look, plus it did stay put even after swimming in the salt water.  </li>
            <li> We used it this this past weekend in Vermont, reapplied and all of us got burnt.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I will have to continue in warmer months like this or not...</li>
            <li> I only use it on my face because its expensive and does need a lot to cover all your areas.  </li>
            <li> Usually organic is something you want, NOT IN A SUNBLOCK.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;~it is really thick, sticky and pasty which makes it damn near impossible to apply/</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too thick, slightly greasy and leaves a whitish/bluish film behind.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to rub in.  </li>
            <li> is what we do NOT like about Burnout Ocean Tested:&lt;br /&gt;~very thick and sticky which makes it extremely hard to apply</li>

            <li> product did not work and the whole family got a terrible sunburn - and this has never happened with any other product before&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would sue this company if I had the means to do it, I can&#x27;t believe that this company sells this crap, I can only believe that the reviews are fake and I will not trust any single source reviews any more.&lt;br</li>
            <li> was probably the worst mistake ever and a complete waste of money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy or thick!  </li>
            <li> I did get a sunburn once on my feet when using this, but I think it was because I applied it really thin.</li>
            <li> While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn, UVA rays damage the skin&#x27;s DNA at a deeper layer.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This worked perfectly for our scuba diving trip. Many sunblocks run when wet and burn your eyes. Not this one. It is a funny color at first. It made my husband look a bit purple, but luckily the color went away almost immediately.</li>
            <li> Seemed to take a few minutes to work into the skin to avoid white cast. However, we were in the sun A LOT and didn&#x27;t come home with a sunburn. Even thought it&#x27;s meant to wear in the water, reapply every now and then.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. After reviewing EWG&#x27;s sunscreen report I went with Burnout for our 8 day Florida beach vacation. I am as pale as they come with light eyes and freckles, I burn in about ten minutes unprotected. Came home after 8 days of 4+ hours per day July sun and only ONE burn where I forgot to apply it. My sister-in-law used it on her face once and her regular 50 SPF everywhere else three times. She fried like a lobster except for her face. We put it all over her babies (same skin types) and no burns on any of them either! I&#x27;m sold! Easy to rub on, no smell, and lasts for hours. Other family members used the spray on type stuff for wet skin and fried also, just as reported by EWG. Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big proponent of the physical sunscreens and did a lot of research in the cosmetic database.  For 2 years now I&#x27;ve been using Solar Rx, a very high quality physical sunscreen and have been happy with it&#x27;s performance.  I spend a lot of time playing beach volleyball and needed a sunscreen that could stand up to the strong Southern California rays.  During a game a few weeks ago my brother had Burnout in his bag and I gave it a try.  By comparison Burnout has a slightly smoother and more fluid consistency than Solar Rx so it was easier to apply and work into my skin.  After using Burnout for a few weeks have decided to switch for several reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Solar Rx is $7.92 per ounce while Burnout is only $4.94 per ounce -- almost 40% cheaper.  Neither product is cheap so it is a big bonus to save some bucks on sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Burnout smells better.  Solar Rx has a mild scent that I don&#x27;t like that much -- somewhat like the smell of clay.  Though it is mild I have a sensitive nose and it bothers me a little.  Burnout&#x27;s smell is similar to a fragrant or essential oil that is very subtle but more pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Burnout has a better consistency that is easier to apply.  SolarRx gets really tacky and when I dive in the sand I have a really hard time getting the sand off because it sticks strongly to SolarRx.  I don&#x27;t seem to have the problem with Burnout.</li>
            <li> This product came with a lot of fluid inside!</li>
            <li> I picked up this sunscreen at Whole Foods yesterday, because it was the only one there that had a good EWG (Environmental Working Group) score. My wife always complains that she gets a sunburn, even though she is wearing sunscreen. Not so with this product: we played at Waterworld California, and no-one got a sunburn. I was a little shocked at the price: almost 20 bucks, but you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> We ordered this sunscreen based on the EMF ratings and after reading the reviews.  I found that it did not protect my family at all.  My husband and two children have very fair skin but I have medium.  We used it this this past weekend in Vermont, reapplied and all of us got burnt.  We found that it went on smoothly and there is no odor.  We did like that.  Additionally it left no white residue like many of the other chemical free sunscreens.  However when the kids came out of the water, they were white in certain places,  it clearly ran right off them.  I didn&#x27;t go in the water at all and still burned.  I will be going back to Goddess Garden which we have used for the last several years.  I apply it once and it lasts all day.  This family can travel to tropical places like Mexico, spend all day at the beach and in the water and barely get any sun, much less get burned.  I will take the little bit of white cakiness it produces any day as long as I am protected.</li>
            <li> For the past several years I have been in a bind -- I did not want to put chemical sunscreens on my child, but I did not trust the emerging nano particle zinc and titanium products either.  The jury is still out on that one but I prefer larger particle size.  This product has larger &gt;100nm particles according to EWG, goes on smoothly, and has protected my child effectively for the past two weeks outdoors all day at camp.  I am very smell sensitive and the smell is just fine.  My child likes it a lot.  We both preferred this formulation to the KIDS version of the same product because of consistency and ease of application of this version.  This version also has fewer ingredients than the KIDS version (same active ingredient) which is preferable to me since there is less risk of some random thing triggering a sensitivity.  My one regret is that I can&#x27;t use it personally because of a sorbitol sensitivity (sorbitol is an ingredient in all 3 formulations).</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t protect my skin like other products do, and I had to wash it off after too long.  It feels lighter than many natural products though, until it&#x27;s on for too long.</li>
            <li> Based on the Sunscreen Report - EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep i decided to dump the brand name sunscreen i have and go with ones that are less harmful. So I purchased 3 sunscreens from Amazon. Burnout Ocean, Burnout SPF 30 for Kids and  Aubrey Organics. The only one that is worth keeping is the Burnout SPF 30 for kids.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly the Burnout Ocean was not as described. The sunscreen is not waterproof at all. I tried it a couple of times on both of my kids and myself and as soon as they get in the water it starts running off. Also, the tube seemed a bit \\&quot;light\\&quot; when i got it, as if the tube is half empty. Oh also, the sunscreen doesn&#x27;t smell very good. Anyway, i am definitely returning the Burnout Ocean.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is great. It goes on a little bit like a moisturizer or lotion, but that&#x27;s better than being matte, especially on my tan skin. Also, I see no whiteness. That&#x27;s a first for zinc oxide sunscreens on my body. Very pleased with this product. Compared to some other zinc oxide sunscreens I tested this year, this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a physical sunscreen after getting strange itchy bumps from using drugstore sunscreen (Neutrogena, Banana Boat). Used this stuff in Maui and it was great! No skin irritation and no sunburn all week! It&#x27;s thicker and does leave a slight white cast, but really just needs to be worked in. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This thing sucks, sucks badly. I have been using this brand for about a year, and I follow the rule strictly: apply a LOT, reapply every 2 hours and after swimming. To be honest I rarely go out and everytime I go out I cover my face with huge sunglasses and always wear a hat, so I never knew whether this thing works or not. NOW I know! I went to the beach with my friend and get burned so, so badly when I just went down to the sea for about 10 minutes (I realized I was burned because my face starts to hurt, and the night after the beach my face turned all red). This sunscreen doesn&#x27;t work at all, at least NOT underwater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely write review. I only do so when I am very dissatisfied with a product. So consider this one of such rare occasion,</li>
            <li> I have tried many other sunscreens - most are too sticky, ghostly, or not long lasting enough. Whole Foods had a tube of this to sample, and an introductory low price.   I like that this has a high 18% zinc content (less chemicals), and it also blends in well. Oh, and no eye sting!    It is more expensive than my other brands (Neutrogena, Blue Lizard, Natures Gate...), but it does such a good job that it is well worth it.  I at the end of my second tube, and am ordering more today from Amazon. Who can beat free shipping!    CSun</li>
            <li> I was one of Burnout&#x27;s greatest fans until they changed the ingredients. The OLD formula had an excellent rating from EWG and it worked great - stayed on, never burned.  The ingredients were recognizable and natural for the most part.  It was time to replenish for summer, so I ordered a few tubes.  The tubes that I received had a completely different ingredient list that would definitely cause EWG to change its rating from &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;not so great&amp;#34;  Now the company is using new CHEMICALS with very limited safety data, and they are far from natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this product two stars instead of one, because if you get the old formula, it is amazing and I would highly recommend it.  However, based on the new ingredient list alone, I will not recommend this product to anyone anymore.  Sorry to see such a great product go, but my family&#x27;s health is more important.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen. It is my favorite zinc/Ti sunscreen after having tried many products. Good for the you, good for the planet. Applies fairly easily, and without looking too white (not as good as some others, but I&#x27;m willing to compromise this a little for the performance, low health risks, and environmental friendliness).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this while being in and on the water for hours. It works well for protection. No, it&#x27;s not as effective as some 50+ synthetic sunscreens, but close. In closing: LOVE IT. (not affiliated)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the EWG sunscreen guide too.</li>
            <li> I drove for 3 hours in the heaviest sun of the day with the top of my Jeep down and didn&#x27;t get more than a splash of sun through the sun block. I could barely tell I had been in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does go on white, but after you work it in that whiteness disappears. Small price to pay for something much less toxic than normal sunblock you buy at the drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the whole family.  My husband has fair skin, our daughter has something in between my husband and me, and I have medium skin tone.  My husband and daughter were both burnt with this sunscreen.  When I applied it, I found it too sticky and I really hate feeling sticky.  My daughter refused to have it applied to her even for a short outing.  So I had to restore to another brand.  This was an expensive product that should have worked.  I will not by this brand again.</li>
            <li> Our favorite sunscreen to use and rated high on not having toxins and chemicals. A bit pricey, but spread it out over total use and it&#x27;s totally worth the money for safe kids.</li>
            <li> The stuff works; good sunblock.  But it goes on thick and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;disappear&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s be on for days unless you hot shower it off.</li>
            <li> On my hunt for a non-avobenzone containing, hi spf/hi ppd SS, I came across this gem - I truly like it and have been using on a daily basis since last August.&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;(1) no white cast (I&#x27;m NC 15, Fairly Light in EM, lightest or 2nd lightest in most d/s foundations in winter and 1 - 2 shades darker in summer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) no breakouts or skin irritations. In fact, I find the hi zinc content to be soothing to my subtype I (blushing) rosacea on my cheeks, nose and chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) no worsening of melasma as had been happening w/ some chem SS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(4) sinks into my skin rather quickly - takes only slightly longer than my regular facial moisturizers - w/ no residual tackiness left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(5) wears beautifully under my MMU and my liquid foundation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;(1) I can only obtain online &#x3D; minor inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) I did find the need over the winter to mix in w/ a moisturizer (I was careful to dispense my usual amount into my hand first than add in some of my Eucerin Q10 sensitive skin moisturizer and then add more SS to counteract any potential reduction in effectiveness resultant of adding in moisturizer &#x3D; required a bit more rubbing in, but results so worth in. Not sure if I will have to continue in warmer months like this or not...</li>
            <li> I love this, but it did leave my face a little white compared to their other sunscreens that are almost identical.</li>
            <li> Burn Out Sunscreen is the real stuff--not false assurance against the dangers of sunshine exposure.</li>
            <li> My kid used this and turned a pretty impressive bright shade of red by the time we were finished kayaking.She doesn&#x27;t usually with our regular sunscreen. She was not happy with me having her try it! She swore she wouldn&#x27;t use it again. Maybe you have to apply it more generously compared to other (chemical vs physical) products.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Worked great on the whole family this last spring break to the Caribbean.  Very impressed with this product.  I will purchase again and I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> A little chalky but it was effective for preventing tropical sunburn.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Arrived on schedule, no problem.  Eco friendly and works very well.  Easy to apply and does not leave pasty look like some zinc sunscreens.</li>
            <li> This works very well. I had never tried sunscreen like this before so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. It is thicker than regular sunscreen and it takes some effort to wash off. But, it rubs in well and doesn&#x27;t leave you looking white. I was also able to get some color but no burn.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about this product.  Have used it for a couple of years.  I only use products that are well rated by EWG. It absorbs quickly but does leave a bit of a shine.  I use it on my face pretty much  every day of the year that I go out of my house.  My husband uses it also doing all sorts of outdoor activities.  For now I believe this product is about as good as it gets for sun protection.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend spends a lot of time outdoors on the river as a fly fishing guide. Being fair skinned, he wears sunscreen every day. After reviewing the EWG guide to sunscreens, I bought him this one, thinking it was a healthier alternative than what he was using. Not the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen did not work for him at all. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and thought this might be a good option for Aruba. Four stars because it&#x27;s expensive. I did like the product and didn&#x27;t get any burn. Burnout goes on nicely.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply!  No white residue, no stickiness.  All around great product.  Expensive but worth it!!  Spent 8+ hours in full-sun with no burn while on a boat.  My friend really liked the product also.</li>
            <li> I tried this one and Natural Elements and preferred this one.  Used it in Mexico on winter white skin and it worked as described.  The ingredients had separated when I first received it but after squeezing the tube and shaking it was easy to apply.  It went on thick and after a little rubbing it did not give me the ghost look, plus it did stay put even after swimming in the salt water.  I reapplied every once in a while just to be cautious so not sure exactly how long it would have lasted but have I have no doubt it works as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen for 5+ years after finding it on the EWG website. It works perfectly for outdoor activities in and out of the water.</li>
            <li> Reef friendly, face friendly, user friendly. I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m incredibly fair skinned, practically albino, and I live in Florida.  I burn through t-shirts, burn through bathing suits, burn walking from my car to my door, etc.  This is the first sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever tried that actually WORKS.  I chose it because it was rated as very non-toxic from some sunscreen review place, and because zinc-based ones are supposed to be the most effective.  I&#x27;ve got both the waterproof and the regular kind, and for the first time in my life I can go out on the boat all day without being dressed for a northern winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the cap doesn&#x27;t snap closed tightly enough and so I&#x27;ve had several accidents where it leaked all over my purse/bag/etc.  Now I keep it in a ziploc baggie.</li>
            <li> This product is great. It&#x27;s safe for the skin without all the chemicals, and toxic stuff. I am absolutely ordering more!</li>
            <li> Burnout sunscreen is a sunscreen that is not full of chemicals that can damage your skin and burn your skin when you are out in the humidity.  This is a great physical sunscreen containing zinc oxide.  Zinc oxide has been used for sun protection for many decades.  I highly recommend Burnout products.</li>
            <li> I have never gotten burnt wearing this sunscreen. I surf and wear this on my face, neck, and  hands (we wear wetsuits most of the year here in CA.) It&#x27;s amazingly waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned about skin cancer and also the effects of my sunscreen on the ocean (sunscreen can harm coral.) I bought this based on reviews and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, sometimes it will show white on your skin, if you don&#x27;t rub it in all the way. But I use far less of this than most other sunscreens and get excellent protection that lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Stays on and totally does the job throughout 70 minutes of sweating in the noon-time sun in an outdoor lap pool.  Does not get in the eyes. Leaves me with zero color/tanning where it is applied. Feels great on the skin. Washes off easily with soap.  This fair-skinned, basel-cell carcinoma survivor can now swim anytime of day.  Can&#x27;t wait to use it in open- and salt-water swims!</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen. I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural sunscreen for my children and this is the best one we&#x27;ve found.  It absorbs easily and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin looking white.  When my children are in the water I reapply it every hour. My girls did not burn at all.  My oldest is very fair skinned and didn&#x27;t even tan.  My youngest has a darker complexion and tans very easily.  She did get a tan while we were at the beach but didn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> great product. high zinc oxide %.</li>
            <li> This truly used to be the best sunscreen on the market. It was the only mineral sunscreen I&#x27;d found that was (note the word WAS) light, non-greasy, and non-white.  Now it&#x27;s 100% the opposite.  It&#x27;s thick and sticky and my kids have complained that the new formula runs into their eyes and stings.  From what I can tell, if you want to seek out the old formula, it&#x27;s the bottle that has the cartoon picture of a person--this one seems to always have the old formula. If you don&#x27;t get the picture, you have the new formula which is sticky and awful.  I truly don&#x27;t know why they changed this product.  The market is filled with goopy white mineral sunscreens. They had the only product which wasn&#x27;t this, and now are like all the rest, and in some cases worse.</li>
            <li> Used this product before. Works real nice. Highly rated, and i can see why.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the bad reviews.  The product is the best mineral sunscreen.  All other products leave a very visible white pasty look.  I wouldn&#x27;t say this product is easy to apply, but it does go on clear.  It doesn&#x27;t go on clear right away, but it does end up clearer then all the other zinc products.  I only use it on my face because its expensive and does need a lot to cover all your areas.  I think that is the only negative on the product.  If price isn&#x27;t any option this product beats all other mineral based suncreens.</li>
            <li> I find this to be the most readily-absorbed sunblock from the natural section that I have found. My complexion is fair, and it&#x27;s not too difficult to rub in the product until the white residue is gone. Seems effective over hours of intermittent exposure, have not used in continuous direct sun. Would buy again</li>
            <li> I surf everyday. My fave sunscreen. I&#x27;ve been using it ever since dermatologists gave me samples years ago. Hard to find so worth the order. Just another great thing outta Santa Cruz.</li>
            <li> non toxic and vegan, stays on in the water, works on my irish pale skin</li>
            <li> amazing, works great.</li>
            <li> sun protection is great for just that the outdoors if your at the beach theme park or going to the part. Not for everyday use to heavy and tacky feels like I have a mask on.</li>
            <li> Got this after checking/ pouring over the Skin Deep website to find out about a safe sunscreen.  It works well doesn&#x27;t take too much to rub in but you need to use a lot because it is not very creamy.  It does the job.</li>
            <li> This stuff works well.  We brought it to the Cayman Islands so that we could use it while swimming without damaging the reefs.  It isn&#x27;t oily and goes on pretty clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> We were looking for a biodegradable sunscreen that would not hurt the animals while we were snorkeling.  It works well.  It needs to be rubbed into the skin,  it is a little white and greasy at first.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used this sunscreen on a few occasions. It&#x27;s OK to use for light oudoor activity and by the pool. But whenever we use this with our daughter at the beach she gets completely burned on her back and arms. This is despite slathering it on and rubbing it in 30+ min before any sun exposure. Pretty disappointing.</li>
            <li> Love!  I can still get a tan and not burn. It does take some scrubbing and more than a day to wash off, but well worth it!  This is the second year I have used Burnout and will continue, as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> No garbage ingredients...worth the extra cost to know I&#x27;m not putting chemicals on my skin...a major reason people get melanoma!</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a more natural sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t have all the nasty chemicals in it that traditional sunscreens do.  Most that I&#x27;ve tried have been so thick, greasy and pasty that I don&#x27;t even want to use them.  The Burnout Ocean Tested is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried even compared to traditional types!  It goes on so smoothly and blends right in.  It&#x27;s not greasy or thick!  My husband even liked it and he is super picky when it comes to lotions as he hates a greasy feeling on his skin.  We wore this in Hawaii and did not get burned at all!  Love it!!</li>
            <li> Due to health concerns and some advice from a healthcare-affiliated friend, my family has joined the non-nano zinc, topical/physical sunscreen ranks. We have been avid sunscreen users for years but have recently become more ingredient conscious and health-smart; looking for products with few, natural ingredients that perform as/better than chemical stews. The larger zinc particles in physical, non-nano sunscreens cannot be absorbed through the skin so they don&#x27;t make their way into blood, organs, and tissues.&lt;br /&gt;We just returned from a week at a mid-Atlantic beach- sunny all day, every day. We brought three non-nano products with us.  The batch we made at home with a few simple ingredients performed well and was very cost-effective, but it was greasy and sticky and all-around unpleasant on the skin.  A competitor to the BurnOut product performed well, too, but cost about $1.50 more per ounce and left more residual white-film. For four out of the six beach days, we used the BurnOut physical sunscreen on our fair-skinned 12 year-old and even after 2-3 hours in sand and water; reapply then 2-3 more hours-  no burn; not even a hint of pink.  Generally, after a week in the sun, he looks like an art project gone awry or a box of Neopolitan ice cream-  a little pink, a little brown and  a little white here, there and everywhere. The only problem occurred under his eyes where he incessantly rubbed the salt water (and sunscreen away) while playing in the water. This is a topical sunscreen so it will rub off, but the water and general sand contact did not affect performance in the least.  Hands down, it stayed on better than the other (homemade and competitor) products.  After the first day, we used a little bit of traditional (absorption) SPF 15 on his nose and cheeks, then topped it with the BurnOut product. Problem solved- no rosey cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of notes:&lt;br /&gt;1. If you are not familiar with non-nano products, do your homework and understand the benefits that equal the seemingly high-cost.&lt;br /&gt;2. This stuff is thick and pasty (like all non-nano zinc products) but it you apply it correctly and evenly, the ghastly hue quickly fades and a little bit of product goes A LONG WAY.&lt;br /&gt;3. There are several similar products available through Amazon and the marketplace, but the BurnOut product seemed to be best value (quantity and performance per dollar) when I purchased.&lt;br /&gt;4. Others reported trouble with skin sensitivities. My wife and son have sensitivities to just about anything but water, and nothing in the BurnOut product presented any difficulty (of course, physiology is individually unique, so not a broad-spectrum claim, just a two-outta-two thumbs up).&lt;br /&gt;5. We are &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; people.  We love nature but DO NOT make a habit of hugging trees. We eat meat, use soap and sometimes wear polyester. The Burnout Sunscreen was a healthy step-forward in our family&#x27;s ability to enjoy the sun and sand. VERY PLEASED, and next summer, we will have nothing but BurnOut in the beach bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******* UPDATE, June 29, 2016-  True to my statement LAST summer, my family carries/uses nothing but BurnOut now.  We have been using it for just about a year-  on and off ball fields, on beach trips, hiking, camping, yard work... I am still singing its praises.  A real test--- My wife, who gets burned after three minutes of sitting too closely to a lit Christmas tree, used it exclusively for a week in St. Maarten (woohoo!) earlier this summer.  Equatorial sun is unforgiving, yet, no burn- not even a light pink spot on either one of us.  The rest of the group was COOKED and we just had a nice, healthy glow.  Also, as I stated in my primary review-  a little goes a long way!  You get tremendous mileage out of a 3.4 oz tube and the more you use it, the better you get at gauging quantity/coverage.  I absolutely love this stuff!at equal the seemingly high-cost.&lt;br /&gt;2.

            <li> I usually wear only physical blocks.  DeVita was my favorite for long time until they changed their formula.  This is the best physical sunblock for the money.  There is very little white residue, if any.  (Disclaimer: I&#x27;m caucasian so cannot speak to darker skin tones.)  It does leave skin feeling a bit tacky, but it&#x27;s far superior in terms of environmental friendliness, efficacy, price, and sheerness than any of the absurdly expensive brands.  I use it on both face and body.</li>
            <li> We are a very health conscious family and we consult the EWG website each year to find the best rated sunscreen for ourselves and for our children. Obviously this years choice was the Burnout Ocean Tested Sunscreen (last year we had Goddess Garden Kids Natural Sunscreen which was fabulous but went down in health rating according to EWG).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what we do NOT like about Burnout Ocean Tested:&lt;br /&gt;~very thick and sticky which makes it extremely hard to apply&lt;br /&gt;~makes skin feel sticky and nasty ALL day&lt;br /&gt;~because of the thickness you&#x27;ll end up using a lot of the product which means we&#x27;d have to buy 10 of these to last through a GA summer&lt;br /&gt;~very unpleasant smell&lt;br /&gt;~wife and kids still got a sunburn (and this has never happened with any other sunscreen before)&lt;br /&gt;~some ingredient is interacting with my wives silver jewelry which leads to black marks all over her skin wherever her bracelet gets in contact with sunscreen treated skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What we do like about it&lt;br /&gt;~the great rating on EWG but what good does that do if everything else just fails right?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;Buying this product was a complete waste of money for us. We will have to get back to using Goddess Garden Sunscreen or just simply try something else with good ratings on the EWG website.</li>
            <li> I have kids who play water polo.  We have to apply sunscreen to their faces before they get in the water and they stay in the water for hours at a time without any opportunity to reapply.  This has proven to last longer and protect them better than sunscreen sticks.  And it does not run into their eyes and it does not make them ghostly white.</li>
            <li> This stuff rubs in well and stands up to sweat. Not much of the pale greasy appearance you can get with the zinc sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I used this product all over my body. A lot of it. I didn&#x27;t swim and I sat in the shade under an umbrella for most of the day and I got really burnt. I do have very fair skin - but I&#x27;ve never had this problem with a sunblock. It does go on clear and it does have good ingredients - but watch out and be careful. It wasn&#x27;t a terrible burn - but I was red all over and sunburnt.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good physical, mineral sunblock, this is it!  Usually organic is something you want, NOT IN A SUNBLOCK.  Organic, in this case, refers to organic chemicals that can break down under UV irradiation and create cancer causing free radicals.  This product works great, I&#x27;ve used it on sunny days at the beach and sunny days skiing and it prevented sun burn.  It goes on pretty smooth.  Maybe a slight stickiness, but not bad, and well worth it.  It can come out a little white, but make sure to apply it liberally and rub it in.  I did get a sunburn once on my feet when using this, but I think it was because I applied it really thin.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen out there!</li>
            <li> Both my wife and I used the product and applied heavily several times and each received very bad sun burns (normally we never get burned when using other sun blocks).  We used the Kids Burnout on our two kids, and they were fine further proving the Burnout Ocean Tested does NOT work.  We returned the product and will never use it again.</li>
            <li> A little tingly on the face when I first apply. I was in the water for a couple hours with just one application and it worked pretty good, I only got a little sunburned.</li>
            <li> Its ok.  kind of thick...</li>
            <li> I love this stuff - you can go out in the sun right after applying. It moisturizes and I can put make-up on over it without beading.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many types of sunscreen, and this seems to be the best for versatility. I live in Hawaii and use this daily...it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or white residue and you can barely notice it&#x27;s on. I&#x27;ve never been burned, even out in the tropical sun all day, while wearing this.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is great!  Doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast on the skin as other chemical free sunscreens do.  Very easy to put on and not thick at all.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This gives bread sun protection and spreads well but you look like a ghost afterwards. Even after rubbing it in. It protected my husband on a s.c. Boating trip very well though. So if you don&#x27;t mind a white face and body go for it.</li>
            <li> Good coverage but leave white residue and make my eyes burn.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone interested in not smothering themselves in harsh chemicals while enjoying the sun. We have yet to burn while regularly applying this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I use this on my children and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it all summer.  Thick, but rubs in and lasts for a long time- no sunburns.</li>
            <li> Kind of pricey but very good sunblock.  Strong and lasts pretty long in the water.</li>
            <li> I would sue this company if I had the means to do it, I can&#x27;t believe that this company sells this crap, I can only believe that the reviews are fake and I will not trust any single source reviews any more.&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so we are on Hawaii for 18 days and I bought this \\&quot;sunblock\\&quot; because it had good reviews and it had a good EGW rating and to make a long story long, now I have a 6 year old burned from head to toe even after multiple applications and she probably will have to stay out of the sun for a couple days... How fun is that for 6 year old on the beach??? Screw you burnout... I&#x27;m going back to the good old coppertone.</li>
            <li> Great coverage and rubs in well.</li>
            <li> We purchased this product based on it&#x27;s great rating on the EWG website as well as the good customer reviews on amazon (Used my husbands account to order in case you&#x27;re wondering why it is not marked as Amazon verified purchase).&lt;br /&gt;Anyway - we live in coastal GA which means we have lots of sun and long summers. Our usual sunscreen (Goddess Garden Sunscreen) has gone down in rating on the EWG website which is why we went for the Burnout instead.&lt;br /&gt;This was probably the worst mistake ever and a complete waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;~the product did not work and the whole family got a terrible sunburn - and this has never happened with any other product before&lt;br /&gt;~it is really thick, sticky and pasty which makes it damn near impossible to apply/rub in&lt;br /&gt;~makes you feel sticky icky all day&lt;br /&gt;~stinks horribly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and go with a different product, especially if you have little children and are planning on having them use this product. There are other products with good ratings on EWG which are reasonably priced and they actually work!</li>
            <li> Used this sunscreen for the first time over 2 weeks surfing in El Salvador.  I never got burned once and it blends into your skin with only a touch of whiteness from the zinc.  Recommended!</li>
            <li> Used this in Mexico as you can only use a few formulations to go into Cenotes. for the one we went to, sunscreen was not checked, but I&#x27;ve heard that at many, they check and regular brands are excluded as they might harm the cenotes. This product got us in the door, which is the nicest thing I can say about it. The formulation was partially separated on arrival, and was greasy. We did not get burned, bus also did not spend a huge amount of time in the sun. For beach days, we used regular sunscreen that we brought along.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible sunscreen. It is not melting in into your skin but leaves thick white mask. Can you imagine to put make up over that mess? I put some sunscreen and waited over one hour it was still like a white glue, absolutely disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;It is maybe OK for use on your hands. But it is not what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Seller is fast and reliable, this is review only for the sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too thick, slightly greasy and leaves a whitish/bluish film behind.  My skin still turned slightly pink if I was in the sun for more than an hour with it on.</li>
            <li> This is very thick and goes on white.  It is hard to rub in.  I don&#x27;t think I would repurchase this sunscreen.  I do like the fact that it is physical only.</li>
            <li> I recently started using the Burnout Ocean Sunscrean and I like it.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my face white nor greasy.  I just get little by litlle (the size of a rain drop) on the tip of my finger and I start rubbing it on my face sections by section.  Let say that I start on my right side of my forehead and then I move to the upper and lower cheeks. The reason I do this is because it is kind of thick and dries quickly.  Right after my sunscreen, I put on my make up and I am ready to go. Now I will like to find a safe (ingredients base) and good face cleaner. Any recommendations are welcome.</li>
            <li> This seller needs to get his facts straight since the product description is misleading, check out Burnout Website for the ingredients. Burnout&#x27;s Ocean Tested mix has some organic ingredients but this is not an acceptable mix although it offers higher ZO than their best selling mix which has 18.9% ZO and selling for almost twice as this Ocean Tested mix on Amzon.  Burnout does not specify certified organic or the percentage of organic in their mix but certainly dumps a lot of ingredients in the mix. I make my own sunscreen but for times when I do not, I need the same formula as I use in my organic sunscreen mix with fewer ingredients. Zinc is what you see surfers put on their nose for protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active Ingredients: Zinc Oxide (non-nano) 20%&lt;br /&gt;Other Ingredients: Purified Water, Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice*, Capric/ Caprylic Triglycerides, Sorbitan Stearate, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Cetyl Dimethicone, Magnesium Sulfate, Organic Avocado Oil*, Virgin Hemp Seed Oil, Organic Cucumber Extract*, Organic Green Tea Extract*, Tocopherols, Organic Pomegranate Juice*, Helionori, Hyaluronic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydrogenated Methyl Abiate, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zinc Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light. Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks. ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions. Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts. ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream. If the sun reddens unprotected skin in ten minutes, for example, a person wearing SPF15 can be exposed to the sun without reddening for 15 times longer - 150 minutes. While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn, UVA rays damage the skin&#x27;s DNA at a deeper layer. Both radiation types can cause skin cancer. The EU recommendation is for sunscreens to offer a UVA protection factor that is a third of their SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BABO has 22% ZO which is not organic but conventional even with higher amount of ZO than organic brand like BADGER with 18.5% ZO but ZO is not the only ingredient in BABO so there are few issues with BABO formula. ZO is like mud, the higher, the better but ZO stays on the surface of the skin for protection so for many, high ZO will not work since it will be too heavy. For a small investment, sunscreens may offer me the possibility of avoiding sun burn, pain, cancer, medical bills, pain killers, etc. that come with exposure to the sun. For that reason, choosing a formula with the least amount of ingredients but high ZO is the best solution so one needs to read the ZO percentage as well as the rest of the ingredient, since it is the whole mix which counts not the high percentage of ZO only. A good sunscreen formula should not have more than a handful ingredients, at least 95% certified organic, protect skin from sun, with no gums, no thickening agents, no perfumes, no alcohol, no restricted ingredients by any other countries, no chemicals, no additives and no softeners.ple, a person wearing SPF15 can be exposed to the sun without reddening for 15 times longer - 150 minutes.

            <li> Ouch! So sunburned! I am incredibly disappointed in this product. I was a believer in burnout in its early days - developed at the university in my hometown, recommended by our local dermatologist for us little junior lifeguard sunworshippers. I bought this many years later, but was a little wary having read the reviews. I bought three anyway. My husband and I had a weekend getaway and used an entire tube in one beach day (to give you an idea of how much we reapply... We are no sunscreen rookies... And a couple haoles...) we were burnt to a crisp from less than 3 hours in the sun with reapplication! To boot, the sunscreen is super thick and leaves you looking purple. On the market again for an eco friendly non toxic screen to protect us.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen Worked like a charm surfing in Costa Rica - waterproof, excellent protection - we never burned. I highly recommend this product to others!</li>
            <li> It is super thick and stays exactly where you put it. Very water-proof. After swimming/surfing in ocean (salt-water and waves), it remains intact. I was impressed by that. I wish I could afford to use it on entire body. It leaves a white cast even when rubbed in good. But it is great sun protection</li>
            <li> I applied this before going out on a 10 mile bike ride and I never burned.  Didn&#x27;t really tan either and that is okay.  I&#x27;ve had cancer before and was looking for a fantastic healthy product.  I finally found it.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Product worked great! Definitely be aware that this is a sunblock that really needs to be rubbed in.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different mineral based sunblocks on my kids (they both have sensitive skin and usually complain that sunblock \\&quot;burns\\&quot; their skin)This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that is easy to put on - all of the other products I&#x27;ve tried are very thick and leave a white film on the skin.  We love this sunscreen and I&#x27;m so glad to find it on amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s so I wanted something emollient.  I was using Burnout for Kids and it was too matte on me.  I wanted to look dewy so thought this one would help.  It&#x27;s super greasy going on and does make me look shiny, which I like.  It&#x27;s actually too slick, my makeup doesn&#x27;t stick to my face as well.  It goes on clear just like the Kids version so in that sense it&#x27;s great.  I&#x27;ve been using it probably two months and it&#x27;s drying out my skin say more than the kids version did.  So today I purchased the Kids version again, I\\&quot;m switching back.  This is supposed to be moisturizing but it is not.</li>
            <li> I researched online looking for safe sunscreen products.  This got a high rating on EWG last year.  This sunscreen met those requirements because it has zinc oxide in non-nano particles and it is ocean safe.  It goes on smooothly and I can even apply it to my face.</li>
