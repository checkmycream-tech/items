            <li>Nice strong hold</li>
            <li>I still use it as I have found nothing better...</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I am really satisfied</li>
            <li>Need I say more.</li>
            <li>this gives good look to the hair, and do not let so stiff or brilliant as the gel.</li>
            <li>nice consistency and right amount of hold</li>
            <li>After my sister strongly recommended it, I gave it a shot.  </li>
            <li>to rinse out of hair&lt;br /&gt;Smell is fine and does NOT stink at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looking for smooth hair and</li>
            <li>It also has a nice scent when you put it on, kind of herbal, but doesn&#x27;t smell later.</li>
            <li>I have short straight hair, needing always something to put my hair in the perfect place.</li>
            <li>Pricey but worth it!</li>
            <li>This is hands-down the very best sculpting past I&#x27;ve came across.</li>
            <li>Really like the way my hair looks natural and looking great.</li>
            <li>Definitely the best sculpting paste I&#x27;ve ever used on my fine but think short hair.</li>
            <li>Item was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>i was looking for a sculpting fibre paste that had the following characteristics: has good &amp;quot;sculpting power&amp;quot;, does not look greasy or water-down, is easy to spread and has a minimal but nice smell...then go for it.</li>
            <li>This is my second jar of this amazing product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Product is very susceptible to water; a light rain without an umbrella will loosen the hold</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this product is amazing and I will continue to use it in the future.</li>
            <li>albeit the price is about 3 times more assuming the same amount of product, but it works much better and fulfills 100% of my wants in a sculpting paste.</li>
            <li>Not a rigid hold, just the right hold.</li>
            <li>Gave it four stars only because of the price, but the quality is definitely there; it smells great all day and does not cause flakes at all.</li>
            <li>I first tried this gel when I got a haircut at a &#x27;salon&#x27; while on vacation in FL...</li>
            <li>First off, this thing is a bit pricey IMO.&lt;br /&gt;Second</li>
            <li>my hair will remain the same for many hours.</li>
            <li>It gives strong enough of a hold but doesn&#x27;t feel like a helmet on your head.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li>I have superfine hair, so all my life (42 years)I had to use tons of product just to hold it in place throughout the day without it looking frizzy, even then it would barely last until 5 PM.  </li>
            <li>it does not work well  in really hot/humid conditions, but I don&#x27;t know of anything that really does.</li>
            <li>I never would have thought about using sculpting paste on hair which is very curly and close to shoulder length.  </li>
            <li>I have a trendy haircut and like to do the messy look.</li>
            <li>Works better than any other Pomade I have tried, including that &amp;#34;Sauvecito&amp;#34; garbage.</li>
            <li>The scent is sweet and subtle, unlike most sculpting pastes which tend to smell like burnt plastic.  </li>
            <li>A small amount rubbed throughout gives the ability to make quick and easy hair styles in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li>This sculpting fiber holds up with minimal stickiness and a fantastic scent.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price, and I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this product again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the first jar for over and year and still have some left.  </li>
            <li>I use this stuff and not only does it hold my hair in place, but my hair feels natural and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.</li>

            <li> A little bit of this product will keep your hair looking neat with a matte look; a little bit more will lock your hair into place with a subtle shine for a long lasting well-groomed look.  </li>

            <li> It gives the curls definition without weighing them down or making my hair stiff or greasy.</li>
            <li> Also, though it appears to be expensive, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I have fairly thick hair which causes problems for our gels, etc.</li>
            <li> Now the product is very weak and almost unusable for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nearly impossible to find in stores, so I buy a couple of tubs on Amazon at a time.</li>
            <li> Number 2 was not that bad, but I was waiting for 3 Sculpte not for 2 Sculpte.</li>

            <li> I ordered number 3 and I got number 2!!!! Number 2 was not that bad, but I was waiting for 3 Sculpte not for 2 Sculpte.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product! Provides great hold without being sticky or greasy. He won&#x27;t use anything else on his hair.</li>
            <li> Such a good product by L&#x27;Oreal, ideal for all kind of hairstyles. Recomended 100% of a customer that use it from Colombia.</li>
            <li> The paste works great and smells great. It gives strong enough of a hold but doesn&#x27;t feel like a helmet on your head.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my hubby and he loves it! He said it&#x27;s the only hair gel that really holds his hair in place without being too stiff! Pricey but worth it!</li>
            <li> I have a trendy haircut and like to do the messy look.

You can use it with your hair dry or wet and it holds all day long. Not a rigid hold, just the right hold. Give this a try</li>
            <li> Product works great and came on time.</li>
            <li> This is my second jar of this amazing product.  I&#x27;ve had the first jar for over and year and still have some left.  This is not greasy in the hair and can be used on the hair a second day with no build up.  Definitely the best sculpting paste I&#x27;ve ever used on my fine but think short hair.</li>
            <li> All is good have not used it yet</li>
            <li> This sculpting fiber holds up with minimal stickiness and a fantastic scent.

            <li> They watered down the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I ordered it, it was perfect. Nice strong hold and it lasted me almost 2 years. Now the product is very weak and almost unusable for me. It&#x27;s a shame I really liked it..</li>
            <li> Gave it four stars only because of the price, but the quality is definitely there; it smells great all day and does not cause flakes at all. Looking for smooth hair and great looks this is it</li>
            <li> Really like the way my hair looks natural and looking great.</li>
            <li> i like this styling product. nice consistency and right amount of hold</li>
            <li> I first tried this gel when I got a haircut at a &#x27;salon&#x27; while on vacation in FL...I still use it as I have found nothing better...it&#x27;s a great product for guys and the smell is fine...</li>
            <li> Smells good. Too gooey for my taste/hair.</li>
            <li> My barber introduced this to me.  Amazing product.</li>
            <li> I have superfine hair, so all my life (42 years)I had to use tons of product just to hold it in place throughout the day without it looking frizzy, even then it would barely last until 5 PM.  The stuff before this was TXT by L&#x27;Oreal and it did a good job of holding it in place, but it was just so sticky you wouldn&#x27;t dare touch my hair.  My girlfriend definitely wouldn&#x27;t want to run her fingers through my hair.  I use this stuff and not only does it hold my hair in place, but my hair feels natural and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky. It also holds through the night, doesn&#x27;t start letting loose like everything else that I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m tempted to buy 100 of these in case they ever stop making it. I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> This stuff provides a great hold, but isn&#x27;t visible. Also, though it appears to be expensive, a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s nearly impossible to find in stores, so I buy a couple of tubs on Amazon at a time. It also has a nice scent when you put it on, kind of herbal, but doesn&#x27;t smell later.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied, everything was correct, times, delivery, etc.&lt;br /&gt;The product is awesome. I am really satisfied and I can recommend it.</li>
            <li> i was looking for a sculpting fibre paste that had the following characteristics: has good &amp;quot;sculpting power&amp;quot;, does not look greasy or water-down, is easy to spread and has a minimal but nice smell...then go for it. the only con - it&#x27;s a bit pricey but this jar goes a loooong way.</li>
            <li> The best gel/was for your hair!</li>
            <li> Every time I open this, I want to use it as lotion.  I can&#x27;t get enough of the smell!  Must be why it&#x27;s unisex, as I try to get my husband to use it whenever possible...it makes me want to be CLOSE to him.  Need I say more.</li>
            <li> Great product for fine hair to give lift.  Only draw back it does not work well  in really hot/humid conditions, but I don&#x27;t know of anything that really does. Have used the product for years and will continue to due so.</li>
            <li> I never would have thought about using sculpting paste on hair which is very curly and close to shoulder length.  After my sister strongly recommended it, I gave it a shot.  Who would have guessed, it works wonderfully on long curly hair!  It gives the curls definition without weighing them down or making my hair stiff or greasy.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily in my hair. A small amount rubbed throughout gives the ability to make quick and easy hair styles in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Plus all the compliments from the ladies on campus doesn&#x27;t hurt either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;Rinses from hands without soap&lt;br /&gt;24-hour hold&lt;br /&gt;Easy to rinse out of hair&lt;br /&gt;Smell is fine and does NOT stink at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Product is very susceptible to water; a light rain without an umbrella will loosen the hold completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product is amazing and I will continue to use it in the future.</li>
            <li> First off, this thing is a bit pricey IMO.&lt;br /&gt;Second - The product must be imported, because only the ingredients list is in English, the rest is in 4 European languages.&lt;br /&gt;Third - This has the perfect amount of &amp;#34;wet-look&amp;#34; + hold + ease of application + smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my previous hair application has been discontinued everywhere (suave paste) I this is the perfect replacement, albeit the price is about 3 times more assuming the same amount of product, but it works much better and fulfills 100% of my wants in a sculpting paste.</li>
            <li> I have short straight hair, needing always something to put my hair in the perfect place. this gives good look to the hair, and do not let so stiff or brilliant as the gel. my hair will remain the same for many hours.</li>
