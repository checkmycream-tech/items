    <ol>
            <li> I was a bit scared to get this item at first because there was barely any review on it, but I bought it and I am in love with it. It was expected to come April 14th and it came a week early. The thing that I did not like about this item is that I had to take pliers and pinch the pieces that hold the flowers together. I only did this because it was constantly ahold of my hair and it would pull terribly when I would take it out at the end of the day. Other than that it is great!</li>
            <li> These are amazing!  I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li> too tight! and I have a small head, get caught in your hair and is a pain to get out.</li>
            <li> Flowers are much smaller than pictured. praying they hold up for my bridesmaids to get thru wedding.</li>
            <li> Headband is kinda tight but not unbearable. Dresses up outfits-super cute.</li>
            <li> pretty roses , dainty hair piece</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very uncomfortable, doesn&#x27;t hold well on the hair.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and does get lost in my hair</li>
            <li> Headband as expected.  Beautiful as pictured.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous band.....love love love it!</li>
            <li> When I tried  on the  product  it broke !  So I&#x27;m really  disappointed . ...</li>
            <li> Did not provide tracking number.</li>
            <li> Good product...just what I thought. Took a longer time to get to Canada than expected. Took 1 month. I assume it got stuck in customs somewhere. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t even fit on my head. Cheap. You get what you pay for of course.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great if you only want to wear it once. The &amp;#34;metal&amp;#34; fades and/or turns some funky color after that.  Reminds me of those cheap fake gold necklaces that turned peoples necks green.</li>
            <li> Broke first day i got it. :(</li>
            <li> Not flexible and broke when I put it on</li>
            <li> Was broken on article do not buy!</li>
