            <li> Strange looking tool...</li>
            <li> Long answer.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s white head extractors, black head extractors, there&#x27;s pimple extractors and a pointy end to help you pop those stubborn pimples.</li>
            <li> It is hard not to notice it when these tools are meant to be held near your face.</li>
            <li> Does not really work as well as advertised</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it made such a difference</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re excited and ready to get rid of the nasty junk in your pores</li>
            <li> Once I got used to the tools I finally got rid of those hard to see blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li> I believe at least some basic instruction should come with them from the jump.</li>
            <li> Removing black heads was a breeze for him.</li>
            <li> This little set is makes me feel like I get a lot for my money.</li>
            <li> This little tool set is a must for clearer skin.</li>
            <li> Heavy weight and sturdy.</li>
            <li> So super annoying.</li>
            <li> Truthfully, i&#x27;m not sure how to use it.</li>
            <li> I usually just pinch or pick them out with my fingernails and then, yep, you guessed it</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t keep the junk in my pores from coming back, but that&#x27;s not the tools fault.</li>
            <li> But at least I can continue my habit and not damage my skin.</li>
            <li> Very useful when trying to get rid of pesky blemishes and does not make ur skin scar or look horrible.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this for my dad who get nasty black heads on his face and neck.</li>
            <li> Blackheads are even worse.</li>
            <li> and I have even left horrible scratches on my face that takes weeks and weeks to heal.</li>
            <li> I hate HATE those stupid little white goopy things that build up under the skin and around the eyes.</li>
            <li> I have a bad habit of using my nails/fingers to squeeze out the junk in the pores on my nose.</li>
            <li> I get painful bumps on the side of my face, this helps to not leave marks.</li>
            <li> Boy, do I wish I had had these tools when I was a teenager with horrible, humiliating, painful acne!  </li>
            <li> its a horrible cycle</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I actually purchased this for my dad who get nasty black heads on his face and neck. These tools rock! Removing black heads was a breeze for him.</li>
            <li> These are useful tools. I have the occasional blackhead or whitehead. I was able to get them out with these tools, where I couldn&#x27;t with just pressing with my fingers. Especially on the sides of my nose in the creases. Good to have this kit!  It&#x27;s important to follow the guidelines. Get the skin nice and hydrated and warmed up. Thanks for a good product! The choice of sizes are great too.</li>
            <li> I get painful bumps on the side of my face, this helps to not leave marks.</li>
            <li> This is a very helpful product. All the tools to handle any problem on your face with out damaging it.</li>
            <li> Didnt think I needed this, but has been very handy :)  The seller includes instructions which come in very helpful.</li>
            <li> The downloadable directions were simple and worth reading. Using the rocking motioned recommended with the tools really worked great.  I mostly had blackheads to treat.  The tools worked efficiently and did not damage the skin or cause any bleeding that using fingernails cause.  Even very tiny blackheads can be removed easily.  The blemish removers are sturdy and easy to clean also. Having the whole set gives a nice choice of sizes and shapes to fit the area you are treating. I am recommending this product to my daughter.</li>
            <li> These are well made. What i really dislike about them is the smell. They smell like metal. It is hard not to notice it when these tools are meant to be held near your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these types of comedone extracters in the past but never had much luck. I love this set because it has a different type of extracter for all different kinds of blemishes. My son is a teenager and is battling blackheads. I have tried to help him extract them before but this kit has been excellent. I was able to get a discount on this kit in exchange for an honest review. They are all good but I took a picture of one that I think works the best. You can see from the photo they&#x27;re good quality and this is a really great deal because you get 6 different types of extracters.</li>
            <li> Does not really work as well as advertised</li>
            <li> Very useful when trying to get rid of pesky blemishes and does not make ur skin scar or look horrible.</li>
            <li> Tools work great! Customer service is beyond greatand Fast shipping to boot!</li>
            <li> Strange looking tool...but my daughter seems to like it</li>
            <li> My teenage son loves this item!  I love the fact that these are stainless steel as well.  The set includes 3 double ended tools for a total of 6 different shaped or sized heads. The Blackhead &amp; Blemish Removers by Zap Zit makes for a safe and effective way to remove blackheads, whiteheads and pimples with less chance of infection from using your fingers. Great for anyone with a pimple or blackhead issue.  I received this product during a promotion and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> So far it seems to do the trick. Just as described</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li> Package shipped extremely fast. The tools came with a how -to booklet and very helpful instructional videos. Once I got used to the tools I finally got rid of those hard to see blackheads on my nose.I would strongly recommend it for anyone who suffers with acne, it Wil clear your skin right up! Great product!!!</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipment</li>
            <li> Truthfully, i&#x27;m not sure how to use it. I will keep trying though. I wish there was a video I could watch.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter recommend I buy this so instead of going to the Dermatologist this would be a much cheaper option.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for asking!</li>
            <li> They work! and they&#x27;re high quality that will last a lifetime. These are the first blemish tools I&#x27;ve tried, and they sure beat popping pimples the old fashioned way. I would recommend these to anyone needing blemish tools.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with the product.I looked into these items after receiving a facial from the spa, I asked what tool they were using and she led me to this product. I tried each one out they didn&#x27;t seem to work very well on my face, I guess they just work for me haven&#x27;t used them since I tried them out.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and seems to do the job.  I like having a variety of extractors to work with for different comedones.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality! Customer service contacted me to be sure that I was pleased with the product and they were extremely nice!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for some of these little guys but wasnt sure what to buy. After being offered to get this set at a discounted price in exchange of an honest review I jumped on the deal. It turns out this set has three tools all with different end that serve different functions for different tasks. There&#x27;s white head extractors, black head extractors, there&#x27;s pimple extractors and a pointy end to help you pop those stubborn pimples. It also comes with instructions which I thought was rather neat because let&#x27;s be honest we all have used these tools and never had real guidance. Once I ended up with a bruised chin for useing one of these tools incorrectly back when I was fourteen. This little set is makes me feel like I get a lot for my money.</li>
            <li> Love it! Fast responses from seller!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It (they) worked great to extract deep blackheads on the back and shoulders resulting from hard work in the yard.  Sometimes it takes a couple of days to work on really deep blackheads, but they do work great.</li>
            <li> Used in agriculture wound care.  Worked great. Easy to sterilize.  Heavy weight and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Wonderful and exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for!</li>
            <li> These are great and the book of information emailed to me help me to use these in the proper way.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a set of blemish remover tools for a while now and these are exactly what I was looking for! Love them!</li>
            <li> Great quality!  These are well worth the money.  They really work great! Wish I would&#x27;ve found these years ago!</li>
            <li> High quality- surgical grade stainless steal metal. Easy to use even by arthritic hands this is a great set. I hate HATE those stupid little white goopy things that build up under the skin and around the eyes. Blackheads are even worse. I usually just pinch or pick them out with my fingernails and then, yep, you guessed it, i get bruises and skin cuts and I have even left horrible scratches on my face that takes weeks and weeks to heal. So super annoying. Now this little set just makes the removal as easy or easier than brushing your teeth. Apply, press, pull and gone! Super easy to clean with soap water and alcohol. Always sterilize anything used on your face unless you want a skin infection. Easy to carry in your bag so you do not have to suffer the &amp;#34;it was not there this morning!&amp;#34; thing in the middle of the afternoon. Keep one in your desk, locker, heck - even the glove box! This little tool set is a must for clearer skin. I was offered a promotional discount in exchange for testing and leaving my honest and unbiased opinion of this product but I really loved that I did not have to worry about the danger of any side affects from prescription drugs. This is truly the all natural way to deal with any skin blemishes!</li>
            <li> When doing research on how to get rid of my clogged pores on my nose I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people mention tools like these, so when I was given the opportunity to try them out at a discount for an honest review I was excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First let me say while researching blemish removers I found a lot of people said it was important to use the tools properly. If not used properly it can cause scarring, bruising, and you won&#x27;t get the results you want. Although it says that you get a video that shows how to properly use the tools you have to go to the site thats given to you and request the video. When you&#x27;re excited and ready to get rid of the nasty junk in your pores there&#x27;s nothing more disappointing than realizing that you have to wait for the video to be emailed to you. That&#x27;s why I rated these as a 4 out of 5. I believe at least some basic instruction should come with them from the jump. I honestly don&#x27;t think most people are going to take the time to go to the website and request the video. But with a quick google search I was able to find some good video and tutorials online so that I knew some what what I was supposed to do. Just FYI although it may make sense to some for others sterilizing these tools before, during, and after use is important. I just used rubbing alcohol (what I read/saw online).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;did it work/will I use it again? Short answer yes. Long answer. I have a bad habit of using my nails/fingers to squeeze out the junk in the pores on my nose. And after I do, two -three days later because ive irritated the skin so much the skin on my nose starts to flake and peel. its a horrible cycle but I continue to do it anyway. I used the tool, making sure I used rubbing alcohol in between and I didn&#x27;t really have this problem. I&#x27;m not sure why it made such a difference but it did. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t keep the junk in my pores from coming back, but that&#x27;s not the tools fault. From my own research its a common thing and probably something that willnever go away. But at least I can continue my habit and not damage my skin.</li>
            <li> These tools work very well and are well made.  With all of the different sizes and styles, they are capable of handling anything.  They have a nice weight to them, and are grooved on the sides to make sure your hands do not slip.  They also provide you with a helpful guide on how to use them.  Overall, great product.</li>
            <li> They came quickly and work great!</li>
            <li> Boy, do I wish I had had these tools when I was a teenager with horrible, humiliating, painful acne!  These are very high quality, surgical grade stainless steel.  They are well made and have secure grips and good heft to them, giving one confidence when holding and using them.  The accompanying  literature and eBook are well written and clear.  The tips and the links to selected videos are very helpful.  NOTE:  Though the videos are quite graphic, and some might find the close-up shots of pimples being removed somewhat disturbing, it is very important to watch them to see exactly how to use the tools for maximum effectiveness.  Problem skin is a problem for boys and girls / men and women of all ages.  These tools, used with the  recommended warm compresses and cleanliness and patience, can help individuals of all ages.   Bravo, Thriving.  I strongly recommend to anyone who suffers with pimples and/or blackheads that you try these tools -- and encourage your loved ones to do the same.  They really do work, and the skin heals rapidly.</li>
