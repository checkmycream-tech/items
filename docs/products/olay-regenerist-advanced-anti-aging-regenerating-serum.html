            <li>Happy customer.</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because anything oil of olay produces is great for the skin</li>
            <li>This serum by Olay is another quality product at a great price.</li>
            <li>I began using the products 3 days ago and as for what I have experienced so far-&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>What I liked the best is it did not leave the feeling that I have oil or lotion on after I</li>
            <li>My skin looked and felt great.</li>
            <li>For the price this is a great product.</li>
            <li>Feels great on your face.....</li>
            <li>It feels great on the skin.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>But, I decided I wanted to tell you what I experienced.     </li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>But for spring and summer, it is great.  </li>
            <li>Have been using for years in conjunction with the Micro-Sculpting Cream and have had great results.</li>
            <li>Great price too.</li>
            <li>Great on your skin too</li>
            <li>but for now this does a great job minimizing the visible signs of aging.</li>
            <li>The night moisturizer is great too.</li>
            <li>The quality is great.</li>
            <li>It is a wonderful product and I especially love the&lt;br /&gt;idea of giving my neck area special treatment especially&lt;</li>
            <li>I love Regenerist!!</li>
            <li>feels very nice when putting on.</li>
            <li>That is always nice to hear!</li>
            <li>I got this product because I&#x27;ve been using Olay regenerist mosturizing cream successfully for four years.  </li>
            <li>Nice feeling too!</li>
            <li>This serum honestly, truly works!  </li>
            <li>Good product, pleasant scent and feel.</li>
            <li>As a moisuriser it does a good job.</li>
            <li>But to be fair, I still dont know what micro sculpting means...</li>
            <li>I do have fair, overly-sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The serum absorbs fairly well and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.  </li>
            <li>Good job.  </li>
            <li>Plus there seems to be a lot of hype about it being as good as department store brands......</li>
            <li>I am told by people that \\&quot;I look good for my age\\&quot; (30&#x27;s rather than 40&#x27;s)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always taken good care of it.</li>
            <li>-- what is Micro-sculpting--, but it does a good job of moisturizing my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have always taken good care of my skin but noticed wrinkled lines on both sides of my mouth area.  </li>
            <li>Light scent is great, too!</li>
            <li>Good seller.</li>
            <li>However, this serum is not as good as the olay regenerist micro-sculpting cream.</li>
            <li>Olay&#x27;s products work well and are a good value.</li>
            <li>Good product, recommended, by my dermatologist to help control rosecea.</li>
            <li>I bought it because it contains peptides, which is good for the skin.</li>
            <li>good product and a good buy.</li>
            <li>Really good product for my face.  </li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>The product arrived in good condition and in  timely manner.  </li>
            <li>I think it does a good job of hydrating</li>
            <li>olay always good.</li>
            <li>Smells good and causes no skin irritation.</li>
            <li>Olay product are good.</li>
            <li>Packing was also good.</li>
            <li>I put it on before going to bed, and I am delighted with the results.</li>
            <li>This is almost too good to be true but it is!!!  </li>
            <li>I love the play products as they&#x27;re a great price and do what they&#x27;re supposed to.</li>
            <li>I love the bottle and pump works great.</li>
            <li>so you can apply spf and moisturizer on top and it will still feel very nice.</li>
            <li>This serum has an agent that adds a mild glow to the skin and makes any complexion bright and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I love this serum!</li>
            <li>but I have noticed a change in the softness of my skin and appearance of brightness; It felt wonderful on my skin from the first moment I applied it.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>You will love it !</li>
            <li>This is one of the best and on top of that, it is ECONOMICAL!  </li>
            <li>Love this product as well as this price!</li>
            <li>But I do love this!</li>
            <li>Love the moisturizing effect this product produces without feeling or looking oily!</li>
            <li>The price was a fantastic deal &amp; the product is great &amp; I see results....</li>
            <li>I use this with the Regenerist cream and the two together are amazing.</li>
            <li>The Olay Regenerist serum has a really nice texture.</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely and spreads well.</li>
            <li>Is it a nice moisturizer, yes......</li>
            <li>I have been using it morning and night every day since it arrived, but I can honestly say I haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction in these wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it each time.</li>
            <li>Nice product.  </li>
            <li>it really does help my skin look great!</li>
            <li>It smells and feels nice, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I used it faithfully, morning and night, and I liked it.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make my skin break out and combined with a Mary Kay mask I&#x27;ve used week for ages, my skin looked nice.  </li>
            <li>It also smells nice, but did not make a noticeable difference for</li>
            <li>It even has a nice scent.  </li>
            <li>I put this on my more problem areas like eyes , neck, and forehead and then follow up with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have the monies to do your beauty fixes the better way, then Olay makes some good products.</li>
            <li>came promptly and packaged nicely.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum since 2010 and am thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>Nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li>Supposedly feels great and works to remove wrinkles, seems high to me, but whatever makes her happy.</li>
            <li>My mother, a true redhead whose gorgeous fair skin never saw the sun, was a faithful user of Merle Norman Cosmetics all her life</li>
            <li>The product has a pleasant \\&quot;spa\\&quot; like aroma to it and feels fine going on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase :)</li>
            <li>will continue to have it automatically sent to my home with is great price and quick service.</li>

            <li>She loves it very much and says it works great..</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very light</li>
            <li>The scent is light and very pleasant and the texture is really creamy and dreamy - and has a biit of a shimmery,silky look to it.&lt;br /&gt;Do</li>

            <li>It not only has a wonderful fragrance, but makes your face feel outstanding.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I decided to try the Olay Regenerist Micro Sculpting Serum instead of the cream.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just so glad to have a non-greasy, pimple free face!  </li>
            <li>What was even better, was</li>
            <li>In addition, the microderma kit is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Just make sure to moisturize after.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, not a miracle worker.</li>
            <li>I thought my skin feels better after using this product for about 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I love the weight, smell and feel of this product.  </li>
            <li>I Love it.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this because the price was lower than the department store brands.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any miraculous age-fighting effects; however it is a nice, light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Skin appeared smoother and more hydrated.</li>
            <li>I have noticed my skin is a bit raw/sensitive feeling (I notice it mostly during exercising/sweating or if I use a wash cloth across my face in the morning)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t be sure as of yet</li>
            <li>: Ok - it is now March</li>
            <li>It does moisturize well...and the areas look better with use, but</li>
            <li>It does moisturize well...and the areas look better with use, but</li>
            <li>Nice moisturizer keeps skin smooth all day</li>
            <li>Some have been better than others, but none have been like this.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the product</li>
            <li>I love using olay regenerist micro sculpting serum; it is not oily and helps make my face feel smoother.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li>So although the product concentrates on one attribute, tighter, firmer skin, and although the price is competitive, there are multi-tasking products that are a better value because of their added benefits.</li>
            <li>There are also products that worked better for me and didn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li>Like most skin-care products, this one promises more than it can deliver.</li>
            <li>Now my eyelids look plump and wrinkle free again!</li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>The bottle had serum leaking out from the sides of the top.  </li>
            <li>Brothers and Sisters, she helped me see the light!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles</li>
            <li>But I truly think this product has helped my skin look better.</li>
            <li>I was sure this would make my skin break out and besides, it cost more</li>
            <li>this product is the one that&#x27;s helped me the most.  </li>

            <li>this product is the one that&#x27;s helped me the most.  </li>
            <li>Love this as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using oil of olay for years and this is my favorite beside the regenerist serum.</li>

            <li>This is not a serum, but more of a cream.</li>
            <li>I have just got the product and cannot comment on many of the effects that it promises, but have bought many olay products</li>
            <li>and they all seem to help my skin do better vs. the loreal products.</li>
            <li>It is amazing for oily skin and makes my face smooth.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I feel it&#x27;s more hydrating than the serum.</li>
            <li>The serum versions are easier to absorb and I feel are more concentrated.</li>
            <li>I like the renerist serum better than this.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>The test is, did my wife buy more and the answer is yes.  </li>
            <li>And yes, like every product on the market they claim a lot more than they provide but still it does make your skin look more radiant.</li>

            <li>Love the application.  </li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>I re-read the box, and they said that most people would see improvement in 5 days.  </li>
            <li>I get lots of compliments on my skin and give most of the credit to the Olay products that I use.</li>
            <li>I love all the Olay products and also give them as gifts to family and friends.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years and love how it makes my skin feel.  </li>

            <li>Skin looks brighter, more radiant.  </li>

            <li>I love the Olay Regenerist cream.</li>

            <li>The product has a nice silky feel when I am applying it, and a light clean fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Let me begin by describing my skin, issues, and desired effects and what I have experienced so far.</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels... silky smooth and</li>
            <li>but so far im really happy with it</li>
            <li>Enjoyed this products ease of use and light fragrance.</li>
            <li>I figured anything with that much perfume couldn&#x27;t be good for my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s advertised to make skin significantly firmer and more radiant in just five days.</li>
            <li>I find it to go on easily.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel oily and is easy to apply twice a day.</li>
            <li>Delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this is the true search for the fountain of youth.  </li>
            <li>My wife uses this product daily and was very happy that I found it for such a good price on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>+ dollars, so this is a fine product that does what it purports to do--moisturize.</li>
            <li>As long as it has lasted, and with the results I have noticed, I think this is a good price and nice product, and would recommend that anyone with aging skin give it a try.</li>
            <li>It is fine if I put skin softner before I apply it.</li>
            <li>Works for me just fine.</li>
            <li>All the product by oil of oay there are really good, no grease , very soft with your skin, it works, I like thsprduct</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually impressed, and it makes me want to try the new Olay Professional RX series.</li>
            <li>Both are excellent, so it&#x27;s largely a matter of personal preference.</li>
            <li>I would see a huge difference but</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, feels light and has a light shimmer to it.</li>
            <li>It was B1B50% off with a coupon for free roller ball with purchase of two Olay moisturizer in the Sunday paper.  </li>
            <li>for light crows feet and laughter lines - nothing.</li>
            <li>During that time, my face and eyes felt no irritation and stayed smooth.  </li>
            <li>I just thought that since it was available to have her continue in her search for the \\&quot;fountain of</li>
            <li>I use Olay Definity at night, because it&#x27;s too light for my skin tone and makes me look ghostly in daylight, but it did nothing for my \\&quot;jowling\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It absorbs well and feels light when applied.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I have been a user of the Regenerist Daily Serum for years and thats a great product.</li>
            <li>While is goes on smoothly, I did not see a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Now as a serum, it doesn&#x27;t act as a make-up primer, or smooth anything.</li>
            <li>I only use Olay products and like all the others I use this one lives up to the Olay reputation of being great for my skin.  </li>
            <li>People have even complimented me on my smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Pricing seems to be in the available range so should sell well.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li>This is a great mosurizer, I have been using this olay and the total olay mosurizer for over 10 years.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel silky and my makeup goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li>This goes on smoothly and make up is a breeze to put over...</li>
            <li>Overall though it is a great product.</li>
            <li>The added bonus is that it&#x27;s fragrance free.</li>
            <li>skin feels moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get over that two simple products can do so much, but they have, and I&#x27;m very happy.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many and really didn&#x27;t think this worked any better than the rest.</li>
            <li>It does a wonderful job of keeping my skin soft, not tight.</li>
            <li>I am also going into a new career where I will be competing with recent college grads, so looking my best is important.</li>
            <li>Feels rich on the skin.</li>
            <li>It got here faster than the original estimated arrival date.  </li>
            <li>The first week using this line was phenomenal.</li>
            <li>You were supposed to put that underneath the original Micro-Sculpting Cream.  </li>
            <li>as it has for me.ere supposed to put that underneath the original Micro-Sculpting Cream.  </li>
            <li>Anyhow, I thought I will give it a try and searched for this online - as usual Amazon had the best price.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t come in the original box, but in an amazon brown box with plastic wrapped around the lid.</li>
            <li>I was satisfied with Olay 7-in-One for my face, so I tried the Regenerist Serum first on my neck.</li>
            <li>So far I am very pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li>After just 5 days, skin is significantly firmer.</li>
            <li>I was fortunate enough to inherit \\&quot;good skin</li>
            <li>and I use it at nights after I clean my face and remove all makeups.</li>
            <li>And I do like most of Olay&#x27;s face creams and lotions, with my favorite being Olay Complete SPF 30.</li>
            <li>So far I love it!</li>
            <li>I wound of buying this Olay micro-sculting serum because Costco offered a special of $20.00 off two Olay mosturizers and two of these Olay serums.  </li>
            <li>It works great around the eye to keep that fresher, minimal wrinkle look.</li>
            <li>Full disclosure:</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about them.</li>
            <li>The smell is so fresh I like it, glides smoothly without any greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>and i loved how it mixed with it.</li>
            <li>The pump provides just the right amount of serum and it blends in smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It is certain worth the price,  I love using it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it in conjunction with the other Olay products, I have used it with Murad and Dr. Brandt, but the results have been great.  </li>
            <li>After a week of using this product I saw tremendous changes - firm and bright skin!</li>
            <li>Not only that, but my skin looks much better, more like when I was 33 or so.</li>
            <li>Just a quick comment on this product.</li>
            <li>It was recommended by BubzBeauty as one of best serums out there -- even compared to the more expensive stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li>like that it absorbs quickly and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>, I wonder how many customers have the same experience , how many customers rapped off by them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does not leave a greasy feeling and that it did a good job of hydrating the skin all day long.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice and it goes on smoothly and makes your skin feel smooth but for me I have not really noticed a difference in</li>
            <li>very good,I love it very much.</li>
            <li>: I was most excited to try this product since it says \\&quot;Dermatologically  Tested, Non Comedogenic (won&#x27;t clog pores), Fast- Absorbing and Non Greasy.</li>
            <li>I have used many different high end products like this and this serum is hands down the best, and the price was fantastic on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This Serum, used together with the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream, is really working, better than products costing three times as much!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but a good product nonetheless when used regularly and consistently.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since tea allergy is not terribly common (although not as rare as you might think), most users should not have a problem with this.</li>
            <li>I  have very sensitive skin and many \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products</li>
            <li>and for the first time in my life--wrinkles!</li>
            <li>nothing dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;Since I did want to find something that wouldn&#x27;t break my face out and would help reverse time - I bought a facial cream and under eye cream by Patricia Wexler(Bath and Body Works) - LOVE it!</li>
            <li>nothing dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;Since I did want to find something that wouldn&#x27;t break my face out and would help reverse time - I bought a facial cream and under eye cream by Patricia Wexler(Bath and Body Works) - LOVE it!</li>
            <li>A quick add-on is that during my time using this serum religiously morning and evening I have noticed fine wrinkles around my eye area and the serum didn&#x27;t combat them in any way or make them better.</li>
            <li>It was slightly strong and the actual scent wasn&#x27;t too appealing.  </li>
            <li>Super light and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>product goes on smoothly, is pleasant enough to deal with, and, in comparison to some department store brands and cosmoceuticals, is quite reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>They taught me a lot about make-up and layering in very light layers which promotes the natural look.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs so quickly that you can put makeup on right away.</li>
            <li>After going through one bottle, I noticed that there was a noticeable difference in the reduction of fine lines especially near the eye area.  </li>
            <li>So maybe I really can&#x27;t make this fine a judgment call, and shouldn&#x27;t be reviewing this product now, or at all.  </li>
            <li>impressed with the product tough</li>
            <li>This is one of the better products out there - Olay Regenerist Micro-sculpting serum won&#x27;t reverse time, but it certainly helps my skin look and feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Am thrilled that Olay has come up with a similar product in a serum,pump bottle formula.  </li>
            <li>However, as it stands now, the product simply isn&#x27;t worth trying again to see if can deliver as promised.</li>
            <li>I am 44 years of age with fair skin that would be classified as combination which is both sensitive and adult acne</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel the benefit is worth the cost</li>
            <li>I tend to stay with chemicals as much as possible and this product appeared to have a nice mix of the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good luck to anyone who tries it</li>
            <li>Good luck to anyone who tries it</li>
            <li>Even using the serum at that rate, the bottle feels as if it might have another month&#x27;s worth of product in it.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s all in my mind, but I can tell a nice difference in my wrinkles when I use this regularly.</li>
            <li>For the price, it is worth using.</li>
            <li>I liked the feel and lightness of Regenerist, but there is something in this that makes me itch and my face red.  </li>
            <li>still dont get any problems for any olay products so far for many years i buy and use them.</li>
            <li>I would also recommend using Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Age Moisture Cream along with the serum to keep the areas around the eyes, mouth, and neck area to have smooth, soft touchable skin.</li>
            <li>serum is pretty lightweight and soaks in quickly.  </li>
            <li>I deleted my first review because I reviewed too quickly.</li>
            <li>Good product, like any other Olay product</li>
            <li>After one month&#x27;s use, I noticed a plugged pore on my right cheek.  </li>
            <li>, I assume that&#x27;s the right thing to do, and she tells me over and over that she wouldn&#x27;t go a day without</li>
            <li>This product just wasn&#x27;t right for me.</li>
            <li>After using the full contents of the bottle my wife claims that the cream made here face feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This fast absorbing, non-greasy formula provides specially designed hydration to give you significantly firmer skin and regenerate skin&#x27;s appearance.</li>
            <li>After the first application, the skin around my laugh lines and forehead wrinkles plumped up making my skin look swollen, like tire tread.</li>
            <li>Since I have been using this and other Olay products, I have been complemented on how beautiful my skin was and that I didn&#x27;t look like I was 64 yrs old.</li>
            <li>It has a soft feel and spreads easily.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so light and soft!</li>
            <li>It absorbs well, and almost right away after applying it, I notice a \\&quot;plumping\\&quot; effect that makes my skin&#x27;s texture smoother and more regular.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I have some redness due to sun damage over the years ( I am very fair skinned with blond hair, blue eyes)</li>
            <li>My mama likes it very much</li>
            <li>Very comparable to items with much higher price tags!</li>
            <li>like I was 10 years younger or more.</li>
            <li>It pretty well works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>On the first application my skin was smother glowing and visibly.younger.</li>
            <li>Skin is left with a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>I plan to begin using as the directions instruct and apply these 2 products together; first applying the serum and topping off with the cream.</li>
            <li>When I first began using it on my face, I used it a week or so before adding the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much under my eye, what I was getting worried about was the droopiness of the skin under my eyebrow, it was encroaching on my eye lid!    </li>
            <li>I am so stunned that this really works that I keep looking in the mirror!  </li>
            <li>I think my first moisturizer was made by Clinique and from there, I just kept trying others.  </li>
            <li>The Micro-Sculpting Cream was the first to come out in that line, I believe.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it is worthwhile product.  </li>
            <li>Nice price and product as expected.</li>
            <li>My skin seems so much smoother with noticeable reduction in the appearance of wrinkles!  </li>
            <li>Too soon to give a full review , only o e month of use , but so far so good for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Olay is my favorite and I have tried various products.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite for in the morning especially.</li>
            <li>but by the 7th morning it was undeniable and even more than the 3rd morning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First review for me.</li>
            <li>I personally like the micro sculpting cream better.</li>
            <li>I put this on under my moisturizer/spf and it just makes my skin really smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I am a regular user of most all Olay products.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Olay!</li>
            <li>Would rate it higher but there is a fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I spend time with research on facial care which is affordable and rates among the top for my skin type.  </li>
            <li>Not overly sensitive, I have had many facials, microdermabrasions and chemical peels with normal reactions.  </li>
            <li>Instantly skin is hydrated and plumped for a more lifted appearance.</li>
            <li>while I have a few brown sun spots and some wrinkles, my skin looks really good.</li>
            <li>while I have a few brown sun spots and some wrinkles, my skin looks really good.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this product and would be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>Of course, we will never be 18 again, so enjoy life and accept the little things that make you look better.</li>
            <li>I starting seeing a real difference in the first couple weeks and over time it just gets better.</li>
            <li>genes\\&quot; from my mother, so my skin looks a good ten years younger than it is.  </li>
            <li>The dates on product are mostly good and one or two might be questionable but I am hoping they work okay.</li>
            <li>I was able to use the product for 3 or 4 weeks without a problem except that my skin was more sensitive to the sun than it was with another product (a moisturizer which contained a little sunscreen).</li>
            <li>I have seen positive changes in my skin.</li>
            <li>The other day, a co-worker actually told me my skin looked great.  </li>
            <li>I used it for three times that long before I could see any difference, and that was just that the skin seemed more hydrated.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak to how this product would work for long term use, but I would recommend it if you are looking for softer, more supple skin.  </li>
            <li>I may update when I get through the whole bottle, but generally changes take a long time to see any effect, but thus far I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li>My skin type is dry skin, this product gave me irritation and gets more dryer if I it as the direction of this product on package.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not a dramatic difference...</li>
            <li>By the way, aluminum starch is listed as an ingredient and that doesn&#x27;t sound like something you want to use in large quantities although it is considered safe in small amounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looks like it&#x27;s actually helping my fine lines and the firmness of some areas in my face.</li>
            <li>Luckily, my Retin-A took care of those right away, but I did continue to break out with acne such as I had never, ever had in my life.  </li>
            <li>I used the micro-sculpting serum for a little over a month and honestly didn&#x27;t see much of an impact.</li>
            <li>After almost two months of use, I awoke one morning to find three HUGE red acne bulges on my cheeks and two on my forehead</li>
            <li>It is really light and non-greasy, while providing me with just enough moisture and smoothness for my oily face.</li>
            <li>I do suggest you use the serum and the cream together as Olay suggests; results come much faster.</li>
            <li>It is non-irritating and left my skin smooth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really amazed.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve found that using a tongue depressor to remove product from the jar works well, it&#x27;s so much easier to dispense it from a pump bottle.  </li>
            <li>Only this one has fragrance, I do prefer fragrance free.</li>
            <li>I may visit them very soon.  </li>
            <li>The lines on my forehead really bother me, and it has seemed to make a difference with them</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant to try this product.</li>
            <li>my age, I never figure too much will help -</li>
            <li>but I can give this a two thumbs up and a high recommendation!</li>
            <li>: I really like the wash.</li>
            <li>It does have a very noticeable scent -</li>
            <li>This is the product I was very nervous about trying since it said nothing about being Non-Comedogenic.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really seen a change...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really seen a change...</li>
            <li>But the Micro Sculpting does not Sculpt, its doesnt really do anything.</li>
            <li>So I decided to try the serum instead and while it didnt cause breakouts, it also didnt do much of anything.</li>
            <li>Cannot really recommend this product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this serum for almost a month now, and really like what it does for my skin.</li>
            <li>What I can say is that this product is a real keeper.</li>
            <li>and it really has helped hydrate my skin.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product..</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The combination didn&#x27;t really made a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>The combination didn&#x27;t really made a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I have to say, that I have not noticed much of a difference in either the appearance or texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li>That said, it did not do much for me.  </li>
            <li>It claims to be fast absorbing, and non-greasy, and to give a user younger-looking skin, without drastic measures, within just five days.</li>
            <li>not the real thing</li>
            <li>and I really like them.  </li>
            <li>and they are very affordable.  </li>
            <li>&quot;  Thanks to Olay, it is.  </li>
            <li>I have used Olay and L&#x27;Oreal products my whole life since I was working in a drugstore and took a seminar/education course on beautification offered by another product.</li>
            <li>But during the day, using the serum, moisturizer, and my foundation all together was just too much.</li>
            <li>Still looking for a product that really has an effect on my skin but haven’t found it yet.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this now for the past couple of weeks and am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Ladies, if you&#x27;re on the fence and this review is the one you&#x27;re reading, she absolutely recommends it.</li>
            <li>It instantly makes your skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li>I really question about the quality of this</li>
            <li>I really like Olay products.  </li>
            <li>I have no wrinkles or real issues.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>This really makes a difference.  </li>
            <li>this thing really works.  </li>
            <li>This really works for me</li>
            <li>I really want to like this serum.</li>
            <li>When I use it, it makes my skin feel lovely and soft, but the reason I bought it was to hopefully reduce wrinkles especially around my eye and mouth area.</li>
            <li>My skin looks far younger than most people my age.</li>
            <li>but when I stopped using it for a couple of days, my skin returned to its former wrinkly self pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>It claims that it will provide extra hydration for the skin to make it significantly firmer looking and regenerate its appearance.  </li>
            <li>As a fan of the original Micro-sculpting cream I found this version to be lightweight but still with enough power.  </li>
            <li>The first morning I woke up, my neck seemed to look a little better (this product promises firming by the 5th day).</li>
            <li>That means with each use your skin is treated to a helpful amount of cell-communicating ingredient niacinamide, skin-identical glycerin, and a cadre of other anti-aging ingredients, including peptides, antioxidants, and more cell-communicating ingredients.</li>
            <li>But really, it&#x27;s quite good and doesn&#x27;t need to rely on absurd claims to be a worthy product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 51 and for a long time looked way younger than my true age, but all of a sudden time started catching up with me.</li>
            <li>and I want to prevent any further wrinkles, also I added this around my eyes and I liked the way my eyes weren&#x27;t puffy or didn&#x27;t have dark circles like usual so with my eyes i loved it.</li>
            <li>My friends and colleagues all asked if I have been doing some special beauty treatment such as laser, peal etc.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have dry skin, so any moisteriser is usually fine.</li>
            <li>Not sure I&#x27;ll be reversing the hands of time with this, but I like the fact that it&#x27;s not greasy and goopy and seems to texturize my skin nicely.</li>
            <li>It seems to be lightening the dark spots better than anything else I have used</li>
            <li>but it is not any better or worse for fine lines than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to certain ingredients in products.  </li>
            <li>There was new puffiness UNDER the bags under my eyes, plus wrinkly sagging on my cheekbones that had never been there before!</li>
            <li>And my neck had NEW wrinkles on it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say, from my personal experience, it is a nice moisturizer, but I am not willing to pay this much for a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Suspicious, I looked inside the bottle and more than half the bottle was gone.</li>
            <li>but I won&#x27;t be purchasing this particular serum again.</li>
            <li>The bottle is actually a decent size - almost two ounces, so while it&#x27;s pricey, it lasts a while.    </li>
            <li>This particular skin product also comes to my house enthusiastically spoken of by some friends and</li>
            <li>The Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum is decent product for the money.  </li>
            <li>This is the first wrinkle product that I have used that I can honestly say shows actual results in a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t particularly noticed my fine lines vanishing, but that never really happens with moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this and any of the Olay products to everyone.</li>
            <li>It is a very light scrub; without harsh scrubbing particles.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>but this is a very light substitute for heavy moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>I highly recomend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>But my skin felt a little bit \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; throughout the day after using it, even though I made sure I rubbed it into my skin in a circular motion as directed.</li>
            <li>On top of that, I&#x27;ve gone through a tough 19 years (15 year decline of my father, which required my helping my mom in his care, while working as a department head and going to school full time, all on 3-5 hrs sleep per night).</li>
            <li>I will only put little around and it stay effective the whole day.</li>
            <li>Been in search of a good product that can help with the fine lines (late 30s) and while nothing really seems to work, including lots of expensive products I have purchased, I did enjoy the texture of this product.</li>
            <li>It didnt smooth out any rough texture.</li>
            <li>- really makes my skin soft on my face &amp; I</li>
            <li>I used my normal routine at night, cleaning my face, applying the Olay Regenerist and then additional products for moisture.  </li>
            <li>This product is for normal skin.</li>
            <li>If you are a more \\&quot;grown\\&quot; woman than myself it may take a few days or weeks to start showing results but it def should be working.</li>
            <li>I have semi-sensitive to normal skin.  </li>
            <li>I get the odd blemish now and again, but for the most part I&#x27;m clear.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to apply so many layers and waiting for each to dry before the next, since my mornings are hectic.</li>
            <li>Since using this product, my skin seems to glow a bit more (not shine), appears a bit less saggy (lines aren&#x27;t as marked), and it feels softer to the touch.  </li>
            <li>I have used many anti aging lotions and potions in the quest to keep my skin looking young for as long as possible.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I notice a visible difference after using this new serum.</li>
            <li>It did not look like a new product.  </li>
            <li>and  the demise of Prescriptives  that made me decide to try this new Oil of Olay series that was being advertised.</li>
            <li>I saw the add for this product on Olay website - it was under their &#x27;New&#x27; product section.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use anything else new on my face.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>All that exaggeration can make it difficult to find the truly useful products for those of us who just want our skin to look nice.</li>
            <li>After several weeks of applying this product daily, my face seemed softer, but it didn&#x27;t smooth ever imperfection my face.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve gone back to my Olay 7-in-One Fragrance Free Moisturizer, which has kept my wrinkles from increasing for two years, and makes my older wrinkles look less obvious, and my foundation goes on smoothly and without getting into creases.</li>
            <li>Invest the money and have it done in a professional way (with the Groupons and things out there nowadays, you might be able to get the professional services done for less than $50</li>
            <li>With the manufacturers&#x27; coupons and the sales in various Drug Stores, you could get the pair for a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>With the manufacturers&#x27; coupons and the sales in various Drug Stores, you could get the pair for a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>It has sunscreen and leaves skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s just a slight tint to this, so I think part of its dramatic effect is that it&#x27;s kind of like having very light makeup on.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels very soft and silky on the skin, not</li>
            <li>The first night I used it I felt quite a bit of stinging on my face, but I left it on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m reordering the RoC CompleteLift Serum that actually tightens my skin and makes it look flat and smooth.</li>
            <li>give this product 4 or 5 stars if it was priced in the same range as the products I use, but a very much more expensive product should give you something more.</li>
            <li>There are many other comparable skin care products delivered to market without animal testing: you&#x27;ve only got to read the labels to find them.  </li>
            <li>There are many other comparable skin care products delivered to market without animal testing: you&#x27;ve only got to read the labels to find them.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t look in the mirror and say WOW!, but it does seem to have helped.     </li>
            <li>The bottle has a pump top that dispenses a small amount of serum.  </li>
            <li>Because the item wasn&#x27;t exactly the same as it&#x27;s supposed to be!  </li>
            <li>Most likely due to tanning and out door sports.</li>
            <li>A great daily product, affordable...not dramatic, instant results but consistent skin firmness with continued use.  </li>
            <li>I wanted this to work, mainly because I dropped about $100 on several products in this line, thinking if I went in for the whole load</li>
            <li>I would like to have the crows feet disappear (especially since they are very light as is) and have the lines around my mouth and forehead become less visible.</li>
            <li>But at age 68, I was noticing distinct dry areas and felt that a \\&quot;heavier\\&quot; moisturizer was needed, so I bought</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more of this product, and may even try out the other products in the Olay lineup!</li>
            <li>As I mentioned above - I get very nervous using new products and start in baby steps.</li>
            <li>The lines around my frown seemed less deep, but then again it might be too soon to tell, but i love the way my skin feels.</li>
            <li>Suitable for everyday use for normal, dry, and combination skin\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>You can see the little flakes of light reflecting particles in it.</li>
            <li>It is hard to know today, with so many brands on the market, as to which one to pick to help your aging skin.  </li>
            <li>Plain old Vaseline would have worked just fine.  </li>
            <li>I stopped using both; let my face clear and began again with just the cream.</li>
            <li>So, I stopped using the cream; let my face clear and started using the serum (alone).</li>
            <li>I stopped using both; let my face clear and began again with just the cream.</li>
            <li>So, I stopped using the cream; let my face clear and started using the serum (alone).</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s clear to me now it&#x27;s the product.    </li>
            <li>i used product on night last night and it leaves your skin very velvety and soft.</li>
            <li>I prefer my serums to be clear or milky with no color added.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t turn back the clock as much as you&#x27;d like but you must do what you can for aging skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still fairly young, in my mid-twenties, so I wanted to try this in the pursuit of line prevention rather than getting rid of pre-existing lines.  </li>
            <li>After using this daily for two weeks, I don&#x27;t seem much of an improvement to my skin, but it does feel smoother to the touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using regenerist daily serum for about 2 years and really like it.  </li>
            <li>and she also had extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too soon to say how much it can undo, but I only care that it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just that I found this stuff before things had gone too far.  </li>
            <li>and now I feel that I CAN reccommend it....- even for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So far that part I like.    </li>
            <li>I love Olay products, but I am not thrilled with Olay Micro-Sculpting Serum.</li>
            <li>I am 67 years old and have never purchased any type of anti-aging products and have never used any type of Olay products.  </li>
            <li>but the combination of the two products has kept my skin soft and</li>
            <li>but the combination of the two products has kept my skin soft and</li>
            <li>I also buy and make serums (sera) frequently.  </li>
            <li>have been using this product for at least the recommended five days, and I do believe I see some change for the better and brighter in my skin.  </li>
            <li>As far as how well this seems to work...</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I especially like the auto ship which is very flexible in how often you receive the product.  </li>
            <li>I have had no trouble with this line however and although not a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; product on my 58 yr.</li>
            <li>old skin, I do feel like they make a difference.</li>
            <li>Makes skin amazingly soft</li>
            <li>I have been using it since OLAY developed this line.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m thinking of trying it nights and mornings</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be trying these old favorites on my neck, which I&#x27;d never thought of doing.</li>
            <li>Wow</li>
            <li>Have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>That said, having professional services can be costly (over $100 a treatment).</li>
            <li>My wrinkles are diminished and my skin feels soft.  </li>
            <li>So far, I have been blessed with no wrinkles.....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m like, wow,</li>
            <li>I also get a few smile lines after smiling to much.</li>
            <li>and this is the perfect weight and formula for around my eyes and a base ..  </li>
            <li>However, it is surprizing, given that I spend a lot of time in the tropical sun and have dry skin issues to boot, that I didn&#x27;t notice much difference beyond what I get with more or less generic moisturizing</li>
            <li>Many similar products are very expensive, but the Olay products are much more affordable.  </li>
            <li>At first I blamed it on my somehow coming into contact with topical testerone, since my husband applies it to his shoulders and upper arms.  </li>
            <li>I tested it on the skin inside my elbow and got no reaction, then used only a tiny bit at first.  </li>
            <li>They quickly change the subject when I say it&#x27;s Oil of Olay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They quickly change the subject when I say it&#x27;s Oil of Olay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>first few days that I used this product, my skin peeled a bit, much like products containing retinal.  </li>
            <li>I used to the o&#x27;oreal youth code serum prior but realized it had alcohol as one of the main ingredients.</li>
            <li>In high school, I worked downtown and bought my moisturizer in the local department store.  </li>
            <li>I have used Clinique since I was 16 - and that was quite a long time ago!&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, years ago I had tried an Oil of Olay product and it did not play very well with my skin.</li>
            <li>When I applied it to certain  areas, I had to add moisturizer afterward, because my skin looked dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>After washing my face felt squeaky clean but not dry or tight.</li>
            <li>The back clasps secure on tightly &amp; hold the earrings in place.  </li>
            <li>If you want something like this, I would certainly suggest you try this before buying more expensive products.</li>
            <li>FInally I looked it the mirror one day and noticed some new discolorations on my cheek plus a darkening of the circles under my eyes, so I decided to stop using this</li>
            <li>Consequently I thought, perhaps, it was via exfoliation that skin might looks brighter, younger (exfoliants do have that effect as they reveal new skin underneath).  </li>
            <li>All I really wanted it to do was hydrate my skin, because I have dry sections on my face.  </li>
            <li>Having had dry skin my whole life, I started to use a moisturizer when I was about seventeen.  </li>
            <li>I use two to three pumps each time because I have very short hair and treat my whole neck, back of neck included, with my face care regimen.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised that I noticed an instant improvement when I applied the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum.</li>
            <li>If you want smooth skin, small pores, less wrinkles, prevention of new wrinkles, the OLAY Regenerist line does that very well.&lt;br /&gt;Ive been using it for 2 years, and haven&#x27;t stopped.</li>
            <li>The scent is very light and (at least on my skin - not dry, not greasy, in the middle)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone back to my old lightweight night moisturizer from Neutrogena Naturals, and both of these things (thank goodness!)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand how they do it, but my skin is much less dry, with fewer fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Two weeks before my father died our company  was closed down, and 3 months later I was in a car accident that has taken many months to recover (from).    </li>
            <li>I live in a dry desert area and am in my early 60&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>By the time I cracked the second bottle is when I saw results without having to have my face an inch away from the mirror, however these results are subtle and I didn&#x27;t receive any comments about looking more awake.</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly, yet it makes such a difference in my skin that I&#x27;m wearing less and less make up, which makes my life, as the mom of a preschooler, so much easier.  </li>
            <li>I like Olay, this product is not any better than other brands I have used, so I wouldn&#x27;t buy this Micro-Sculpting serum again, because could get another brand for less in cost, with the same results.</li>
            <li>So I switched back to my old moisturiser to see if any effect that I was not noticing would disappear.</li>
            <li>It surprised me so the next time I thought I&#x27;d try it one just one side of my face to compare the difference.</li>
            <li>;  I use this at night under the Pro X Wrinkle Smoothing cream and it leaves my skin satiny soft the next morning.</li>
            <li>product came with just half amount, I immediately return it, but I received less than 50% of  original cost !</li>
            <li>But, it definitely plumps up the wrinkles and twice per day use as directed, particularly after the peel kit, has shown obvious results for me in the last month.</li>
            <li>I much prefer other Olay products.</li>
            <li>ordered this product from impossible discount though  Amazon by accident, and the shipping and handling is free charge ,but the original cost was over 13</li>
            <li>If there was a fragrance free version with a little less greasy feel at a slightly lower cost, it would be worth trying.  </li>
            <li>But I was told by a medical professional before that the only way I was going to get rid of that was thru laser treatments.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I also use the Olay night cream over it to ensure my skin does not dry out.</li>
            <li>A couple days ago I noticed that this is also carried by my local Costco and is covered by their general refund policy.</li>
            <li>Last night I tried using it again and like clockwork, I had the most irritating red eyes by the morning.  </li>
            <li>but I notice small wrinkles around my eyes (crows feet) and what I would call creases around my mouth (laugh lines?) and a line that goes across my forehead (an expression line?).</li>
            <li>both work very well and are not as expensive as other products that are not even half as good as Olay.</li>
            <li>I usually use Olay Regenerist Daily serum; the Micro-Sculpting serum is less \\&quot;serum-y\\&quot; and more lotion-like.</li>
            <li>The shine factor is the most significant difference between this and the other (less expensive)</li>
            <li>retired, after all -- where I&#x27;ve been spending heavily on department store products, and cosmoceuticals, that promise exactly the same results.  </li>
            <li>It has a slight, vague, hint of color which seems to be on the very, very pale golden or super rich vanilla ice cream side.</li>
            <li>and I was getting only half as much in a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I was getting only half as much in a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is as good as the expensive creams that I have previously used.  </li>
            <li>I have a few a little worse/than fine lines on my forehead.</li>
            <li>My face is not very dry, and tends to oiliness in the t-zone, but the skin is definitely losing its firmness and starting to head south a bit.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this serum and the other regenerist products for a long time and they really work for me.</li>
            <li>This may be a little to intense for my skin.</li>
            <li>I believe it uses nano technology which makes it &amp;#34;smart&amp;#34; - in other words it works with your skin and complexion and beats any of the new BB creams.</li>

            <li> I love Regenerist!!</li>
            <li> feels very nice when putting on.</li>
            <li> That is always nice to hear!</li>
            <li> I got this product because I&#x27;ve been using Olay regenerist mosturizing cream successfully for four years.  </li>
            <li> Nice feeling too!</li>
            <li> This serum honestly, truly works!  </li>
            <li> Good product, pleasant scent and feel.</li>
            <li> As a moisuriser it does a good job.</li>
            <li> But to be fair, I still dont know what micro sculpting means...</li>
            <li> I do have fair, overly-sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The serum absorbs fairly well and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.  </li>
            <li> Good job.  </li>
            <li> Plus there seems to be a lot of hype about it being as good as department store brands......</li>
            <li> I am told by people that \\&quot;I look good for my age\\&quot; (30&#x27;s rather than 40&#x27;s)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always taken good care of it.</li>
            <li> -- what is Micro-sculpting--, but it does a good job of moisturizing my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have always taken good care of my skin but noticed wrinkled lines on both sides of my mouth area.  </li>
            <li> Light scent is great, too!</li>
            <li> Good seller.</li>
            <li> However, this serum is not as good as the olay regenerist micro-sculpting cream.</li>
            <li> Olay&#x27;s products work well and are a good value.</li>
            <li> Good product, recommended, by my dermatologist to help control rosecea.</li>
            <li> I bought it because it contains peptides, which is good for the skin.</li>
            <li> good product and a good buy.</li>
            <li> Really good product for my face.  </li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in good condition and in  timely manner.  </li>
            <li> I think it does a good job of hydrating</li>
            <li> olay always good.</li>
            <li> Smells good and causes no skin irritation.</li>
            <li> Olay product are good.</li>
            <li> Packing was also good.</li>
            <li> I put it on before going to bed, and I am delighted with the results.</li>
            <li> This is almost too good to be true but it is!!!  </li>
            <li> I love the play products as they&#x27;re a great price and do what they&#x27;re supposed to.</li>
            <li> I love the bottle and pump works great.</li>
            <li> so you can apply spf and moisturizer on top and it will still feel very nice.</li>
            <li> This serum has an agent that adds a mild glow to the skin and makes any complexion bright and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I love this serum!</li>
            <li> but I have noticed a change in the softness of my skin and appearance of brightness; It felt wonderful on my skin from the first moment I applied it.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> You will love it !</li>
            <li> This is one of the best and on top of that, it is ECONOMICAL!  </li>
            <li> Love this product as well as this price!</li>
            <li> But I do love this!</li>
            <li> Love the moisturizing effect this product produces without feeling or looking oily!</li>
            <li> The price was a fantastic deal &amp; the product is great &amp; I see results....</li>
            <li> I use this with the Regenerist cream and the two together are amazing.</li>
            <li> The Olay Regenerist serum has a really nice texture.</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely and spreads well.</li>
            <li> Is it a nice moisturizer, yes......</li>
            <li> I have been using it morning and night every day since it arrived, but I can honestly say I haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction in these wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it each time.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  </li>
            <li> it really does help my skin look great!</li>
            <li> It smells and feels nice, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I used it faithfully, morning and night, and I liked it.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my skin break out and combined with a Mary Kay mask I&#x27;ve used week for ages, my skin looked nice.  </li>
            <li> It also smells nice, but did not make a noticeable difference for</li>
            <li> It even has a nice scent.  </li>
            <li> I put this on my more problem areas like eyes , neck, and forehead and then follow up with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have the monies to do your beauty fixes the better way, then Olay makes some good products.</li>
            <li> came promptly and packaged nicely.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum since 2010 and am thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> Nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> Supposedly feels great and works to remove wrinkles, seems high to me, but whatever makes her happy.</li>
            <li> My mother, a true redhead whose gorgeous fair skin never saw the sun, was a faithful user of Merle Norman Cosmetics all her life</li>
            <li> The product has a pleasant \\&quot;spa\\&quot; like aroma to it and feels fine going on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase :)</li>
            <li> will continue to have it automatically sent to my home with is great price and quick service.</li>
            <li> It has a light fragrance that is also pleasant.      </li>
            <li> The price was good &amp; it arrived very quickly</li>
            <li> The seller is great and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> and most importantly it&#x27;s WORKING!!</li>
            <li> and most importantly it&#x27;s WORKING!!</li>

            <li> She loves it very much and says it works great..</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very light</li>
            <li> The scent is light and very pleasant and the texture is really creamy and dreamy - and has a biit of a shimmery,silky look to it.&lt;br /&gt;Do</li>
            <li> I love the feel of it and it keeps my skin nice a smooth.</li>
            <li> It not only has a wonderful fragrance, but makes your face feel outstanding.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I decided to try the Olay Regenerist Micro Sculpting Serum instead of the cream.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just so glad to have a non-greasy, pimple free face!  </li>
            <li> What was even better, was</li>
            <li> In addition, the microderma kit is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Just make sure to moisturize after.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, not a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> I thought my skin feels better after using this product for about 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I love the weight, smell and feel of this product.  </li>
            <li> I Love it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this because the price was lower than the department store brands.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any miraculous age-fighting effects; however it is a nice, light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Skin appeared smoother and more hydrated.</li>
            <li> I have noticed my skin is a bit raw/sensitive feeling (I notice it mostly during exercising/sweating or if I use a wash cloth across my face in the morning)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be sure as of yet</li>
            <li> : Ok - it is now March</li>
            <li> It does moisturize well...and the areas look better with use, but</li>
            <li> It does moisturize well...and the areas look better with use, but</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizer keeps skin smooth all day</li>
            <li> Some have been better than others, but none have been like this.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> I love using olay regenerist micro sculpting serum; it is not oily and helps make my face feel smoother.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> So although the product concentrates on one attribute, tighter, firmer skin, and although the price is competitive, there are multi-tasking products that are a better value because of their added benefits.</li>
            <li> There are also products that worked better for me and didn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Like most skin-care products, this one promises more than it can deliver.</li>
            <li> Now my eyelids look plump and wrinkle free again!</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  </li>
            <li> The bottle had serum leaking out from the sides of the top.  </li>
            <li> Brothers and Sisters, she helped me see the light!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles</li>
            <li> But I truly think this product has helped my skin look better.</li>
            <li> I was sure this would make my skin break out and besides, it cost more</li>
            <li> this product is the one that&#x27;s helped me the most.  </li>

            <li> Love this as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using oil of olay for years and this is my favorite beside the regenerist serum.</li>
            <li> The skin, it claims, will be plumped, and look brighter and more radiant.  </li>

            <li> My wife is in love with this serum and has vowed to buy it again when hers runs out.  </li>
            <li> This is not a serum, but more of a cream.</li>
            <li> I have just got the product and cannot comment on many of the effects that it promises, but have bought many olay products</li>
            <li> and they all seem to help my skin do better vs. the loreal products.</li>
            <li> It is amazing for oily skin and makes my face smooth.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I feel it&#x27;s more hydrating than the serum.</li>
            <li> The serum versions are easier to absorb and I feel are more concentrated.</li>
            <li> I like the renerist serum better than this.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> The test is, did my wife buy more and the answer is yes.  </li>
            <li> And yes, like every product on the market they claim a lot more than they provide but still it does make your skin look more radiant.</li>
            <li> and you would see better results).</li>

            <li> always love this product.  </li>

            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> I re-read the box, and they said that most people would see improvement in 5 days.  </li>
            <li> I get lots of compliments on my skin and give most of the credit to the Olay products that I use.</li>
            <li> I love all the Olay products and also give them as gifts to family and friends.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and love how it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> plus I love the way it feels.</li>
            <li> Skin looks brighter, more radiant.  </li>
            <li> This serum contains mineral pigments that leave a shiny finish, which is how this manages to make your skin look brighter and more radiant.</li>

            <li> I always love Olay product.</li>
            <li> love this product...</li>
            <li> I love the Olay Regenerist cream.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>

            <li> The product has a nice silky feel when I am applying it, and a light clean fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Let me begin by describing my skin, issues, and desired effects and what I have experienced so far.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels... silky smooth and</li>
            <li> but so far im really happy with it</li>
            <li> Enjoyed this products ease of use and light fragrance.</li>
            <li> I figured anything with that much perfume couldn&#x27;t be good for my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s advertised to make skin significantly firmer and more radiant in just five days.</li>
            <li> I find it to go on easily.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel oily and is easy to apply twice a day.</li>
            <li> Delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is the true search for the fountain of youth.  </li>
            <li> My wife uses this product daily and was very happy that I found it for such a good price on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> + dollars, so this is a fine product that does what it purports to do--moisturize.</li>
            <li> As long as it has lasted, and with the results I have noticed, I think this is a good price and nice product, and would recommend that anyone with aging skin give it a try.</li>
            <li> It is fine if I put skin softner before I apply it.</li>
            <li> Works for me just fine.</li>
            <li> All the product by oil of oay there are really good, no grease , very soft with your skin, it works, I like thsprduct</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually impressed, and it makes me want to try the new Olay Professional RX series.</li>
            <li> Both are excellent, so it&#x27;s largely a matter of personal preference.</li>
            <li> I would see a huge difference but</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, feels light and has a light shimmer to it.</li>
            <li> It was B1B50% off with a coupon for free roller ball with purchase of two Olay moisturizer in the Sunday paper.  </li>
            <li> for light crows feet and laughter lines - nothing.</li>
            <li> During that time, my face and eyes felt no irritation and stayed smooth.  </li>
            <li> I just thought that since it was available to have her continue in her search for the \\&quot;fountain of</li>
            <li> I use Olay Definity at night, because it&#x27;s too light for my skin tone and makes me look ghostly in daylight, but it did nothing for my \\&quot;jowling\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It absorbs well and feels light when applied.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I have been a user of the Regenerist Daily Serum for years and thats a great product.</li>
            <li> While is goes on smoothly, I did not see a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> Now as a serum, it doesn&#x27;t act as a make-up primer, or smooth anything.</li>
            <li> I only use Olay products and like all the others I use this one lives up to the Olay reputation of being great for my skin.  </li>
            <li> People have even complimented me on my smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Pricing seems to be in the available range so should sell well.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li> This is a great mosurizer, I have been using this olay and the total olay mosurizer for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel silky and my makeup goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li> This goes on smoothly and make up is a breeze to put over...</li>
            <li> Overall though it is a great product.</li>
            <li> The added bonus is that it&#x27;s fragrance free.</li>
            <li> skin feels moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get over that two simple products can do so much, but they have, and I&#x27;m very happy.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many and really didn&#x27;t think this worked any better than the rest.</li>
            <li> It does a wonderful job of keeping my skin soft, not tight.</li>
            <li> I am also going into a new career where I will be competing with recent college grads, so looking my best is important.</li>
            <li> Feels rich on the skin.</li>
            <li> It got here faster than the original estimated arrival date.  </li>
            <li> The first week using this line was phenomenal.</li>
            <li> You were supposed to put that underneath the original Micro-Sculpting Cream.  </li>
            <li> as it has for me.ere supposed to put that underneath the original Micro-Sculpting Cream.  </li>
            <li> Anyhow, I thought I will give it a try and searched for this online - as usual Amazon had the best price.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t come in the original box, but in an amazon brown box with plastic wrapped around the lid.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with Olay 7-in-One for my face, so I tried the Regenerist Serum first on my neck.</li>
            <li> So far I am very pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li> After just 5 days, skin is significantly firmer.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to inherit \\&quot;good skin</li>
            <li> and I use it at nights after I clean my face and remove all makeups.</li>
            <li> And I do like most of Olay&#x27;s face creams and lotions, with my favorite being Olay Complete SPF 30.</li>
            <li> So far I love it!</li>
            <li> I wound of buying this Olay micro-sculting serum because Costco offered a special of $20.00 off two Olay mosturizers and two of these Olay serums.  </li>
            <li> It works great around the eye to keep that fresher, minimal wrinkle look.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure:</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about them.</li>
            <li> The smell is so fresh I like it, glides smoothly without any greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> and i loved how it mixed with it.</li>
            <li> The pump provides just the right amount of serum and it blends in smoothly.  </li>
            <li> It is certain worth the price,  I love using it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it in conjunction with the other Olay products, I have used it with Murad and Dr. Brandt, but the results have been great.  </li>
            <li> After a week of using this product I saw tremendous changes - firm and bright skin!</li>
            <li> Not only that, but my skin looks much better, more like when I was 33 or so.</li>
            <li> Just a quick comment on this product.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by BubzBeauty as one of best serums out there -- even compared to the more expensive stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> like that it absorbs quickly and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li> , I wonder how many customers have the same experience , how many customers rapped off by them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not leave a greasy feeling and that it did a good job of hydrating the skin all day long.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice and it goes on smoothly and makes your skin feel smooth but for me I have not really noticed a difference in</li>
            <li> very good,I love it very much.</li>
            <li> : I was most excited to try this product since it says \\&quot;Dermatologically  Tested, Non Comedogenic (won&#x27;t clog pores), Fast- Absorbing and Non Greasy.</li>
            <li> I have used many different high end products like this and this serum is hands down the best, and the price was fantastic on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This Serum, used together with the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream, is really working, better than products costing three times as much!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but a good product nonetheless when used regularly and consistently.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since tea allergy is not terribly common (although not as rare as you might think), most users should not have a problem with this.</li>
            <li> I  have very sensitive skin and many \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products</li>
            <li> and for the first time in my life--wrinkles!</li>
            <li> nothing dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;Since I did want to find something that wouldn&#x27;t break my face out and would help reverse time - I bought a facial cream and under eye cream by Patricia Wexler(Bath and Body Works) - LOVE it!</li>
            <li> nothing dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;Since I did want to find something that wouldn&#x27;t break my face out and would help reverse time - I bought a facial cream and under eye cream by Patricia Wexler(Bath and Body Works) - LOVE it!</li>
            <li> A quick add-on is that during my time using this serum religiously morning and evening I have noticed fine wrinkles around my eye area and the serum didn&#x27;t combat them in any way or make them better.</li>
            <li> It was slightly strong and the actual scent wasn&#x27;t too appealing.  </li>
            <li> Super light and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> product goes on smoothly, is pleasant enough to deal with, and, in comparison to some department store brands and cosmoceuticals, is quite reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> They taught me a lot about make-up and layering in very light layers which promotes the natural look.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs so quickly that you can put makeup on right away.</li>
            <li> After going through one bottle, I noticed that there was a noticeable difference in the reduction of fine lines especially near the eye area.  </li>
            <li> So maybe I really can&#x27;t make this fine a judgment call, and shouldn&#x27;t be reviewing this product now, or at all.  </li>
            <li> impressed with the product tough</li>
            <li> This is one of the better products out there - Olay Regenerist Micro-sculpting serum won&#x27;t reverse time, but it certainly helps my skin look and feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Am thrilled that Olay has come up with a similar product in a serum,pump bottle formula.  </li>
            <li> However, as it stands now, the product simply isn&#x27;t worth trying again to see if can deliver as promised.</li>
            <li> I am 44 years of age with fair skin that would be classified as combination which is both sensitive and adult acne</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel the benefit is worth the cost</li>
            <li> I tend to stay with chemicals as much as possible and this product appeared to have a nice mix of the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good luck to anyone who tries it</li>
            <li> Good luck to anyone who tries it</li>
            <li> Even using the serum at that rate, the bottle feels as if it might have another month&#x27;s worth of product in it.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s all in my mind, but I can tell a nice difference in my wrinkles when I use this regularly.</li>
            <li> For the price, it is worth using.</li>
            <li> I liked the feel and lightness of Regenerist, but there is something in this that makes me itch and my face red.  </li>
            <li> still dont get any problems for any olay products so far for many years i buy and use them.</li>
            <li> I would also recommend using Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Age Moisture Cream along with the serum to keep the areas around the eyes, mouth, and neck area to have smooth, soft touchable skin.</li>
            <li> serum is pretty lightweight and soaks in quickly.  </li>
            <li> I deleted my first review because I reviewed too quickly.</li>
            <li> Good product, like any other Olay product</li>
            <li> After one month&#x27;s use, I noticed a plugged pore on my right cheek.  </li>
            <li> , I assume that&#x27;s the right thing to do, and she tells me over and over that she wouldn&#x27;t go a day without</li>
            <li> This product just wasn&#x27;t right for me.</li>
            <li> After using the full contents of the bottle my wife claims that the cream made here face feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This fast absorbing, non-greasy formula provides specially designed hydration to give you significantly firmer skin and regenerate skin&#x27;s appearance.</li>
            <li> After the first application, the skin around my laugh lines and forehead wrinkles plumped up making my skin look swollen, like tire tread.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using this and other Olay products, I have been complemented on how beautiful my skin was and that I didn&#x27;t look like I was 64 yrs old.</li>
            <li> It has a soft feel and spreads easily.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so light and soft!</li>
            <li> It absorbs well, and almost right away after applying it, I notice a \\&quot;plumping\\&quot; effect that makes my skin&#x27;s texture smoother and more regular.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I have some redness due to sun damage over the years ( I am very fair skinned with blond hair, blue eyes)</li>
            <li> My mama likes it very much</li>
            <li> Very comparable to items with much higher price tags!</li>
            <li> like I was 10 years younger or more.</li>
            <li> It pretty well works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> On the first application my skin was smother glowing and visibly.younger.</li>
            <li> Skin is left with a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I plan to begin using as the directions instruct and apply these 2 products together; first applying the serum and topping off with the cream.</li>
            <li> When I first began using it on my face, I used it a week or so before adding the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much under my eye, what I was getting worried about was the droopiness of the skin under my eyebrow, it was encroaching on my eye lid!    </li>
            <li> I am so stunned that this really works that I keep looking in the mirror!  </li>
            <li> I think my first moisturizer was made by Clinique and from there, I just kept trying others.  </li>
            <li> The Micro-Sculpting Cream was the first to come out in that line, I believe.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it is worthwhile product.  </li>
            <li> Nice price and product as expected.</li>
            <li> My skin seems so much smoother with noticeable reduction in the appearance of wrinkles!  </li>
            <li> Too soon to give a full review , only o e month of use , but so far so good for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Olay is my favorite and I have tried various products.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite for in the morning especially.</li>
            <li> but by the 7th morning it was undeniable and even more than the 3rd morning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First review for me.</li>
            <li> I personally like the micro sculpting cream better.</li>
            <li> I put this on under my moisturizer/spf and it just makes my skin really smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> I am a regular user of most all Olay products.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Olay!</li>
            <li> Would rate it higher but there is a fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I spend time with research on facial care which is affordable and rates among the top for my skin type.  </li>
            <li> Not overly sensitive, I have had many facials, microdermabrasions and chemical peels with normal reactions.  </li>
            <li> Instantly skin is hydrated and plumped for a more lifted appearance.</li>
            <li> while I have a few brown sun spots and some wrinkles, my skin looks really good.</li>
            <li> while I have a few brown sun spots and some wrinkles, my skin looks really good.</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this product and would be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> Of course, we will never be 18 again, so enjoy life and accept the little things that make you look better.</li>
            <li> I starting seeing a real difference in the first couple weeks and over time it just gets better.</li>
            <li> genes\\&quot; from my mother, so my skin looks a good ten years younger than it is.  </li>
            <li> The dates on product are mostly good and one or two might be questionable but I am hoping they work okay.</li>
            <li> I was able to use the product for 3 or 4 weeks without a problem except that my skin was more sensitive to the sun than it was with another product (a moisturizer which contained a little sunscreen).</li>
            <li> I have seen positive changes in my skin.</li>
            <li> The other day, a co-worker actually told me my skin looked great.  </li>
            <li> I used it for three times that long before I could see any difference, and that was just that the skin seemed more hydrated.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to how this product would work for long term use, but I would recommend it if you are looking for softer, more supple skin.  </li>
            <li> I may update when I get through the whole bottle, but generally changes take a long time to see any effect, but thus far I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> My skin type is dry skin, this product gave me irritation and gets more dryer if I it as the direction of this product on package.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not a dramatic difference...</li>
            <li> By the way, aluminum starch is listed as an ingredient and that doesn&#x27;t sound like something you want to use in large quantities although it is considered safe in small amounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Looks like it&#x27;s actually helping my fine lines and the firmness of some areas in my face.</li>
            <li> Luckily, my Retin-A took care of those right away, but I did continue to break out with acne such as I had never, ever had in my life.  </li>
            <li> I used the micro-sculpting serum for a little over a month and honestly didn&#x27;t see much of an impact.</li>
            <li> After almost two months of use, I awoke one morning to find three HUGE red acne bulges on my cheeks and two on my forehead</li>
            <li> It is really light and non-greasy, while providing me with just enough moisture and smoothness for my oily face.</li>
            <li> I do suggest you use the serum and the cream together as Olay suggests; results come much faster.</li>
            <li> It is non-irritating and left my skin smooth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really amazed.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve found that using a tongue depressor to remove product from the jar works well, it&#x27;s so much easier to dispense it from a pump bottle.  </li>
            <li> Only this one has fragrance, I do prefer fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I may visit them very soon.  </li>
            <li> The lines on my forehead really bother me, and it has seemed to make a difference with them</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to try this product.</li>
            <li> my age, I never figure too much will help -</li>
            <li> but I can give this a two thumbs up and a high recommendation!</li>
            <li> : I really like the wash.</li>
            <li> It does have a very noticeable scent -</li>
            <li> This is the product I was very nervous about trying since it said nothing about being Non-Comedogenic.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really seen a change...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really seen a change...</li>
            <li> But the Micro Sculpting does not Sculpt, its doesnt really do anything.</li>
            <li> So I decided to try the serum instead and while it didnt cause breakouts, it also didnt do much of anything.</li>
            <li> Cannot really recommend this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for almost a month now, and really like what it does for my skin.</li>
            <li> What I can say is that this product is a real keeper.</li>
            <li> and it really has helped hydrate my skin.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product..</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The combination didn&#x27;t really made a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> The combination didn&#x27;t really made a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have to say, that I have not noticed much of a difference in either the appearance or texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li> That said, it did not do much for me.  </li>
            <li> It claims to be fast absorbing, and non-greasy, and to give a user younger-looking skin, without drastic measures, within just five days.</li>
            <li> not the real thing</li>
            <li> and I really like them.  </li>
            <li> and they are very affordable.  </li>
            <li> &quot;  Thanks to Olay, it is.  </li>
            <li> I have used Olay and L&#x27;Oreal products my whole life since I was working in a drugstore and took a seminar/education course on beautification offered by another product.</li>
            <li> But during the day, using the serum, moisturizer, and my foundation all together was just too much.</li>
            <li> Still looking for a product that really has an effect on my skin but haven’t found it yet.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this now for the past couple of weeks and am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> Ladies, if you&#x27;re on the fence and this review is the one you&#x27;re reading, she absolutely recommends it.</li>
            <li> It instantly makes your skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> I really question about the quality of this</li>
            <li> I really like Olay products.  </li>
            <li> I have no wrinkles or real issues.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> This really makes a difference.  </li>
            <li> this thing really works.  </li>
            <li> This really works for me</li>
            <li> I really want to like this serum.</li>
            <li> When I use it, it makes my skin feel lovely and soft, but the reason I bought it was to hopefully reduce wrinkles especially around my eye and mouth area.</li>
            <li> My skin looks far younger than most people my age.</li>
            <li> but when I stopped using it for a couple of days, my skin returned to its former wrinkly self pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> It claims that it will provide extra hydration for the skin to make it significantly firmer looking and regenerate its appearance.  </li>
            <li> As a fan of the original Micro-sculpting cream I found this version to be lightweight but still with enough power.  </li>
            <li> The first morning I woke up, my neck seemed to look a little better (this product promises firming by the 5th day).</li>
            <li> That means with each use your skin is treated to a helpful amount of cell-communicating ingredient niacinamide, skin-identical glycerin, and a cadre of other anti-aging ingredients, including peptides, antioxidants, and more cell-communicating ingredients.</li>
            <li> But really, it&#x27;s quite good and doesn&#x27;t need to rely on absurd claims to be a worthy product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 51 and for a long time looked way younger than my true age, but all of a sudden time started catching up with me.</li>
            <li> and I want to prevent any further wrinkles, also I added this around my eyes and I liked the way my eyes weren&#x27;t puffy or didn&#x27;t have dark circles like usual so with my eyes i loved it.</li>
            <li> My friends and colleagues all asked if I have been doing some special beauty treatment such as laser, peal etc.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dry skin, so any moisteriser is usually fine.</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;ll be reversing the hands of time with this, but I like the fact that it&#x27;s not greasy and goopy and seems to texturize my skin nicely.</li>
            <li> It seems to be lightening the dark spots better than anything else I have used</li>
            <li> but it is not any better or worse for fine lines than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to certain ingredients in products.  </li>
            <li> There was new puffiness UNDER the bags under my eyes, plus wrinkly sagging on my cheekbones that had never been there before!</li>
            <li> And my neck had NEW wrinkles on it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say, from my personal experience, it is a nice moisturizer, but I am not willing to pay this much for a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Suspicious, I looked inside the bottle and more than half the bottle was gone.</li>
            <li> but I won&#x27;t be purchasing this particular serum again.</li>
            <li> The bottle is actually a decent size - almost two ounces, so while it&#x27;s pricey, it lasts a while.    </li>
            <li> This particular skin product also comes to my house enthusiastically spoken of by some friends and</li>
            <li> The Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum is decent product for the money.  </li>
            <li> This is the first wrinkle product that I have used that I can honestly say shows actual results in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t particularly noticed my fine lines vanishing, but that never really happens with moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this and any of the Olay products to everyone.</li>
            <li> It is a very light scrub; without harsh scrubbing particles.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> but this is a very light substitute for heavy moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> I highly recomend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> But my skin felt a little bit \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; throughout the day after using it, even though I made sure I rubbed it into my skin in a circular motion as directed.</li>
            <li> On top of that, I&#x27;ve gone through a tough 19 years (15 year decline of my father, which required my helping my mom in his care, while working as a department head and going to school full time, all on 3-5 hrs sleep per night).</li>
            <li> I will only put little around and it stay effective the whole day.</li>
            <li> Been in search of a good product that can help with the fine lines (late 30s) and while nothing really seems to work, including lots of expensive products I have purchased, I did enjoy the texture of this product.</li>
            <li> It didnt smooth out any rough texture.</li>
            <li> - really makes my skin soft on my face &amp; I</li>
            <li> I used my normal routine at night, cleaning my face, applying the Olay Regenerist and then additional products for moisture.  </li>
            <li> This product is for normal skin.</li>
            <li> If you are a more \\&quot;grown\\&quot; woman than myself it may take a few days or weeks to start showing results but it def should be working.</li>
            <li> I have semi-sensitive to normal skin.  </li>
            <li> I get the odd blemish now and again, but for the most part I&#x27;m clear.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to apply so many layers and waiting for each to dry before the next, since my mornings are hectic.</li>
            <li> Since using this product, my skin seems to glow a bit more (not shine), appears a bit less saggy (lines aren&#x27;t as marked), and it feels softer to the touch.  </li>
            <li> I have used many anti aging lotions and potions in the quest to keep my skin looking young for as long as possible.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I notice a visible difference after using this new serum.</li>
            <li> It did not look like a new product.  </li>
            <li> and  the demise of Prescriptives  that made me decide to try this new Oil of Olay series that was being advertised.</li>
            <li> I saw the add for this product on Olay website - it was under their &#x27;New&#x27; product section.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use anything else new on my face.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> All that exaggeration can make it difficult to find the truly useful products for those of us who just want our skin to look nice.</li>
            <li> After several weeks of applying this product daily, my face seemed softer, but it didn&#x27;t smooth ever imperfection my face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone back to my Olay 7-in-One Fragrance Free Moisturizer, which has kept my wrinkles from increasing for two years, and makes my older wrinkles look less obvious, and my foundation goes on smoothly and without getting into creases.</li>
            <li> Invest the money and have it done in a professional way (with the Groupons and things out there nowadays, you might be able to get the professional services done for less than $50</li>
            <li> With the manufacturers&#x27; coupons and the sales in various Drug Stores, you could get the pair for a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> With the manufacturers&#x27; coupons and the sales in various Drug Stores, you could get the pair for a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> It has sunscreen and leaves skin very soft.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s just a slight tint to this, so I think part of its dramatic effect is that it&#x27;s kind of like having very light makeup on.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels very soft and silky on the skin, not</li>
            <li> The first night I used it I felt quite a bit of stinging on my face, but I left it on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reordering the RoC CompleteLift Serum that actually tightens my skin and makes it look flat and smooth.</li>
            <li> give this product 4 or 5 stars if it was priced in the same range as the products I use, but a very much more expensive product should give you something more.</li>
            <li> There are many other comparable skin care products delivered to market without animal testing: you&#x27;ve only got to read the labels to find them.  </li>
            <li> There are many other comparable skin care products delivered to market without animal testing: you&#x27;ve only got to read the labels to find them.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t look in the mirror and say WOW!, but it does seem to have helped.     </li>
            <li> The bottle has a pump top that dispenses a small amount of serum.  </li>
            <li> Because the item wasn&#x27;t exactly the same as it&#x27;s supposed to be!  </li>
            <li> Most likely due to tanning and out door sports.</li>
            <li> A great daily product, affordable...not dramatic, instant results but consistent skin firmness with continued use.  </li>
            <li> I wanted this to work, mainly because I dropped about $100 on several products in this line, thinking if I went in for the whole load</li>
            <li> I would like to have the crows feet disappear (especially since they are very light as is) and have the lines around my mouth and forehead become less visible.</li>
            <li> But at age 68, I was noticing distinct dry areas and felt that a \\&quot;heavier\\&quot; moisturizer was needed, so I bought</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more of this product, and may even try out the other products in the Olay lineup!</li>
            <li> As I mentioned above - I get very nervous using new products and start in baby steps.</li>
            <li> The lines around my frown seemed less deep, but then again it might be too soon to tell, but i love the way my skin feels.</li>
            <li> Suitable for everyday use for normal, dry, and combination skin\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> You can see the little flakes of light reflecting particles in it.</li>
            <li> It is hard to know today, with so many brands on the market, as to which one to pick to help your aging skin.  </li>
            <li> Plain old Vaseline would have worked just fine.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using both; let my face clear and began again with just the cream.</li>
            <li> So, I stopped using the cream; let my face clear and started using the serum (alone).</li>
            <li> I stopped using both; let my face clear and began again with just the cream.</li>
            <li> So, I stopped using the cream; let my face clear and started using the serum (alone).</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s clear to me now it&#x27;s the product.    </li>
            <li> i used product on night last night and it leaves your skin very velvety and soft.</li>
            <li> I prefer my serums to be clear or milky with no color added.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t turn back the clock as much as you&#x27;d like but you must do what you can for aging skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still fairly young, in my mid-twenties, so I wanted to try this in the pursuit of line prevention rather than getting rid of pre-existing lines.  </li>
            <li> After using this daily for two weeks, I don&#x27;t seem much of an improvement to my skin, but it does feel smoother to the touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using regenerist daily serum for about 2 years and really like it.  </li>
            <li> and she also had extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soon to say how much it can undo, but I only care that it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just that I found this stuff before things had gone too far.  </li>
            <li> and now I feel that I CAN reccommend it....- even for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So far that part I like.    </li>
            <li> I love Olay products, but I am not thrilled with Olay Micro-Sculpting Serum.</li>
            <li> I am 67 years old and have never purchased any type of anti-aging products and have never used any type of Olay products.  </li>
            <li> but the combination of the two products has kept my skin soft and</li>
            <li> but the combination of the two products has kept my skin soft and</li>
            <li> I also buy and make serums (sera) frequently.  </li>
            <li> have been using this product for at least the recommended five days, and I do believe I see some change for the better and brighter in my skin.  </li>
            <li> As far as how well this seems to work...</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I especially like the auto ship which is very flexible in how often you receive the product.  </li>
            <li> I have had no trouble with this line however and although not a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; product on my 58 yr.</li>
            <li> old skin, I do feel like they make a difference.</li>
            <li> Makes skin amazingly soft</li>
            <li> I have been using it since OLAY developed this line.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m thinking of trying it nights and mornings</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be trying these old favorites on my neck, which I&#x27;d never thought of doing.</li>
            <li> Wow</li>
            <li> Have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> That said, having professional services can be costly (over $100 a treatment).</li>
            <li> My wrinkles are diminished and my skin feels soft.  </li>
            <li> So far, I have been blessed with no wrinkles.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m like, wow,</li>
            <li> I also get a few smile lines after smiling to much.</li>
            <li> and this is the perfect weight and formula for around my eyes and a base ..  </li>
            <li> However, it is surprizing, given that I spend a lot of time in the tropical sun and have dry skin issues to boot, that I didn&#x27;t notice much difference beyond what I get with more or less generic moisturizing</li>
            <li> Many similar products are very expensive, but the Olay products are much more affordable.  </li>
            <li> At first I blamed it on my somehow coming into contact with topical testerone, since my husband applies it to his shoulders and upper arms.  </li>
            <li> I tested it on the skin inside my elbow and got no reaction, then used only a tiny bit at first.  </li>
            <li> They quickly change the subject when I say it&#x27;s Oil of Olay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They quickly change the subject when I say it&#x27;s Oil of Olay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> first few days that I used this product, my skin peeled a bit, much like products containing retinal.  </li>
            <li> I used to the o&#x27;oreal youth code serum prior but realized it had alcohol as one of the main ingredients.</li>
            <li> In high school, I worked downtown and bought my moisturizer in the local department store.  </li>
            <li> I have used Clinique since I was 16 - and that was quite a long time ago!&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, years ago I had tried an Oil of Olay product and it did not play very well with my skin.</li>
            <li> When I applied it to certain  areas, I had to add moisturizer afterward, because my skin looked dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> After washing my face felt squeaky clean but not dry or tight.</li>
            <li> The back clasps secure on tightly &amp; hold the earrings in place.  </li>
            <li> If you want something like this, I would certainly suggest you try this before buying more expensive products.</li>
            <li> FInally I looked it the mirror one day and noticed some new discolorations on my cheek plus a darkening of the circles under my eyes, so I decided to stop using this</li>
            <li> Consequently I thought, perhaps, it was via exfoliation that skin might looks brighter, younger (exfoliants do have that effect as they reveal new skin underneath).  </li>
            <li> All I really wanted it to do was hydrate my skin, because I have dry sections on my face.  </li>
            <li> Having had dry skin my whole life, I started to use a moisturizer when I was about seventeen.  </li>
            <li> I use two to three pumps each time because I have very short hair and treat my whole neck, back of neck included, with my face care regimen.  </li>
            <li> I was very surprised that I noticed an instant improvement when I applied the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum.</li>
            <li> If you want smooth skin, small pores, less wrinkles, prevention of new wrinkles, the OLAY Regenerist line does that very well.&lt;br /&gt;Ive been using it for 2 years, and haven&#x27;t stopped.</li>
            <li> The scent is very light and (at least on my skin - not dry, not greasy, in the middle)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone back to my old lightweight night moisturizer from Neutrogena Naturals, and both of these things (thank goodness!)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how they do it, but my skin is much less dry, with fewer fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Two weeks before my father died our company  was closed down, and 3 months later I was in a car accident that has taken many months to recover (from).    </li>
            <li> I live in a dry desert area and am in my early 60&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> By the time I cracked the second bottle is when I saw results without having to have my face an inch away from the mirror, however these results are subtle and I didn&#x27;t receive any comments about looking more awake.</li>
            <li> It glides on smoothly, yet it makes such a difference in my skin that I&#x27;m wearing less and less make up, which makes my life, as the mom of a preschooler, so much easier.  </li>
            <li> I like Olay, this product is not any better than other brands I have used, so I wouldn&#x27;t buy this Micro-Sculpting serum again, because could get another brand for less in cost, with the same results.</li>
            <li> So I switched back to my old moisturiser to see if any effect that I was not noticing would disappear.</li>
            <li> It surprised me so the next time I thought I&#x27;d try it one just one side of my face to compare the difference.</li>
            <li> ;  I use this at night under the Pro X Wrinkle Smoothing cream and it leaves my skin satiny soft the next morning.</li>
            <li> product came with just half amount, I immediately return it, but I received less than 50% of  original cost !</li>
            <li> But, it definitely plumps up the wrinkles and twice per day use as directed, particularly after the peel kit, has shown obvious results for me in the last month.</li>
            <li> I much prefer other Olay products.</li>
            <li> ordered this product from impossible discount though  Amazon by accident, and the shipping and handling is free charge ,but the original cost was over 13</li>
            <li> If there was a fragrance free version with a little less greasy feel at a slightly lower cost, it would be worth trying.  </li>
            <li> But I was told by a medical professional before that the only way I was going to get rid of that was thru laser treatments.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also use the Olay night cream over it to ensure my skin does not dry out.</li>
            <li> A couple days ago I noticed that this is also carried by my local Costco and is covered by their general refund policy.</li>
            <li> Last night I tried using it again and like clockwork, I had the most irritating red eyes by the morning.  </li>
            <li> but I notice small wrinkles around my eyes (crows feet) and what I would call creases around my mouth (laugh lines?) and a line that goes across my forehead (an expression line?).</li>
            <li> both work very well and are not as expensive as other products that are not even half as good as Olay.</li>
            <li> I usually use Olay Regenerist Daily serum; the Micro-Sculpting serum is less \\&quot;serum-y\\&quot; and more lotion-like.</li>
            <li> The shine factor is the most significant difference between this and the other (less expensive)</li>
            <li> retired, after all -- where I&#x27;ve been spending heavily on department store products, and cosmoceuticals, that promise exactly the same results.  </li>
            <li> It has a slight, vague, hint of color which seems to be on the very, very pale golden or super rich vanilla ice cream side.</li>
            <li> and I was getting only half as much in a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I was getting only half as much in a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is as good as the expensive creams that I have previously used.  </li>
            <li> I have a few a little worse/than fine lines on my forehead.</li>
            <li> My face is not very dry, and tends to oiliness in the t-zone, but the skin is definitely losing its firmness and starting to head south a bit.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this serum and the other regenerist products for a long time and they really work for me.</li>
            <li> This may be a little to intense for my skin.</li>
            <li> I believe it uses nano technology which makes it &amp;#34;smart&amp;#34; - in other words it works with your skin and complexion and beats any of the new BB creams.</li>
            <li> never bothered with drug store moisturizers much because I was a snob; plain and simple.</li>
            <li> I live in a very arid place and have trouble keeping my skin from getting all dried out and between this and the Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream</li>
            <li> I noticed immediately that the serum and moisturizer seemed to create a kind of unpleasant layer over my skin, which I definitely did not like.  </li>
            <li> I only need a small pump for my whole face.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of any other brand, cheapo or department store, that caused such major issues for me.</li>
            <li> However, I noticed that the serum didn&#x27;t hydrate my skin that much, as just a few minutes after application, my skin became dry again.  </li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am middle age, have dry skin, especially so because I am in the trpoical sun a lot.  </li>
            <li> However, after using this for about 5 days my skin got very irritated, it burned when I used my usual sunscreen and makeup.  </li>
            <li> Very hydrating, but not sure about &amp;#34;sculpting.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> , maybe I didnt use it long enough to see results, or maybe I&#x27;m not the target skin type</li>
            <li> Once I thought these was the problem and stopped using it completely for a few weeks and used only basic, organic makeup.  </li>
            <li> I have used Olay Regenerist Micro-sculpting cream for a long time and am a big fan.  </li>
            <li> Havent used it long enough to say if there is any difference in my skin</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t actually know how long I&#x27;ve used it</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t actually know how long I&#x27;ve used it</li>
            <li> I did not get to use this product long enough to determine its efficacy because the smell was way to overpowering.</li>
            <li> I bought Olay Serum because it was touted as a sculpting substance, which I took it to mean it would smooth out some deep wrinkles around my mouth, and firm up my skin, but in my case this has not happened.</li>
            <li> my only negative is that one of the two bottles that I purchased was half full</li>
            <li> But, like other reviewers here have said, I looked elsewhere for the problem, never imagining that an expensive, reputable brand would cause such harm to my skin.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts and the few I had have gone.</li>
            <li> I have ended up with dry patches and a couple of big zits.  </li>
            <li> Other than &#x27;Micro-sculpting,&#x27; I&#x27;m not sure exactly what this serum is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I keep trying other &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; products, but don&#x27;t have the same results, so I keep going back to this.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, after a week, my skin did feel smoother -- this has never happened with any other product (e.g. such noticeable effects in a short period of time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The serum by itself seems to provide enough moisture for my t-zone, so I apply the other moisturizer over the serum only on my cheeks and neck.           </li>
            <li> Maybe other people have different results, after all, everybody&#x27;s skin is different, but I don&#x27;t see any noticeable results.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and use it under Olay Total Effects lotion with SPF15.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Olay products, and this one lives up to the brand&#x27;s usual high level of quality.</li>
            <li> Too bad because my skin looked nice but this side effect outweighed the benefits.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much, so one bottle lasts at least six months.  </li>
            <li> , my skin stay hydrated all day long.</li>
            <li> I had to stop using it because it caused  acne in me, along with a strange looking crusty rash.</li>
            <li> Im 24 and have minor aging.</li>
            <li> However the merchandise inside seemed unaffected.</li>
            <li> The formula is a serum which when applied correctly and before moisturizing, absorbs into the skin with ease only leaving a slight touch of greasiness but not enough to bother my combination skin.  </li>
            <li> but make my problem less apparent.  </li>
            <li> I will never go back to any other skin care product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s back to Olay Total Effects Serum and moisturizer for me and perhaps a little olive oil.  </li>
            <li> I am experiencing menopause with extreme hot-flashes which has only compounded my oily T-zone.</li>
            <li> I chose to start using it only at night due to</li>
            <li> I use this serum with the other Olay Regenerist products such as day and night creams.  </li>
            <li> Skin sags for various reasons, mostly due to sun damage that hinders its support structure, the cumulative effects of gravity, and bone loss.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it sculpts really because I have only used it a few times..</li>
            <li> My skin is hyper oily, with dry spots around my eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin to the max, but you wouldn&#x27;t know that to look at me.</li>
            <li> so I will continue to do.of treating animals terribly in its laboratories, and, to me, no skin cream is worth the suffering of innocent creatures.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Caucasian with dry skin prone to break outs from irritations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years after trying all sorts of more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> The results, thou limited, do what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li> Drooping jawline, deep dark circles and bags under my eyes,</li>
            <li> But for dry or very dry need moisturizer over it.&lt;br /&gt;Skin</li>
            <li> Today is day 4, and each day, my skin is just getting smoother, I had some dry spots on my cheeks for 2-3 wks, and those spots are gone!  </li>
            <li> I think I looked 55, if not older.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not particularly hydrating.  </li>
            <li> (I have less than a quarter bottle left, it will be gone within two weeks.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting complements on my skin, which is smoother and less red.</li>
            <li> Compared to the super expensive department store brands this is a steal.</li>
            <li> The reason this is rated so highly is because it has a lot in common with the other serums from Olay Regenerist.</li>
            <li> The second night, the sensation was less and last night I felt little to no stinging.</li>
            <li> The firm has a long record of treating animals terribly in its laboratories, and, to me, no skin cream is worth the suffering of innocent creatures.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a month, so maybe it takes a little longer to have an age-fighting effect.</li>
            <li> After about two weeks, I did notice a small amount  of results around my eyes but nothing major to be reported.     </li>
            <li> I am 37-years old, which is a shock to people I talk to; they think I am at least 27-30.</li>
            <li> The lady of the house is convinced that this Micro-Sculpting Serum is what keeps her looking AT LEAST ten years younger than her years.  </li>
            <li> The cream moisturizers are too heavy and oily for me, especially around my forehead area.</li>
            <li> The micro sculpting serum sinks into the skin faster and feels lighter.  </li>
            <li> Without the latter, someone would have already buried me because I look like I&#x27;m dead with no lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using the serum for a few days and having those issues, I decided to only use it at night.</li>
            <li> it goes on a bit greasier than I expected.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I am a firm believer in avoiding the sun and attempting to do regular microderms and peels in an effort to minimize the signs of aging.</li>
            <li> Performs as expected.</li>
            <li> It is a nice moisturizer and base for my mineral makeup.</li>
            <li> Suddenly, my black circles were lightening to grey.  </li>
            <li> Suddenly, my black circles were lightening to grey.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommended, especially since I&#x27;ve used expensive department store products and didn&#x27;t see results like this one.</li>
            <li> At least Amazon offers these products at half the price of a drugstore.</li>
            <li> I use both products - the daily serum in the morning and the micro sculpting serum (with a small amount of the micro sculpting cream) in the evening.  </li>
            <li> I continued using this for several weeks past what I should because I blamed everything else under the sun: stress, hormones, weather, even food choices.</li>
            <li> but I will look to other products in the Regenerist line.</li>
            <li> So I plan to return to my other cream when I finish this bottle.</li>
            <li> And doctors had always said it was due to my allergy.</li>
            <li> And doctors had always said it was due to my allergy.</li>
            <li> I USE THIS DAY AND NIGHT WITH MY OTHER SKIN PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> Small line creases in skin have diminished within the last month of use but they have NOT disappeared.      </li>
            <li> But after another month of being very careful not to risk contact with this substance, I have come to the conclusion that it must be the Olay product.  </li>
            <li> The wrinkles had spread from just in the center of my neck to additional wrinkles slightly to the sides.</li>
            <li> I usually have break outs if a product is even slightly greasy, but after several days of using this, I&#x27;ve had no problems at all.</li>
            <li> This may be partially due to the heat and humidity of summer, but I didn&#x27;t typically have those problems before adding the serum to my routine.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so even though it&#x27;s not cheap at around $16 with subscribe and save</li>
            <li> applying sparingly is all you need to do (a small amount goes a long way).</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream for at least a month (in total time).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 28 and have hereditary bags and dark circles</li>
            <li> It is rather pricey and not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Now im young, so what I can say is it didnt make anything worse</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my mother&#x27;s good genes and the fact that I&#x27;ve always hated sitting in the sun!  </li>
            <li> The other disappointing thing about this product is that it offers no additional benefits such as sunscreen or a cooling sensation going on.</li>
            <li> as some other products do: the package states it has been dermatologically tested so as to be non-comedogenic; that is, it won&#x27;t clog the pores, causing breakouts, nor does it appear to be heavily</li>
            <li> and I have to say I saw a slight difference in the area around my eye.</li>
            <li> I used the product as directed and noticed my skin did feel slightly tighter.</li>
            <li> The product&#x27;s box was dented and half opened when it was received.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed with this serum and don&#x27;t see any improvement with fine lines or wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Do NOT expect miracles but your skin will see a slight improvement.</li>
            <li> and since I already trusted my previous Olay face products, I decided to try this for the neck.</li>
            <li> Wasteful mess.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed the skin on my neck is less firm.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been about a month; still using it once a day with a little micro sculpting cream on the \\&quot;problem areas\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a week now).</li>
            <li> It blends well into the skin and helps ease the little lines, etc.</li>
            <li> The people who examine the products after packaging it should check a little closer.  </li>
            <li> Winter time I use a little stronger on exposed areas but this always to start with..</li>
            <li> I will continue buying, but perhaps not from Amazon - little pricy and have to wait to get it.</li>
            <li> I did not care for other Olay products I&#x27;ve used in the past as they were too harsh for my skin.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, how dry did I think my skin was?  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money, even with the Costco discount.</li>
            <li> and I worry it would be too heavy during the day.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and it&#x27;s non-greasy.</li>
            <li> and I do have a history of having trouble finding skin products that are beneficial and do not produce deleterious effects on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Since I had to keep the products - and it is far too expensive to throw away, I use it on my neck/jaw line and between my breasts (twice a day).</li>
            <li> Since I had to keep the products - and it is far too expensive to throw away, I use it on my neck/jaw line and between my breasts (twice a day).</li>
            <li> I also tried the Micro Sculpting Cream and that was way too heavy for my skin and caused breakouts.</li>
            <li> I rate it a 2 because it does not do what Olay claims it will, it does not sculpt, lift or firm.  </li>
            <li> For the price, I expected at least moisturized skin.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few products that made a noticeable difference on my skin.</li>
            <li> Waste of time for me.</li>
            <li> Just started using this for a few days now</li>
            <li> I stopped for a few days and the burnjng is gone.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t heavy like a lot of the creams on the market.  </li>
            <li> But as we all know like with anything there are a few exceptions who it will not work for.</li>
            <li> will break out if a product is to heavy thou.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> However, like other reviewers, I&#x27;ve determined that this product and this product alone was the cause of very irritating red rashes under and over my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Apparently I was wrong about how it works.  </li>
            <li> but if we can slow the process down, we&#x27;re fools not to do it and</li>
            <li> but if we can slow the process down, we&#x27;re fools not to do it and</li>
            <li> and you can kiss your dead, dull skin goodby.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to prevent or heal dryness; you still need to use your usual lotion or cream after.  </li>
            <li> and my skin was an oil slick.  </li>
            <li> After using the 2 products for aprox.a week I began to have small pimples around my mouth and on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> these Olay products may not be for you.a week I began to have small pimples around my mouth and on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> As usual with this type of product, it&#x27;s a wrinkle plumper, not a tightener.</li>
            <li> No more after using this product.</li>
            <li> I still am not sure I like this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether it is the fragrance-free version</li>
            <li> On the negative side, I was hoping that this stuff was going to permanently improve my skin, at least a little bit - the regenerative effect</li>
            <li> Shh, this will be our little secret.</li>
            <li> But then I developed a bad allergy from it.</li>
            <li> We all know that, as we age, our skin loses elasticity.  </li>
            <li> It least it could have done nothing</li>
            <li> I muttered and complained and waited until I found a coupon for it and then waited for a sale.  </li>

            <li> \\&quot;Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum\\&quot; comes bearing the promise that it will penetrate into the skin&#x27;s surface to deliver a super-concentrated amino-peptide +B3 complex.  </li>
            <li> I am in my late 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> There seems to be no lasting effects, but I&#x27;m afraid to stop using it.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I do not know what it does, or why it works, but it does for some reason.  </li>
            <li> I am in my late 40&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> It feels silky and delicate.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t mean it is a cure....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m broken out, my skin is dull, and I look and feel like an oil slick.</li>
            <li> Sorry Olay, but you have let me down on this one.</li>
            <li> there but you can tell a subtle difference with this one.</li>
            <li> (If you&#x27;re serious about preventing aging, then don&#x27;t forget your sun protection.  </li>
            <li> It took a while to see the result, but this sculpting serum seems to work in smoothing out shallow wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It adds a subtle bit of color</li>
            <li> Very hard to find this product</li>
            <li> From a family member&#x27;s viewpoint who tried the product: The Olay Regenerist product was slightly greasy and the fragrance was awkward.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I want to say is that this was a terrible product for me, but that does not mean it will be a terrible product for you.  </li>
            <li> - I was afraid it may be heavy and cause me to become oily.</li>
            <li> However, two months in, I&#x27;ve taken a turn for the worse.</li>
            <li> Besides, I found it highly irritating to be bombarded by this overpowering scent ages after I had applied it.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical if a serum could actually firm the skin as the add stated on their website.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m feeling a little disappointed that I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable</li>
            <li> I will never buy expensive face creams again..</li>
            <li> I was quite skeptical about this product.</li>
            <li> but again...much too expensive to throw away, so I&#x27;ll use it in these areas until it is gone.</li>
            <li> but again...much too expensive to throw away, so I&#x27;ll use it in these areas until it is gone.</li>
            <li> No, this was a fairly expensive mistake for me.</li>
            <li> It has a faint scent which is pleasing.  </li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this Olay product.  </li>
            <li> the third morning, my skin looked awful.</li>
            <li> wrong</li>
            <li> I would never ever buy anything from impossible discount from now on.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> bad customer service</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to say anything bad about Olay, because it has always worked well for me.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on reviews and have not been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Crows feet, those stupid furrows between your brows, some lines on my forehad, and a sort of repulsive crinkely neck.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Because about 4 months ago I noticed my face looked awful!.</li>
            <li> So, I am not going to say this is a terrible product, but it is a terrible product for me.  </li>
            <li> This product was my worst nightmare.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t terrible, but it wasn&#x27;t an overnight miracle cream either.  </li>
            <li> (( i feel very disappointed from buying this products!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used Oil of Olay for years. I switched to using the Regenerist a couple of years ago. I love the feel of it and it keeps my skin nice a smooth. I live in a very arid place and have trouble keeping my skin from getting all dried out and between this and the Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream, my skin stay hydrated all day long.</li>
            <li> This serum has an agent that adds a mild glow to the skin and makes any complexion bright and beautiful. I believe it uses nano technology which makes it &amp;#34;smart&amp;#34; - in other words it works with your skin and complexion and beats any of the new BB creams.</li>
            <li> I use this with my moisturizer. I love the play products as they&#x27;re a great price and do what they&#x27;re supposed to. Happy customer.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because anything oil of olay produces is great for the skin and I have used it for years</li>
            <li> The Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum is really great! It not only has a wonderful fragrance, but makes your face feel outstanding. Since I have been using this and other Olay products, I have been complemented on how beautiful my skin was and that I didn&#x27;t look like I was 64 yrs old. That is always nice to hear! I will never go back to any other skin care product. I would highly recommend this and any of the Olay products to everyone.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I decided to try the Olay Regenerist Micro Sculpting Serum instead of the cream. I love it. It is really light and non-greasy, while providing me with just enough moisture and smoothness for my oily face. I only need a small pump for my whole face. The cream moisturizers are too heavy and oily for me, especially around my forehead area. I just wish I knew this sooner. I&#x27;m just so glad to have a non-greasy, pimple free face!  What was even better, was I got it on sale at CVS for $18.99 instead of the retail price of $23. And recently went and picked me up the roller ball and just the Renegerist Serum and difinity serum at Rite Aid for $40, but got back $20 up to use in the store. It was B1B50% off with a coupon for free roller ball with purchase of two Olay moisturizer in the Sunday paper.  [...]</li>
            <li> I turn 50 in March. I am also going into a new career where I will be competing with recent college grads, so looking my best is important. On top of that, I&#x27;ve gone through a tough 19 years (15 year decline of my father, which required my helping my mom in his care, while working as a department head and going to school full time, all on 3-5 hrs sleep per night). Two weeks before my father died our company  was closed down, and 3 months later I was in a car accident that has taken many months to recover (from).    So why am I telling you this? Because about 4 months ago I noticed my face looked awful!. Drooping jawline, deep dark circles and bags under my eyes, and for the first time in my life--wrinkles! Crows feet, those stupid furrows between your brows, some lines on my forehad, and a sort of repulsive crinkely neck. I think I looked 55, if not older. So my Mom took me to Target and purchased the microsculpting kit, i.e the serum package with the cream. I also bought the Olay micro dermabrasion kit and the eye dermapods.     And you know what? After two short weeks, my crows feet were gone! Ditto with the forehead lines. Not only that, but my skin looks much better, more like when I was 33 or so. I keep getting compliments from everyone I know, and now even some strangers are asking how I keep my skin looking like I was 10 years younger or more. I can&#x27;t get over that two simple products can do so much, but they have, and I&#x27;m very happy.    I do suggest you use the serum and the cream together as Olay suggests; results come much faster. In addition, the microderma kit is fantastic! Three times a week and you can kiss your dead, dull skin goodby. Just make sure to moisturize after.    SRK Brown</li>
            <li> Works like it should!</li>
            <li> I think the title says it all. As a moisuriser it does a good job. Did I notice any skin firming, plumping (??) effects after using for 5 (actually 14) days?? nope. So I switched back to my old moisturiser to see if any effect that I was not noticing would disappear. Nope.&lt;br /&gt;So, maybe if I had deeper wrinkles than I do I would see a huge difference but for light crows feet and laughter lines - nothing.</li>
            <li> Feels rich on the skin. Good product, pleasant scent and feel. Would buy again.  You can&#x27;t turn back the clock as much as you&#x27;d like but you must do what you can for aging skin. It&#x27;s ok, not a miracle worker. Only your fairy godmother can erase all wrinkles from aging.</li>
            <li> Other than &#x27;Micro-sculpting,&#x27; I&#x27;m not sure exactly what this serum is supposed to do. I can tell you what it didnt do. It didnt moisturize. It didnt remove any lines. It didnt remove bags under my eyes. I didnt belnd any different colors. It didnt smooth out any rough texture. Now im young, so what I can say is it didnt make anything worse, maybe I didnt use it long enough to see results, or maybe I&#x27;m not the target skin type and I am a guy. But to be fair, I still dont know what micro sculpting means...</li>
            <li> Just a quick comment on this product. It pretty well works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;I get a lot of sun and use it on the crows feet. There are no miracle creams&lt;br /&gt;out there but you can tell a subtle difference with this one.</li>
            <li> I used this serum with microsculping cream. I was amazed to see the difference it made over the night. My pores got smaller, my jawline was lifted. But after a week of application, I noticed my skin looks darker and drier. And even I can&#x27;t apply foundation over these anymore. I didn&#x27;t have any breakout but it might be my reaction to these line. Since I like the way it works,  I will take a break and retry.</li>
            <li> The price was a fantastic deal &amp; the product is great &amp; I see results....my only negative is that one of the two bottles that I purchased was half full, I&#x27;m not saying that it was used but that it didn&#x27;t have the correct amount in that bottle as it was supposed to have</li>
            <li> I thought my skin feels better after using this product for about 2-3 weeks. But then I developed a bad allergy from it. I now have hive-like bumps all over my face and neck, and they are very red and itchy.</li>
            <li> I like Olay, this product is not any better than other brands I have used, so I wouldn&#x27;t buy this Micro-Sculpting serum again, because could get another brand for less in cost, with the same results.</li>
            <li> I got this product because I&#x27;ve been using Olay regenerist mosturizing cream successfully for four years.  It is non-irritating and left my skin smooth.  I wound of buying this Olay micro-sculting serum because Costco offered a special of $20.00 off two Olay mosturizers and two of these Olay serums.  I had never used this serum before.  However, like other reviewers, I&#x27;ve determined that this product and this product alone was the cause of very irritating red rashes under and over my eyes.  Initially, I was suspicious this product caused irritation.  But, like other reviewers here have said, I looked elsewhere for the problem, never imagining that an expensive, reputable brand would cause such harm to my skin.  Once I thought these was the problem and stopped using it completely for a few weeks and used only basic, organic makeup.  During that time, my face and eyes felt no irritation and stayed smooth.  Last night I tried using it again and like clockwork, I had the most irritating red eyes by the morning.  Mind you, I made a concerted effort not to use it around my eyes, but possibly rubbing my eyes contributed to the problem.  Either way, I will never again use this product.  It really hurts a lot to use it at this point, like where I had trouble sleeping.  I have to assume Olay used some inflammatory chemicals in this formula which is causing the problem.  What a waste of money, even with the Costco discount.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still fairly young, in my mid-twenties, so I wanted to try this in the pursuit of line prevention rather than getting rid of pre-existing lines.  After using this daily for two weeks, I don&#x27;t seem much of an improvement to my skin, but it does feel smoother to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is pretty lightweight and soaks in quickly.  It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky at all.  It&#x27;s not particularly hydrating.  If you&#x27;re someone hoping to use this in lieu of a moisturizer - don&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s not going to prevent or heal dryness; you still need to use your usual lotion or cream after.  (If you&#x27;re serious about preventing aging, then don&#x27;t forget your sun protection.  That&#x27;s the #1 thing you can do to keep your skin youthful!)</li>
            <li> I love the weight, smell and feel of this product.  I only use it at night because I have oily skin and I worry it would be too heavy during the day.  When I put it on at night, I swear I can actually feel it doing something, like a pulling of my skin.  I haven&#x27;t used it in conjunction with the other Olay products, I have used it with Murad and Dr. Brandt, but the results have been great.  It makes my skin smoother and feel nicer.  I will definitely be buying more of this product, and may even try out the other products in the Olay lineup!</li>
            <li> This serum is a superb product.On the first application my skin was smother glowing and visibly.younger.This serum.out performs Caudalie vinexpert serum which costs 80 dollars for one tiny oz.I&#x27;m really amazed. I will never buy expensive face creams again..Its not necessary.</li>
            <li> This serum by Olay is another quality product at a great price. The serum has a wonderful smell. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and it&#x27;s non-greasy. I usually have break outs if a product is even slightly greasy, but after several days of using this, I&#x27;ve had no problems at all. I love the bottle and pump works great. I would certainly recommend this product and would be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my wife who is always looking for the \\&quot;ultimate\\&quot; face cream.  I&#x27;m sure this is the true search for the fountain of youth.  Thus the search is one that will truly last a lifetime.  After using the full contents of the bottle my wife claims that the cream made here face feel soft and smooth.  It does not leave a greasy feeling and that it did a good job of hydrating the skin all day long.  Did it make her skin appear firmer?  Well as she said \\&quot;The jury is still out on that claim.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt; And no dear readers, I did not mask this \\&quot;Vine\\&quot; order as a gift.  I just thought that since it was available to have her continue in her search for the \\&quot;fountain of youth\\&quot; so be it.  She said if she could give it 4 1/2 stars she would.  Hence the 4 star rating.</li>
            <li> The Olay Regenerist products are my go to products.  I have been using Olay since I was in my 20&#x27;s.  I Love it.</li>
            <li> I have used Olay Regenerist Micro-sculpting cream for a long time and am a big fan.  Am thrilled that Olay has come up with a similar product in a serum,pump bottle formula.  Although I&#x27;ve found that using a tongue depressor to remove product from the jar works well, it&#x27;s so much easier to dispense it from a pump bottle.  We all know that, as we age, our skin loses elasticity.  This product has truly helped my skin to feel smoother and tighter.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product love how you can subscribe and get even a better deal this is a very good product will continue to have it automatically sent to my home with is great price and quick service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using regenerist daily serum for about 2 years and really like it.  I read all the hype and decided to try the micro sculpting serum and compare.  The consistency is different; the daily serum is thicker and, some might say, a bit greasy.  The micro sculpting serum sinks into the skin faster and feels lighter.  I use both products - the daily serum in the morning and the micro sculpting serum (with a small amount of the micro sculpting cream) in the evening.  I don&#x27;t know if I notice a visible difference after using this new serum. Perhaps I need to use it twice a day. I like it regardless and wil probably continue to use it.  UPDATE:  it&#x27;s been about a month; still using it once a day with a little micro sculpting cream on the \\&quot;problem areas\\&quot;.  I think I am noticing a difference.  The other day, a co-worker actually told me my skin looked great.  I guess this stuff works and, since I&#x27;m not getting any younger, I just ordered another bottle.</li>
            <li> WORKS ABOUT LIKE OTHERS FOR SALE.  HAVE YET TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WORKS AND THAT YOU CAN AFFORD SO WILL PROBABLY NOT REORDER</li>
            <li> From a family member&#x27;s viewpoint who tried the product: The Olay Regenerist product was slightly greasy and the fragrance was awkward.  It was slightly strong and the actual scent wasn&#x27;t too appealing.  Since it is Olay, you are paying for the name somewhat.  If there was a fragrance free version with a little less greasy feel at a slightly lower cost, it would be worth trying.  However, as it stands now, the product simply isn&#x27;t worth trying again to see if can deliver as promised.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this because the price was lower than the department store brands. I had to stop using it because it caused  acne in me, along with a strange looking crusty rash. Also, I didn&#x27;t like that it doesn&#x27;t moisturize at all. When I applied it to certain  areas, I had to add moisturizer afterward, because my skin looked dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> Great serum great price..loaded with vitamins and antioxidants! Skin is left with a healthy glow. All skin types. But for dry or very dry need moisturizer over it.&lt;br /&gt;Skin shows improvement within 1-2 weeks. Only this one has fragrance, I do prefer fragrance free.</li>
            <li> The first thing I want to say is that this was a terrible product for me, but that does not mean it will be a terrible product for you.  I was fortunate enough to inherit \\&quot;good skin genes\\&quot; from my mother, so my skin looks a good ten years younger than it is.  But at age 68, I was noticing distinct dry areas and felt that a \\&quot;heavier\\&quot; moisturizer was needed, so I bought Olay Regenerist Micro-Scupting Serum and matching moisturizer.  I noticed immediately that the serum and moisturizer seemed to create a kind of unpleasant layer over my skin, which I definitely did not like.  After one month&#x27;s use, I noticed a plugged pore on my right cheek.  After almost two months of use, I awoke one morning to find three HUGE red acne bulges on my cheeks and two on my forehead and my skin was an oil slick.  Luckily, my Retin-A took care of those right away, but I did continue to break out with acne such as I had never, ever had in my life.  At first I blamed it on my somehow coming into contact with topical testerone, since my husband applies it to his shoulders and upper arms.  But after another month of being very careful not to risk contact with this substance, I have come to the conclusion that it must be the Olay product.  I do have fair, overly-sensitive skin and I do have a history of having trouble finding skin products that are beneficial and do not produce deleterious effects on my skin.  So, I am not going to say this is a terrible product, but it is a terrible product for me.  My mother, a true redhead whose gorgeous fair skin never saw the sun, was a faithful user of Merle Norman Cosmetics all her life and she also had extremely sensitive skin.  I may visit them very soon.  Either that or it&#x27;s back to Olay Total Effects Serum and moisturizer for me and perhaps a little olive oil.

            <li> The skin care world is rife with hyperbole - reverse time! anti-aging! maybe even a back to the kindergarten movement. All that exaggeration can make it difficult to find the truly useful products for those of us who just want our skin to look nice. This is one of the better products out there - Olay Regenerist Micro-sculpting serum won&#x27;t reverse time, but it certainly helps my skin look and feel smooth and soft. I haven&#x27;t noticed any miraculous age-fighting effects; however it is a nice, light moisturizer. I have very dry skin and use it under Olay Total Effects lotion with SPF15. The serum has a light, flowery fragrance that I like, and it feels good going on. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a month, so maybe it takes a little longer to have an age-fighting effect. But really, it&#x27;s quite good and doesn&#x27;t need to rely on absurd claims to be a worthy product.  Full disclosure: I usually use Olay Regenerist Daily serum; the Micro-Sculpting serum is less \\&quot;serum-y\\&quot; and more lotion-like. Both are excellent, so it&#x27;s largely a matter of personal preference. I&#x27;m a fan of Olay products, and this one lives up to the brand&#x27;s usual high level of quality. (from Mrs.718tech)</li>
            <li> After going through one bottle, I noticed that there was a noticeable difference in the reduction of fine lines especially near the eye area.  The serum absorbs fairly well and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.  Skin appeared smoother and more hydrated.</li>
            <li> After using this product for only two weeks, it works. Just that simple. I don&#x27;t know how it works; I just know that the naso-labial lines in my face are diminishing, and so are my \\&quot;chin dents.\\&quot; I didn&#x27;t even buy it from Amazon (and paid almost $25.00 for it). But I&#x27;ll be ordering it from Amazon from now on. I&#x27;m 51 and for a long time looked way younger than my true age, but all of a sudden time started catching up with me. It wasn&#x27;t quite a panic, but yeah, kinda. But this product is turning back the clock. It&#x27;s too soon to say how much it can undo, but I only care that it&#x27;s working. My skin is hyper oily, with dry spots around my eyes and mouth. This product goes on without a shine, but I do get \\&quot;breakthrough shine\\&quot; in the middle of the day. My remedy? I wash my face and reapply. I haven&#x27;t used it at night like the directions suggest. I use Olay Definity at night, because it&#x27;s too light for my skin tone and makes me look ghostly in daylight, but it did nothing for my \\&quot;jowling\\&quot;. Maybe it&#x27;s a combination of the two. Maybe it&#x27;s just that I found this stuff before things had gone too far.  In any event, I&#x27;m wowwed. I&#x27;ll post before and after pictures once I figure out how. No matter your skin type, I say give this a try.</li>
            <li> I use this with the Regenerist cream and the two together are amazing. Over the last year I have seen my complexion even out and my skin tone improve dramatically. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about them. I starting seeing a real difference in the first couple weeks and over time it just gets better.</li>
            <li> Came within the range provided for shipping. Ultimately, well packed and is as it states. Good job.  For those of your wanting to know if it works: give it time and it does, esleciay around forehead and eye lines.</li>
            <li> The Olay Regenerist serum has a really nice texture. It has a light fragrance that is also pleasant.      The lines on my forehead really bother me, and it has seemed to make a difference with them (I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a week now). I&#x27;m actually impressed, and it makes me want to try the new Olay Professional RX series.</li>
            <li> I was quite skeptical about this product. Number one I have used Clinique since I was 16 - and that was quite a long time ago!&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, years ago I had tried an Oil of Olay product and it did not play very well with my skin. I was very hesitant to try this product. Plus there seems to be a lot of hype about it being as good as department store brands......&lt;br /&gt;I was,  dare I  actually say it?, impressed with the product tough and now I feel that I CAN reccommend it....- even for sensitive skin. The scent is light and very pleasant and the texture is really creamy and dreamy - and has a biit of a shimmery,silky look to it.&lt;br /&gt;Do I think it is a miracle cream? No, I don&#x27;t. I do, however think that is is an excellent cream that does offer benefit to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;At my age, I never figure too much will help - but I can give this a two thumbs up and a high recommendation!</li>
            <li> I just got my Olay regenerist today.  It got here faster than the original estimated arrival date.  So thankful for that.    The smell is so fresh I like it, glides smoothly without any greasy feeling.  So far that part I like.    I&#x27;ll send another review again after the 5 day advertised date that Olay says that I will see that difference.  Im hoping to change my star rating after that time.</li>
            <li> I love this serum! As a \\&quot;mature\\&quot; woman, I still have combination skin.  This Olay product is perfect in keeping my dry areas moisturized while not making the T zone too oily.  It absorbs well and feels light when applied.  You don&#x27;t need much, so one bottle lasts at least six months.  This is a wonderful product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Let me begin by describing my skin, issues, and desired effects and what I have experienced so far. I am 44 years of age with fair skin that would be classified as combination which is both sensitive and adult acne prone (I take an antibiotic twice a day to keep it under control). I am experiencing menopause with extreme hot-flashes which has only compounded my oily T-zone. I am told by people that \\&quot;I look good for my age\\&quot; (30&#x27;s rather than 40&#x27;s) but I notice small wrinkles around my eyes (crows feet) and what I would call creases around my mouth (laugh lines?) and a line that goes across my forehead (an expression line?). I would like to have the crows feet disappear (especially since they are very light as is) and have the lines around my mouth and forehead become less visible. I have also noticed the skin on my neck is less firm. I began using the products 3 days ago and as for what I have experienced so far-&lt;br /&gt;1. Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub: I really like the wash. It is a gel type wash not creamy. It is a very light scrub; without harsh scrubbing particles. It does have a very noticeable scent - I like that it isn&#x27;t medicinal but almost perfume like. After washing my face felt squeaky clean but not dry or tight. What I liked the best is it did not leave the feeling that I have oil or lotion on after I wash.&lt;br /&gt;2. Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream: This is the product I was very nervous about trying since it said nothing about being Non-Comedogenic. I have been using it sparingly and only at night. I chose to start using it only at night due to it being a cream - I was afraid it may be heavy and cause me to become oily. Neither has been the case. It goes on smooth and applying sparingly is all you need to do (a small amount goes a long way). I can&#x27;t say I have seen any results with my wrinkles as of yet (as I said above I have only used it 3 nights) but I have noticed a change in the softness of my skin and appearance of brightness; It felt wonderful on my skin from the first moment I applied it. It leaves your skin feeling silky smooth. The first night I used it I felt quite a bit of stinging on my face, but I left it on. The second night, the sensation was less and last night I felt little to no stinging. I have noticed my skin is a bit raw/sensitive feeling (I notice it mostly during exercising/sweating or if I use a wash cloth across my face in the morning) but I hope this will cease with continued use. There isn&#x27;t any redness or visible signs of irritation. I can&#x27;t be sure as of yet but I think my complexion is clearing...I haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts and the few I had have gone. The cream, like the wash, has a noticeable fragrance; but again I rather like the scent and it goes away rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;3. Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum: I was most excited to try this product since it says \\&quot;Dermatologically  Tested, Non Comedogenic (won&#x27;t clog pores), Fast- Absorbing and Non Greasy. Suitable for everyday use for normal, dry, and combination skin\\&quot;. Plus it boasts results in just \\&quot;after 5 days\\&quot;. I could just copy and paste what I wrote above with the exception - I have been using this product during the day. As I mentioned above - I get very nervous using new products and start in baby steps. I plan to begin using as the directions instruct and apply these 2 products together; first applying the serum and topping off with the cream. The serum also leaves your skin feeling silky with no oily feeling at all. These products soak in instantly and you feel the results the moment you apply it. Now, lets hope to see results with the lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to give it a month - and I&#x27;ll let you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Ok - it is now March and I&#x27;ve tried the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream for at least a month (in total time). When I first began using it on my face, I used it a week or so before adding the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum. After using the 2 products for aprox.a week I began to have small pimples around my mouth and on my cheeks. I stopped using both; let my face clear and began again with just the cream. After aprox. a week or so the breakouts started again. So, I stopped using the cream; let my face clear and started using the serum (alone). Again- my face broke out. By the time I figured out the products wouldn&#x27;t work for me....I missed the return window. Since I had to keep the products - and it is far too expensive to throw away, I use it on my neck/jaw line and between my breasts (twice a day). I haven&#x27;t really seen a change...but again...much too expensive to throw away, so I&#x27;ll use it in these areas until it is gone. It does moisturize well...and the areas look better with use, but nothing dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;Since I did want to find something that wouldn&#x27;t break my face out and would help reverse time - I bought a facial cream and under eye cream by Patricia Wexler(Bath and Body Works) - LOVE it! NO breakouts...and most importantly it&#x27;s WORKING!! Intensive Night Reversal and Repair Cream &amp; the Intensive 3 in 1 Eye Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensative/acne prone skin these Olay products may not be for you.a week I began to have small pimples around my mouth and on my cheeks. I stopped using both; let my face clear and began again with just the cream. After aprox. a week or so the breakouts started again. So, I stopped using the cream; let my face clear and started using the serum (alone). Again- my face broke out. By the time I figured out the products wouldn&#x27;t work for me....I missed the return window.

            <li> Nice moisturizer keeps skin smooth all day</li>
            <li> And this one is no exception. It goes on nicely and spreads well. Best of all, I see good results when I use this nightly.</li>
            <li> I love Olay products, but I am not thrilled with Olay Micro-Sculpting Serum. I have been a user of the Regenerist Daily Serum for years and thats a great product. But the Micro Sculpting does not Sculpt, its doesnt really do anything. I also tried the Micro Sculpting Cream and that was way too heavy for my skin and caused breakouts. So I decided to try the serum instead and while it didnt cause breakouts, it also didnt do much of anything. I have seen absolutly no difference in my skin after using this product daily, morning and night, for 2 months.  No difference in my jaw line, my neck, no lifting, no firming, no overall difference in condition of skin.  Cannot really recommend this product and I will not purchase it again. Is it a nice moisturizer, yes...... but does it do what Olay claims, not in my experience.  I rate it a 2 because it does not do what Olay claims it will, it does not sculpt, lift or firm.  Sorry Olay, but you have let me down on this one.</li>
            <li> I deleted my first review because I reviewed too quickly. The first week using this line was phenomenal. My skin looked and felt great. However, two months in, I&#x27;ve taken a turn for the worse. I don&#x27;t have problem skin. I&#x27;ve always taken good care of it. I get the odd blemish now and again, but for the most part I&#x27;m clear. Holy bajoly, this stuff clogged my pores. I&#x27;m broken out, my skin is dull, and I look and feel like an oil slick. I have dry skin to the max, but you wouldn&#x27;t know that to look at me. I continued using this for several weeks past what I should because I blamed everything else under the sun: stress, hormones, weather, even food choices. But it&#x27;s clear to me now it&#x27;s the product.    I wanted this to work, mainly because I dropped about $100 on several products in this line, thinking if I went in for the whole load I&#x27;d get the best results. I figured eventually it would save me money. No, this was a fairly expensive mistake for me. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with skincare. I can&#x27;t think of any other brand, cheapo or department store, that caused such major issues for me. Some have been better than others, but none have been like this.</li>
            <li> This product was my worst nightmare. I applied it once and I woke up with a saggy neck. I&#x27;m so devastated. It least it could have done nothing but it gave me a problem I&#x27;m still waiting for the turkey neck it caused to go away. I&#x27;ve been doing neck excercizes and nothing is helping.</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;ll be reversing the hands of time with this, but I like the fact that it&#x27;s not greasy and goopy and seems to texturize my skin nicely.</li>
            <li> I am just finishing up my second bottle after getting it at my Warehouse Club as a two pack. I&#x27;ve used this exclusively from December 24th 2010 - May 10th 2011 (I have less than a quarter bottle left, it will be gone within two weeks.) and I have to say I saw a slight difference in the area around my eye. I&#x27;m 28 and have hereditary bags and dark circles so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much under my eye, what I was getting worried about was the droopiness of the skin under my eyebrow, it was encroaching on my eye lid!    By the time I cracked the second bottle is when I saw results without having to have my face an inch away from the mirror, however these results are subtle and I didn&#x27;t receive any comments about looking more awake. I am satisfied with the product but I won&#x27;t be purchasing this particular serum again. I don&#x27;t feel the benefit is worth the cost but I will look to other products in the Regenerist line. A quick add-on is that during my time using this serum religiously morning and evening I have noticed fine wrinkles around my eye area and the serum didn&#x27;t combat them in any way or make them better.</li>
            <li> I love using olay regenerist micro sculpting serum; it is not oily and helps make my face feel smoother.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful product and I especially love the&lt;br /&gt;idea of giving my neck area special treatment especially&lt;br /&gt;here in Tucson AZ</li>
            <li> Maybe it was something I did, but I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my skin after almost a month of using it. All I really wanted it to do was hydrate my skin, because I have dry sections on my face.  However, I noticed that the serum didn&#x27;t hydrate my skin that much, as just a few minutes after application, my skin became dry again.  I also didn&#x27;t notice my skin getting firmer or \\&quot;brighter,\\&quot; as I was promised.  For the price, I expected at least moisturized skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how Oil of Olay came up with the description for this product -- what is Micro-sculpting--, but it does a good job of moisturizing my skin.  I find it to go on easily. It has a faint scent which is pleasing.  I do not believe in miracles from any facial product be they inexpensive or products purchased for $300.00+ dollars, so this is a fine product that does what it purports to do--moisturize.</li>
            <li> When I use it, it makes my skin feel lovely and soft, but the reason I bought it was to hopefully reduce wrinkles especially around my eye and mouth area. I have been using it morning and night every day since it arrived, but I can honestly say I haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction in these wrinkles. I&#x27;m feeling a little disappointed that I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Denise</li>
            <li> This is the second time buying this product for my wife. She loves it very much and says it works great..</li>
            <li> I purchased this together with the Olay Regenerist Night Elixir almost a month ago.  I am 67 years old and have never purchased any type of anti-aging products and have never used any type of Olay products.  I have always taken good care of my skin but noticed wrinkled lines on both sides of my mouth area.  I cannot afford any type of surgical procedures and felt hopeless.  I am so stunned that this really works that I keep looking in the mirror!  The wrinkles are almost totally gone!  Please give it time to work....I used these morning and at night for a month.  This is almost too good to be true but it is!!!  I will always order Olay products!!</li>
            <li> This Serum, used together with the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream, is really working, better than products costing three times as much!  My 50+ yo skin is feeling and looking smoother and the crows feet around my eyes have noticeably diminished.  I will definitely keep using these Olay Regenerist line products.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this Olay product.  While is goes on smoothly, I did not see a difference in my skin.  The pump provides just the right amount of serum and it blends in smoothly.  I used the product for 14 days now and I do not see that there is any improvement with lines, wrinkles, or moisturizing.  I also am not at all fond of the peculiar scent.  It is rather pricey and not worth the money.  I much prefer other Olay products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for almost a month now, and really like what it does for my skin. It absorbs well, and almost right away after applying it, I notice a \\&quot;plumping\\&quot; effect that makes my skin&#x27;s texture smoother and more regular. I love the way my skin feels... silky smooth and yes, with regular use, actually firmer. The bottle is actually a decent size - almost two ounces, so while it&#x27;s pricey, it lasts a while.    On the negative side, I was hoping that this stuff was going to permanently improve my skin, at least a little bit - the regenerative effect the name suggests - but when I stopped using it for a couple of days, my skin returned to its former wrinkly self pretty quickly. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but a good product nonetheless when used regularly and consistently.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is pretty awesome. It absorbs so quickly that you can put makeup on right away. I haven&#x27;t particularly noticed my fine lines vanishing, but that never really happens with moisturizer. What I can say is that this product is a real keeper.</li>
            <li> I used the product as directed and noticed my skin did feel slightly tighter. The product has a pleasant \\&quot;spa\\&quot; like aroma to it and feels fine going on. But my skin felt a little bit \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; throughout the day after using it, even though I made sure I rubbed it into my skin in a circular motion as directed. The other disappointing thing about this product is that it offers no additional benefits such as sunscreen or a cooling sensation going on. I prefer to \\&quot;multi-task\\&quot; with my skin creams so I don&#x27;t have to apply so many layers and waiting for each to dry before the next, since my mornings are hectic. The product recommends use twice a day. So although the product concentrates on one attribute, tighter, firmer skin, and although the price is competitive, there are multi-tasking products that are a better value because of their added benefits. There are also products that worked better for me and didn&#x27;t feel greasy. So I plan to return to my other cream when I finish this bottle.</li>
            <li> Like most skin-care products, this one promises more than it can deliver. It&#x27;s advertised to make skin significantly firmer and more radiant in just five days. I used it for three times that long before I could see any difference, and that was just that the skin seemed more hydrated. Of course, that is desirable if you are middle-aged or beyond so I would have continued to use it except that I was showing signs of possible allergy to it by the time I discontinued it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and am allergic to a list of substances including tea, so when I saw that the ingredients include camellia sinensis (tea), I approached the product carefully. I tested it on the skin inside my elbow and got no reaction, then used only a tiny bit at first.  I was able to use the product for 3 or 4 weeks without a problem except that my skin was more sensitive to the sun than it was with another product (a moisturizer which contained a little sunscreen). FInally I looked it the mirror one day and noticed some new discolorations on my cheek plus a darkening of the circles under my eyes, so I decided to stop using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since tea allergy is not terribly common (although not as rare as you might think), most users should not have a problem with this. By the way, aluminum starch is listed as an ingredient and that doesn&#x27;t sound like something you want to use in large quantities although it is considered safe in small amounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will probably want to add a sunscreen in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would prefer a fragrance-free product but did not find that this has an objectionable odor. It has a soft feel and spreads easily.</li>
            <li> Soften and tighten the skin. I stopped using it for a month and notice the difference of my skin texture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 years and it really has helped hydrate my skin.  I live in a dry desert area and am in my early 60&#x27;s.  For the price this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Feels great on your face.....almost like a layer of silk!! Love it! Light scent is great, too!</li>
            <li> I like how the product feels and the way it makes your skin feel, I just don&#x27;t like all the ingredients they put it the product. It smells nice and it goes on smoothly and makes your skin feel smooth but for me I have not really noticed a difference in it being age defying.</li>
            <li> It took a while to see the result, but this sculpting serum seems to work in smoothing out shallow wrinkles. It doesn&#x27;t feel oily and is easy to apply twice a day. It&#x27;s nice that you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it each time. A couple days ago I noticed that this is also carried by my local Costco and is covered by their general refund policy.</li>
            <li> When my RoC product ran out, I decided to try this product that claimed to tighten and lift the look of aging skin. As usual with this type of product, it&#x27;s a wrinkle plumper, not a tightener. After the first application, the skin around my laugh lines and forehead wrinkles plumped up making my skin look swollen, like tire tread. I&#x27;m reordering the RoC CompleteLift Serum that actually tightens my skin and makes it look flat and smooth. At least Amazon offers these products at half the price of a drugstore. [[ASIN:B0018S6MO6 RoC CompleteLift Serum, 1.3-Ounce Bottle]]</li>
            <li> I really like this product.. It feels great on the skin. Havent used it long enough to say if there is any difference in my skin but so far im really happy with it</li>
            <li> Nice product.  Smooths and not greasy serum.  Nice feeling too!</li>
            <li> This is one of the few products that made a noticeable difference on my skin. My eyelids were beginning to look like crepe paper. No more after using this product. Now my eyelids look plump and wrinkle free again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Olay Regenerist products and use them all the time. Compared to the super expensive department store brands this is a steal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  It&#x27;s non-greasy and  performs as advertised.  I use it on the backs of my hands also.  Remember to use sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Good seller. I would order from this seller again. However, this serum is not as good as the olay regenerist micro-sculpting cream. Olay recommends to use this product in combination with micro-sculpting cream for the best result, however, that leaves lots of residue on your face and makes your face looks like a clown. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this serum again. It is wasting money.</li>
            <li> I have been using olay regenerist micro-sculpting serum for over a year.  It is as good as the expensive creams that I have previously used.  It is certain worth the price,  I love using it.</li>
            <li> I would not want to be without my Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculping serum it really does help my skin look great!</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  I keep trying other &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; products, but don&#x27;t have the same results, so I keep going back to this.  Makes my skin feel flawless.</li>
            <li> It smells and feels nice, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin whatsoever. It didn&#x27;t break me out, either, but we are all different.</li>
            <li> I saw no difference after using the product for 1 month</li>
            <li> very good,I love it very much.</li>
            <li> The product&#x27;s box was dented and half opened when it was received.  The bottle had serum leaking out from the sides of the top.  It did not look like a new product.  Now I need to spend extra time and money in order to get a refund. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> At sixty-four, I&#x27;ve used all kinds of moisturizers.  Having had dry skin my whole life, I started to use a moisturizer when I was about seventeen.  I didn&#x27;t wear a foundation; just moisturizer and lipstick. Without the former, I&#x27;d be a mass of wrinkles at my current age. Without the latter, someone would have already buried me because I look like I&#x27;m dead with no lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never bothered with drug store moisturizers much because I was a snob; plain and simple. In high school, I worked downtown and bought my moisturizer in the local department store.  I think my first moisturizer was made by Clinique and from there, I just kept trying others.  Seriously, how dry did I think my skin was?  Plain old Vaseline would have worked just fine.  Ah, but ignorance was bliss and I never knew how uneducated I was until I read a book by Paula Begoun.  Brothers and Sisters, she helped me see the light!  And the inside of a drug store!  It was her book and  the demise of Prescriptives  that made me decide to try this new Oil of Olay series that was being advertised. A born cynic, I didn&#x27;t think it would make any difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose the Regenerist line, based on my skin type, and I&#x27;ve never looked back.  The Micro-Sculpting Cream was the first to come out in that line, I believe.  I used it faithfully, morning and night, and I liked it.  It didn&#x27;t make my skin break out and combined with a Mary Kay mask I&#x27;ve used week for ages, my skin looked nice.  I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles but that&#x27;s not because of anything I&#x27;ve done.  It&#x27;s my mother&#x27;s good genes and the fact that I&#x27;ve always hated sitting in the sun!  But I truly think this product has helped my skin look better. I  have very sensitive skin and many \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products make me break. I tend to stay with chemicals as much as possible and this product appeared to have a nice mix of the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Olay came out with a Regenerating Serum that was white and came in a 3.4 ounce bottle.  You were supposed to put that underneath the original Micro-Sculpting Cream.  With the manufacturers&#x27; coupons and the sales in various Drug Stores, you could get the pair for a very reasonable price.  The combination didn&#x27;t really made a difference in my skin. I figured maybe it was doing something I couldn&#x27;t see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, all of a sudden, I couldn&#x27;t find my white Regenerating Serum.  Instead, this Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum was on the shelf in its place.  I muttered and complained and waited until I found a coupon for it and then waited for a sale.  I was sure this would make my skin break out and besides, it cost more and I was getting only half as much in a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it.  I have to say that within about two weeks, I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference this Serum made in my skin.  I&#x27;ve always had dark circles under my eyes.  So did my father.  And doctors had always said it was due to my allergy. Suddenly, my black circles were lightening to grey.  My skin looked terrific!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t actually know how long I&#x27;ve used it but the combination of the two products has kept my skin soft and while I have a few brown sun spots and some wrinkles, my skin looks really good. I&#x27;m not bragging.  When I go to a department store, the painted ladies always ask which of their moisturizers I&#x27;m using.  They quickly change the subject when I say it&#x27;s Oil of Olay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend it strongly enough.  We&#x27;re all going to get wrinkles but if we can slow the process down, we&#x27;re fools not to do it and this product is the one that&#x27;s helped me the most.  Good luck to anyone who tries it and I hope it works as well for you as it has for me.ere supposed to put that underneath the original Micro-Sculpting Cream.

            <li> So, I am a fan of Olay products, and I like lightweight lotions. I also buy and make serums (sera) frequently.  But this stuff...meh.  Not moisterizing. I don&#x27;t have dry skin, so any moisteriser is usually fine. But this does nothing...I have to apply moisteriser with it.  Now as a serum, it doesn&#x27;t act as a make-up primer, or smooth anything. Waste of time for me.</li>
            <li> Am noticing deep wrinkles starting to even out.  Will continue to use!!!</li>
            <li> This is the first wrinkle product that I have used that I can honestly say shows actual results in a few weeks. I have used many different high end products like this and this serum is hands down the best, and the price was fantastic on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Super light and absorbs fast. It was recommended by BubzBeauty as one of best serums out there -- even compared to the more expensive stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, after a week, my skin did feel smoother -- this has never happened with any other product (e.g. such noticeable effects in a short period of time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOARD THIS STUFF when it goes on sale!!!</li>
            <li> Enjoyed this products ease of use and light fragrance. It blends well into the skin and helps ease the little lines, etc.</li>
            <li> Just started using this for a few days now so I don&#x27;t see any results (obviously too soon) but I like the satiny feel it leaves on my skin  Update this I believe started making my eyes burn. I stopped for a few days and the burnjng is gone. Too bad because my skin looked nice but this side effect outweighed the benefits. Looking for something else now.</li>
            <li> Love this as a moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been using oil of olay for years and this is my favorite beside the regenerist serum. Goes on smooth, feels light and has a light shimmer to it. Everyone think I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s but I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s lol. I just tell everyone that I use this</li>
            <li> I waited to review this product until I had used it for over a week.  I have to say, that I have not noticed much of a difference in either the appearance or texture of my skin.  It may be because I use a moisturizer routinely, but that said, it is not an \\&quot;anti-aging\\&quot; product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am middle age, have dry skin, especially so because I am in the trpoical sun a lot.  I do not, however, have wrinkles... so if that is what this is intended to address, it was lost on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it absorbs quickly and is not greasy.  It also smells nice, but did not make a noticeable difference for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few days that I used this product, my skin peeled a bit, much like products containing retinal.  I had to go to the product description (the print on the bottle is too tiny for me to read) to see if it did.  It does not appear to, but my skin reacted similarly (to products containing retinal or retin-a).  Consequently I thought, perhaps, it was via exfoliation that skin might looks brighter, younger (exfoliants do have that effect as they reveal new skin underneath).  Apparently I was wrong about how it works.  That said, it did not do much for me.  I&#x27;d say, from my personal experience, it is a nice moisturizer, but I am not willing to pay this much for a moisturizer.  However, it is surprizing, given that I spend a lot of time in the tropical sun and have dry skin issues to boot, that I didn&#x27;t notice much difference beyond what I get with more or less generic moisturizing creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give this product 4 or 5 stars if it was priced in the same range as the products I use, but a very much more expensive product should give you something more.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum\\&quot; comes bearing the promise that it will penetrate into the skin&#x27;s surface to deliver a super-concentrated amino-peptide +B3 complex.  It claims that it will provide extra hydration for the skin to make it significantly firmer looking and regenerate its appearance.  It claims to be fast absorbing, and non-greasy, and to give a user younger-looking skin, without drastic measures, within just five days. The skin, it claims, will be plumped, and look brighter and more radiant.  This particular skin product also comes to my house enthusiastically spoken of by some friends and acquaintances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for at least the recommended five days, and I do believe I see some change for the better and brighter in my skin.  Mind you, as I&#x27;ve recently said in reviewing another skin product, I&#x27;ve reached the age --I&#x27;m retired, after all -- where I&#x27;ve been spending heavily on department store products, and cosmoceuticals, that promise exactly the same results.  And I&#x27;ve also been investing in some procedures that promise the same results.  So maybe I really can&#x27;t make this fine a judgment call, and shouldn&#x27;t be reviewing this product now, or at all.  Nevertheless, I do think I see some extra results.  And I do not appear to be allergic to this product, nor does it appear to be upsetting my skin, as some other products do: the package states it has been dermatologically tested so as to be non-comedogenic; that is, it won&#x27;t clog the pores, causing breakouts, nor does it appear to be heavily perfumed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product goes on smoothly, is pleasant enough to deal with, and, in comparison to some department store brands and cosmoceuticals, is quite reasonably priced.  And it appears to deliver on its claims.  So what don&#x27;t I like about it?  It is a Proctor and Gamble product, and, as a card-carrying PETA member, I have been trying to boycott P &amp; G&#x27;s multifarious products for upwards of fifteen years.  The firm has a long record of treating animals terribly in its laboratories, and, to me, no skin cream is worth the suffering of innocent creatures.  There are many other comparable skin care products delivered to market without animal testing: you&#x27;ve only got to read the labels to find them.  So I&#x27;ve been doing for fifteen years, and so I will continue to do.of treating animals terribly in its laboratories, and, to me, no skin cream is worth the suffering of innocent creatures.

            <li> The Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum is decent product for the money.  It goes on smoothly and feels very light on your skin.  It even has a nice scent.  It isn&#x27;t heavy like a lot of the creams on the market.  Many similar products are very expensive, but the Olay products are much more affordable.  As far as how well this seems to work...it wasn&#x27;t terrible, but it wasn&#x27;t an overnight miracle cream either.  I have sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t cause any break outs or skin allergies.  After several weeks of applying this product daily, my face seemed softer, but it didn&#x27;t smooth ever imperfection my face.  I can&#x27;t speak to how this product would work for long term use, but I would recommend it if you are looking for softer, more supple skin.  Overall, it is worthwhile product.  Olay&#x27;s products work well and are a good value.</li>
            <li> I USE THIS DAY AND NIGHT WITH MY OTHER SKIN PRODUCTS. IT HAS MADE A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE IN MY SKIN APPEARANCE. MY SKIN TEXTURE AND FIRMNESS HAS IMPROVED USING IT.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on reviews and have not been disappointed.  I use this serum with the other Olay Regenerist products such as day and night creams.  I especially like the auto ship which is very flexible in how often you receive the product.  Would definitely reorder and will continue with auto delivery.</li>
            <li> Really enjoying how my skin looks &amp; feels from using this product.</li>
            <li> I still am not sure I like this. It seems to sting some.</li>
            <li> Item as described. Delivered very quickly. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase :)</li>
            <li> No outer packing&lt;br /&gt;Is not the real thing</li>
            <li> I only use Olay products and like all the others I use this one lives up to the Olay reputation of being great for my skin.  I have been using the Regenerist version for 2 years and am completely satisfied with the results.  People have even complimented me on my smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Very hard to find this product &amp; I have used it for years - really makes my skin soft on my face &amp; I like the smell as well.  The price was good &amp; it arrived very quickly so I actually saved money buying it online - no using up gas in the car trying to find it in the stores!  Will def. order from this vendor again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this line of Olay products for quite some time and I really like them.  I did not care for other Olay products I&#x27;ve used in the past as they were too harsh for my skin.  I have had no trouble with this line however and although not a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; product on my 58 yr. old skin, I do feel like they make a difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oil of Olay for over 20 years.  Unfortunately the price keeps going higher and higher.  So I put this on Subscribe and Save and they are very affordable.  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> For the record, I love Olay.  Since I started using their products about 3 years ago, I have noticed an appreciable difference in the quality of my skin.  I don&#x27;t understand how they do it, but my skin is much less dry, with fewer fine lines and wrinkles.  Whoo-hoo!  I went camping last weekend with my son&#x27;s preschool, and one of the preschool moms stared at me and said jealously - \\&quot;Is that how you look in the morning????\\&quot;  Thanks to Olay, it is.  And the micro sculpting serum  continues the streak.  It glides on smoothly, yet it makes such a difference in my skin that I&#x27;m wearing less and less make up, which makes my life, as the mom of a preschooler, so much easier.  Yeah, Olay!</li>
            <li> Well, my husband, Jeff, gave me this product and said try it and let me know what you think.  So, I did.  But, I decided I wanted to tell you what I experienced.     I used my normal routine at night, cleaning my face, applying the Olay Regenerist and then additional products for moisture.  After about two weeks, I did notice a small amount  of results around my eyes but nothing major to be reported.     I have used Olay and L&#x27;Oreal products my whole life since I was working in a drugstore and took a seminar/education course on beautification offered by another product. They taught me a lot about make-up and layering in very light layers which promotes the natural look.  I in turn have passed those techniques on to my kids.  These are both very good products.     Pricing seems to be in the available range so should sell well.  The results, thou limited, do what it says it will do.  Of course, we will never be 18 again, so enjoy life and accept the little things that make you look better.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 40&#x27;s. My face is not very dry, and tends to oiliness in the t-zone, but the skin is definitely losing its firmness and starting to head south a bit.  I&#x27;ve used this serum daily for almost two months now.  I started out using it morning and night as recommended.  But during the day, using the serum, moisturizer, and my foundation all together was just too much. It made my face too shiny and oily.  This may be partially due to the heat and humidity of summer, but I didn&#x27;t typically have those problems before adding the serum to my routine.  After using the serum for a few days and having those issues, I decided to only use it at night. The serum by itself seems to provide enough moisture for my t-zone, so I apply the other moisturizer over the serum only on my cheeks and neck.           Since using this product, my skin seems to glow a bit more (not shine), appears a bit less saggy (lines aren&#x27;t as marked), and it feels softer to the touch.  There&#x27;s not a dramatic difference... I don&#x27;t look in the mirror and say WOW!, but it does seem to have helped.     The product has a nice silky feel when I am applying it, and a light clean fragrance.  The bottle has a pump top that dispenses a small amount of serum.  I use two to three pumps each time because I have very short hair and treat my whole neck, back of neck included, with my face care regimen.  Even using the serum at that rate, the bottle feels as if it might have another month&#x27;s worth of product in it.  As long as it has lasted, and with the results I have noticed, I think this is a good price and nice product, and would recommend that anyone with aging skin give it a try.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised that I noticed an instant improvement when I applied the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum. It surprised me so the next time I thought I&#x27;d try it one just one side of my face to compare the difference. It actually does seem to work as advertised to &#x27;plump&#x27; and hydrate the skin. The effects aren&#x27;t permanent or anything and the next day (even after 5 days) my skin would look the same. The scent is very light and (at least on my skin - not dry, not greasy, in the middle) it goes on a bit greasier than I expected. A little goes a long way so even though it&#x27;s not cheap at around $16 with subscribe and save it&#x27;s definitely a solid affordable product.</li>
            <li> Nice price and product as expected.</li>
            <li> Product was received on time for a very good price. Olay is always a quality product that does what it claims it should do.</li>
            <li> This product is for normal skin. My skin type is dry skin, this product gave me irritation and gets more dryer if I it as the direction of this product on package. It is fine if I put skin softner before I apply it.</li>
            <li> I love this serum. It goes on very smooth and absorbs quickly. Leaves skin silky smooth. Have recommended this to friends and they love it as well</li>
            <li> Didn’t do a thing for my skin. I was hoping it would but no such luck. Still looking for a product that really has an effect on my skin but haven’t found it yet.  Oh well.</li>
            <li> This is a great mosurizer, I have been using this olay and the total olay mosurizer for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> I have been using this now for the past couple of weeks and am very pleased with the results.  My skin seems so much smoother with noticeable reduction in the appearance of wrinkles!  I love it.</li>
            <li> Makes skin amazingly soft</li>
            <li> Good product, recommended, by my dermatologist to help control rosecea. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year.  It seems to help in combination wit he ROC and medication.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s all in my mind, but I can tell a nice difference in my wrinkles when I use this regularly. There seems to be no lasting effects, but I&#x27;m afraid to stop using it. It is a nice moisturizer and base for my mineral makeup.</li>
            <li> I have been using it since OLAY developed this line.  It has sunscreen and leaves skin very soft.  The only thing, this time the bottle was unscrewed within the packaging and the product was coming out of the bottle.  The people who examine the products after packaging it should check a little closer.  This has nothing to do with the product.  I love Regenerist!!</li>
            <li> The earrings are absolutely beautiful &amp; well manufactured.  The back clasps secure on tightly &amp; hold the earrings in place.  They arrived quickly &amp; were nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> I received this item though the Amazon Vine program.  Honestly, I do not know what it does, or why it works, but it does for some reason.  My wife is in love with this serum and has vowed to buy it again when hers runs out.  She uses it every morning, I assume that&#x27;s the right thing to do, and she tells me over and over that she wouldn&#x27;t go a day without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Ladies, if you&#x27;re on the fence and this review is the one you&#x27;re reading, she absolutely recommends it.</li>
            <li> I saw the add for this product on Olay website - it was under their &#x27;New&#x27; product section. I am 52 and my facial skin was beginning to get a bit saggy around my cheeks and jawline. I was very skeptical if a serum could actually firm the skin as the add stated on their website. Anyhow, I thought I will give it a try and searched for this online - as usual Amazon had the best price. After a week of using this product I saw tremendous changes - firm and bright skin! My friends and colleagues all asked if I have been doing some special beauty treatment such as laser, peal etc. Thank you Olay!</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with this serum and don&#x27;t see any improvement with fine lines or wrinkles. Will use it all but stick to the Olay moisturizing cream instead.</li>
            <li> As a fan of the original Micro-sculpting cream I found this version to be lightweight but still with enough power.  The formula is a serum which when applied correctly and before moisturizing, absorbs into the skin with ease only leaving a slight touch of greasiness but not enough to bother my combination skin.  Small line creases in skin have diminished within the last month of use but they have NOT disappeared.      I recommend it for daytime use before your makeup routine.  Do NOT expect miracles but your skin will see a slight improvement.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s just a slight tint to this, so I think part of its dramatic effect is that it&#x27;s kind of like having very light makeup on.  But, it definitely plumps up the wrinkles and twice per day use as directed, particularly after the peel kit, has shown obvious results for me in the last month.</li>
            <li> works as advertised, firmer skin in four to eight weeks</li>
            <li> Good anytime! Alone or under micro-sculpting cream!</li>
            <li> This is not a serum, but more of a cream. It is yellow cream in the bottle. I bought it because it contains peptides, which is good for the skin. It instantly makes your skin feel smooth. I have just got the product and cannot comment on many of the effects that it promises, but have bought many olay products and they all seem to help my skin do better vs. the loreal products. I may update when I get through the whole bottle, but generally changes take a long time to see any effect, but thus far I am happy with this product. It didn&#x27;t come in the original box, but in an amazon brown box with plastic wrapped around the lid. It took about a week to arrive to me.</li>
            <li> Works for me just fine.</li>
            <li> It is amazing for oily skin and makes my face smooth. I will only put little around and it stay effective the whole day.It is affordable and will recommended it. ❤️❤️❤️</li>
            <li> Because the item wasn&#x27;t exactly the same as it&#x27;s supposed to be!  I think it might be an irregular so to speak, in that it had no fragrance and the texture seems a bit thicker... Offer doesn&#x27;t mention damaged goods....</li>
            <li> This along with Sculpting Cream and Eye Serum are my lifeline . . and I&#x27;ve tried everything.  Have definitely taken 15 years off my face when used daily.  Would never be without!!!</li>
            <li> Tons of good ingredients! You will love it !</li>
            <li> Too soon to give a full review , only o e month of use , but so far so good for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Been in search of a good product that can help with the fine lines (late 30s) and while nothing really seems to work, including lots of expensive products I have purchased, I did enjoy the texture of this product. I put it on under my eyes and when I wear foundation, I put it on underneath and it serves as a primer.  I like the product- but it is not any better or worse for fine lines than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product over the last 3 months, and can definitely tell the difference it made to my skin. I am very happy with this product and I use it at nights after I clean my face and remove all makeups.</li>
            <li> Olay is my favorite and I have tried various products. This is my favorite for in the morning especially. It makes my skin feel silky and my makeup goes on smooth.  Love this.</li>
            <li> I bought this yesterday, I will be posting every wk on results. So far I love it! i used product on night last night and it leaves your skin very velvety and soft. I used it this morning under my Olay spf 15 moistoirizer and i loved how it mixed with it. So far I&#x27;m thinking of trying it nights and mornings I will keep posting on my results for a month to see how my skin changes. I am 27, but I am getting frown lines and I want to prevent any further wrinkles, also I added this around my eyes and I liked the way my eyes weren&#x27;t puffy or didn&#x27;t have dark circles like usual so with my eyes i loved it. The lines around my frown seemed less deep, but then again it might be too soon to tell, but i love the way my skin feels. Will post week 2 on results.</li>
            <li> The product picture shows a boxed product, but mine arrived unboxed, but sealed with plastic.  I like this product, but am concerned about the authenticity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether it is the fragrance-free version but it does take some time for my skin to get used to it. good product and a good buy.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with Olay 7-in-One for my face, so I tried the Regenerist Serum first on my neck. I&#x27;ve started getting some \\&quot;turkey sagging\\&quot; and since I already trusted my previous Olay face products, I decided to try this for the neck. The first morning I woke up, my neck seemed to look a little better (this product promises firming by the 5th day). So I used it on my face too, and as recommended, used the Olay Micro-Sculpting Moisture Cream afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the third morning, my skin looked awful. There was new puffiness UNDER the bags under my eyes, plus wrinkly sagging on my cheekbones that had never been there before! I looked like E.T. the Extra-terrestrial (movie)! And my neck had NEW wrinkles on it! The wrinkles had spread from just in the center of my neck to additional wrinkles slightly to the sides. I said to myself, this has to be something else... but by the 7th morning it was undeniable and even more than the 3rd morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Moisturizer, applied after the Serum, stays sticky, and when I tried wearing it in the morning, my foundation wouldn&#x27;t spread well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone back to my Olay 7-in-One Fragrance Free Moisturizer, which has kept my wrinkles from increasing for two years, and makes my older wrinkles look less obvious, and my foundation goes on smoothly and without getting into creases. I use it in the daytime. I&#x27;ve gone back to my old lightweight night moisturizer from Neutrogena Naturals, and both of these things (thank goodness!) brought my skin back to where it was before. I&#x27;ll be trying these old favorites on my neck, which I&#x27;d never thought of doing. And I&#x27;ll be happier with how I look!</li>
            <li> Really good product for my face.  It seems to be lightening the dark spots better than anything else I have used</li>
            <li> All the product by oil of oay there are really good, no grease , very soft with your skin, it works, I like thsprduct</li>
            <li> Hello. First review for me. Im 24 going on 25. I have a few a little worse/than fine lines on my forehead. Most likely due to tanning and out door sports. I also get a few smile lines after smiling to much. I have to say i was looking for something to correct and prevent. I just put this on my face. Wow after 10min i feel the tightness. So consider this. Im 24 and have minor aging. It worked almost instantly/tightning. If you are a more \\&quot;grown\\&quot; woman than myself it may take a few days or weeks to start showing results but it def should be working. This may be a little to intense for my skin. I will use it once a weeI know it tightens! Hopefully it is ling term. Good luck. Product works. But as we all know like with anything there are a few exceptions who it will not work for. Xoxi</li>
            <li> I have to start by saying that I am big fan of the renerist line. I personally like the micro sculpting cream better. I feel it&#x27;s more hydrating than the serum. The serum versions are easier to absorb and I feel are more concentrated. I like the renerist serum better than this.</li>
            <li> I definitely like this serum it&#x27;s so light and soft! I use this in the morning and before I go to bed at night. This goes on smoothly and make up is a breeze to put over... I put this on my more problem areas like eyes , neck, and forehead and then follow up with a good moisturizer. I used to the o&#x27;oreal youth code serum prior but realized it had alcohol as one of the main ingredients. Olay&#x27;s is noticeably different and doesn&#x27;t have the alcohol. I will definitely be buying this again!!!</li>
            <li> Have used for years... Have sensitive skin and this is the perfect weight and formula for around my eyes and a base ..  Winter time I use a little stronger on exposed areas but this always to start with..</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF. I&#x27;m 57 and people think I  look 35. Maybe it helps. Maybe I&#x27; just BLESSED. LOL</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Goes on like silk not greasy.  Does work before I put on my foundation. For the price, it is worth using.</li>
            <li> I put this on under my moisturizer/spf and it just makes my skin really smooth and soft.  It seems to quench my skin instantly and it&#x27;s very light so you can apply spf and moisturizer on top and it will still feel very nice.</li>
            <li> This serum honestly, truly works!  It is hard to know today, with so many brands on the market, as to which one to pick to help your aging skin.  This is one of the best and on top of that, it is ECONOMICAL!  Have told others about how great it works!</li>
            <li> As a vine reviewer, I received one bottle of the serum which I gave to my wife.  The test is, did my wife buy more and the answer is yes.  She was very pleased with the product and was impressed how it made the puffiness around her eyes less noticeable.  It doesn&#x27;t work miracles but no product does no matter what you hear on those 30 minute infomercials.  And yes, like every product on the market they claim a lot more than they provide but still it does make your skin look more radiant.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in good condition and in  timely manner.  The dates on product are mostly good and one or two might be questionable but I am hoping they work okay.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I am a firm believer in avoiding the sun and attempting to do regular microderms and peels in an effort to minimize the signs of aging. That said, having professional services can be costly (over $100 a treatment). If you don&#x27;t have the monies to do your beauty fixes the better way, then Olay makes some good products. I used the micro-sculpting serum for a little over a month and honestly didn&#x27;t see much of an impact. I think it does a good job of hydrating but if you are looking for an aging miracle, this isn&#x27;t going to do it. Invest the money and have it done in a professional way (with the Groupons and things out there nowadays, you might be able to get the professional services done for less than $50 and you would see better results).</li>
            <li> Love it.  Does wonders for my face.  My wrinkles are diminished and my skin feels soft.  Makes me look much younger.</li>
            <li> always love this product.  definitely the best price for the product online.  came promptly and packaged nicely.  would recommend the vendor</li>
            <li> Love this product as well as this price! I only gave it 4 stars because the packaging that it arrived in looked like it had been through the wringer. However the merchandise inside seemed unaffected.</li>
            <li> I would never ever buy anything from impossible discount from now on.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product from impossible discount though  Amazon by accident, and the shipping and handling is free charge ,but the original cost was over 13 dollars!&lt;br /&gt;The product came with just half amount, I immediately return it, but I received less than 50% of  original cost !&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the company, they emailed me back saying , it was used and opened! and I have to pay shipping and handling fee!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So bad customer service , I wonder how many customers have the same experience , how many customers rapped off by them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, the another reason i returned this product is I really question about the quality of this product!&lt;br /&gt;So many people&#x27;s pores get blocked by using this one!!!</li>
            <li> I really like Olay products.  I&#x27;m very sensitive to certain ingredients in products.  I liked the feel and lightness of Regenerist, but there is something in this that makes me itch and my face red.  I don&#x27;t want to say anything bad about Olay, because it has always worked well for me.  This product just wasn&#x27;t right for me.</li>
            <li> I am a regular user of most all Olay products.  I&#x27;ve used the Micro-Sculpting Serum in conjunction with the Micro-Sculpting Cream.&lt;br /&gt;They both work very well and are not as expensive as other products that are not even half as good as Olay.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day.  I have seen positive changes in my skin. Six more words; six more words</li>
            <li> I have used many anti aging lotions and potions in the quest to keep my skin looking young for as long as possible. I am turning 40 next month.&lt;br /&gt;While I have some redness due to sun damage over the years ( I am very fair skinned with blond hair, blue eyes) I have no wrinkles or real issues.&lt;br /&gt;I will break out if a product is to heavy thou.&lt;br /&gt;This serum glides on and you can feel it soak in. I love how silky it feels and the way my skin absorbs it.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels softer but I see no difference in the redness. But I was told by a medical professional before that the only way I was going to get rid of that was thru laser treatments.&lt;br /&gt;I like to use it during the day since I use retinol products at night. However there is no spf in it so I have to get my sunscreen from my foundation or a seperate lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I do like it thou and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin but this is a very light substitute for heavy moisturizers.  I am sure I will have to use a moisturizer with it in the winter.  But for spring and summer, it is great.  It does reduce the wrinkles &amp; lines that come along with being 45.  But I do love this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum since 2010 and am thrilled with it. I have very oily skin so must use a serum in lieu of a cream or lotion. This one has been the best I&#x27;ve tried and I could see a noticeable improvement in my skin texture. This stuff is wonderful. I have also tried ROC and Boots No 7 and couldn&#x27;t see any improvement with those. I&#x27;m staying with this product. Thanks, Olay!</li>
            <li> Would rate it higher but there is a fragrance.  As a man, I don&#x27;t want perfumey products. No smell &#x3D; clean!</li>
            <li> Love the application.  I am in my late 40&#x27;s.  So far, I have been blessed with no wrinkles.....however, I am experiencing the sagging in my neck and eye area.  This really makes a difference.  I don&#x27;t mean it is a cure....but make my problem less apparent.  I highly recomend this product.</li>
            <li> I spend time with research on facial care which is affordable and rates among the top for my skin type.  I have come back to this 2-3 times after using something which was guaranteed to give results....wrong</li>
            <li> olay always good. love this product. still dont get any problems for any olay products so far for many years i buy and use them.</li>
            <li> Performs as expected.</li>
            <li> Smells good and causes no skin irritation.</li>
            <li> Love the moisturizing effect this product produces without feeling or looking oily!</li>
            <li> Have been using for years in conjunction with the Micro-Sculpting Cream and have had great results.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this at my local CVS since it was on sale.  I&#x27;ve only used it at night after I shower, and by day 3, I noticed that the texture of my skin improved!  I re-read the box, and they said that most people would see improvement in 5 days.  Today is day 4, and each day, my skin is just getting smoother, I had some dry spots on my cheeks for 2-3 wks, and those spots are gone!  I&#x27;m like, wow, this thing really works.  The serum says it&#x27;ll also help get rid of hyper-pigmentation ... here&#x27;s hoping so!  I highly recommended, especially since I&#x27;ve used expensive department store products and didn&#x27;t see results like this one.</li>
            <li> Looks like it&#x27;s actually helping my fine lines and the firmness of some areas in my face. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I bought Olay Serum because it was touted as a sculpting substance, which I took it to mean it would smooth out some deep wrinkles around my mouth, and firm up my skin, but in my case this has not happened. Maybe other people have different results, after all, everybody&#x27;s skin is different, but I don&#x27;t see any noticeable results. I do like the feel of this serum when I spread it out on my face. It feels silky and delicate. And I do like most of Olay&#x27;s face creams and lotions, with my favorite being Olay Complete SPF 30.</li>
            <li> I have semi-sensitive to normal skin.  Not overly sensitive, I have had many facials, microdermabrasions and chemical peels with normal reactions.  However, after using this for about 5 days my skin got very irritated, it burned when I used my usual sunscreen and makeup.  I have ended up with dry patches and a couple of big zits.  I didn&#x27;t use anything else new on my face.</li>
            <li> I get lots of compliments on my skin and give most of the credit to the Olay products that I use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay sculpting serum and cream for about six years now.  I swear by it and recommend it for any age.  Great price too.</li>
            <li> Good product, like any other Olay product</li>
            <li> Very hydrating, but not sure about &amp;#34;sculpting.&amp;#34;  I use this at night under the Pro X Wrinkle Smoothing cream and it leaves my skin satiny soft the next morning.</li>
            <li> I love all the Olay products and also give them as gifts to family and friends. This is a great product that arrived quickly in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful product. I have always wanted to try. Olay product are good. Great on your skin too</li>
            <li> Any woman who is concerned about aging (wrinkles), this Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum is the answer. I started using this product around the eyes, mouth, and neck area, and noticed a change in 1 week. I am 37-years old, which is a shock to people I talk to; they think I am at least 27-30. I would highly recommend this product. I would also recommend using Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Age Moisture Cream along with the serum to keep the areas around the eyes, mouth, and neck area to have smooth, soft touchable skin. Shh, this will be our little secret. Look 10-15 years younger in just one week.</li>
            <li> When I opened the Olay box, there were obvious finger smudges on the inside packaging. Suspicious, I looked inside the bottle and more than half the bottle was gone. No wonder the price is low...</li>
            <li> This product works best during the evening. It seems to add somewhat of sheen to the skin. Overall though it is a great product. I like the fact it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily or pasty.</li>
            <li> The lady of the house is convinced that this Micro-Sculpting Serum is what keeps her looking AT LEAST ten years younger than her years.  I totally agree!</li>
            <li> My mama likes it very much</li>
            <li> The product was alright, I guess. I&#x27;ve tried many and really didn&#x27;t think this worked any better than the rest. The seller is great and shipped quickly. Packing was also good.</li>
            <li> i ordered the olay regenerist micro sculpting serum and i received a night resurfacing elixir, i want to contact the seller but i cant find that option</li>
            <li> I am trying to economize on skin care products so I decided to substitute this serum for my regular one.  So far I am very pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li> If you want to turn back time, buy a time machine or see a plastic surgeon. If you want smooth skin, small pores, less wrinkles, prevention of new wrinkles, the OLAY Regenerist line does that very well.&lt;br /&gt;Ive been using it for 2 years, and haven&#x27;t stopped. It works great around the eye to keep that fresher, minimal wrinkle look. Im 38, and will probably need stronger products as time passes, but for now this does a great job minimizing the visible signs of aging.</li>
            <li> I have used Olay face products for years.  This product feels wonderful and is great for wearing under Olay&#x27;s tinted moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and love how it makes my skin feel.  I will continue buying, but perhaps not from Amazon - little pricy and have to wait to get it.</li>
            <li> This really works for me plus I love the way it feels. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years after trying all sorts of more expensive brands. I always return to this one. The added bonus is that it&#x27;s fragrance free. The night moisturizer is great too.</li>
            <li> Claims: Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum penetrates into skin&#x27;s surface to deliver our super-concentrated amino-peptide + B3 complex. This fast absorbing, non-greasy formula provides specially designed hydration to give you significantly firmer skin and regenerate skin&#x27;s appearance. The Results? Younger-looking skin without drastic measures. Instantly skin is hydrated and plumped for a more lifted appearance. After just 5 days, skin is significantly firmer. Skin looks brighter, more radiant.  Review: This water- and silicone-based serum doesn&#x27;t have any sculpting ability, either on a micro or macro scale. Hydrating and plumping skin that is showing signs of sagging isn&#x27;t going to make it look lifted-it&#x27;s not as though this serum is a mini face-lift in a bottle. Skin sags for various reasons, mostly due to sun damage that hinders its support structure, the cumulative effects of gravity, and bone loss. Simply plumping skin with moisture isn&#x27;t going to lift it and erase signs of sagging, though it will make skin smoother. The reason this is rated so highly is because it has a lot in common with the other serums from Olay Regenerist. That means with each use your skin is treated to a helpful amount of cell-communicating ingredient niacinamide, skin-identical glycerin, and a cadre of other anti-aging ingredients, including peptides, antioxidants, and more cell-communicating ingredients. This serum contains mineral pigments that leave a shiny finish, which is how this manages to make your skin look brighter and more radiant. The shine factor is the most significant difference between this and the other (less expensive) Olay Regenerist serums. This does contain fragrance.  Ingredients: Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Dimethicone, Panthenol, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Polyethylene, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Sodium Hyaluronate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carnosine, Allantoin, Dimethiconol, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-4, Laureth-7, Citric Acid, PEG-100 Stearate, DMDM Hydantoin, BHT, Disodium EDTA, Tin Oxide, Fragrance, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Titanium Dioxide, Mica.

            <li> For all of the books except for the two they were awesome and I cannot wait for the movie to come out for Fifty Shades of Gray</li>
            <li> I am over 50 and use this exclusively. It does a wonderful job of keeping my skin soft, not tight.</li>
            <li> Product arrived with lotion pumped out of one bottle ordered. Wasteful mess.</li>
            <li> Not as I purchased in store</li>
            <li> A great daily product, affordable...not dramatic, instant results but consistent skin firmness with continued use.  Very comparable to items with much higher price tags!</li>
            <li> I like the Olay Regenerist line.&lt;br /&gt;It feels very soft and silky on the skin, not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li> I prefer the jar better</li>
            <li> I did not get to use this product long enough to determine its efficacy because the smell was way to overpowering. I felt like I could just dab some on my neck and use it as a daily perfume. I figured anything with that much perfume couldn&#x27;t be good for my skin. Besides, I found it highly irritating to be bombarded by this overpowering scent ages after I had applied it. I am not a perfume wearer and I did not intend to have my face cream make me into one.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recomended and buy it anymore because i didn&#x27;t see any improvement for a month now!:(( i feel very disappointed from buying this products!</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum and the other regenerist products for a long time and they really work for me. My skin looks far younger than most people my age.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product daily and was very happy that I found it for such a good price on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We look forward to doing business with this supplier again.</li>
            <li> I always love Olay product. The quality is great. But for the outcome, I still don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> love this product...I can see a difference already and it has only been ten days! Will definately recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love the Olay Regenerist cream. I put it on before going to bed, and I am delighted with the results. I&#x27;ve been getting complements on my skin, which is smoother and less red. I also use the Olay night cream over it to ensure my skin does not dry out. If you want something like this, I would certainly suggest you try this before buying more expensive products. You only need one pump to cover your face.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it.  I have dry skin and this is my daily moisturizer. It has a slight, vague, hint of color which seems to be on the very, very pale golden or super rich vanilla ice cream side. It adds a subtle bit of color but you have to look to notice it. I feel it adds a bit of healthy glow but not so overpowering as to look made-up.</li>
            <li> I really want to like this serum. It&#x27;s highly rated and great value. And I kept trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it blocks my skin from getting the moisturizer I need from my moisturizer so then my skin over produces oil. I end up shiny. Then I end up with break outs. Sigh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t like that for a serum it has make up in it. You can see the little flakes of light reflecting particles in it. Why am I wearing this to bed? I prefer my serums to be clear or milky with no color added. I think this is another reason why I end up with break outs it&#x27;s like wearing make up 24/7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Caucasian with dry skin prone to break outs from irritations.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any results from this product though I use the micro-sculpting cream as my night cream and do like that.</li>
            <li> feels very nice when putting on. Not sure if it sculpts really because I have only used it a few times..but it seems like a very nice face cream!</li>
            <li> She loves the stuff, swears by it. Supposedly feels great and works to remove wrinkles, seems high to me, but whatever makes her happy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Nothing spectacular. I don&#x27;t know what all the hype is over with this. I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    </ol>
