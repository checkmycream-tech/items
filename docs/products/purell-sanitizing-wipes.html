            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Package sometimes comes open--not the best to keep in your purse</li>
            <li>Perfect for overseas travel in Asia.  </li>
            <li>Best.</li>
            <li>Its a great product and</li>
            <li>I have purchased Purrell products before and have thought they were good quality products.  </li>
            <li>Good to keep in the car.</li>
            <li>great on-the-go, but make sure you seal them well</li>
            <li>They seemed to be good for the classroom and safe for kids.  </li>
            <li>I use this for my kids and my grandkids, and it comes in handy traveling..</li>
            <li>Kind of a pain, it would be better if it was a ziplock or something.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>i love these wipes.  </li>
            <li>Too many wipes in a package that doesn&#x27;t reseal well.</li>
            <li>ok.  </li>
            <li>It was nice to have something cool to wipe off with and the germ fighting ability</li>
            <li>Easy and convenient to carry in my backpack or purse</li>
            <li>Really love these alcohol wipes, they leave my hands feeling clean without any residue.</li>
            <li>The cover is much to cheap.  </li>
            <li>think the most it is worth is about .39 cents.</li>
            <li>I especially keep a pack handy if we&#x27;re on vacation, at a concert, or at some kind of festival/fair.</li>
            <li>Good for travel and a quick clean, but beware, the alcohol is strong and might sting sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Purell Wipes are quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Clean feeling, not oily or over moisturized.</li>
            <li>I love the convenience of a wipe for sanitizing our hands on the go - five little kids whose hands are always in everything and always on the go make good sanitizing a MUST.</li>
            <li>These are great, however ladies should know that these are VERY wet</li>
            <li>Love how handy they are, although the &#x27;resealable&#x27; pack doesn&#x27;t work so well if it gets wet at all.</li>
            <li>I love is not too big and easy to carry.convience to use when needed to clean when there is no water around.</li>
            <li>I like it very much, the product is very useful for me because I make dialisis by hand  to my husband</li>
            <li>I love having wipes handy in my purse for cleaning my hands if I can&#x27;t wash them in a restroom, or for cleaning them if they get messy while we&#x27;re out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the difference for a wipe that delivers.</li>
            <li>so if you&#x27;re looking to carry them in your purse, you really need to make sure the flap is very well sealed.</li>
            <li>These wipes are great disinfectants for busy moms of toddlers on the go, who don&#x27;t seem to have enough time to wash their hands in the sink.</li>
            <li>Pack is just the right size.</li>
            <li>Those clean sticky fingers really nicely and don&#x27;t dry out in a day like this pack!!!</li>
            <li>I have  tried several different brands of personal wipes, this is the best, hands-down.&lt;br /&gt;The tissues remain moist and the re-sealable flap works</li>
            <li>The cloth has a great feel and is a slightly bigger size than I expected.</li>
            <li>Makes mess clean up easy</li>
            <li>This allows to much air to get inside the pouch, and the wipes dry to quickly.</li>
            <li>Used these on a trip abroad to keep my hands (and other items) germ free.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to smell</li>
            <li>I keep coming back to this product since I really love the wipes, but the last 5 to 10 towels inside always get dried out and thrashed, no matter how carefully I open and close.</li>
            <li>the cover doesn&#x27;t really stay on so be careful!</li>

            <li> a drippy, slippy, hard to use product.</li>
            <li> At least I can order 10 packs at a time!</li>

            <li> I keep coming back to this product since I really love the wipes, but the last 5 to 10 towels inside always get dried out and thrashed, no matter how carefully I open and close. Switching to an alternative brand.</li>
            <li> I love having wipes handy in my purse for cleaning my hands if I can&#x27;t wash them in a restroom, or for cleaning them if they get messy while we&#x27;re out. I especially keep a pack handy if we&#x27;re on vacation, at a concert, or at some kind of festival/fair. I trust the Purell brand and the smell of these wipes is not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Convenient&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Package sometimes comes open--not the best to keep in your purse</li>

            <li> Best. Wipes. Ever.  Just wish I could find them in a store so I wouldn&#x27;t have to order them.  At least I can order 10 packs at a time!</li>
            <li> I have purchased Purrell products before and have thought they were good quality products.  These wipes were purchased for my son&#x27;s classroom.  They seemed to be good for the classroom and safe for kids.  I was pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Used these on a trip abroad to keep my hands (and other items) germ free. Love how handy they are, although the &#x27;resealable&#x27; pack doesn&#x27;t work so well if it gets wet at all. Since the wipes are wet when you pull them out, you have to wipe off the pack before the seal will work again. Kind of a pain, it would be better if it was a ziplock or something.</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of a wipe for sanitizing our hands on the go - five little kids whose hands are always in everything and always on the go make good sanitizing a MUST. These are just too wet to be convenient. Instead of wipe on, wipe off portability we have a drippy, slippy, hard to use product. I am going back to my old Wet Ones, even though they are slightly more expensive. It&#x27;s worth the difference for a wipe that delivers.</li>
            <li> I like it very much, the product is very useful for me because I make dialisis by hand  to my husband and I desinfect all the surfaces with Purezza towels.</li>
            <li> Really love these alcohol wipes, they leave my hands feeling clean without any residue. The cloth has a great feel and is a slightly bigger size than I expected. The one knock is the cover doesn&#x27;t really stay on so be careful!</li>
            <li> I use this for my kids and my grandkids, and it comes in handy traveling.. Makes mess clean up easy</li>
            <li> Took these to Haiti.  It was nice to have something cool to wipe off with and the germ fighting ability was comforting.</li>
            <li> i love these wipes.  I am very sensitive to smell so I like the alcohol scent that these have vs other hand sanitizer wipes.</li>
            <li> These are great, however ladies should know that these are VERY wet so if you&#x27;re looking to carry them in your purse, you really need to make sure the flap is very well sealed. Lesson learned on my end. Its a great product and I actually like that they&#x27;re so wet, but I now keep them in a flat, zipper compartment in my purse so that it doesn&#x27;t get knocked around and come open.</li>
            <li> Good to keep in the car.</li>

            <li> Too many wipes in a package that doesn&#x27;t reseal well. I got this on the subscribe and save because I couldn&#x27;t find the individually sealed packs. I have located them. Don&#x27;t get this, get the individually sealed units. Those clean sticky fingers really nicely and don&#x27;t dry out in a day like this pack!!!</li>
            <li> Good for travel and a quick clean, but beware, the alcohol is strong and might sting sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have  tried several different brands of personal wipes, this is the best, hands-down.&lt;br /&gt;The tissues remain moist and the re-sealable flap works ok.  I can recommend this product.</li>
