            <li>However, I love what it does for my existing hair, the texture, fullness, and the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>My wife thinks that Revita has caused me more hair loss than what was losing before.</li>
            <li>People have told me that I have more hair.</li>
            <li>Pleased with the result and it  does what it claims it&#x27;s suppose to do within that time period .</li>
            <li>Great product thanks</li>
            <li>form Organix does the better job than DS conditioner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Oh, and one more thing.</li>
            <li>Smells great and makes your hair feel great, not greasy or filmy like lots of other growth products.</li>
            <li>Great product,recommended to friends;they love it too.stopped hair loss and can see some new hair growth.</li>
            <li>I have tried many, many products and I found that the Giovanni Smooth</li>
            <li>This product works very good at helping to decrease hair loss, but shouldn&#x27;t be used as a stand-alone  product to keep your hair from falling out or even growing back.</li>
            <li>Worth the cost!</li>
            <li>The shampoo feels pretty okay</li>
            <li>but I truely believe this product helps with not losing your hair.</li>
            <li>And it hurts my eyes so there&#x27;s definitely some kind of chemical in there</li>
            <li>um lets see 166 as of right now?  </li>
            <li>Stick to the natural conditioners since those usually offer the best results.</li>
            <li>the first couple times you use it.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner and definitely see it working.</li>
            <li>Hair is growing back and scalp feels much better.</li>
            <li>I usually give good ratings for products anyway, because I do my research beforehand.</li>
            <li>The shampoo itself seems good, but instead of this conditioner I would choose some other natural or organic product to support the hair care.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so much thicker.</li>
            <li>Just wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much.</li>
            <li>but it really didn&#x27;t have any effect on my hair at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this is supposed to be for stylists, because this is much more than a 2 month supply!</li>
            <li>New hair growth noticed by my hair care lady!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for all women and men who are experiencing thinning hair.</li>
            <li>High quality with delivered results in fuller, healthier hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s definitely not the right option for you.</li>
            <li>First get a high biotin supplement regiment that will need to be taken daily.</li>
            <li>You new to use both the shampoo and the conditioner .</li>
            <li>I have tried nearly every product on the market and</li>
            <li>First, the product is for Arthur Stark, not Andrea B. Stark.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, after 3 months of use, I cannot see any change in my hairline or any new hair</li>
            <li>The product was clearly advertized as 1000 ml bottles and when it was received the bottles only contained 925 ml&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Delivery was much quicker than I expected too.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s THIN, EASILY TANGLED, DAMAGED or DRY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff doesnt work...I have tried nearly every product on the market and this product just makes your skin tingle the first couple times you use it.  Hair will continue to fall out and I believe that this is false advertising.  Seriously, do some research on it and you will find out without having to spend...um lets see 166 as of right now?  Thats ridiculous for a product that does nothing.</li>
            <li> I noticed a lot of regrowth of new little hairs after using this product. I will continue to use this. My hair feels so much thicker.</li>
            <li> I am using these products along with Spectral.RS and have grown back some hair!&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure which or if it&#x27;s the combination of products so I will not change what has been working for me.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend you give it a try for atleast a few months.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for all women and men who are experiencing thinning hair. I have been using it for six months and there is a noticeable improvement in the fullness of my hair. Great stuff!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is supposed to be for stylists, because this is much more than a 2 month supply! I love this shampoo and conditioner and definitely see it working. Smells great and makes your hair feel great, not greasy or filmy like lots of other growth products. The small bottles of these are a JOKE, horrible packaging and nothing in it. For $70 ($35 each), you get a tiny bit compared to these liters. A must have for every guy!</li>
            <li> The product was clearly advertized as 1000 ml bottles and when it was received the bottles only contained 925 ml&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner combo and that I can get them in a jumbo size! Delivery was much quicker than I expected too.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product very long yet, so don&#x27;t know if it will actually restore hair growth for me.  However, I love what it does for my existing hair, the texture, fullness, and the fragrance.  I usually give good ratings for products anyway, because I do my research beforehand.</li>
            <li> This product works. I have been using this product for over three years and it works! Worth the cost! Try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps. I have also been using propecia with this product but I truely believe this product helps with not losing your hair.</li>
            <li> It works for me. Hair is growing back and scalp feels much better. Just wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much.</li>
            <li> Great product,recommended to friends;they love it too.stopped hair loss and can see some new hair growth.</li>
            <li> Product delivered in a timely manner. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> It has really helped my thin hair!</li>
            <li> I started to use Revita shampoo and conditioner 4-5 months back. I was loosing some hair before but now I have lost a lot. My wife thinks that Revita has caused me more hair loss than what was losing before. I&#x27;m still waiting to see if anything grows back.</li>
            <li> People have told me that I have more hair.</li>
            <li> Pleased with the result and it  does what it claims it&#x27;s suppose to do within that time period . You new to use both the shampoo and the conditioner .</li>
            <li> I have had amazing results with Revita Shampoo and Conditioner.  I was losing quite a lot of hair and these products have stemmed the tide of hair loss and even thickened up my hair!! Great, great products.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Great product thanks</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since August &amp; my hair is getting healthier than it has been in years.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast shipment and product works great. High quality with delivered results in fuller, healthier hair.</li>
            <li> Great product, I look forward to continued use.  Will post updates and let everyone know if I stopped loosing anymore hair.</li>
            <li> This product works very good at helping to decrease hair loss, but shouldn&#x27;t be used as a stand-alone  product to keep your hair from falling out or even growing back. I have been using this combination for about six months, and the areas I had been balding have started to grow in baby hairs. Now I didn&#x27;t get these results solely by using the shampoo and conditioner. You have to use a combination of treatments to ensure the best results. First get a high biotin supplement regiment that will need to be taken daily. Next either get Propecia or minoxidil prescribed to you. Now I am no rep for DS Labs, but I am personally using their Spectral DNC-L after I use the shampoo and conditioner. I had my hair falling out in chunks before I started doing this, and now I can see it all coming back.</li>
            <li> I just got this product few days ago. I do not see any results yet, but I just want to send a warning to all of you out there who are considering to buy this duo. The shampoo feels pretty okay and hopefully will get the job done. When it comes to the CONDITIONER it&#x27;s simply not worth the money. My hair gets tangled very easily so I always use a conditioner while washing my hair. This product simply did not meet my expectations - it felt like I did not put any conditioner at all! If you have hair that&#x27;s thin, easily tangled, damaged or dry it&#x27;s definitely not the right option for you. The shampoo itself seems good, but instead of this conditioner I would choose some other natural or organic product to support the hair care. I have tried many, many products and I found that the Giovanni Smooth As Silk Deeper Moisture Conditioner works best for me, or even Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner form Organix does the better job than DS conditioner. That&#x27;s just few examples - there is a lot of products out there! Match them with your hair type and you&#x27;ll be happy with the results. Stick to the natural conditioners since those usually offer the best results. All hair is different so just keep that in mind. My warning goes out to people with hair that&#x27;s THIN, EASILY TANGLED, DAMAGED or DRY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and one more thing. The label on the bottle says: \\&quot;If desired, follow with a high-quality conditioner\\&quot;. It does not even mention the DS conditioner! So you should not feel obligated to but that brand to get the results desired.</li>
            <li> First, the product is for Arthur Stark, not Andrea B. Stark.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, after 3 months of use, I cannot see any change in my hairline or any new hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using the products as prescribed for another month or two to see if there is a change.&lt;br /&gt;At this time, my rating would have to be &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; based on two factors:&lt;br /&gt;  1- The cost of the product&lt;br /&gt;  2- Following directions 100% for almost  3 months without any noticeable change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arthur Stark</li>
            <li> My friend talked me into buying this as if it thickens your hair and grows new hair like crazy. I really didn&#x27;t see any benefit of using it, it was very very expensive, I was too lazy to return it so I decided to finish the bottle to see if anything helps but it really didn&#x27;t have any effect on my hair at all. And it hurts my eyes so there&#x27;s definitely some kind of chemical in there but it&#x27;s not helping my hair grow. I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a year and while it has not generated growth where hair is entirely gone, it seems to have thickened existing hair.</li>
