            <li>however the seller NewvoBeauty, did sent it off quick</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Holds very well and the VOLUME!!</li>
            <li>Also made for some fun &#x27;beauty stocking stuffer&#x27; additions to girlfriends.</li>
            <li>tiny bottles (2 grams) but still a fabulous product for a fabulous price!</li>
            <li>Not as good as other hair powders.</li>
            <li>so I guess I&#x27;m doing it right.</li>
            <li>The small size is great to tuck into your purse or pack for a trip.</li>
            <li>I love that I can get volume from just a teeny tiny bit of this powder.</li>
            <li>So glad I found these on Amazon in these smaller sizes.  </li>
            <li>My hair stylist first tunred me onto this product.</li>
            <li>I really adds volume, and it holds!  </li>
            <li>Also, if you use more than just a pinch your hair feels gross.</li>
            <li>It works but gets hair s not dirty if you sprinkle too much on</li>
            <li>I was having a hard time finding this in stores, so I am very happy to find it here, and at this low price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light that I can barely tell if I got any on.  </li>
            <li>I use less product but still get nice volumized and texturized hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair too and as my permed hair grows out, it separates in the back.  </li>
            <li>She reports this product adds to her hair volume and really helps when styling her hair.</li>
            <li>It really felt like baby powder and went on like baby powder and made my hair respond as if I&#x27;d put baby powder on</li>
            <li>I really do.  </li>
            <li>I am very picky about hair products and it flaking and dulling and drying your hair.</li>
            <li>and then all it really did was make it feel sticky...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>the size is a Great travel size, this lasts forever since a little goes a long way and keeps y flat fine hair voluminized all day long!</li>
            <li>Noe, i do a light curl, put the powder, shake shake shake , and flip back up, pin it to the sides , and it stays up all day long!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also going to try what another reviewer said which was to put some powder on your fingers  and rub into the scalp instead of shaking directly onto the scalp.</li>
            <li>This powder does what I have been trying to do for 20 years, completely changes the texture of my hair, volumizes, gives it the tousled look, makes the ends piecey.</li>
            <li>This stuff is different, not original big sexy hair powder product.</li>
            <li>thin, long hair and Osis made it look and feel a lot thicker, I was hoping for similar results with this product based on all the good reviews...</li>
            <li>, it just lays flat, even if i use hair hot tools, the curls don thold for long.</li>
            <li>I havw thick but fine hair.</li>
            <li>First of all its visible on dark hair.  </li>
            <li>Be careful you don&#x27;t use too much</li>
            <li>Im tired of using hairspray that its damaging my hair even more than the hair tools.</li>
            <li>This styling product is fast, simple and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky and dry like hair spray does.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After reading the reviews here on Amazon, I was sure that I had discovered my long lost secret.</li>
            <li>Not long enough hold.</li>

            <li> I havw thick but fine hair.</li>
            <li> First of all its visible on dark hair.  </li>
            <li> Be careful you don&#x27;t use too much</li>
            <li> Im tired of using hairspray that its damaging my hair even more than the hair tools.</li>
            <li> This styling product is fast, simple and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky and dry like hair spray does.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading the reviews here on Amazon, I was sure that I had discovered my long lost secret.</li>
            <li> Not long enough hold.</li>
            <li> It left my hair gooey and flat.</li>
            <li> It gives lift and volume to my naturally thin and silky flat hair, and helps in giving grip to my hair so that I am able to put it up or tease it for added lift without without worrying about it falling down.  </li>
            <li> and then my hair feel flat again.</li>
            <li> Third, I have thick long hair, so it works for me first 30</li>
            <li> One way to prevent too much powder coming out is to cover half the holes with your fingers as you turn the bottle upside down.  </li>
            <li> It does not cause itchiness in my sensitive scalp although it does give me dandruff when I wear it consecutively for a few days without washing my hair.</li>
            <li> If you have normally greasy hair or if you use a little too much dry oil or other product that leaves it too greasy.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work like same products other brands.</li>
            <li> It made the hair feel dry</li>
            <li> My hair has no valume when i dry it</li>
            <li> The bottle&#x27;s directions says to apply on dry hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to blow dry my hair with a bunch of products in it.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this stuff can be a disaster if you use too much</li>
            <li> Does not work as well as the dry shampoo sprays.</li>
            <li> It seems that several reviews stated that you only get one small bottle...</li>
            <li> I tried it 3 times, once using a small amt, next using a larger amt and last hardly using any at all; same results each time.</li>
            <li> I like this product - it only takes a little amount to provide volume.  </li>
            <li> Need to be careful about amount used so it works as it should.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was disappointed because I expected more from it.</li>
            <li> which was half way dry by the time I got to powdering.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try these before  committing to a bigger bottle, and I wanted a small bottle to take with me when I travel for a non liquid option.</li>
            <li> I have short thin hair and this is the only product I need to give it the volume and shape I want!</li>
            <li> I bought this based on all the good reviews but was very disappointed by it, I have used Osis+Dust</li>
            <li> A couple of the reviews said that that the powdery substance feels a little wet when you feel it.</li>
            <li> Plus, I asked the seller a few questions and they responded crazy fast!</li>
            <li> I just sprinkled a little where my cowlick lurks.  </li>
            <li> I just create a part and sprinkle a little on, and rub it in.</li>
            <li> This product worked for a little while</li>
            <li> This adds just a little volume where you need it.  </li>
            <li> I have very dark hair</li>
            <li> but I applied on my towel dried hair (as did my hairdresser)  </li>
            <li> Just a few little sprinkles and no more greasy look.</li>
            <li> little bit in the root, move it with your fingers and BAAM !</li>
            <li> I like the small bottle size as it travels well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes in a small container</li>
            <li> Reminds me of the old &amp;#34;Minipoo&amp;#34; from years ago.&lt;br /&gt;Hair feels dirty after.</li>
            <li> Second makes my hair look dirty, greasy.  </li>
            <li> I think this has a lot to do with the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> then hair starts feeling dirty and the volume falls flat...</li>
            <li> Very small size.</li>
            <li> It does give a slightly tacky feeling, which accounts for the added grip, but it never makes my hair look greasy or oily or weird in any way.</li>
            <li> Hairdresser recommended for thin hair.</li>
            <li> Does not do anything go to Sally&#x27;s or beauty supply its a fake!</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch, IDK.</li>
            <li> And, I don&#x27;t want to tease the crap out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will look awful if you don&#x27;t know how to apply it.</li>

            <li> Purchased this for my 25-yr-old daughter for a stocking stuffer. The small size is great to tuck into your purse or pack for a trip. She reports this product adds to her hair volume and really helps when styling her hair.</li>
            <li> I will never use hair spray again! This styling product is fast, simple and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky and dry like hair spray does. Nice find!</li>
            <li> A lighter product than I am used to, but am starting to get used to it.  I like the small bottle size as it travels well.  Will purchase again.  Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic to give boost at the roots and to help give texture to your hair. This size is perfect for travel or the gym bag.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair. It&#x27;s healthy - but, my DNA has given me fine hair. Cool - but, I want \\&quot;Hollywood Hair\\&quot; - or, I guess I could say that I want Jersey Shore hair. And, I don&#x27;t want to tease the crap out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews here on Amazon, I was sure that I had discovered my long lost secret. Erm. Noo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a small container and you shake the powdery stuff onto your hair. A couple of the reviews said that that the powdery substance feels a little wet when you feel it. Maybe I got a bad batch, IDK. It really felt like baby powder and went on like baby powder and made my hair respond as if I&#x27;d put baby powder on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have brown hair - with red highlights and it DIDN&#x27;T make my hair turn white. So, that part was nice. It made the hair feel dry (like it had baby powder on it). It didn&#x27;t smell like baby powder, although that would not have bothered me. (No odor.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I&#x27;ll use it a couple more times just to make sure that I don&#x27;t - for sure like it. I should be fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed because I expected more from it.</li>
            <li> I like this product - it only takes a little amount to provide volume.  I should have paid closer attention to the size of these bottles.  Very small size.</li>
            <li> Ordered another 4. My friend introduced me to this product , and i love it. My hair has no valume when i dry it, it just lays flat, even if i use hair hot tools, the curls don thold for long. Im tired of using hairspray that its damaging my hair even more than the hair tools. Noe, i do a light curl, put the powder, shake shake shake , and flip back up, pin it to the sides , and it stays up all day long!  POW POW!</li>
            <li> Not as good as other hair powders.</li>
            <li> love it.. works great to give me the volume i need... will buy again!!</li>
            <li> A friend told me about this product and I absolutely love it! I have very fine hair and Powder Play gives me the boost it needs!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work like same products other brands.</li>
            <li> First of all its visible on dark hair.  Second makes my hair look dirty, greasy.  Third, I have thick long hair, so it works for me first 30 -40 min. Won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
            <li> Great for adding volume, and I have oily hair so I feel like it drys my hair out in a good way, and helps me to skip a washing the next day.</li>
            <li> This is baby powder not the actuall stuff! Does not do anything go to Sally&#x27;s or beauty supply its a fake!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t seem to get the hang of using this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and works great on my hair! I&#x27;ve searched for something that would help my fine hair stand up and I&#x27;ve used countless number of products and nothing works like this stuff. Highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I really do.  It&#x27;s like incredibly good  coffee for your hair.  I wish I had invented it.&lt;br /&gt;--Paige Jackson</li>
            <li> Seriously I love this stuff!  The only problem is that I thought the bottles were bigger than they were but that is my fault I didn&#x27;t read the description well enough.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after my hairdresser said it works wonders for those wayward cowlicks.  I have fine hair too and as my permed hair grows out, it separates in the back.  Hairspray works but then my hair feels sticky.  This worked like a charm. I just sprinkled a little where my cowlick lurks.  One way to prevent too much powder coming out is to cover half the holes with your fingers as you turn the bottle upside down.  I&#x27;m also going to try what another reviewer said which was to put some powder on your fingers  and rub into the scalp instead of shaking directly onto the scalp. The bottle&#x27;s directions says to apply on dry hair but I applied on my towel dried hair (as did my hairdresser)  which was half way dry by the time I got to powdering.</li>
            <li> I love that I can get volume from just a teeny tiny bit of this powder. I don&#x27;t have to blow dry my hair with a bunch of products in it. I also don&#x27;t have to use a curling iron close to the roots anymore which means healthier hair! I havw thick but fine hair. Seriously, this stuff can be a disaster if you use too much or you sprinkle it all over your head of hair. Use a dime sized amount at your roots only. Not all over your hair! I am very picky about hair products and it flaking and dulling and drying your hair. It will look awful if you don&#x27;t know how to apply it. I think this has a lot to do with the negative reviews. This stuff is styling gold! Also, if you order the smaller bottles, you do get a four pack of the product. Great for putting one in your purse or make up bag.</li>
            <li> So glad I found these on Amazon in these smaller sizes.  Great for travel, which I do a lot, and can bring these with me. Also made for some fun &#x27;beauty stocking stuffer&#x27; additions to girlfriends.</li>
            <li> tiny bottles (2 grams) but still a fabulous product for a fabulous price!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist first tunred me onto this product. the size is a Great travel size, this lasts forever since a little goes a long way and keeps y flat fine hair voluminized all day long! Doesn&#x27;t make my hair look oily or greasy either. Will order again</li>
            <li> This was not like it was described. It left my hair gooey and flat. I tried it 3 times, once using a small amt, next using a larger amt and last hardly using any at all; same results each time.</li>
            <li> Any one with fine hair will love this product.  I really adds volume, and it holds!  I was having a hard time finding this in stores, so I am very happy to find it here, and at this low price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light that I can barely tell if I got any on.  But the results are fantastic - so I guess I&#x27;m doing it right.</li>
            <li> This powder does what I have been trying to do for 20 years, completely changes the texture of my hair, volumizes, gives it the tousled look, makes the ends piecey. I put it all over my hair, at the root to the ends and rub it in like shampoo kind of. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Does not work as well as the dry shampoo sprays. It feels like powder dumped on. Reminds me of the old &amp;#34;Minipoo&amp;#34; from years ago.&lt;br /&gt;Hair feels dirty after.</li>
            <li> Great stuff at first...then hair starts feeling dirty and the volume falls flat...booo</li>
            <li> It seems that several reviews stated that you only get one small bottle... I got 4. And I LOVE this stuff. It really is amazing.</li>
            <li> Use it every day! I have short thin hair and this is the only product I need to give it the volume and shape I want! Maybe a spritz of hairspray just for good measure. I love this stuff. Plus, I asked the seller a few questions and they responded crazy fast!</li>
            <li> I love it a beautician used on my hair and I just had to order some. Thank YOU!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try these before  committing to a bigger bottle, and I wanted a small bottle to take with me when I travel for a non liquid option. I loved this product! It gives lift and volume to my naturally thin and silky flat hair, and helps in giving grip to my hair so that I am able to put it up or tease it for added lift without without worrying about it falling down.  I have very dark hair and you can never see any residue. I just create a part and sprinkle a little on, and rub it in. It does give a slightly tacky feeling, which accounts for the added grip, but it never makes my hair look greasy or oily or weird in any way. It&#x27;s perfect and I use it several times a week!</li>
            <li> My hair is fine so I wanted a volumizing product to give the roots more lift. This product worked for a little while and then my hair feel flat again. Also, if you use more than just a pinch your hair feels gross.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff wish I could buy it by the pound lol</li>
            <li> Hairdresser recommended for thin hair. It works but gets hair s not dirty if you sprinkle too much on</li>
            <li> I bought this based on all the good reviews but was very disappointed by it, I have used Osis+Dust It Matifying Powder and it only takes a tiny bit of it to see big results, but with the Big Hair brand I had to use a lot to see any difference in my hair and then all it really did was make it feel sticky...I have thin, long hair and Osis made it look and feel a lot thicker, I was hoping for similar results with this product based on all the good reviews...I will not buy this again, going back to Osis...however the seller NewvoBeauty, did sent it off quick, I ordered one a Tuesday and received it on Saturday...I would buy from them again, just not this product.</li>
            <li> Love it! It is easy to work in the roots. You can fit this size in your purse or pocket so you never have to run out of volume. The product doesn&#x27;t stink . Very easy to comb it out and the stickiness and stiffness goes away once you comb . It does not cause itchiness in my sensitive scalp although it does give me dandruff when I wear it consecutively for a few days without washing my hair.</li>
            <li> Volume with out teasing ?? Are you kidding me ? Really really surprise about this amazing product !&lt;br /&gt;Put little bit in the root, move it with your fingers and BAAM !&lt;br /&gt;Love it :D</li>
            <li> Holds very well and the VOLUME!! Omg</li>
            <li> I have been using this product to aid in backcombing my fine hair and for adding texture.  I have found that if I put a tiny bit on my fingers and massage in my hair I get a much better result than shaking the bottle over my head.  Also putting a tiny bit on my backcombing brush helps as well.  I use less product but still get nice volumized and texturized hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff ever invented.  I use it to give my hair volume plus do some spiky stuff in the back.!!</li>
            <li> Read all the reviews and purchased the product and love it. Need to be careful about amount used so it works as it should.</li>
            <li> This adds just a little volume where you need it.  If you put a bit on the ends of your fingers and put it into your hair at the roots, it works best.  Lasts forever.</li>
            <li> This works great at making your hair manageable and giving it a more thick and full look. It adds a lot of lift to your hair. Be careful you don&#x27;t use too much or you won&#x27;t be able to run your fingers through your hair. It can make it tangle a bit.  This also works great to remove a greasy look. If you have normally greasy hair or if you use a little too much dry oil or other product that leaves it too greasy. Just a few little sprinkles and no more greasy look.</li>
            <li> This stuff is different, not original big sexy hair powder product.</li>
            <li> Perfect purchase!  Quick shipping - LOVE the product.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> One container was open and powder was everywhere, but I guess I can&#x27;t complain for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smaller containers than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Not long enough hold. Does it&#x27;s job mostly</li>
