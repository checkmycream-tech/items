            <li>You probably would throw it away because you can&#x27;t stand using a sponge for years and not because it changes one bit in its prowess to keep your skin feeling good after having a bath with it.</li>
            <li>loved it.  </li>
            <li>Always looking for a good source of these shower scrubbers.</li>

            <li>It reaches your back without any issues, lathers great when you apply body wash, it&#x27;s just awesome.  </li>
            <li>I used it twice because of how good and refreshing it made me</li>
            <li>Kind of like a puff scrubber.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s effective.  </li>
            <li>Extremely effective at exfoliation.</li>
            <li>Nice to find it online</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price and it does a nice job</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, exfoliates superbly, and makes efficient use of soap.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s really nice.</li>
            <li>It stays very clean (and hair-free!)</li>
            <li>We are so excited to see this now available through Amazon at a great price!!  </li>

            <li>It lathers up great, keeps soapy, exfoliates skin, rinses off quickly and dries</li>
            <li>The seller was super responsive and great to deal with.  </li>
            <li>So for those reasons I&#x27;m glad I got it, but it&#x27;s not the magic cloth I was hoping for !</li>

            <li>I love it so much I bought my mom one too, and she couldn&#x27;t agree more that this is an awesome product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best product to make your skin  soft and it is relaxing, if that makes any sense.  </li>
            <li>This is the most amazing addition to my shower ever.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been great - good as new</li>
            <li>If you want a good towel to make you feel squeaky clean, THIS IS IT.</li>
            <li>Great washcloth, it really works!  </li>
            <li>My skins feels very smooth after using this.</li>
            <li>so this is a very important feature for me.  </li>
            <li>and afterwards my skin is very smooth.</li>
            <li>It does leave your skin feeling very smooth</li>
            <li>but if not it dries very quickly on its own.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is also the best gift to take to friends in the hospital as it allows them to easily scrub their own back.</li>
            <li>this summer is going to be smooth and silky!</li>
            <li>But you can find &#x27;em elsewhere, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had one for many years</li>
            <li>and I expect to use it for many years to come.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I ordered from Emma&#x27;s Cosmetics &amp; Skincare (Fulfilled by Amazon), and can verify that I received an authentic product.</li>
            <li>As for the wash cloth itself, I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this bath wash towel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Salux Nylon bath towels for more than a decade now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d had always been able to purchase this at any Oriental grocery store.</li>
            <li>and I think that&#x27;s part of the reason he fell in love with me!He</li>
            <li>I have been using one for many years, don&#x27;t even know when I bought it.  </li>
            <li>And finally, it creates a wonderful lather from any soap.  </li>

            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I really love this product, and I&#x27;ve been using it for years...</li>
            <li>I like that it dries out between showers, seems more hygienic.  </li>
            <li>These Salux bath towels are fantastic!</li>
            <li>I have found nothing better.</li>
            <li>love this towel---i&#x27;ve</li>

            <li>This item is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I need to huy more of this for my lifetime supply and for give away.  </li>
            <li>Received my Salux last week and very happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>skin is not like baby butt yet, however, its better than scrubs in a jar&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Way better than any scrub I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>I could not like this thing more.  </li>
            <li>My skin gets really silky and works great on my feet.</li>
            <li>Have to add my two cents since we&#x27;ve been using these on our RV for 10 years or more.</li>
            <li>Glad I found it.</li>
            <li>I love this item couldnt be happier.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s never molded or needed to be washed any more than that.  </li>
            <li>I have bought many of these.</li>
            <li>You know those bath poufs that most people use, the ones you can get at Walmart?</li>
            <li>This washcloth is of excellent quality and definitely exfoliates well.  </li>
            <li>Only ones i ever use, the best.</li>
            <li>and it made me breakout more</li>
            <li>many smooths recommendations</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more and more.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Well, it does look like cheap plastic in person, too, and it also happens to be amazing.</li>
            <li>Two of them have gotten it and love it.</li>
            <li>and I feel like my after shower moisturizer absorbs better.  </li>
            <li>These are great  fast delivery.</li>
            <li>These things are delightfully abrasive, and last forever.</li>
            <li>However this towel rinses so much better than the gloves</li>
            <li>I will probably use it more often in the summer.</li>
            <li>It also increases your blood circulation, and you just feel more relaxed after using it.  </li>
            <li>it works ok .  </li>
            <li>I love this washcloth.</li>
            <li>but now I know where to go to get more.</li>
            <li>but I wanted a more durable option, preferably something that could be washed and reused.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re starting to fray around the edges the teeniest bit, but otherwise are in excellent shape.</li>
            <li>make sure you get the Salux brand and not a knockoff.</li>
            <li>I love it; I will probably get more as gifts.</li>
            <li>Love the exfoliating experience achieved from this nylon bath towel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more of these.</li>
            <li>Have never found a better one.</li>
            <li>.i love weaved wash clothes</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Its helped to extend the life and make it a better value.</li>
            <li>As for the results, Hopefully I&#x27;ll see some after more use.  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love this cloth.</li>
            <li>So when I saw this on Amazon, I was very excited.</li>
            <li>I was looking for some kind of exfoliation tool on Amazon, found this, decided to try it, and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>As others have mentioned, its great for washing your own back to, which feels so great after a really sweaty gym workout : )</li>
            <li>Soap foams in them nicely, and they rinse really clean when you finish your shower.</li>
            <li>Product is exact, shipping was fast and at an excellent price!  </li>
            <li>This exfoliating washcloth makes you feel sooo very clean.</li>
            <li>I am a very clean person so this is a must.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried it yet , but it feels pretty griddy, will probably be realllllllly good for feet</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m STILL using the original six cloths!</li>
            <li>This is an excellent exfoliater and it lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great when showering gets rid of all the dead cells leaving Ur body feeling great will buy again</li>
            <li>This thing is a gem and totally worth the price, by many times over!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cheers to a clean shower!</li>
            <li>It work very good for me, I dont use it at the daily basics,  fiber are in some way abrasive...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m better off with a cheap loofah ball from the dollar store.</li>
            <li>perfect amount of abrasiveness, but not too rough on the skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is more smooth than ever.  </li>
            <li>(JUST BE SURE THAT YOURS-RECEIVED IS A GENUINE &amp;#34;SALUX&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just really that good.</li>
            <li>I bought a blue towel, it absorbs excellent foam and gently but effectively scrubs the skin.</li>
            <li>It really does seem to stimulate your skin and gives you a tingle, in a good way.</li>
            <li>, stimulating might be the right word to use, I guess it just depends on what kind of stimulation you like.</li>
            <li>It also drys very quickly.</li>
            <li>My son likes the way it lathers up so easily.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to clean every inch of my body so thoroughly.</li>
            <li>I have been very pleasantly surprised, as it works wonderfully and my skin has been so much softer since I started using this as part of my routine.</li>
            <li>To my surprise this has become a favorite shower item to really clean my skin.  </li>
            <li>It dries very quickly so you don&#x27;t have to worry about mildew!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It dries easily, too.</li>
            <li>Because the towels are made of nylon, they rinse clean quite easily, thus making them much more hygienic than loofah&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>The item shipped very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Plus, you can clean it quite easily which is way better than those $3 shower puffs you get at the supermarket.</li>
            <li>It washes easily too, I just throw it in the washer.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>These bath wash towels stay strong and scrub forever.</li>
            <li>so far soo good, enjoying it.</li>
            <li>A great accessory for the general purpose of exfoliation of your skin.  </li>
            <li>this is the top choice leaves you feeling smooth and clean</li>
            <li>These are the best wash towels I have ever used hands down.</li>
            <li>To be honest, at first it feels and looks like a cheap product that you wouldn&#x27;t want to put on your skin, but the results speak for themselves.</li>
            <li>Cheap, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so super glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li>I am very well pleased!  </li>
            <li>Found it on Amazon and will purchase many more for certain.</li>
            <li>It is huge though.</li>
            <li>Like everyone else says this thing is HUGE.</li>
            <li>but the cloth is huge</li>
            <li>and it makes my skin feel smooth afterward.  </li>
            <li>fantastic item.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Now I am getting used to it, and my skin does feel smooth after using it.</li>
            <li>The Leyjie is thinner, lighter with cheaply sewn seams.</li>
            <li>A great friend of mine who lived in Hawaii slept over one evening and left one of these Bath Wash Towels for me to use since I borrowed hers while she was with me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for getting rid of dead skin cells, and&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a light texture to exfoliate and invigorate the skin.</li>
            <li>others have mentioned, they&#x27;re great for scrubbing your back (or your butt).  </li>
            <li>but your skin will be so smooth.</li>
            <li>and I thought I&#x27;d buy it since it was relatively cheap.</li>
            <li>Because of the length it&#x27;s great for washing the back.</li>
            <li>It exfoliates really well and suds up with soap nicely.</li>
            <li>Using this product leaves my skin smooth and velvety.</li>
            <li>This is a great back scrubber.  </li>
            <li>This washcloth is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>My husband introduced me to these wash towels over 30 years ago, and we think they are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I also use one to exfoliate my lips and that makes them really smooth.</li>
            <li>This item is great for exfoliating and it is so convenient for scrubbing the hard-to-reach back areas.  </li>
            <li>I remember when one of my friends linked me to this I thought it was a joke because it looks like cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>but when you rub it on the body it is smooth.  </li>
            <li>Everyone should experiment for themselves on what they feel comfortable with.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth, no dryness.</li>
            <li>We were using mesh loofas in the shower - cheap, flimsy, disposable -</li>
            <li>This is a great thing for getting rid of the bumps on skins (ingrown hairs especially).</li>
            <li>This product great for cleansing the entire body in a showering setting.</li>
            <li>It was cheap</li>
            <li>Easy to keep clean</li>
            <li>Like others mentioned, my skin feels smooth after each use.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best thing to take into the showers: you can scrub yourself all over with it folded, also with it unfolded, your back and the bottom of your feet!</li>
            <li>They do an excellent job of exfoliating, but are still gentle enough that you can use them on your face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tremendous size allows you to comfortably clean every area of your body thoroughly!</li>
            <li>In fact, i loved it so much I am purchasing another right now.</li>
            <li>So much softer than the 100% nylon version I found in TJ Maxx, and the length is perfect for keeping the back clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered received as stated!!</li>
            <li>It is easy to rinse off and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It rinses easily and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>The Japanese Salux washcloth is amazing!</li>
            <li>I just switched washes, and the dove deep moisture with the towel is amazing!</li>
            <li>This unique wash cloth has been everything I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li>top of it the seller was an absolute dream!</li>
            <li>It was great to be able to gentle scrub your back without pulling your arm out!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure neither one was a knockoff.</li>
            <li>it first arrived, it felt slightly more abrasive than a mesh poof.  </li>
            <li>I bathe with it, it makes me clean.</li>
            <li>If I forget it while traveling and have to use a face towel, I don&#x27;t feel as clean.  </li>
            <li>If not im going to cut it up and use it to scrub things clean because boy does it scrub.</li>
            <li>you can get them super cheap in Los Angeles at Korean $ stores.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling super smooth.</li>
            <li>so if you&#x27;re not used to that, take it easy to avoid that \\&quot;freshly peeled\\&quot; feeling.</li>
            <li>Works great in the winter when my skin gets flaky and dry.</li>
            <li>I feel clean and refreshed after my morning shower</li>
            <li>I felt so clean after using this.</li>
            <li>I feel absolutely clean all the time.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t seem to feel clean if I can&#x27;t get my scrub on. . .</li>
            <li>Just as advertised, it rinses clean of suds in just one go.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel clean without it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely the best money I&#x27;ve ever spent on any shower or bath goods.</li>
            <li>They are great for exfoliating your whole body, make it easy to clean your back.</li>
            <li>My skin is not sensitive, so the more abrasive the better!  </li>
            <li>I am certain you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>nylon wash cloth is certainly a lot more sanitary than cotton ones.</li>
            <li>I do all I can to keep them on hand and often give them to special friends as gifts.</li>
            <li>(so right!)</li>
            <li>But most importantly after every shower my skin feels SO SMOOTH AND SOFT!  </li>
            <li>Perfect for your hard to reach body parts.</li>
            <li>Amazing way to exfoliate your skin, it will be so so soft.</li>
            <li>Wash gently while you become acquainted with the texture.</li>
            <li>Not to mention this is good for cleaning and scrubbing your back......</li>
            <li>I love this thing, it really exfoliates well.</li>
            <li>#34;fake tanning&amp;#34; products, and for the product to be even, an good exfoliation is necessary.  </li>
            <li>Another thing I love so much is the length of it.</li>
            <li>it makes full body washing and showering a breeze.  </li>
            <li>Full body exfoliation...</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good for male.</li>
            <li>I need to rub more gentle than he does,though.</li>
            <li>I almost didn&#x27;t want to use them--these are good scrubbers, still but entirely livable for me.</li>
            <li>It makes you feel super clean.</li>
            <li>This towel dries really fast, much more so than the gloves, so it&#x27;s gone into my travel kit for now.</li>
            <li>I also love how it dries fast.  </li>
            <li>This is an awesome wash cloth, it delivers just the right amount of scrubbing, not too rough and not too gentle.</li>
            <li>I love this - so much more scouring power than a shower puff, so easy to use, rinse, and dry.</li>
            <li>Great as expected!</li>
            <li>quality is just fine, however, I was pretty put off that the cloths arrived wrapped in tissue paper.  </li>
            <li>What I wound up with was the perfect facial cloth for home or a tolerable washcloth on the road which weighs 6 grams (0.25 oz) and rolls up to about the same size as a lighter.  </li>
            <li>It also lathers up alot no matter the type of soap and rinses well and dries quickly which is a plus since you don&#x27;t want mold or mildew when you shower.</li>
            <li>Love this - will order more in the future.</li>
            <li>a quick run in the washer couldn&#x27;t handle.  </li>
            <li>this feels great and leaves my skin soft and clear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky since I can purchase these at nearby, Korean-owned stores for about $2.00-$2.50.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t take that much soap for it to lather up, and it also works great for your back!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also really durable and easy to rinse clean.  </li>
            <li>The size is also very convenient--makes it easy to clean everywhere.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more sanitary than a sponge because it can be thoroughly rinsed and drys quickly, and it scrubs better than just using a regular washcloth.</li>
            <li>and dries quickly, so</li>
            <li>Quick drying.</li>
            <li>I was one of the lucky ones who did not get a knock-off in the mail.</li>
            <li>Received quick, will use this seller again for this product.</li>
            <li>The delivery was quick and the wash clothes as promised.</li>
            <li>this along with either water or honey makes the best facial scrub to use with this facial cloth.</li>
            <li>I have ridiculously sensitive skin - and, while I tried my best to avoid the irritants, secondhand exposure via my husband was also a concern.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t perfect loofahs because they&#x27;re too flimsy and simply don&#x27;t get the job done, washcloths are the same deal.</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;m really getting clean!</li>
            <li>you are new to one of these, be warned, it is not soft and cushy like a pouf that you may be used to.  </li>
            <li>Very fast shipping too !</li>
            <li>It almost seems like its hurting at first, but then you realize how smooth it makes your skin feel after you get out of</li>
            <li>I love finally being able to scrub my own back thoroughly!</li>
            <li>Now that I shop Amazon which is completely new to me and was able to purchase it after 4yrs of using a washcloth</li>
            <li>is a great body exfoliator, and ever since I started using it, I&#x27;ve been seeing a LOT less ingrown hair on my legs (I tend to get a lot of those a couple days after shaving).</li>
            <li>The towel is durable, easy to carry, and reasonably priced (buy lots at reduced prices to save on shipping).</li>
            <li>They last a LONG time and for me they are the best at exfoliating and taking care of your skin!</li>
            <li>Good for people with limited reach or mobility while bathing.</li>
            <li>my skin is buttery soft and super glowy:)</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for an easy way to scrub most of your back skin off, this is what you want!</li>
            <li>When I get out of the shower my skin is very smooth and soft from all the exfoliation.</li>
            <li>but I could see a difference after the very first use; my skin is much more soft.</li>
            <li>I love a good hard scrub.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s large enough you can clean your back easily, even if your range of motion isn&#x27;t great.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for making these available</li>
            <li>These things are AWSOME , wash and massage your body together, great for removing dead skin</li>
            <li>It is really great, I had trouble finding it</li>
            <li>and it be extremely useful.</li>
            <li>Glad I finally found some at such a good price.</li>
            <li>This is great wash cloth, once you start to use, you won&#x27;t go back to your old one.</li>
            <li>The size is big and they are sturdy and they exfoliate my skin nicely.</li>
            <li>This cloth is awesome, cleans skin very well, exfoliates perfectly without being too rough, but rough enough to clear skin.</li>
            <li>Would prefer something with more natural fibers that could be used for scrubbing that wouldn&#x27;t make my skin sore.  </li>
            <li>Definately worth the 5 or 6 dollars I payed.</li>
            <li>I liked it for scrubbing my back in the shower.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews for this product, I figured it was worth 5 bucks to try.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try</li>
            <li>My skin has no problem with that, but more sensitive people may not respond well to this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definetly worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too rough on the skin, the length is perfect for getting your back, and you never have to wash it or worry about it getting smelly.</li>
            <li>bought this,which I cut up and shared with a couple of my grandchildren, I made up a facial scrub  by grinding up oatmeal, almonds, rose petals and some lavender and added clay..</li>
            <li>I was expecting to have to grit my teeth when I used it, but I figured it would be worth it.  </li>
            <li>: Be nice, warn girlfriends/guests about this towel and provide an alternative before they actually go in to take a shower.</li>
            <li>This is great for scrubbing all over with only a small amount of body wash it makes so many suds!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for scrubbing one&#x27;s back and then wadding up to get all of your other places.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d be able to get used to how rough it was!  </li>
            <li>It air dries pretty quickly and I store it in a ziploc for travel.  </li>
            <li>This is a &amp;#34;cloth&amp;#34; that is made from the same nylon fibers that make up the &amp;#34;loofah&amp;#34; scrubbers, so it stays clean when you rinse it out in the shower over many uses, rather than washcloths that may start to grow mold.</li>
            <li>+ this makes your body open more and clean to efficiently lotion yourself after.</li>
            <li>Combined with a good moisturiizing soap, the exfoliation of the slightly rough texture is just what the doctor ordered!</li>
            <li>Exfoliates and lathers with even under performing body wash and bar soaps and leaves skin super smooth and soft!  </li>
            <li>The price was right</li>
            <li>I use this in the shower in the morning, and then right after, I moisturize.  </li>
            <li>It gives just the right amount of scrub, without going over board.</li>
            <li>Rinses clean and dries extremely fast.</li>
            <li>sounds kind of gross but the first time you try it</li>
            <li>It is very easy for her to use on her back.  </li>
            <li>Also, the more you spend the more you save - price per item goes down as the quantity ordered increases.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve found no other bath towel that is more durable for the price.</li>
            <li>I had these growing up &amp; they scrub soo good nothing like the ones they sell at the store nowadays with soft material that doesnt do the job , I will purchase more in the near future.</li>
            <li>I feel clean, soft, and not too mention actually clean.</li>
            <li>, I will try one more time and will try to barely graze my skin with it.</li>
            <li>Having been given an earlier version of this product by a Japanese woman in Hawaii in 1988, I was delighted to discover this product available now.</li>
            <li>However, they work just as great as what I&#x27;ve used in the past</li>
            <li>with this i can and shower in 2 minutes; the roughness is stimulating and i feel dead cells sloughing off nicely!</li>
            <li>It is far better than the jute products that I owe which typically don&#x27;t last more than a year.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant about it at first but well worth the try.</li>
            <li>A great small christmas gift for ladies..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and long so I can do a sort of twist with it on my body, like a polishing motion.</li>
            <li>It is a large wash cloth and rinses and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Great to get dead skin off and super easy to wash your back.  </li>
            <li>They dry fairly quickly, making them suitable for travel.</li>
            <li>you want a good scrub down?  </li>
            <li>It was the best shower I ever took the first time I used one of these, wow my skin felt years younger and looked years younger.</li>
            <li>I bought a couple of these a few months ago when they were priced ridiculously low, and both my boyfriend and I are really impressed.</li>
            <li>Old one wore out after several years of good and faithful service.  </li>
            <li>It lathers quickly and rinses just as fast.</li>
            <li>Then, I recently read a review for the Salux cloth, and how great it was for treating back acne issues as well as exfoliation.</li>
            <li>And for those of you who are trying to be more eco-friendly, this cloth can be washed and reused, it dries quickly, and it&#x27;s a lot better than tossing loofahs, which are harder to clean properly.</li>
            <li>It is handy for being able to exfoliate your back since it&#x27;s so long.</li>
            <li>Excellent for using before applying self-tanner-no streaks or dry dark patches.</li>
            <li>normal wash clothes idk why but i dont feel clean</li>
            <li>A little abrasive, though, but good</li>
            <li>Dries extremely fast, too, so no weird smell!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great to use because of it&#x27;s length, you can reach all of those hard to scrub places with ease.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>There are various sellers of this product on Amazon, and it appears from the reviews that some are not shipping the authentic Salux product made in Japan.</li>
            <li>I first learned of these in Japan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this item at 18yrs.</li>
            <li>My sister first introduced me to these Japanese nylon washcloths many years ago.</li>
            <li>This works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I received the exact color and brand in the picture, salux.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle but powerful.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and bump free.</li>
            <li>You get used to it after the first day.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the Japanese version of a&lt;br /&gt;Turkish towel, and goes one better than that.</li>
            <li>I was first exposed to this about 6 years ago while visiting my friends in Mexico.  </li>
            <li>However, since our move, I have not been able to find them anywhere locally yet.  </li>
            <li>It works okay, but is not what I expected and may not offer some of the benefits of a true Salux cloth.</li>
            <li>When I first ordered the product I didn&#x27;t receive it.  </li>
            <li>and this helped take off the extra skin (gross, but effective!).  </li>
            <li>and I found them even better and longer lasting than the ones I had purchased before.</li>
            <li>(I also have given these as gifts to my family and friends, that is just how much I like them!)</li>
            <li>I love these wash cloths, they are the bomb - as an Asian, I grew up with these.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>but I really like them!  </li>
            <li>It is exactly like the description.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>It is a quite simple product and that is probably what makes me appreciate it all the more; its functional.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much pressure though!  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The first one lasted about a year</li>
            <li>Instead, with my first one, I felt like I was using a pot scrubber in the beginning.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pretty simple girl compared to most.</li>
            <li>but FAST!  </li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more in the future!</li>
            <li>The quality is such that I believe I will be able to use it for years.  </li>
            <li>I like being able to scrub my back as well.  </li>
            <li>Love these wash towels, I only like this brand.</li>
            <li>Machine washable, wonderful texture, whats not to like?&lt;br /&gt;I was introduced to these by a lady friend, I don&#x27;t think ill ever use a loofah again.</li>
            <li>First introduced to this wash cloth at the Grand Wailea Hydro Spa in the Japanese inspired bath.</li>
            <li>The feeling before and after when I first used this made me feel &amp;#34;ahh&amp;#34; like after a hot steamy sauna session.</li>
            <li>I first purchased these years ago.</li>
            <li>first used this type of body scrubber when I lived in Japan.</li>
            <li>I have given these to many of my American friends and they all admit it took some getting use to</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more after this one wears out.</li>
            <li>I find the most abrasive wash cloth in my linen closet and use it to bathe with because I&#x27;m big on exfoiliating.</li>
            <li>Upon receiving, I saw this wasn&#x27;t exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I love taking a shower and scrubbing my back with this product.  </li>
            <li>I first tried the Salux brand skin cloths about five years ago.</li>
            <li>It has a nice rough texture.</li>
            <li>The first was a gift.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this thing!</li>
            <li>My first purchase was with the seller &amp;#34;ON CLOUD 9.&amp;#34; The Salux I received from them was a 100% legitimate Salux that was created in Japan.</li>
            <li>I prefer this 100 times more than a traditional shower loofah.  </li>
            <li>It exfoliates without being too abrasive and leaves my skin clean and very soft.</li>
            <li>It is easy to keep clean and dry.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft!!!!</li>
            <li>I did notice right away that my skin was much softer.</li>
            <li>Really feel clean and it reminds me of getting a body scrub at a spa without the high price.</li>
            <li>It is very large so you can easily reach back etc.</li>
            <li>It also more abrasive and produces less lather than the original.</li>
            <li>They really scrub the skin, doing the exfoliating that leaves skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Cleans your body very thoroughly and leaves skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Great scrubber, delivered earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>I love that you can get your whole back without asking someone else for help.</li>
            <li>It achieves the same result as a good salt/oil scrub you buy, it exfoliates and moisturizes at the same time.</li>
            <li>It cleans every part of your body and most of all it definetly cleans your back very well.</li>
            <li>It is as wonderful as the african local sponge that gives you a natural exfoliative effect and it stays true for as long as ever!</li>
            <li>The first time I took a shower with this jewel, it felt amazing and my skin hadn&#x27;t felt so smooth in a long long time.</li>
            <li>first when I opened the package I didn&#x27;t expect it to do that much.</li>
            <li>best wash cloth out dont waste your time with other cloths</li>
            <li>I loved it while I was using it, but within a few hours I was covered in itchy bumps from head to toe!</li>
            <li>The original order was lost in the mail several weeks and the sender, JapanSupermall, quickly sent me a second order free.</li>
            <li>The texture never dulls and great for scrubbing off dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really easy to reach my back and scrub.</li>
            <li>I find it easier to use and handle than the poofs (also easy to scrub your back).  </li>
            <li>AND I can easily scrub my back with no problem at all.</li>
            <li>Also makes it easy to exfoliate and wash your back.</li>
            <li>Easy access to back.</li>
            <li>And the size and shape makes scrubbing your back really easy.</li>
            <li>The size makes it easy to hold in both hands and wash your back.</li>
            <li>Easy to scrub your back, holds soap well, scrubby but not too scrubby.</li>
            <li>The long length allows for you to give your back a good horizontal, vertical or diagonal scrub.</li>
            <li>My Japanese friend had one of these back in high school (shout out to Hideharu) and he always said how good it makes you feel.</li>
            <li>So, what to do with this large piece of wash cloth?</li>
            <li>its a great material, delivered super fast, and is long enough to wrap around my back and wash it.</li>
            <li>It does work really well, but perhaps too strong for a daily use like I can with the gloves.</li>
            <li>For being such a simple idea this product surely works!</li>
            <li>Very high quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit abrasive and long, but gets you squeaky clean!</li>
            <li>They are large enough to wash your entire back and they feel great \\&quot;scrubbing\\&quot; your skin.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also very long so they feel wonderful on your back, but fold down neatly so they can be hung like a regular wash cloth (and still dry fairly rapidly when folded).</li>
            <li>Likewise I like the fact it sloughs off the dead skin in a clean way; you can easily squeeze it to rinse it out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unlike cloth washcloths and loofas, the Salux skin cloths are HUGE; they&#x27;re designed so that you can grip one end in each hand and scrub your back.</li>
            <li>Is nothing like the real thing in results, quality and feel.</li>
            <li>This&lt;br /&gt;was supposed to be a gift and now have to wait and go through the whole process of&lt;br /&gt;return and refund.</li>
            <li>I really feel ripped off and taken advantage of.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i love the harder clothes, i have been using this since 1970&#x27;s...</li>
            <li>but it seems to be a very well made luffa towel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier to hold</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know why these are selling for so much online.</li>
            <li>I ordered my item from the Pandora seller and received the genuine Salux cloth and not a Chinese knockoff.  </li>
            <li>After just 1 use you can feel how much softer and smoother your skin is.</li>
            <li>they replaced the package real</li>
            <li>Having arthritis in one shoulder really hinders my ability to reach everwher I need to.  </li>
            <li>but it makes your skin feel much smoother and cleaner.</li>
            <li>but it really exfoliates well.</li>
            <li>really makes showering feel cleansing</li>
            <li>I used to have to stock up and buy a whole bunch of them when visiting family in Hawaii, or beg them to send me some in the mail.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very vigorous scrub</li>
            <li>Really exfoliates your skin.</li>
            <li>but it made my skin so much softer.  </li>
            <li>It really works well for that purpose.</li>
            <li>It really makes my skin feel so much softer.</li>
            <li>Read the reviews of others so you can select the real thing.</li>
            <li>Unbeknownst to me, the item was packed pressed up close against the very outer layer of the packing envelope.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I really needed a loofah</li>
            <li>Works great for exfoliating without irritating skin.</li>
            <li>A bit ti much for the face</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother &amp; absorbs lotion really well.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This thing is for real.  </li>
            <li>you find it too rough, as you will get used to it and actually enjoy it!</li>
            <li>and it really is exfoliating.</li>
            <li>I feel very rejuvenated after using it</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive but works well.</li>
            <li>but I enjoy mine well enough to assume it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend trying it!</li>
            <li>very exfoliate much scrub</li>
            <li>Not to sound to gross</li>
            <li>It really leaves you feeling a lot cleaner than a loofah will.</li>
            <li>I really like this towel.  </li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>This product exfoliates very well and is made of a very sturdy material.  </li>
            <li>I really like these.</li>
            <li>After much research, I stumbled upon the Japanese-style nylon washcloths and decided to give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast-forward to today</li>
            <li>very scratchy</li>
            <li>Another bonus, my skin is really exfoliated and has been looking great!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The second feature I love is its exfoliating capability leaving skin soft.  </li>
            <li>Daily exfoliation keeps skin soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>The blue Salux scrubbers I bought are perfect; they have enough \\&quot;body\\&quot; not to just bunch up into a skinny rope when I try to scrub my back, and the texture is aggressive enough to feel that they&#x27;re really doing something.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Another plus: These things work up such a great lather that I&#x27;ve been using less liquid soap!</li>
            <li>and I like the way it can fold into a half width or be used at full width quite comfortably.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extra long length makes it perfect for getting your entire back.  </li>
            <li>Just one week using these Salux wash cloths resulted in a remarkable difference in my arms and legs, to the point where I have finally gone back to wearing short dresses and skirts without pantyhose.</li>
            <li>In China,&amp;#34; !SEND IT BACK IMMEDIATELY, UNOPENED, FOR A REFUND!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW OF THE ORIGINAL, &amp;#34;SALUX&amp;#34; JAPANESE-MADE CLOTH: .......</li>
            <li>I got two at a very reasonable sum and will probably order a few more just to have on hand for guests, etc.  </li>
            <li>I use a small hanger to hang mine next to the rest of my towels for easy use :) Absolutely recommend!</li>
            <li>The slightly rough texture is just right for getting you clean.</li>
            <li>Size allows you to thoroughly clean back.  </li>
            <li>Yes, I&#x27;m talking about the authentic Salux nylon, made in Japan, not some imitation some here</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps a imitation product would have worked better.</li>
            <li>I definitely feel clean after using this cloth -</li>
            <li>It is somewhat more course than a typical cloth of this type, is a full three feet long for easy use on your back, and holds up really well over time.</li>
            <li>I use it everywhere on my body, and have found it to be a very thorough cleaning cloth, and would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I even used it with considerable pressure on my arms &amp; legs (as opposed to people saying to be very gentle with it).  </li>
            <li>The product is just a long rectangular towel, it makes it super easy to wash your back, and it lathers soap so well.</li>
            <li>When it came I really liked it, but it did look cheaply made and a little rough to use.</li>
            <li>but it really exfoliates your skin just enough to leave it feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>When I first met my husband he would always tell me how soft my skin was</li>
            <li>Saves money because they lather so much better and last so much longer than regular loofahs</li>
            <li>THIS, though, makes me feel smooth, soft, and is gentle enough to use every day.</li>
            <li>Not bad for under ten bucks.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t live without them!</li>
            <li>It drys very quickly - Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>My skin feels NEW!  </li>
            <li>and you can really see the new skin glow.</li>
            <li>This is really important in winter months when I suffer from really dry skin.</li>
            <li>Much better than your typical loofa.</li>
            <li>Being a heavy person it is good for cleaning your back area, but you will have to get use to the feel of the material on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I prefer it more coarse so that it is actually exfoliating me.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll only run into a problem if you don&#x27;t have enough soap on it, you&#x27;ll be able to tell if you don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>however, with this towel you really do have to be completely out of the line of running water while using it, otherwise it will lose its lather fast and require re-soaping.</li>
            <li>Growing up as a person of Korean ethnic background, I have used this exact wash cloth pretty much my entire life.</li>
            <li>Its still very useable and hasn&#x27;t frayed more than few pieces</li>
            <li>My boyfriend is constantly commenting on how soft and smooth my skin is.</li>
            <li>wow such soft so impress wow such happiness</li>
            <li>and they last long and very easy to clean before getting out of the shower, just hang in the shower to dry.</li>
            <li>A little bit more rough than expected, but still good.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>so i highly recommend getting one from amazon.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item.  </li>
            <li>These wash cloths allow scrubbing the back in a more natural manner much like drying your back with a bath towel.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is sad that I&#x27;m so excited over a wash cloth, but I am (it&#x27;s the small things when you get older, lol!).  </li>
            <li>For the record, I use Apricot scrub all over my body, but for a washcloth, I need a little more softness.</li>
            <li>But wow!!</li>
            <li>I could use the ones available in the market, but it seemed ridiculous to spend money on something I had for free.</li>
            <li>, I put in in the laundry and air dry it to clean it every so often.  </li>
            <li>They rinse clean in seconds, dry in minutes.</li>
            <li>It has a fairly rough texture which is a fantastic exfoliator.  </li>
            <li>Towel has been very durable so far.</li>
            <li>However, I was pleasantly surprised at how much softer my skin was after using it.  </li>
            <li>wow very five stars</li>
            <li>Pairs great with expensive soap you want to hold onto for a while.</li>
            <li>so i don&#x27;t have to waste more soap.</li>
            <li>These items probably only cost pennies to produce but the results are worth the price alone.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re used to the normal bath poof, this is going to feel like sandpaper.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking of buying a few more for friends.  </li>
            <li>They are bit rough for the face or other, ahem, sensitive areas, but for anywhere else you want to be squeaky clean and exfoliated, there&#x27;s nothing better.  </li>
            <li>It only requires minimum shower gel to get a great long-lasting lather, which means I&#x27;ve actually noticed I buy less shower gel over the months!  </li>
            <li>It has a long length which makes it easy to reach my whole back.</li>
            <li>It creates an amazing lather, which helps me use less soap overall.</li>
            <li>This worked well, but easily broke down in the shower.</li>
            <li>This product is perfectly fine for highly sensitive skin as I have extremely sensitive skin, you don&#x27;t have to be extremely abrasive with this product at all, just a gentle rub</li>
            <li>I live in Florida with its incumbent humidity</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the Salux bath towel or any of the nylon bath towels.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live with it now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using mine for three months and its still like brand new.</li>
            <li>cant live without these</li>
            <li>if you are delicate or a tenderfoot you may need some time to get used to it as it&#x27;s a rough scrub but great afterwards.</li>
            <li>When I actually got the real Salux, I realized just how much of a difference there was between the two.</li>
            <li>and I like the way the cloths dry so quickly.  </li>
            <li>If you get bleach on it, it will turn light blue, as I found out recently while cleaning my bathroom.</li>
            <li>and I like the fact I can reach all areas of my back in a simple comfortable manner.  </li>
            <li>My second purchase was with &amp;#34;JapanSuperMall.&amp;#34; I purchased the item on December 27th for a total of $4.27 with free shipping</li>
            <li>Highly recommended if you&#x27;re looking for a different or new shower experience where you feel like you&#x27;re actually getting clean when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li>No other scrubbers really exfoliate your skin well except for these.</li>
            <li>This product is cheap, seems so far long lasting, and really gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>Long enough to give your back a good cleaning and take off any skin you don&#x27;t want at the same time.</li>
            <li>The scrubber is quite long so she can easily hold it with both hands and scrub her shoulders and back.</li>
            <li>They are great for exfoliating your entire body, even your hard to reach back and shoulders.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin so soft!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more coarse than \\&quot;poofs\\&quot; that other people bathe with.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll feel amazingly soft afterwards!</li>
            <li>You are able to toss them in the washing machine weekly for extra cleanliness and they are made very solidly; I anticipate they will last years.  </li>
            <li>It works just as well, if not better than a sugar scrub, and leave your skin feeling silky smooth!</li>
            <li>It was worth buying because I can now reach spots that were hard to get clean.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I save the old ones to scrub the tub!  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling SOO soft!</li>
            <li>More so than the sponge poufs I&#x27;ve been using in the past.</li>
            <li>I bought my first Salux Nylon on the island of Kauai several years ago.  </li>
            <li>I was a little nervous reading some of the reviews that said this was too rough, but I think the texture is perfect (although if you don&#x27;t want something rough - definitely buy one that is not rough-weave).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the authentic Salux one (not the Chinese imitation).  </li>
            <li>It truly makes me feel clean not like those other cloths from Walmart or anywhere else.</li>
            <li>Due to the weaved nature of the fabric, after a quick rinse, the cloth will dry exceptionally quickly after use.</li>
            <li>No matter how gentle and careful I was when using it, it always made palms of my hands red, raw, dry and incredibly itchy like nothing</li>
            <li>The cloth I use is firm and easily cleans after each use.</li>
            <li>It may seem rough at first, but it does really well</li>
            <li>towel is pretty big and as the picture denotes on the package, I suppose you could use the whole thing to scrub your back</li>
            <li>This nylon cloth works well as it dries quickly and is coarse in texture, similar to a brush.</li>
            <li>I especially like the large size.</li>
            <li>great for exfoliation, dont press to hard or it hurts a little.</li>
            <li>So be careful using it the first time!  </li>
            <li>They foam well with soap, then rinse clear.</li>
            <li>Its not harsh on the body or face.</li>
            <li>I just ordered a package of three directly from saluxshop.com.</li>
            <li>Will buy straight from Salux dealer in the future.</li>
            <li>and it makes you feel soft after bathing.</li>
            <li>Besides that, the towels are too soft to provide any scrubbing</li>
            <li>old and had never felt anything like it before.</li>
            <li>You can really cut it into 2 maybe even 3 different pieces</li>
            <li>The old ones I recycle as my travel wash</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough to use it on your face also, so I do that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised that these haven&#x27;t caught on yet.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive skin, but the effects are noticeable.  </li>
            <li>but I can still use it on sensitive areas like my face.</li>
            <li>When I use it I feel refreshed, and my arms are soft</li>
            <li>This product literally rubs off all your old skin and leaves you body soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>I tried it out and even with only a gentle rub it caused skin abrasions.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin sooo soft.</li>
            <li>I hang mine on the towel rack at the end of the shower/tub after rinsing and it&#x27;s ready next time I want to use it.  </li>
            <li>They seemed reasonable enough and since my skin is a chronic problem of sensitivity</li>
            <li>you will see the benefits it offers.  </li>
            <li>Silky smooth skin everyday, and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried scrubs, loofahs, mesh bath poofs (which Salux now replaced), pumice stones, natural sponges, salt scrub, I can&#x27;t think of everything.  </li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>WOW what a difference there is when using it.  </li>
            <li>My itchy unwashed back thanks you.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like to have a bunch of different types of scrubs and soaps and formulas.</li>
            <li>but idk about sensitive areas .</li>
            <li>It made the old skin come off.</li>
            <li>I suffer from KP on my upper arms, which has worsened over the years and this has really helped exfoliate that area.  </li>
            <li>for years I used them to keep my skin soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling soft and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>Prepared to be surprised.</li>
            <li>I can get my back really well without having to switch to the loofah on a stick that I use for that area.</li>
            <li>It feels similar to a loofa and is not irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li>Wow was I surprised by what a difference it made.</li>
            <li>it is ready for the next time you need it.</li>
            <li>You can really wash your back yourself.</li>
            <li>PRODUCT, MANUFACTURED IN JAPAN [NOT in China], or its quality WILL NO-WHERE NEARLY MATCH</li>
            <li>The one improvement I could suggest is to mold a soft rubber bead across each end to help</li>
            <li>Warning: If you have soft or sensitive skin, this will scratch you up and it takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li>but I personally keep mine whole.</li>
            <li>These towels are just abrasive enough to give your skin a good scrub without irritating the skin.</li>
            <li>Seemed expensive, but it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>On my second one, at first it was a little bit rough getting used to that harsher exfoliating property with a new one again, but now after a few days, I&#x27;m once again used to the somewhat harsh feeling and am enjoying the full exfoliation and cleansing properties that this wash cloth/towel offers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $5 for a year&#x27;s worth of use, give it a shot and just be patient if at first</li>
            <li>The knitting is tight and stretchy and works much better than other nylon wash products and feels much softer.</li>
            <li>I usually get a new one each year, just to be safe when it comes to a hygiene, but they could easily last longer than that.  </li>
            <li>The length is great for cleaning your back and any other hard to reach places.</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;recycling&amp;#34; act extends their VERY useful life-span ANOTHER few</li>
            <li>They create lots of lather from just a small amount of soap or bodywash, they exfoliate your skin without feeling overly abrasive and are gentle enough to use on your face, they scrub your back better and with more ease than any back brush, and they dry quickly and last a long, long time.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, after about a year, the towel tore as I was gripping it to clean my back.</li>
            <li>The price was right and the cyberspace ink didn&#x27;t even dry before I received an email that the order had shipped!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the original longer ones, not cheap like swap meet ones.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to ball up and grip with your hand and then open it up to clean your entire back area, which can be hard to do with a loofah.</li>
            <li>A little soap lasts forever on this towel, and it&#x27;s extra length was great for me since I have wide shoulders that make it hard to clean my back.</li>
            <li>So much better than those ridiculous puff things.</li>
            <li>It helps exfoliate dead skin cells and helps you feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>This bath towel does get a decent amount of lather and exfoliates as much as a standard synthetic loofah.</li>
            <li>I really like it because I use it everyday consistently</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I will continue to use this daily as it is quite abrasive, but I am so glad that I bought it.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for many years, usually have to search for it in Asian food stores.</li>
            <li>Although it is long, it is a bit too large for wash cloths.  </li>
            <li>They last a long time and dry very quickly.</li>
            <li>Exfoliates very well and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>When I first started to use this product, it felt rough when washing.</li>
            <li>These towels are rough at first</li>
            <li>This wash cloth is rough at first for those not used to it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty rough</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to have a friend recommend looking on Amazon to locate one of these long scrubbing towels to do my back.  </li>
            <li>used to find it at a shop on Grant Ave in SF Chinatown, and an Asian mart in Bergenfield, New Jersey.  </li>
            <li>even though I use it daily, it&#x27;s still like brand new after months of use.</li>
            <li>When I got this product, I was shocked that many reviews referred to it being comfortable</li>
            <li>Salux makes my skin soft, silky, smooth, clean, removes dead skin, prevents breakouts, prevents dry, flaky skin, prevents itchy skin as it removes the dead skin.</li>
            <li>The design is rather simple since it is like a long scarf; but it manages to cover my 6&#x27;3&amp;#34; frame pretty well</li>
            <li>Traditional washcloths were my least favorite options because they don&#x27;t exfoliate or work up the desired lather.</li>
            <li>After a few months of use, I use it about once per week everywhere and have kind of gotten use to it, but use it a few times per week on my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could only seeing you not liking this product if you have very sensitive skin, or don&#x27;t like pain.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why there is so much hype about a cheap piece of rough nylon cloth.  </li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t use it for a few days I&#x27;m very aware of tension in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it builds lather as easily as a loofah, but I like lots of lather and found this wash cloth builds enough lather for my tastes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been looking for a small back brush to take on trips, but couldn&#x27;t find anything the right size, one that wouldn&#x27;t take up much room in a suitcase.  </li>
            <li>I think it is too harsh for the face, but I love using it on my feet as well as my other skin.</li>
            <li>I rubbed too hard and it stung after my shower, but I&#x27;ve learned to be a little more gentle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and long, but personally I find it a little too rough.  </li>
            <li>If you use it tightly against your skin, your skin will become red rather quickly</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s no more than a piece of cheaply made nylon that gave me dermatitis, especially on my hands.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had such soft skin on my arms and legs ...</li>
            <li>you never tried one, it will be rough at first (especially if you shower using just a bare soap bar or a face towel).  </li>
            <li>the traditional scrubbie when you&#x27;re done with your shower, you can hold it up lengthwise toward the shower flow and watch all of the old soap &amp; crud rinse out.  </li>
            <li>I like this cloth a lot because you barely have to use any soap to lather up with this</li>
            <li>I bought this because for some reason as an adult I&#x27;d been breaking out on my back.</li>
            <li>if there&#x27;s an asian grocery store near you, they had this on the shelf for $5.</li>
            <li>Smooths rough skin very well.</li>
            <li>Do no buy this product, especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Their washability make them a sanitary, economical, and green alternative to those bunched-up mesh</li>
            <li>The rest of the mainland hasn&#x27;t caught on yet (at least not mainstream stores - unless one is lucky enough to live near an Asian supermarket/store).  </li>
            <li>When I lived in Hawaii these were a common product at any local drug store and easy to get.</li>
            <li>Scrubs the dead skin and dirt right off.</li>
            <li>Replace your poufs and never worry about what&#x27;s hiding in all those nooks and crannies that never dry out!</li>
            <li>is getting just as much exfoliation as the other parts.</li>
            <li>I always used to buy sugar scrubs from the store-and I am positive that I missed spots on my back, and probably other places.  </li>
            <li>The reason I ordered it was specifically because I wanted the Salux brand and the only reason I didn&#x27;t return it was because I didn&#x27;t want to deal with the hassle, time, and expense of shipping this thing back during the busy holiday season.</li>
            <li>After taken a shower with this cloth then I apply the body lotion so the skin does not dry out.  </li>
            <li>My skin has never felt smoother, no dry patches, no ashy elbows.  </li>
            <li>It is a little scratchy the first time</li>
            <li>First 2 or 3 times will take a little getting use to, because of the coarseness.  </li>
            <li>Really, it only felt maybe a tad rougher than those nylon poufs that are sold in every drug store, &amp; that&#x27;s not rough at all!  </li>
            <li>A little more rough than I expected,  </li>
            <li>Gentle enough for my face but also rough enough for when I need it to be.</li>
            <li>Also, although some sellers do charge outrageous shipping, I had no trouble finding a seller with fair rates, and this product is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>A little coarse and abrasive at first</li>
            <li>I sometimes use this for dry rubbing too because it is gentle enough to use dry.</li>
            <li>It really helps before shaving too, my razor gets less clogged after exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(they don&#x27;t stay soft for long but initially they are).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Whole Foods also has a version which is a little longer, and softer.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stand the hotel bath towels that are never long enough to scrub my upper back.</li>
            <li>If you have (or want) tough, but smooth skin, this towel is for you.</li>
            <li>I have such profound dry skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit scratchy, but not too much so - just enough to let you scrub as much or as little as needed.  </li>
            <li>Super product, only I found the product too long for me to use, so I had to cut it in half and sew the rough edge.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The price cannot be beat, its basically the price of a good quality washcloth.  </li>
            <li> You probably would throw it away because you can&#x27;t stand using a sponge for years and not because it changes one bit in its prowess to keep your skin feeling good after having a bath with it.</li>
            <li> loved it.  </li>
            <li> Always looking for a good source of these shower scrubbers.</li>
            <li> I use plastic loofah gloves already, but read on a beauty blog that this towel was really good for exfoliation.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found to really clean my body.</li>
            <li> Lathers exceptionally</li>
            <li> /&gt;It exfoliates better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used, my skin feels great from using it.</li>

            <li> I have loved these for years and have been searching for some more.</li>
            <li> It has a nice level of roughness for exfoliating the skin.</li>
            <li> :)...all the women who bath in my home love these things.....works great with liquid soap!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Casanova Jr.</li>
            <li> The Salux nylon does a great job at getting the back and the length is perfect.  </li>
            <li> It reaches your back without any issues, lathers great when you apply body wash, it&#x27;s just awesome.  </li>
            <li> I used it twice because of how good and refreshing it made me</li>
            <li> Kind of like a puff scrubber.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s effective.  </li>
            <li> Extremely effective at exfoliation.</li>
            <li> Nice to find it online</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price and it does a nice job</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, exfoliates superbly, and makes efficient use of soap.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s really nice.</li>
            <li> It stays very clean (and hair-free!)</li>
            <li> We are so excited to see this now available through Amazon at a great price!!  </li>
            <li> This is a really good towel to clean yourself with!</li>
            <li> It lathers up great, keeps soapy, exfoliates skin, rinses off quickly and dries</li>
            <li> The seller was super responsive and great to deal with.  </li>
            <li> So for those reasons I&#x27;m glad I got it, but it&#x27;s not the magic cloth I was hoping for !</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this kind of wash cloth.</li>
            <li> Really is an amazing product :)</li>
            <li> It is an excellent exfoliator and feels amazing, waking up my skin and making me feel more alive in the mornings—no exaggeration.</li>
            <li> I love it so much I bought my mom one too, and she couldn&#x27;t agree more that this is an awesome product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best product to make your skin  soft and it is relaxing, if that makes any sense.  </li>
            <li> This is the most amazing addition to my shower ever.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been great - good as new</li>
            <li> If you want a good towel to make you feel squeaky clean, THIS IS IT.</li>
            <li> Great washcloth, it really works!  </li>
            <li> My skins feels very smooth after using this.</li>
            <li> so this is a very important feature for me.  </li>
            <li> and afterwards my skin is very smooth.</li>
            <li> It does leave your skin feeling very smooth</li>
            <li> but if not it dries very quickly on its own.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is also the best gift to take to friends in the hospital as it allows them to easily scrub their own back.</li>
            <li> this summer is going to be smooth and silky!</li>
            <li> But you can find &#x27;em elsewhere, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one for many years</li>
            <li> and I expect to use it for many years to come.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> I ordered from Emma&#x27;s Cosmetics &amp; Skincare (Fulfilled by Amazon), and can verify that I received an authentic product.</li>
            <li> As for the wash cloth itself, I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this bath wash towel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Salux Nylon bath towels for more than a decade now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d had always been able to purchase this at any Oriental grocery store.</li>
            <li> and I think that&#x27;s part of the reason he fell in love with me!He</li>
            <li> I have been using one for many years, don&#x27;t even know when I bought it.  </li>
            <li> And finally, it creates a wonderful lather from any soap.  </li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> Use with your favorite body wash.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this luffa towel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve found it on Amazon!&lt;br</li>

            <li> Overall this is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Many years ago I came across this product at a luxury resort in Guam.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I really love this product, and I&#x27;ve been using it for years...</li>
            <li> I like that it dries out between showers, seems more hygienic.  </li>
            <li> These Salux bath towels are fantastic!</li>
            <li> I have found nothing better.</li>
            <li> love this towel---i&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> The only thing is that doesn&#x27;t perfectly exfoliate areas of the body like the arms where most people have the redness</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>
            <li> but this one is better than all the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed using this in the shower.  </li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both love them.</li>
            <li> I used as a child, but that makes it even better.</li>
            <li> My gourd loofah couldn&#x27;t reach my backs so well, but this works wonderful on the back.</li>
            <li> I love the size, I love the way it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> My skin has never looked or felt better.  </li>
            <li> items for making sure you do not have plaque development.</li>
            <li> Been using these for years and love them.</li>
            <li> More durable and can be used for more than one thing.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this thing.</li>
            <li> I can not believe how much better my skin feels after I shower for $6.00.</li>
            <li> I love that I can reach everywhere on my body-</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Love this thing</li>
            <li> and I am going to get more to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews, I had to buy some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering more for Christmas gifts.  </li>
            <li> I have heard so many friends raving about how they love these prizes</li>
            <li> This item is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I need to huy more of this for my lifetime supply and for give away.  </li>
            <li> Received my Salux last week and very happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> skin is not like baby butt yet, however, its better than scrubs in a jar&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Way better than any scrub I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> I could not like this thing more.  </li>
            <li> My skin gets really silky and works great on my feet.</li>
            <li> Have to add my two cents since we&#x27;ve been using these on our RV for 10 years or more.</li>
            <li> Glad I found it.</li>
            <li> I love this item couldnt be happier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never molded or needed to be washed any more than that.  </li>
            <li> I have bought many of these.</li>
            <li> You know those bath poufs that most people use, the ones you can get at Walmart?</li>
            <li> This washcloth is of excellent quality and definitely exfoliates well.  </li>
            <li> Only ones i ever use, the best.</li>
            <li> and it made me breakout more</li>
            <li> many smooths recommendations</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more and more.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Well, it does look like cheap plastic in person, too, and it also happens to be amazing.</li>
            <li> Two of them have gotten it and love it.</li>
            <li> and I feel like my after shower moisturizer absorbs better.  </li>
            <li> These are great  fast delivery.</li>
            <li> These things are delightfully abrasive, and last forever.</li>
            <li> However this towel rinses so much better than the gloves</li>
            <li> I will probably use it more often in the summer.</li>
            <li> It also increases your blood circulation, and you just feel more relaxed after using it.  </li>
            <li> it works ok .  </li>
            <li> I love this washcloth.</li>
            <li> but now I know where to go to get more.</li>
            <li> but I wanted a more durable option, preferably something that could be washed and reused.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re starting to fray around the edges the teeniest bit, but otherwise are in excellent shape.</li>
            <li> make sure you get the Salux brand and not a knockoff.</li>
            <li> I love it; I will probably get more as gifts.</li>
            <li> Love the exfoliating experience achieved from this nylon bath towel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering more of these.</li>
            <li> Have never found a better one.</li>
            <li> .i love weaved wash clothes</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Its helped to extend the life and make it a better value.</li>
            <li> As for the results, Hopefully I&#x27;ll see some after more use.  </li>
            <li> I love, love, love this cloth.</li>
            <li> So when I saw this on Amazon, I was very excited.</li>
            <li> I was looking for some kind of exfoliation tool on Amazon, found this, decided to try it, and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, its great for washing your own back to, which feels so great after a really sweaty gym workout : )</li>

            <li> It work very good for me, I dont use it at the daily basics,  fiber are in some way abrasive...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m better off with a cheap loofah ball from the dollar store.</li>
            <li> perfect amount of abrasiveness, but not too rough on the skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is more smooth than ever.  </li>
            <li> (JUST BE SURE THAT YOURS-RECEIVED IS A GENUINE &amp;#34;SALUX&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just really that good.</li>
            <li> I bought a blue towel, it absorbs excellent foam and gently but effectively scrubs the skin.</li>
            <li> It really does seem to stimulate your skin and gives you a tingle, in a good way.</li>
            <li> , stimulating might be the right word to use, I guess it just depends on what kind of stimulation you like.</li>
            <li> It also drys very quickly.</li>
            <li> My son likes the way it lathers up so easily.</li>

            <li> It dries easily, too.</li>
            <li> Because the towels are made of nylon, they rinse clean quite easily, thus making them much more hygienic than loofah&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> The item shipped very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Plus, you can clean it quite easily which is way better than those $3 shower puffs you get at the supermarket.</li>

            <li> Cheap, easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so super glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li> I am very well pleased!  </li>
            <li> Found it on Amazon and will purchase many more for certain.</li>
            <li> It is huge though.</li>
            <li> Like everyone else says this thing is HUGE.</li>
            <li> but the cloth is huge</li>
            <li> and it makes my skin feel smooth afterward.  </li>
            <li> fantastic item.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Now I am getting used to it, and my skin does feel smooth after using it.</li>
            <li> The Leyjie is thinner, lighter with cheaply sewn seams.</li>
            <li> A great friend of mine who lived in Hawaii slept over one evening and left one of these Bath Wash Towels for me to use since I borrowed hers while she was with me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for getting rid of dead skin cells, and&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a light texture to exfoliate and invigorate the skin.</li>
            <li> others have mentioned, they&#x27;re great for scrubbing your back (or your butt).  </li>
            <li> but your skin will be so smooth.</li>
            <li> and I thought I&#x27;d buy it since it was relatively cheap.</li>
            <li> Because of the length it&#x27;s great for washing the back.</li>
            <li> It exfoliates really well and suds up with soap nicely.</li>
            <li> Using this product leaves my skin smooth and velvety.</li>
            <li> This is a great back scrubber.  </li>
            <li> This washcloth is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> My husband introduced me to these wash towels over 30 years ago, and we think they are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I also use one to exfoliate my lips and that makes them really smooth.</li>
            <li> This item is great for exfoliating and it is so convenient for scrubbing the hard-to-reach back areas.  </li>
            <li> I remember when one of my friends linked me to this I thought it was a joke because it looks like cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> but when you rub it on the body it is smooth.  </li>
            <li> Everyone should experiment for themselves on what they feel comfortable with.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth, no dryness.</li>
            <li> We were using mesh loofas in the shower - cheap, flimsy, disposable -</li>
            <li> This is a great thing for getting rid of the bumps on skins (ingrown hairs especially).</li>
            <li> This product great for cleansing the entire body in a showering setting.</li>
            <li> It was cheap</li>
            <li> Easy to keep clean</li>
            <li> Like others mentioned, my skin feels smooth after each use.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best thing to take into the showers: you can scrub yourself all over with it folded, also with it unfolded, your back and the bottom of your feet!</li>
            <li> They do an excellent job of exfoliating, but are still gentle enough that you can use them on your face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tremendous size allows you to comfortably clean every area of your body thoroughly!</li>
            <li> In fact, i loved it so much I am purchasing another right now.</li>
            <li> So much softer than the 100% nylon version I found in TJ Maxx, and the length is perfect for keeping the back clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered received as stated!!</li>
            <li> It is easy to rinse off and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> It rinses easily and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> The Japanese Salux washcloth is amazing!</li>
            <li> I just switched washes, and the dove deep moisture with the towel is amazing!</li>
            <li> This unique wash cloth has been everything I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> top of it the seller was an absolute dream!</li>
            <li> It was great to be able to gentle scrub your back without pulling your arm out!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty sure neither one was a knockoff.</li>
            <li> it first arrived, it felt slightly more abrasive than a mesh poof.  </li>
            <li> I bathe with it, it makes me clean.</li>
            <li> If I forget it while traveling and have to use a face towel, I don&#x27;t feel as clean.  </li>
            <li> If not im going to cut it up and use it to scrub things clean because boy does it scrub.</li>
            <li> you can get them super cheap in Los Angeles at Korean $ stores.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling super smooth.</li>
            <li> so if you&#x27;re not used to that, take it easy to avoid that \\&quot;freshly peeled\\&quot; feeling.</li>
            <li> Works great in the winter when my skin gets flaky and dry.</li>
            <li> I feel clean and refreshed after my morning shower</li>
            <li> I felt so clean after using this.</li>
            <li> I feel absolutely clean all the time.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t seem to feel clean if I can&#x27;t get my scrub on. . .</li>
            <li> Just as advertised, it rinses clean of suds in just one go.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel clean without it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely the best money I&#x27;ve ever spent on any shower or bath goods.</li>
            <li> They are great for exfoliating your whole body, make it easy to clean your back.</li>
            <li> My skin is not sensitive, so the more abrasive the better!  </li>
            <li> I am certain you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> nylon wash cloth is certainly a lot more sanitary than cotton ones.</li>
            <li> I do all I can to keep them on hand and often give them to special friends as gifts.</li>
            <li> (so right!)</li>
            <li> But most importantly after every shower my skin feels SO SMOOTH AND SOFT!  </li>
            <li> Perfect for your hard to reach body parts.</li>
            <li> Amazing way to exfoliate your skin, it will be so so soft.</li>
            <li> Wash gently while you become acquainted with the texture.</li>
            <li> Not to mention this is good for cleaning and scrubbing your back......</li>
            <li> I love this thing, it really exfoliates well.</li>
            <li> #34;fake tanning&amp;#34; products, and for the product to be even, an good exfoliation is necessary.  </li>
            <li> Another thing I love so much is the length of it.</li>
            <li> it makes full body washing and showering a breeze.  </li>
            <li> Full body exfoliation...</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s good for male.</li>
            <li> I need to rub more gentle than he does,though.</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t want to use them--these are good scrubbers, still but entirely livable for me.</li>
            <li> It makes you feel super clean.</li>
            <li> This towel dries really fast, much more so than the gloves, so it&#x27;s gone into my travel kit for now.</li>
            <li> I also love how it dries fast.  </li>
            <li> This is an awesome wash cloth, it delivers just the right amount of scrubbing, not too rough and not too gentle.</li>
            <li> I love this - so much more scouring power than a shower puff, so easy to use, rinse, and dry.</li>
            <li> Great as expected!</li>
            <li> quality is just fine, however, I was pretty put off that the cloths arrived wrapped in tissue paper.  </li>
            <li> What I wound up with was the perfect facial cloth for home or a tolerable washcloth on the road which weighs 6 grams (0.25 oz) and rolls up to about the same size as a lighter.  </li>
            <li> It also lathers up alot no matter the type of soap and rinses well and dries quickly which is a plus since you don&#x27;t want mold or mildew when you shower.</li>
            <li> Love this - will order more in the future.</li>
            <li> a quick run in the washer couldn&#x27;t handle.  </li>
            <li> this feels great and leaves my skin soft and clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky since I can purchase these at nearby, Korean-owned stores for about $2.00-$2.50.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t take that much soap for it to lather up, and it also works great for your back!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also really durable and easy to rinse clean.  </li>
            <li> The size is also very convenient--makes it easy to clean everywhere.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more sanitary than a sponge because it can be thoroughly rinsed and drys quickly, and it scrubs better than just using a regular washcloth.</li>
            <li> and dries quickly, so</li>
            <li> Quick drying.</li>
            <li> I was one of the lucky ones who did not get a knock-off in the mail.</li>
            <li> Received quick, will use this seller again for this product.</li>
            <li> The delivery was quick and the wash clothes as promised.</li>
            <li> this along with either water or honey makes the best facial scrub to use with this facial cloth.</li>
            <li> I have ridiculously sensitive skin - and, while I tried my best to avoid the irritants, secondhand exposure via my husband was also a concern.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t perfect loofahs because they&#x27;re too flimsy and simply don&#x27;t get the job done, washcloths are the same deal.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m really getting clean!</li>
            <li> you are new to one of these, be warned, it is not soft and cushy like a pouf that you may be used to.  </li>
            <li> Very fast shipping too !</li>
            <li> It almost seems like its hurting at first, but then you realize how smooth it makes your skin feel after you get out of</li>
            <li> I love finally being able to scrub my own back thoroughly!</li>
            <li> Now that I shop Amazon which is completely new to me and was able to purchase it after 4yrs of using a washcloth</li>
            <li> is a great body exfoliator, and ever since I started using it, I&#x27;ve been seeing a LOT less ingrown hair on my legs (I tend to get a lot of those a couple days after shaving).</li>
            <li> The towel is durable, easy to carry, and reasonably priced (buy lots at reduced prices to save on shipping).</li>
            <li> They last a LONG time and for me they are the best at exfoliating and taking care of your skin!</li>
            <li> Good for people with limited reach or mobility while bathing.</li>
            <li> my skin is buttery soft and super glowy:)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an easy way to scrub most of your back skin off, this is what you want!</li>
            <li> When I get out of the shower my skin is very smooth and soft from all the exfoliation.</li>
            <li> but I could see a difference after the very first use; my skin is much more soft.</li>
            <li> I love a good hard scrub.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s large enough you can clean your back easily, even if your range of motion isn&#x27;t great.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for making these available</li>
            <li> These things are AWSOME , wash and massage your body together, great for removing dead skin</li>
            <li> It is really great, I had trouble finding it</li>
            <li> and it be extremely useful.</li>
            <li> Glad I finally found some at such a good price.</li>
            <li> This is great wash cloth, once you start to use, you won&#x27;t go back to your old one.</li>
            <li> The size is big and they are sturdy and they exfoliate my skin nicely.</li>
            <li> This cloth is awesome, cleans skin very well, exfoliates perfectly without being too rough, but rough enough to clear skin.</li>
            <li> Would prefer something with more natural fibers that could be used for scrubbing that wouldn&#x27;t make my skin sore.  </li>
            <li> Definately worth the 5 or 6 dollars I payed.</li>
            <li> I liked it for scrubbing my back in the shower.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews for this product, I figured it was worth 5 bucks to try.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try</li>
            <li> My skin has no problem with that, but more sensitive people may not respond well to this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definetly worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too rough on the skin, the length is perfect for getting your back, and you never have to wash it or worry about it getting smelly.</li>
            <li> bought this,which I cut up and shared with a couple of my grandchildren, I made up a facial scrub  by grinding up oatmeal, almonds, rose petals and some lavender and added clay..</li>
            <li> I was expecting to have to grit my teeth when I used it, but I figured it would be worth it.  </li>
            <li> : Be nice, warn girlfriends/guests about this towel and provide an alternative before they actually go in to take a shower.</li>
            <li> This is great for scrubbing all over with only a small amount of body wash it makes so many suds!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for scrubbing one&#x27;s back and then wadding up to get all of your other places.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d be able to get used to how rough it was!  </li>
            <li> It air dries pretty quickly and I store it in a ziploc for travel.  </li>
            <li> This is a &amp;#34;cloth&amp;#34; that is made from the same nylon fibers that make up the &amp;#34;loofah&amp;#34; scrubbers, so it stays clean when you rinse it out in the shower over many uses, rather than washcloths that may start to grow mold.</li>
            <li> + this makes your body open more and clean to efficiently lotion yourself after.</li>
            <li> Combined with a good moisturiizing soap, the exfoliation of the slightly rough texture is just what the doctor ordered!</li>
            <li> Exfoliates and lathers with even under performing body wash and bar soaps and leaves skin super smooth and soft!  </li>
            <li> The price was right</li>
            <li> I use this in the shower in the morning, and then right after, I moisturize.  </li>
            <li> It gives just the right amount of scrub, without going over board.</li>
            <li> Rinses clean and dries extremely fast.</li>
            <li> sounds kind of gross but the first time you try it</li>
            <li> It is very easy for her to use on her back.  </li>
            <li> Also, the more you spend the more you save - price per item goes down as the quantity ordered increases.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve found no other bath towel that is more durable for the price.</li>
            <li> I had these growing up &amp; they scrub soo good nothing like the ones they sell at the store nowadays with soft material that doesnt do the job , I will purchase more in the near future.</li>
            <li> I feel clean, soft, and not too mention actually clean.</li>
            <li> , I will try one more time and will try to barely graze my skin with it.</li>
            <li> Having been given an earlier version of this product by a Japanese woman in Hawaii in 1988, I was delighted to discover this product available now.</li>
            <li> However, they work just as great as what I&#x27;ve used in the past</li>
            <li> with this i can and shower in 2 minutes; the roughness is stimulating and i feel dead cells sloughing off nicely!</li>
            <li> It is far better than the jute products that I owe which typically don&#x27;t last more than a year.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about it at first but well worth the try.</li>
            <li> A great small christmas gift for ladies..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and long so I can do a sort of twist with it on my body, like a polishing motion.</li>
            <li> It is a large wash cloth and rinses and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Great to get dead skin off and super easy to wash your back.  </li>
            <li> They dry fairly quickly, making them suitable for travel.</li>
            <li> you want a good scrub down?  </li>
            <li> It was the best shower I ever took the first time I used one of these, wow my skin felt years younger and looked years younger.</li>
            <li> I bought a couple of these a few months ago when they were priced ridiculously low, and both my boyfriend and I are really impressed.</li>
            <li> Old one wore out after several years of good and faithful service.  </li>
            <li> It lathers quickly and rinses just as fast.</li>
            <li> Then, I recently read a review for the Salux cloth, and how great it was for treating back acne issues as well as exfoliation.</li>
            <li> And for those of you who are trying to be more eco-friendly, this cloth can be washed and reused, it dries quickly, and it&#x27;s a lot better than tossing loofahs, which are harder to clean properly.</li>
            <li> It is handy for being able to exfoliate your back since it&#x27;s so long.</li>
            <li> Excellent for using before applying self-tanner-no streaks or dry dark patches.</li>
            <li> normal wash clothes idk why but i dont feel clean</li>
            <li> A little abrasive, though, but good</li>
            <li> Dries extremely fast, too, so no weird smell!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great to use because of it&#x27;s length, you can reach all of those hard to scrub places with ease.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> There are various sellers of this product on Amazon, and it appears from the reviews that some are not shipping the authentic Salux product made in Japan.</li>
            <li> I first learned of these in Japan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this item at 18yrs.</li>
            <li> My sister first introduced me to these Japanese nylon washcloths many years ago.</li>
            <li> This works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I received the exact color and brand in the picture, salux.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle but powerful.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and bump free.</li>
            <li> You get used to it after the first day.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the Japanese version of a&lt;br /&gt;Turkish towel, and goes one better than that.</li>
            <li> I was first exposed to this about 6 years ago while visiting my friends in Mexico.  </li>
            <li> However, since our move, I have not been able to find them anywhere locally yet.  </li>
            <li> It works okay, but is not what I expected and may not offer some of the benefits of a true Salux cloth.</li>
            <li> When I first ordered the product I didn&#x27;t receive it.  </li>
            <li> and this helped take off the extra skin (gross, but effective!).  </li>
            <li> and I found them even better and longer lasting than the ones I had purchased before.</li>
            <li> (I also have given these as gifts to my family and friends, that is just how much I like them!)</li>
            <li> I love these wash cloths, they are the bomb - as an Asian, I grew up with these.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> but I really like them!  </li>
            <li> It is exactly like the description.</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> It is a quite simple product and that is probably what makes me appreciate it all the more; its functional.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much pressure though!  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The first one lasted about a year</li>
            <li> Instead, with my first one, I felt like I was using a pot scrubber in the beginning.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty simple girl compared to most.</li>
            <li> but FAST!  </li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more in the future!</li>
            <li> The quality is such that I believe I will be able to use it for years.  </li>
            <li> I like being able to scrub my back as well.  </li>
            <li> Love these wash towels, I only like this brand.</li>
            <li> Machine washable, wonderful texture, whats not to like?&lt;br /&gt;I was introduced to these by a lady friend, I don&#x27;t think ill ever use a loofah again.</li>
            <li> First introduced to this wash cloth at the Grand Wailea Hydro Spa in the Japanese inspired bath.</li>
            <li> The feeling before and after when I first used this made me feel &amp;#34;ahh&amp;#34; like after a hot steamy sauna session.</li>
            <li> I first purchased these years ago.</li>
            <li> first used this type of body scrubber when I lived in Japan.</li>
            <li> I have given these to many of my American friends and they all admit it took some getting use to</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more after this one wears out.</li>
            <li> I find the most abrasive wash cloth in my linen closet and use it to bathe with because I&#x27;m big on exfoiliating.</li>
            <li> Upon receiving, I saw this wasn&#x27;t exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I love taking a shower and scrubbing my back with this product.  </li>
            <li> I first tried the Salux brand skin cloths about five years ago.</li>
            <li> It has a nice rough texture.</li>
            <li> The first was a gift.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this thing!</li>
            <li> My first purchase was with the seller &amp;#34;ON CLOUD 9.&amp;#34; The Salux I received from them was a 100% legitimate Salux that was created in Japan.</li>
            <li> I prefer this 100 times more than a traditional shower loofah.  </li>
            <li> It exfoliates without being too abrasive and leaves my skin clean and very soft.</li>
            <li> It is easy to keep clean and dry.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft!!!!</li>
            <li> I did notice right away that my skin was much softer.</li>
            <li> Really feel clean and it reminds me of getting a body scrub at a spa without the high price.</li>
            <li> It is very large so you can easily reach back etc.</li>
            <li> It also more abrasive and produces less lather than the original.</li>
            <li> They really scrub the skin, doing the exfoliating that leaves skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Cleans your body very thoroughly and leaves skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Great scrubber, delivered earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I love that you can get your whole back without asking someone else for help.</li>
            <li> It achieves the same result as a good salt/oil scrub you buy, it exfoliates and moisturizes at the same time.</li>
            <li> It cleans every part of your body and most of all it definetly cleans your back very well.</li>
            <li> It is as wonderful as the african local sponge that gives you a natural exfoliative effect and it stays true for as long as ever!</li>
            <li> The first time I took a shower with this jewel, it felt amazing and my skin hadn&#x27;t felt so smooth in a long long time.</li>
            <li> first when I opened the package I didn&#x27;t expect it to do that much.</li>
            <li> best wash cloth out dont waste your time with other cloths</li>
            <li> I loved it while I was using it, but within a few hours I was covered in itchy bumps from head to toe!</li>
            <li> The original order was lost in the mail several weeks and the sender, JapanSupermall, quickly sent me a second order free.</li>
            <li> The texture never dulls and great for scrubbing off dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really easy to reach my back and scrub.</li>
            <li> I find it easier to use and handle than the poofs (also easy to scrub your back).  </li>
            <li> AND I can easily scrub my back with no problem at all.</li>
            <li> Also makes it easy to exfoliate and wash your back.</li>
            <li> Easy access to back.</li>
            <li> And the size and shape makes scrubbing your back really easy.</li>
            <li> The size makes it easy to hold in both hands and wash your back.</li>
            <li> Easy to scrub your back, holds soap well, scrubby but not too scrubby.</li>
            <li> The long length allows for you to give your back a good horizontal, vertical or diagonal scrub.</li>
            <li> My Japanese friend had one of these back in high school (shout out to Hideharu) and he always said how good it makes you feel.</li>
            <li> So, what to do with this large piece of wash cloth?</li>
            <li> its a great material, delivered super fast, and is long enough to wrap around my back and wash it.</li>
            <li> It does work really well, but perhaps too strong for a daily use like I can with the gloves.</li>
            <li> For being such a simple idea this product surely works!</li>
            <li> Very high quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit abrasive and long, but gets you squeaky clean!</li>
            <li> They are large enough to wash your entire back and they feel great \\&quot;scrubbing\\&quot; your skin.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also very long so they feel wonderful on your back, but fold down neatly so they can be hung like a regular wash cloth (and still dry fairly rapidly when folded).</li>
            <li> Likewise I like the fact it sloughs off the dead skin in a clean way; you can easily squeeze it to rinse it out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike cloth washcloths and loofas, the Salux skin cloths are HUGE; they&#x27;re designed so that you can grip one end in each hand and scrub your back.</li>
            <li> Is nothing like the real thing in results, quality and feel.</li>
            <li> This&lt;br /&gt;was supposed to be a gift and now have to wait and go through the whole process of&lt;br /&gt;return and refund.</li>
            <li> I really feel ripped off and taken advantage of.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to go.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i love the harder clothes, i have been using this since 1970&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> but it seems to be a very well made luffa towel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier to hold</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why these are selling for so much online.</li>
            <li> I ordered my item from the Pandora seller and received the genuine Salux cloth and not a Chinese knockoff.  </li>
            <li> After just 1 use you can feel how much softer and smoother your skin is.</li>
            <li> they replaced the package real</li>
            <li> Having arthritis in one shoulder really hinders my ability to reach everwher I need to.  </li>
            <li> but it makes your skin feel much smoother and cleaner.</li>
            <li> but it really exfoliates well.</li>
            <li> really makes showering feel cleansing</li>
            <li> I used to have to stock up and buy a whole bunch of them when visiting family in Hawaii, or beg them to send me some in the mail.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very vigorous scrub</li>
            <li> Really exfoliates your skin.</li>
            <li> but it made my skin so much softer.  </li>
            <li> It really works well for that purpose.</li>
            <li> It really makes my skin feel so much softer.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews of others so you can select the real thing.</li>
            <li> Unbeknownst to me, the item was packed pressed up close against the very outer layer of the packing envelope.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I really needed a loofah</li>
            <li> Works great for exfoliating without irritating skin.</li>
            <li> A bit ti much for the face</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother &amp; absorbs lotion really well.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> This thing is for real.  </li>
            <li> you find it too rough, as you will get used to it and actually enjoy it!</li>
            <li> and it really is exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I feel very rejuvenated after using it</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive but works well.</li>
            <li> but I enjoy mine well enough to assume it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend trying it!</li>
            <li> very exfoliate much scrub</li>
            <li> Not to sound to gross</li>
            <li> It really leaves you feeling a lot cleaner than a loofah will.</li>
            <li> I really like this towel.  </li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> This product exfoliates very well and is made of a very sturdy material.  </li>
            <li> I really like these.</li>
            <li> After much research, I stumbled upon the Japanese-style nylon washcloths and decided to give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast-forward to today</li>
            <li> very scratchy</li>
            <li> Another bonus, my skin is really exfoliated and has been looking great!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The second feature I love is its exfoliating capability leaving skin soft.  </li>
            <li> Daily exfoliation keeps skin soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> The blue Salux scrubbers I bought are perfect; they have enough \\&quot;body\\&quot; not to just bunch up into a skinny rope when I try to scrub my back, and the texture is aggressive enough to feel that they&#x27;re really doing something.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Another plus: These things work up such a great lather that I&#x27;ve been using less liquid soap!</li>
            <li> and I like the way it can fold into a half width or be used at full width quite comfortably.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extra long length makes it perfect for getting your entire back.  </li>
            <li> Just one week using these Salux wash cloths resulted in a remarkable difference in my arms and legs, to the point where I have finally gone back to wearing short dresses and skirts without pantyhose.</li>
            <li> In China,&amp;#34; !SEND IT BACK IMMEDIATELY, UNOPENED, FOR A REFUND!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW OF THE ORIGINAL, &amp;#34;SALUX&amp;#34; JAPANESE-MADE CLOTH: .......</li>
            <li> I got two at a very reasonable sum and will probably order a few more just to have on hand for guests, etc.  </li>
            <li> I use a small hanger to hang mine next to the rest of my towels for easy use :) Absolutely recommend!</li>
            <li> The slightly rough texture is just right for getting you clean.</li>
            <li> Size allows you to thoroughly clean back.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;m talking about the authentic Salux nylon, made in Japan, not some imitation some here</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps a imitation product would have worked better.</li>
            <li> I definitely feel clean after using this cloth -</li>
            <li> It is somewhat more course than a typical cloth of this type, is a full three feet long for easy use on your back, and holds up really well over time.</li>
            <li> I use it everywhere on my body, and have found it to be a very thorough cleaning cloth, and would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I even used it with considerable pressure on my arms &amp; legs (as opposed to people saying to be very gentle with it).  </li>
            <li> The product is just a long rectangular towel, it makes it super easy to wash your back, and it lathers soap so well.</li>
            <li> When it came I really liked it, but it did look cheaply made and a little rough to use.</li>
            <li> but it really exfoliates your skin just enough to leave it feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> When I first met my husband he would always tell me how soft my skin was</li>
            <li> Saves money because they lather so much better and last so much longer than regular loofahs</li>
            <li> THIS, though, makes me feel smooth, soft, and is gentle enough to use every day.</li>
            <li> Not bad for under ten bucks.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t live without them!</li>
            <li> It drys very quickly - Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> My skin feels NEW!  </li>
            <li> and you can really see the new skin glow.</li>
            <li> This is really important in winter months when I suffer from really dry skin.</li>
            <li> Much better than your typical loofa.</li>
            <li> Being a heavy person it is good for cleaning your back area, but you will have to get use to the feel of the material on your skin.  </li>
            <li> I prefer it more coarse so that it is actually exfoliating me.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll only run into a problem if you don&#x27;t have enough soap on it, you&#x27;ll be able to tell if you don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> however, with this towel you really do have to be completely out of the line of running water while using it, otherwise it will lose its lather fast and require re-soaping.</li>
            <li> Growing up as a person of Korean ethnic background, I have used this exact wash cloth pretty much my entire life.</li>
            <li> Its still very useable and hasn&#x27;t frayed more than few pieces</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is constantly commenting on how soft and smooth my skin is.</li>
            <li> wow such soft so impress wow such happiness</li>
            <li> and they last long and very easy to clean before getting out of the shower, just hang in the shower to dry.</li>
            <li> A little bit more rough than expected, but still good.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> so i highly recommend getting one from amazon.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item.  </li>
            <li> These wash cloths allow scrubbing the back in a more natural manner much like drying your back with a bath towel.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is sad that I&#x27;m so excited over a wash cloth, but I am (it&#x27;s the small things when you get older, lol!).  </li>
            <li> For the record, I use Apricot scrub all over my body, but for a washcloth, I need a little more softness.</li>
            <li> But wow!!</li>
            <li> I could use the ones available in the market, but it seemed ridiculous to spend money on something I had for free.</li>
            <li> , I put in in the laundry and air dry it to clean it every so often.  </li>
            <li> They rinse clean in seconds, dry in minutes.</li>
            <li> It has a fairly rough texture which is a fantastic exfoliator.  </li>
            <li> Towel has been very durable so far.</li>
            <li> However, I was pleasantly surprised at how much softer my skin was after using it.  </li>
            <li> wow very five stars</li>
            <li> Pairs great with expensive soap you want to hold onto for a while.</li>
            <li> so i don&#x27;t have to waste more soap.</li>
            <li> These items probably only cost pennies to produce but the results are worth the price alone.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to the normal bath poof, this is going to feel like sandpaper.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking of buying a few more for friends.  </li>
            <li> They are bit rough for the face or other, ahem, sensitive areas, but for anywhere else you want to be squeaky clean and exfoliated, there&#x27;s nothing better.  </li>
            <li> It only requires minimum shower gel to get a great long-lasting lather, which means I&#x27;ve actually noticed I buy less shower gel over the months!  </li>
            <li> It has a long length which makes it easy to reach my whole back.</li>
            <li> It creates an amazing lather, which helps me use less soap overall.</li>
            <li> This worked well, but easily broke down in the shower.</li>
            <li> This product is perfectly fine for highly sensitive skin as I have extremely sensitive skin, you don&#x27;t have to be extremely abrasive with this product at all, just a gentle rub</li>
            <li> I live in Florida with its incumbent humidity</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the Salux bath towel or any of the nylon bath towels.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live with it now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using mine for three months and its still like brand new.</li>
            <li> cant live without these</li>
            <li> if you are delicate or a tenderfoot you may need some time to get used to it as it&#x27;s a rough scrub but great afterwards.</li>
            <li> When I actually got the real Salux, I realized just how much of a difference there was between the two.</li>
            <li> and I like the way the cloths dry so quickly.  </li>
            <li> If you get bleach on it, it will turn light blue, as I found out recently while cleaning my bathroom.</li>
            <li> and I like the fact I can reach all areas of my back in a simple comfortable manner.  </li>
            <li> My second purchase was with &amp;#34;JapanSuperMall.&amp;#34; I purchased the item on December 27th for a total of $4.27 with free shipping</li>
            <li> Highly recommended if you&#x27;re looking for a different or new shower experience where you feel like you&#x27;re actually getting clean when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> No other scrubbers really exfoliate your skin well except for these.</li>
            <li> This product is cheap, seems so far long lasting, and really gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> Long enough to give your back a good cleaning and take off any skin you don&#x27;t want at the same time.</li>
            <li> The scrubber is quite long so she can easily hold it with both hands and scrub her shoulders and back.</li>
            <li> They are great for exfoliating your entire body, even your hard to reach back and shoulders.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin so soft!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more coarse than \\&quot;poofs\\&quot; that other people bathe with.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll feel amazingly soft afterwards!</li>
            <li> You are able to toss them in the washing machine weekly for extra cleanliness and they are made very solidly; I anticipate they will last years.  </li>
            <li> It works just as well, if not better than a sugar scrub, and leave your skin feeling silky smooth!</li>
            <li> It was worth buying because I can now reach spots that were hard to get clean.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I save the old ones to scrub the tub!  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling SOO soft!</li>
            <li> More so than the sponge poufs I&#x27;ve been using in the past.</li>
            <li> I bought my first Salux Nylon on the island of Kauai several years ago.  </li>
            <li> I was a little nervous reading some of the reviews that said this was too rough, but I think the texture is perfect (although if you don&#x27;t want something rough - definitely buy one that is not rough-weave).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the authentic Salux one (not the Chinese imitation).  </li>
            <li> It truly makes me feel clean not like those other cloths from Walmart or anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Due to the weaved nature of the fabric, after a quick rinse, the cloth will dry exceptionally quickly after use.</li>
            <li> No matter how gentle and careful I was when using it, it always made palms of my hands red, raw, dry and incredibly itchy like nothing</li>
            <li> The cloth I use is firm and easily cleans after each use.</li>
            <li> It may seem rough at first, but it does really well</li>
            <li> towel is pretty big and as the picture denotes on the package, I suppose you could use the whole thing to scrub your back</li>
            <li> This nylon cloth works well as it dries quickly and is coarse in texture, similar to a brush.</li>
            <li> I especially like the large size.</li>
            <li> great for exfoliation, dont press to hard or it hurts a little.</li>
            <li> So be careful using it the first time!  </li>
            <li> They foam well with soap, then rinse clear.</li>
            <li> Its not harsh on the body or face.</li>
            <li> I just ordered a package of three directly from saluxshop.com.</li>
            <li> Will buy straight from Salux dealer in the future.</li>
            <li> and it makes you feel soft after bathing.</li>
            <li> Besides that, the towels are too soft to provide any scrubbing</li>
            <li> old and had never felt anything like it before.</li>
            <li> You can really cut it into 2 maybe even 3 different pieces</li>
            <li> The old ones I recycle as my travel wash</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough to use it on your face also, so I do that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised that these haven&#x27;t caught on yet.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive skin, but the effects are noticeable.  </li>
            <li> but I can still use it on sensitive areas like my face.</li>
            <li> When I use it I feel refreshed, and my arms are soft</li>
            <li> This product literally rubs off all your old skin and leaves you body soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> I tried it out and even with only a gentle rub it caused skin abrasions.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin sooo soft.</li>
            <li> I hang mine on the towel rack at the end of the shower/tub after rinsing and it&#x27;s ready next time I want to use it.  </li>
            <li> They seemed reasonable enough and since my skin is a chronic problem of sensitivity</li>
            <li> you will see the benefits it offers.  </li>
            <li> Silky smooth skin everyday, and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried scrubs, loofahs, mesh bath poofs (which Salux now replaced), pumice stones, natural sponges, salt scrub, I can&#x27;t think of everything.  </li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> WOW what a difference there is when using it.  </li>
            <li> My itchy unwashed back thanks you.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like to have a bunch of different types of scrubs and soaps and formulas.</li>
            <li> but idk about sensitive areas .</li>
            <li> It made the old skin come off.</li>
            <li> I suffer from KP on my upper arms, which has worsened over the years and this has really helped exfoliate that area.  </li>
            <li> for years I used them to keep my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling soft and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> Prepared to be surprised.</li>
            <li> I can get my back really well without having to switch to the loofah on a stick that I use for that area.</li>
            <li> It feels similar to a loofa and is not irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li> Wow was I surprised by what a difference it made.</li>
            <li> it is ready for the next time you need it.</li>
            <li> You can really wash your back yourself.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT, MANUFACTURED IN JAPAN [NOT in China], or its quality WILL NO-WHERE NEARLY MATCH</li>
            <li> The one improvement I could suggest is to mold a soft rubber bead across each end to help</li>
            <li> Warning: If you have soft or sensitive skin, this will scratch you up and it takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> but I personally keep mine whole.</li>
            <li> These towels are just abrasive enough to give your skin a good scrub without irritating the skin.</li>
            <li> Seemed expensive, but it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> On my second one, at first it was a little bit rough getting used to that harsher exfoliating property with a new one again, but now after a few days, I&#x27;m once again used to the somewhat harsh feeling and am enjoying the full exfoliation and cleansing properties that this wash cloth/towel offers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $5 for a year&#x27;s worth of use, give it a shot and just be patient if at first</li>
            <li> The knitting is tight and stretchy and works much better than other nylon wash products and feels much softer.</li>
            <li> I usually get a new one each year, just to be safe when it comes to a hygiene, but they could easily last longer than that.  </li>
            <li> The length is great for cleaning your back and any other hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;recycling&amp;#34; act extends their VERY useful life-span ANOTHER few</li>
            <li> They create lots of lather from just a small amount of soap or bodywash, they exfoliate your skin without feeling overly abrasive and are gentle enough to use on your face, they scrub your back better and with more ease than any back brush, and they dry quickly and last a long, long time.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after about a year, the towel tore as I was gripping it to clean my back.</li>
            <li> The price was right and the cyberspace ink didn&#x27;t even dry before I received an email that the order had shipped!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the original longer ones, not cheap like swap meet ones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to ball up and grip with your hand and then open it up to clean your entire back area, which can be hard to do with a loofah.</li>
            <li> A little soap lasts forever on this towel, and it&#x27;s extra length was great for me since I have wide shoulders that make it hard to clean my back.</li>
            <li> So much better than those ridiculous puff things.</li>
            <li> It helps exfoliate dead skin cells and helps you feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> This bath towel does get a decent amount of lather and exfoliates as much as a standard synthetic loofah.</li>
            <li> I really like it because I use it everyday consistently</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I will continue to use this daily as it is quite abrasive, but I am so glad that I bought it.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for many years, usually have to search for it in Asian food stores.</li>
            <li> Although it is long, it is a bit too large for wash cloths.  </li>
            <li> They last a long time and dry very quickly.</li>
            <li> Exfoliates very well and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> When I first started to use this product, it felt rough when washing.</li>
            <li> These towels are rough at first</li>
            <li> This wash cloth is rough at first for those not used to it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty rough</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to have a friend recommend looking on Amazon to locate one of these long scrubbing towels to do my back.  </li>
            <li> used to find it at a shop on Grant Ave in SF Chinatown, and an Asian mart in Bergenfield, New Jersey.  </li>
            <li> even though I use it daily, it&#x27;s still like brand new after months of use.</li>
            <li> When I got this product, I was shocked that many reviews referred to it being comfortable</li>
            <li> Salux makes my skin soft, silky, smooth, clean, removes dead skin, prevents breakouts, prevents dry, flaky skin, prevents itchy skin as it removes the dead skin.</li>
            <li> The design is rather simple since it is like a long scarf; but it manages to cover my 6&#x27;3&amp;#34; frame pretty well</li>
            <li> Traditional washcloths were my least favorite options because they don&#x27;t exfoliate or work up the desired lather.</li>
            <li> After a few months of use, I use it about once per week everywhere and have kind of gotten use to it, but use it a few times per week on my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could only seeing you not liking this product if you have very sensitive skin, or don&#x27;t like pain.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why there is so much hype about a cheap piece of rough nylon cloth.  </li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use it for a few days I&#x27;m very aware of tension in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it builds lather as easily as a loofah, but I like lots of lather and found this wash cloth builds enough lather for my tastes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been looking for a small back brush to take on trips, but couldn&#x27;t find anything the right size, one that wouldn&#x27;t take up much room in a suitcase.  </li>
            <li> I think it is too harsh for the face, but I love using it on my feet as well as my other skin.</li>
            <li> I rubbed too hard and it stung after my shower, but I&#x27;ve learned to be a little more gentle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and long, but personally I find it a little too rough.  </li>
            <li> If you use it tightly against your skin, your skin will become red rather quickly</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s no more than a piece of cheaply made nylon that gave me dermatitis, especially on my hands.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had such soft skin on my arms and legs ...</li>
            <li> you never tried one, it will be rough at first (especially if you shower using just a bare soap bar or a face towel).  </li>
            <li> the traditional scrubbie when you&#x27;re done with your shower, you can hold it up lengthwise toward the shower flow and watch all of the old soap &amp; crud rinse out.  </li>
            <li> I like this cloth a lot because you barely have to use any soap to lather up with this</li>
            <li> I bought this because for some reason as an adult I&#x27;d been breaking out on my back.</li>
            <li> if there&#x27;s an asian grocery store near you, they had this on the shelf for $5.</li>
            <li> Smooths rough skin very well.</li>
            <li> Do no buy this product, especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Their washability make them a sanitary, economical, and green alternative to those bunched-up mesh</li>
            <li> The rest of the mainland hasn&#x27;t caught on yet (at least not mainstream stores - unless one is lucky enough to live near an Asian supermarket/store).  </li>
            <li> When I lived in Hawaii these were a common product at any local drug store and easy to get.</li>
            <li> Scrubs the dead skin and dirt right off.</li>
            <li> Replace your poufs and never worry about what&#x27;s hiding in all those nooks and crannies that never dry out!</li>
            <li> is getting just as much exfoliation as the other parts.</li>
            <li> I always used to buy sugar scrubs from the store-and I am positive that I missed spots on my back, and probably other places.  </li>
            <li> The reason I ordered it was specifically because I wanted the Salux brand and the only reason I didn&#x27;t return it was because I didn&#x27;t want to deal with the hassle, time, and expense of shipping this thing back during the busy holiday season.</li>
            <li> After taken a shower with this cloth then I apply the body lotion so the skin does not dry out.  </li>
            <li> My skin has never felt smoother, no dry patches, no ashy elbows.  </li>
            <li> It is a little scratchy the first time</li>
            <li> First 2 or 3 times will take a little getting use to, because of the coarseness.  </li>
            <li> Really, it only felt maybe a tad rougher than those nylon poufs that are sold in every drug store, &amp; that&#x27;s not rough at all!  </li>
            <li> A little more rough than I expected,  </li>
            <li> Gentle enough for my face but also rough enough for when I need it to be.</li>
            <li> Also, although some sellers do charge outrageous shipping, I had no trouble finding a seller with fair rates, and this product is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> A little coarse and abrasive at first</li>
            <li> I sometimes use this for dry rubbing too because it is gentle enough to use dry.</li>
            <li> It really helps before shaving too, my razor gets less clogged after exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (they don&#x27;t stay soft for long but initially they are).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Whole Foods also has a version which is a little longer, and softer.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand the hotel bath towels that are never long enough to scrub my upper back.</li>
            <li> If you have (or want) tough, but smooth skin, this towel is for you.</li>
            <li> I have such profound dry skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit scratchy, but not too much so - just enough to let you scrub as much or as little as needed.  </li>
            <li> Super product, only I found the product too long for me to use, so I had to cut it in half and sew the rough edge.  </li>
            <li> My normal washcloths start to smell after use of less than a week.  </li>
            <li> Little rough on the skin for first couple of uses; then I got used to it.</li>
            <li> We cycle through about one a week - more during the summer, when my husband&#x27;s likely to have brushed up against poison ivy and other problem plants - so each cloth has been through the washer at least 43 times (on average).</li>
            <li> it spread out flat while I do my back.  </li>
            <li> When this arrived I immediately noticed it was a knock-off of the original and appeared to be of poor quality.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use them every time I shower, but twice or so a week, since I&#x27;m not sure if the constant exfoliation would be too much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s an almost-all synthetic, long washcloth with a REAL &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; propensity to &amp;#34;sloth&amp;#34; away dead skin, dirt and body oils that leave you feeling &amp;#34;invigorated&amp;#34; after every shower or bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> long enough to use on my back and arms and anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is long so it can do your back and is so simple to wash and hang in the shower.</li>
            <li> This does the job!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  works a described, dries quickly, long enough to wash back</li>
            <li> The cloth is long enough to stretch over your back and scrub.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long enough to grab with both hands and reach your back.  </li>
            <li> For those who have trouble with the size of it, I just fold it up into a small square, and use it like a sponge/loofah and scrub every where, and when I want to scrub my back, I just open it back up to full size.</li>
            <li> This is really nothing out of the ordinary that you can&#x27;t buy in any drug store around the corner.</li>
            <li> at least they are married.</li>
            <li> No more flakey skin even after I moisturize as this nylon body wash gently takes it all off.  </li>
            <li> It makes a tiny bit of soap go a LONG way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The towels come in several colors -- blue, pink, yellow --</li>
            <li> so it actually saves you $$ in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are long lasting about a year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for this for sooo long at the asian stores</li>
            <li> They last so long.  </li>
            <li> Really long so I can exfoliate my back well.</li>
            <li> It is wide and long so you can really get all areas of your body, I started using it with a regular body wash, and its true, you only need a tiny bit because the towel lathers like crazy..</li>
            <li> I only hope it lasts a long time to justify the cost.</li>
            <li> These cloths are soft enough but also course enough to take off dead skin.  </li>
            <li> These last a long time and exfoliate the skin well.</li>
            <li> Be careful using, as it can really strip your skin with little effort.</li>
            <li> it is pretty long so you can scrub in hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> can if they don&#x27;t dry out properly.</li>
            <li> These are the cure for the winter dry skin, itchy back.</li>
            <li> I used it on soft skin like my stomach (but with less pressure).</li>
            <li> Not everyone can use a back brush due to physical problems and even age.</li>
            <li> I have a very dry back that flakes a lot skin.  </li>
            <li> They are big enough I cut mine in half, so they last a long time.</li>
            <li> Actually you feel like you&#x27;ve visited an expensive spa with the clean tingle you feel when done...</li>
            <li> The scrubbing surface is a little more aggressive than I&#x27;d anticipated and can be uncomfortable in some areas, but it definitely gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked by how rough it was at first, but it really exfoliates my skin and my skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li> After moving away from Hawaii, I was afraid I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find these anymore.</li>
            <li> When my loofa wasn&#x27;t cutting it exfoliation-wise, I started looking into products that might serve me better.</li>
            <li> I will say it is slightly painful as it kind of scrapes the surface of your skin..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still cheap enough that I had no problems buying another one, I was just disappointed that my normal use could cause a tear.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand for a long time now.</li>
            <li> But now I use it everyday and after every shower my skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li> The long length facilitates back-scrubbing and foot-cleaning.</li>
            <li> I purchased these since the price was similar to what I had spent in person.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can tell from my uses so far that will serve for quite a while (easily few months).</li>
            <li> its long so you can reach anything.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s literally about 3 feet long.</li>
            <li> This summer I went to Japan and had the pleasure of experiencing one of these long exfoliating towels.</li>
            <li> I will continue to order them and use them for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of accustoming to the strange abrasive feel, but once you lather it up and use the length to your advantage</li>
            <li> I have not had mine as long as some others here, but I have noticed no deterioration in the cloth whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> This cloth also lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve been using those poufs for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The product itself is a long sheet of 60% nylon and 40% polyester.</li>
            <li> It is extremely long and rigid, you can cut it into sheets if you&#x27;d like to</li>
            <li> At first you will think it is similar to a synthetic scouring pad you might use in your kitchen; but once you see how thin it is and how to manipulate it for use</li>
            <li> It felt harsh to my skin on my first use, but I got used to it after a few times.</li>
            <li> The only reason i&#x27;d even heard of them is from reading reviews on how these were recommended for black soap, as the rag doesn&#x27;t stain like regular wash cloths.</li>
            <li> you will see how much stuff your previous loofahs, sponges, wash cloths and scrubs have been missing.</li>
            <li> With the summer being so intense in Texas, I slather on sunscreen 2-3 times per days - if not more per day!</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s long enough to scrub my back, which I was definitely missing with the loofah.</li>
            <li> I am never going back to any other type of body scrubber again.  </li>
            <li> Been looking for this item for a long time!</li>
            <li> This is much better than using expensive chemical products to exfoliate/get rid of hairs!</li>
            <li> and I can use the other as a back up or use it on my face)</li>
            <li> My back also doesn&#x27;t itch like it did before I assumed due to dry skin or hair growth or who knows..</li>
            <li> I use this cloth every day to help eliminate flaking from dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It by no means cures my dry skin, but since I started using these I no longer get alligator skin on my legs like I used to.  </li>
            <li> I have really dry, itchy skin this time of year, and I don&#x27;t know why, but this helps a lot.  </li>
            <li> (I wash with shower gel seperately bc of my dry skin).</li>
            <li> wash mine in the washing machine with the rest of my towels, and allow it to air dry.  </li>
            <li> Just rinse &amp; hang it to dry when finished &amp;</li>
            <li> It grosses me out how it takes forever for the inside of those loofahs to dry.  </li>
            <li> I spent hundreds of dollars on various creams and exfoliators to see minimal results.</li>
            <li> Every single bath/shower should have one of these.</li>
            <li> This dries faster than the &amp;#34;loofah&amp;#34; scrubbers because it is a single sheet of material.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s genius; so many tiny woven patterns to flush out all your dirty little pores on your body&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> i have a small shower space, so this means i have to turn off the shower completely while using the towel</li>
            <li> its maybe a little rough at first, but it wears down a little  </li>
            <li> Im not sure i could ever go back to a regular loofah puff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than any of the (often expensive) exfoliating scrubs I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> (b/c it gets the dead skin off), and it&#x27;s long (to get the back area).</li>
            <li> the way, these last about a year to a year and a half before you should replace.</li>
            <li> A little rough and scratchy, but I do like it overall.</li>
            <li> When I was a little girl, I used the the natural gourd loofah grown and dried by mo grandmother.</li>
            <li> A little rough, but definitely gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This towel is not too hard and not too soft for my skin.</li>
            <li> He is 6&#x27;1, he has some mild acne on his back that drives him mad, and I know this thing is going to get rid of that issue for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had my \\&quot;back scrubby\\&quot; for so long it had lost texture and had a small rip.</li>
            <li> A towel with rough texture.</li>
            <li> Not much of a novelty.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s so rough and scratchy</li>
            <li> It was rough and smelled like fish.</li>
            <li> worry about it being too rough.</li>
            <li> It says Salux, so that is what I expected.  </li>
            <li> But I would be too embarassed to give something so rough to a friend or family member.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a pink Salux towel for myself and was so amazed by its performance that I decided to purchase one for him.  </li>
            <li> Too rough , don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> Some people may feel rough on skin though.</li>
            <li> The towel is slightly rough so you use it for exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I get the idea, but it&#x27;s just way too rough for me.</li>
            <li> Received item faster than expected.</li>
            <li> Wet body dirt and place body wash onto cloth.  </li>
            <li> It is so rough and scratchy that it hurts.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a towel, not much to say.</li>
            <li> I will say, the cloth is rough.  </li>
            <li> but I think it was too rough</li>
            <li> They really do change your bathing game, and I can&#x27;t imagine not having them now.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I was expecting something that felt rough.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe for people who are used to a washcloth it feels rough -- but not to me at all.</li>
            <li> Just some cheap knock off brand mad in china.  </li>
            <li> When I opened it carefully with sharp scissors, I immediately slit into the product.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands and these tend to keep their rough texture for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> Would not suggest it unless youre trying to scrub your back raw</li>
            <li> And they dry quickly - no yucky sponges or poofs.  </li>
            <li> All you need is a bit of soap and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> For over a decade I&#x27;ve been embarrassed to expose my legs due to what I eventually found out was Keratosis Pilaris.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item mostly because of its length, but was disappointed with the texture.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be made out of some other material</li>
            <li> When I first saw it, I was skeptical and even thinking...</li>
            <li> not as life changing as some of the other reviews might make it seem.</li>
            <li> You can find this cheaper other places on the web.</li>
            <li> My mother has been buying these washcloths from an Asian Market for her family for the past 20 years.  </li>
            <li> and if you have psoriasis or other skin conditions I would say it is amongst the &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> You just have to get past the initial roughness.  </li>
            <li> It feel sharp when you hold it in your hand</li>
            <li> and I felt cleaner after using it due to the exfoliating effect.</li>
            <li> Start from feet and start very very gently on other part of body.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other exfoliating cloths which were horrible--they tore and did not exfoliate as well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other \\&quot;Korean</li>
            <li> I end up playing games with it to see how much sudsiness I can get with how little amount of body wash (Oil of Olay, Victoria&#x27;s Secret).  </li>
            <li> This wash cloth is just too very rough on the skin for our use.&lt;br /&gt;REVISED REVIEW:</li>
            <li> I cut them in half and use one for a few months before using the second half.</li>
            <li> I suspect a lot of positive reviews are fake.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon, but I usually buy this from local Korean markrts and price may less than here.</li>
            <li> It is a little rough</li>
            <li> Feels a little rough</li>
            <li> Can it feel a little rough?  </li>
            <li> Yes, but sometimes a girl needs it a little rough.  </li>
            <li> If you ever get to try this shower towel, the texture is very delicate, intricate, and rough, but not too rough at the same time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (especially if you&#x27;re really dirty and don&#x27;t have sensitive skin!!)</li>
            <li> (I am an asian in my late 20).</li>
            <li> If this is the case, don&#x27;t even bother opening it - just register a complaint with Amazon and get your money back!</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;re done using the Salux just throw it on a towel rack and it&#x27;ll be dry within a few hours!</li>
            <li> I have tried the conventional loofahs and they soon fall apart and become a mess.</li>
            <li> A single towel usually lasts me 6-9 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have used other products like a round loofh and it just glides over my skin</li>
            <li> Some of them are slightly longer than others.  </li>
            <li> I also throw mine in the washer, but it does make it less abrasive after a while.</li>
            <li> You need less soap to cleanse skin lathers well.</li>
            <li> Less soap equals less drying affect on the skin.</li>
            <li> And for $3 or less, how could you NOT want one of these things???  </li>
            <li> The blemishes also appears less pronounced.</li>
            <li> less then a couple or hours when hung from its end or draped in its middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At the time I was having some serious issues with contact dermatitis caused by exposure to various plants -</li>
            <li> Put a little shower gel on there, lather it up and rub yourself down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a really long and weird shaped rag, I cut mine into smaller pieces but WARNING if you do this, commit to stitching everything down with a sewing machine.</li>
            <li> Loofahs are not effective exfoliators for folks that have unusually dry skin, Keratosis Pilaris, etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They produce copious amounts of foam with small amounts of almost any body-wash liquid or bar soaps and the cloths, themselves, last me at least a couple of years before they must be replaced (always, because a couple of inches of their ends begin to tear off after that amount of time/usage, during the type of back-scrub motions as exhibited on the package&#x27;s front side)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little rougher than the gourd loofah</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a cloth made of that material that those little loofa shower puffs are made from.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t you are going to have little strings/fibers all over</li>
            <li> After about a week of use I do see some improvement in the little bumps on my legs.  </li>
            <li> It works well....not too abrasive...just enough to remove soap scum!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Imagine rubbing your wet body down with #12 sand paper - your neck, your back, your elbows and your crack - sorry, off track there.</li>
            <li> I follow ny shower with heavy moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This cloth will remove dead skin cells and help your circulation.</li>
            <li> So scrubby without being harsh.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on one of those stick pumice things.</li>
            <li> It is rougher than a loofah, but after a month and a few washes in the laundry, I&#x27;ve gotten used to it and like it.</li>
            <li> I bit the bullet to order a few.  </li>
            <li> but this cloth will remove the dead skin that collect doing the day.  </li>
            <li> Also, it does shed a few threads from time to time.</li>
            <li> Salux is a specific brand so to say something is Salux when in fact it does not say Salux on the package would be false advertising.</li>
            <li> I sent them an email and when neither of us could figure out where my package went (I&#x27;m willing to bet my idiotic post office lost it)</li>
            <li> I used ALOT less soap than usual.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really long, so I will be cutting mine in half and giving the other half to my husband.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am sorry that you didn&#x27;t received all 3 towels, but since it is exactly 2 months now that you finally do the claim, we are very sorry</li>
            <li> I usually keep mine for a couple years</li>
            <li> No more lufas for me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, another posted mentioned that these are not actual Salux cloths</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s over priced, in China, it&#x27;s  no more than CNY 5 or 1 dollar.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After ~6 months of daily use, the texture gets a bit weird</li>
            <li> and I usually replace them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lathers so well even with a small amount of body wash.</li>
            <li> Not sure what else to say.</li>
            <li> You put a small amount of soap on it and squeeze it a bunch of times and you have tons of suds.  </li>
            <li> usually fully-dries in</li>
            <li> Washcloths\\&quot; in the past, all of which turned out to be too fine-woven and flimsy to scrub well.  </li>
            <li> very very harsh and scratchy.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to scrub hard or you will make your skin raw.</li>
            <li> Oh and now I can reach my back because of it&#x27;s length which I struggled to do with my measly square washcloth.</li>
            <li> And I was not scrubbing too hard.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ll warn you that you shouldn&#x27;t use it too hard.</li>
            <li> Hard to wear out unless you snag them.  </li>
            <li> Still, it hasn&#x27;t soured me at all on this towel.</li>
            <li> This product is actually quite dangerous if used on the face.</li>
            <li> I use this every day in the shower and it is literally like the cloth never ages or loses its texture.</li>
            <li> It never looses its texture and never retains any dirt or soap scum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for at least thirty years.  </li>
            <li> but their skin is softer and they can never go back to their boring old</li>
            <li> have complained about.  </li>
            <li> Besides being thicker than the others I&#x27;ve bought, the Salux is at least 6\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I used to use the tube-o-exfoliant, but I often found that to feel too harsh -- then I found out that it often is, as they use gritty materials (like ground walnut shells) that are really bad for your skin.</li>
            <li> I was extremely upset that I was unable to purchase it when I moved to MA in 2006 from Fla. and looked for it in Chinatown to no avail.</li>
            <li> After the first use I noticed a shocking amount of dead skin floating toward the shower drain, so</li>
            <li> I have a very small stand up shower and had no problem with it staying soapy.</li>
            <li> Seriously, how could anyone NOT give this 5 stars?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li> Wash in cold water and then air dry.)</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and was afraid this nylon product would irritate it</li>
            <li> which were so tough</li>
            <li> Just hit the back button a few times to get away from this dreadful product.  </li>
            <li> As others have said they last forever - I have had one of these for over 10 years - I just bought another so that I could have one in my travel kit because I hate to be without it.  </li>
            <li> and you would basically be scratching and irritating your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lathers like crazy and rubs off dead skin as well.  </li>
            <li> And they feel heavenly on tired feet.</li>
            <li> Although I am slightly disappointed because it wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting, it&#x27;s not too bad and does a decent job exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I saw the rave reviews and figured it wouldn&#x27;t be too bad if it didn&#x27;t work since it was less than $10 with shipping.</li>
            <li> As I understand it (and I may be wrong)</li>
            <li> The bottom line is that the Leyjie is too expensive for what you&#x27;re given.</li>
            <li> Wtf?</li>
            <li> I was skeptical despite all the reviews.  </li>
            <li> I must have gotten a fake product.</li>
            <li> Also, sugar scrub it difficult to use on your feet...</li>
            <li> sorry ...</li>
            <li> I was looking for an exfoliation cloth because I don&#x27;t like using the chemicals and buying exfoliation cremes can get expensive.</li>
            <li> I randomly found a glowing review of this thing online and thought, hey why not..</li>
            <li> Words cannot express my anger at the moment and an angry customer is not a repeating customer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve already ordered another for a friend of mine who suffers from skin issues and she also waxes.  </li>
            <li> and if I don&#x27;t use one during a shower, I feel dirty as heck.  </li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with this!</li>
            <li> I dont know why anyone gave this a bad review.</li>
            <li> well I suggest you purchase one of these bad boys.  </li>
            <li> :-(  </li>
            <li> However, I am disappointed at it.</li>
            <li> If you are thinking about buying this; you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This might get annoying come winter time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;which is horrible!</li>
            <li> Horrible..</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE quality Leyjie versions arrived.  </li>
            <li> This is a horribly product that i shouldn&#x27;t have even buy it.  </li>
            <li> that are really annoying!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this - so much more scouring power than a shower puff, so easy to use, rinse, and dry. I&#x27;m back to buy another one for myself and one for my sister. I&#x27;ve never had such soft skin on my arms and legs ... this summer is going to be smooth and silky!</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found to really clean my body. Its not harsh on the body or face. I strongly recommend this item. I have used other products like a round loofh and it just glides over my skin and I don&#x27;t feel like it cleaned my body.</li>
            <li> Throw your loofah&#x27;s away  and try this out. I am certain you&#x27;ll love it. One of the best exfoliating products I have used.</li>
            <li> I bathe with it, it makes me clean. Well, that and the soap.</li>
            <li> This is really nothing out of the ordinary that you can&#x27;t buy in any drug store around the corner. A towel with rough texture. Not much of a novelty.</li>
            <li> This wash cloth is like a skin exfoliate . the length allows for scrubbing the back with ease. Wash gently while you become acquainted with the texture. Rinses clean and dries extremely fast.</li>
            <li> I use this every time I shower and it makes my skin feel smooth afterward.  I got it months ago and it&#x27;s still in brand-new condition. fantastic item.</li>
            <li> I just ordered a package of three directly from saluxshop.com. The price was right and the cyberspace ink didn&#x27;t even dry before I received an email that the order had shipped!! Also, the more you spend the more you save - price per item goes down as the quantity ordered increases.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I saw someone online had it and raved about it so I got it. I&#x27;m very impressed! I followed the directions and lathered it with soap and rubbed it on my body while in the shower. It makes a tiny bit of soap go a LONG way. It&#x27;s nice and long so I can do a sort of twist with it on my body, like a polishing motion. You can&#x27;t beat the price or the incredible softness that comes with this cloth. A must-have!</li>
            <li> I bought a couple of these a few months ago when they were priced ridiculously low, and both my boyfriend and I are really impressed. To be honest, at first it feels and looks like a cheap product that you wouldn&#x27;t want to put on your skin, but the results speak for themselves. For over a decade I&#x27;ve been embarrassed to expose my legs due to what I eventually found out was Keratosis Pilaris. I spent hundreds of dollars on various creams and exfoliators to see minimal results. Just one week using these Salux wash cloths resulted in a remarkable difference in my arms and legs, to the point where I have finally gone back to wearing short dresses and skirts without pantyhose. I am convinced that the change in texture of my skin is because of these wash cloths, since when I travel and use hotel supplied wash cloths I find that the KP returns, so now I always take them with me. They dry fairly quickly, making them suitable for travel. They&#x27;re also very long so they feel wonderful on your back, but fold down neatly so they can be hung like a regular wash cloth (and still dry fairly rapidly when folded). I can&#x27;t imagine ever going back to a regular wash cloth or loofah again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I often travel to countries whose hotels do not provide washcloths.  I wanted something lightweight and compact since I only take a backpack for a five-day business trip.  I cut six inches off this washcloth and used a lighter to sear the edges so that it would not later unravel.  What I wound up with was the perfect facial cloth for home or a tolerable washcloth on the road which weighs 6 grams (0.25 oz) and rolls up to about the same size as a lighter.  The remainder lives in my shower and still performs its intended duty perfectly.  I did notice right away that my skin was much softer.</li>
            <li> Just like the title says. Right before a trip out of the country we ordered 3 of these wash cloths (which are excellent by the way). They arrived just in the nick of time but there were only 2. We didn&#x27;t have time to deal with it before we left, so I contacted the company when we got back. Their answer is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry that you didn&#x27;t received all 3 towels, but since it is exactly 2 months now that you finally do the claim, we are very sorry but we can&#x27;t honor it. Hope you can understand. Thank you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I don&#x27;t understand. 2 people had to share one wash cloth. at least they are married. Like I said, the cloths are great. But you can find &#x27;em elsewhere, I&#x27;m sure. I rated the product the lowest number of stars that I could to reflect upon the seller jipping us on something we paid for.</li>
            <li> I have  been using these cloths for years.  It makes my skin feel so good while I am wasing it. I use a body wash and it foams up so nicely - great for washing your back - the shape is perfect.  As others have said they last forever - I have had one of these for over 10 years - I just bought another so that I could have one in my travel kit because I hate to be without it.  Buying a couple to give to friends too.</li>
            <li> For being such a simple idea this product surely works! Machine washable AND will actually do my back?! Amazing! I had to buy some for my boyfriend because he was actually using mine!</li>
            <li> The Japanese Salux washcloth is amazing! I buy them all the time for myself and gifts.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t beat the way it makes your skin feel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately what I received with this order was the Chinese knockoff Leyijie brand,&lt;br /&gt;which is horrible! Is nothing like the real thing in results, quality and feel. This&lt;br /&gt;was supposed to be a gift and now have to wait and go through the whole process of&lt;br /&gt;return and refund. Will buy straight from Salux dealer in the future.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give 0 stars for not being the Salux brand as advertised. The reason I ordered it was specifically because I wanted the Salux brand and the only reason I didn&#x27;t return it was because I didn&#x27;t want to deal with the hassle, time, and expense of shipping this thing back during the busy holiday season. As I understand it (and I may be wrong) Salux is a specific brand so to say something is Salux when in fact it does not say Salux on the package would be false advertising. I really feel ripped off and taken advantage of.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this kind of wash cloth. I&#x27;ve had one for many years and it was starting to wear out. So when I saw this on Amazon, I was very excited. It is exactly what I wanted and I expect to use it for many years to come. love it</li>
            <li> There are various sellers of this product on Amazon, and it appears from the reviews that some are not shipping the authentic Salux product made in Japan. I ordered from Emma&#x27;s Cosmetics &amp; Skincare (Fulfilled by Amazon), and can verify that I received an authentic product. As for the wash cloth itself, I love it. It is somewhat more course than a typical cloth of this type, is a full three feet long for easy use on your back, and holds up really well over time.</li>
            <li> I love this bath wash towel. I have used this brand for a long time now. It may seem rough at first, but it does really well and it makes you feel soft after bathing. Not to mention this is good for cleaning and scrubbing your back...... LOVE IT!!! WILL BUY MORE!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item mostly because of its length, but was disappointed with the texture.  It feels like you are rubbing sand paper against your skin, and it does not hold the soap once you have it close to water.  Being a heavy person it is good for cleaning your back area, but you will have to get use to the feel of the material on your skin.  I am hoping after several use, it would feel lest abrasive to my skin.</li>
            <li> it is not goods I want .  I don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> I use this cloth every day to help eliminate flaking from dry skin.  I follow ny shower with heavy moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Salux Nylon bath towels for more than a decade now. I first learned of these in Japan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found no other bath towel that is more durable for the price. A single towel usually lasts me 6-9 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often travel for business. I can&#x27;t stand the hotel bath towels that are never long enough to scrub my upper back. Besides that, the towels are too soft to provide any scrubbing power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I carry one of these nylon bath towels in a Ziplock bag and keep it in my shaving kit. The towel dries out in about an hour (time for breakfast), then I put it back in the Ziplock bag and I&#x27;m ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The towels come in several colors -- blue, pink, yellow -- should that matter to you. The towel is durable, easy to carry, and reasonably priced (buy lots at reduced prices to save on shipping).</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this item at 18yrs. old and had never felt anything like it before. I&#x27;d had always been able to purchase this at any Oriental grocery store. I was extremely upset that I was unable to purchase it when I moved to MA in 2006 from Fla. and looked for it in Chinatown to no avail. Now that I shop Amazon which is completely new to me and was able to purchase it after 4yrs of using a washcloth I was ecstatic. This exfoliating washcloth makes you feel sooo very clean. When I first met my husband he would always tell me how soft my skin was and I think that&#x27;s part of the reason he fell in love with me!He couldn&#x27;t keep his hands off...This cloth will remove dead skin cells and help your circulation. It also lathers up alot no matter the type of soap and rinses well and dries quickly which is a plus since you don&#x27;t want mold or mildew when you shower. Oh and now I can reach my back because of it&#x27;s length which I struggled to do with my measly square washcloth. Please keep in mind if you are delicate or a tenderfoot you may need some time to get used to it as it&#x27;s a rough scrub but great afterwards. I recommend it wholeheartedly!</li>
            <li> This is fantastic. I think it is too harsh for the face, but I love using it on my feet as well as my other skin. My skins feels very smooth after using this. I use it with bar soap and while it doesn&#x27;t lather up while I am rubbing the soap on it, it does lather up once I start scrubbing my skin. It is easy to rinse off and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> My sister first introduced me to these Japanese nylon washcloths many years ago. They are absolutely the best! They create lots of lather from just a small amount of soap or bodywash, they exfoliate your skin without feeling overly abrasive and are gentle enough to use on your face, they scrub your back better and with more ease than any back brush, and they dry quickly and last a long, long time. I have several, keeping one in my shower, one in my gym bag and having extras on hand to replace them when they do (finally) wear out.</li>
            <li> The best wash cloth in the World</li>
            <li> I was looking for some kind of exfoliation tool on Amazon, found this, decided to try it, and was not disappointed. My skin looks and feels better even after 2 uses! It&#x27;s as good as everyone says. Also, although some sellers do charge outrageous shipping, I had no trouble finding a seller with fair rates, and this product is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I buy my salux scrubby clothes from cvs, or walgreens i love the harder clothes, i have been using this since 1970&#x27;s...i never changed, this is THE BEST in feeling clean!!!!</li>
            <li> A little rough and scratchy, but I do like it overall.</li>
            <li> When I first started to use this product, it felt rough when washing. But now I use it everyday and after every shower my skin feels so soft. I&#x27;ve been telling all my friends and family about this product. I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> This is basically an unraveled loofah. It is handy for being able to exfoliate your back since it&#x27;s so long.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this washcloth!  I have been using one for many years, don&#x27;t even know when I bought it.  The best feature of this cloth (in my mind) is it NEVER molds or smells.  I live in Florida with its incumbent humidity so this is a very important feature for me.  My normal washcloths start to smell after use of less than a week.  :-(  The second feature I love is its exfoliating capability leaving skin soft.  And finally, it creates a wonderful lather from any soap.  I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> This works exactly as advertised. It is huge though. You can really cut it into 2 maybe even 3 different pieces and it be extremely useful.</li>
            <li> hey, it is Chinese, don&#x27;t say it \\&quot;japanese\\&quot; -- this would offend both! The one I got from this page is said to be \\&quot;made in China\\&quot; and even has a Chinese pinyin name!&lt;br /&gt;It did hurt at the beginning, and I could only use it for my butt (I am an asian in my late 20). Now I am getting used to it, and my skin does feel smooth after using it.</li>
            <li> Old one wore out after several years of good and faithful service.  Expect same from this replacement. .</li>
            <li> I have loved these for years and have been searching for some more. So glad I found them!</li>
            <li> Makes your skin so soft!</li>
            <li> I love these. They are great for exfoliating your whole body, make it easy to clean your back.They last a long time and dry very quickly. Use with your favorite body wash.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this luffa towel. It feels good and it&#x27;s really easy to reach my back and scrub. I thought it was going to be made out of some other material but it seems to be a very well made luffa towel. It lathers quickly and rinses just as fast. It also drys very quickly. Next time I&#x27;m going to get the rest of my family one. It&#x27;s just really that good. It&#x27;s so much easier to hold and you don&#x27;t have to worry about it unfurling like the luffa sponge.</li>
            <li> Every single bath/shower should have one of these. So scrubby without being harsh. Antimicrobial so it doesn&#x27;t get all gross and smelly like washcloths can if they don&#x27;t dry out properly. And they basically last forever. So much better than those ridiculous puff things.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the last 20 years, someone from Hawaii introduced it to me.  It&#x27;s much more coarse than \\&quot;poofs\\&quot; that other people bathe with.  I prefer it more coarse so that it is actually exfoliating me.  I find it easier to use and handle than the poofs (also easy to scrub your back).  I don&#x27;t know how to shower with out it.  If I forget it while traveling and have to use a face towel, I don&#x27;t feel as clean.  It air dries pretty quickly and I store it in a ziploc for travel.  I usually keep mine for a couple years, I put in in the laundry and air dry it to clean it every so often.  The old ones I recycle as my travel wash cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to find it at a shop on Grant Ave in SF Chinatown, and an Asian mart in Bergenfield, New Jersey.  I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve found it on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to watch out for knockoffs, they are not as coarse (unless you prefer softer ones).  Whole Foods also has a version which is a little longer, and softer.</li>
            <li> When I bought this there was nothing to indicate that it was the Chinese knockoff, Leyjie. When it came I really liked it, but it did look cheaply made and a little rough to use. When I actually got the real Salux, I realized just how much of a difference there was between the two. The Leyjie is thinner, lighter with cheaply sewn seams. It also more abrasive and produces less lather than the original. If you aren&#x27;t sure which one you have look on the pack to see where it&#x27;s made. Salux is made in Japan, Leyjie is made in China and the Salux washcloth has the logo sewn into the seam as well. The bottom line is that the Leyjie is too expensive for what you&#x27;re given.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the rave reviews. I received the exact color and brand in the picture, salux. But it&#x27;s so rough and scratchy that I actually cut my thigh while using it. Wtf? Literally three scratches on my thigh. I&#x27;m better off with a cheap loofah ball from the dollar store. And I was not scrubbing too hard. I&#x27;ve only used it once though, I will try one more time and will try to barely graze my skin with it. If not im going to cut it up and use it to scrub things clean because boy does it scrub. Who knows maybe this was a knock off. Either way I would not recommend it from this seller.</li>
            <li> Guys (and chicks), this is the best tool you can use to wash yourself with. My Japanese friend had one of these back in high school (shout out to Hideharu) and he always said how good it makes you feel. Well, I finally bought one 20 years later and it definitely works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine rubbing your wet body down with #12 sand paper - your neck, your back, your elbows and your crack - sorry, off track there. Point is, it totally exfoliates your body including your back. It makes soaps sud up really great so it actually saves you $$ in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take it from me, don&#x27;t wait 20 years to buy one.</li>
            <li> This unique wash cloth has been everything I hoped it would be. It&#x27;s gentle but powerful. I would recommend it for all!</li>
            <li> A little bit more rough than expected, but still good.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Leaves skin soft and bump free. I Gave this as a stocking stuffer and was so well received that I was requested to give it again this year.</li>
            <li> My son likes the way it lathers up so easily. It has a nice level of roughness for exfoliating the skin.</li>
            <li> The first time I took a shower with this jewel, it felt amazing and my skin hadn&#x27;t felt so smooth in a long long time. If you ever get to try this shower towel, the texture is very delicate, intricate, and rough, but not too rough at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s genius; so many tiny woven patterns to flush out all your dirty little pores on your body&#x27;s skin. However, I&#x27;ll warn you that you shouldn&#x27;t use it too hard. If you use it tightly against your skin, your skin will become red rather quickly and you would basically be scratching and irritating your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers to a clean shower!</li>
            <li> These are great! Replace your poufs and never worry about what&#x27;s hiding in all those nooks and crannies that never dry out! Feels really good on the skin AND I can easily scrub my back with no problem at all. Love it!</li>
            <li> Buy this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first when I opened the package I didn&#x27;t expect it to do that much. It was rough and smelled like fish. (The smell entirely went away after two uses in the shower)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It exfoliates better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used, my skin feels great from using it. It&#x27;s gentle enough to use it on your face also, so I do that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t worry about it being too rough. You get used to it after the first day. You&#x27;ll only run into a problem if you don&#x27;t have enough soap on it, you&#x27;ll be able to tell if you don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m considering buying this for some of my friends to get them to try it out. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This bath towel does get a decent amount of lather and exfoliates as much as a standard synthetic loofah. i also like the elegantly simple solution it provides to reaching all areas of the body. however, with this towel you really do have to be completely out of the line of running water while using it, otherwise it will lose its lather fast and require re-soaping. i have a small shower space, so this means i have to turn off the shower completely while using the towel so i don&#x27;t have to waste more soap. This might get annoying come winter time.</li>
            <li> Love this - will order more in the future.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why these are selling for so much online. you can get them super cheap in Los Angeles at Korean $ stores. Next time I go I&#x27;m going to get more. No more lufas for me.</li>
            <li> A great friend of mine who lived in Hawaii slept over one evening and left one of these Bath Wash Towels for me to use since I borrowed hers while she was with me. It was the best shower I ever took the first time I used one of these, wow my skin felt years younger and looked years younger. I have used the same one now for over 5 years and it&#x27;s just starting to wear out...so I just orderd two of them ....one for her and one for me.....I sure I can find her so I can return the favor....:)...all the women who bath in my home love these things.....works great with liquid soap!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Casanova Jr.</li>
            <li> Having been given an earlier version of this product by a Japanese woman in Hawaii in 1988, I was delighted to discover this product available now. These \\&quot;towels\\&quot; make the smelly, soapy washcloth obsolete. They foam well with soap, then rinse clear. They really scrub the skin, doing the exfoliating that leaves skin soft and smooth. The long length facilitates back-scrubbing and foot-cleaning. Try one and you won&#x27;t go back to using washcloths.</li>
            <li> I like the salux cloth for it&#x27;s incredibly \\&quot;invigorating\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;rub.  It&#x27;s perfect for getting rid of dead skin cells, and&lt;br /&gt;is long enough to use on my back and arms and anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone- it&#x27;s the Japanese version of a&lt;br /&gt;Turkish towel, and goes one better than that.</li>
            <li> I was first exposed to this about 6 years ago while visiting my friends in Mexico.  When I first saw it, I was skeptical and even thinking...\\&quot;What the hell is this?\\&quot;  I tried it once and I can&#x27;t imagine taking a shower without one now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you never tried one, it will be rough at first (especially if you shower using just a bare soap bar or a face towel).  But give it a chance, break it in and you&#x27;ll never use anything else.  I&#x27;m surprised that these haven&#x27;t caught on yet.</li>
            <li> I have bought several Salux brand wash cloths at our local asian food stores.  However, since our move, I have not been able to find them anywhere locally yet.  I purchased these since the price was similar to what I had spent in person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is just fine, however, I was pretty put off that the cloths arrived wrapped in tissue paper.  They were not as pictured - meaning inside the branded packaging.  However, they work just as great as what I&#x27;ve used in the past and it wasn&#x27;t anything a quick run in the washer couldn&#x27;t handle.  I would buy these again.</li>
            <li> not as life changing as some of the other reviews might make it seem. great for exfoliation, dont press to hard or it hurts a little.</li>
            <li> Brought it for my boyfriend, he loves it. Good size as well</li>
            <li> I checked the reviews after purchasing the item because I&#x27;ve used an actual Salux before. It says Salux, so that is what I expected.  Unfortunately, another posted mentioned that these are not actual Salux cloths and I was stuck with this.  It works okay, but is not what I expected and may not offer some of the benefits of a true Salux cloth.</li>
            <li> Ive used these  cloths for years. I had to go to the store to buy them.  Now that I can purchase them on line You have a customer for life.</li>
            <li> Not so good. I saw the reviews and thought it were good for washing body. However, I am disappointed at it. It&#x27;s over priced, in China, it&#x27;s  no more than CNY 5 or 1 dollar.</li>
            <li> Little rough on the skin for first couple of uses; then I got used to it. It is easy to keep clean and dry. I can tell from my uses so far that will serve for quite a while (easily few months). I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Good for people with limited reach or mobility while bathing.</li>
            <li> So many bubbles!  A little abrasive, though, but good if that is what you want!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product!  I bought five (5) for friends and family.  They all love it and are ordering more for their friends and family.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the Salux bath towel or any of the nylon bath towels. I have to agree with most of the reviews, this is an awesome bath tower. It is a little rough but it really exfoliates your skin just enough to leave it feeling smooth and soft. The Salux nylon does a great job at getting the back and the length is perfect.  Overall this is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Many years ago I came across this product at a luxury resort in Guam. I have used this product for about 12 years now. I absolutely love it. It exfoliates my skin beautifully. I use it all over my body. People stop me all the time and comment on my skin it looks just like porcelein. I can&#x27;t live with it now.</li>
            <li> The photo and description of what I ordered are not what I received in the mail. The packaging look similar, but the vendor sent me a different brand, and it&#x27;s made in China.</li>
            <li> I purchased this quicly after seeing the product advertised was a Salux.  I bought two of them to give as gift.. Horrible.. HORRIBLE quality Leyjie versions arrived.  Maybe I could try this on my back.. But I would be too embarassed to give something so rough to a friend or family member. Dissapointing.</li>
            <li> The Salux cloth is pretty awesome.  I was skeptical despite all the reviews.  These items probably only cost pennies to produce but the results are worth the price alone.  I ordered my item from the Pandora seller and received the genuine Salux cloth and not a Chinese knockoff.  After just 1 use you can feel how much softer and smoother your skin is.</li>
            <li> Great product! Grew up using these. Glad I finally found some at such a good price.</li>
            <li> Happy with the service and with the Salux wash cloths.  Great for trips and I like the way the cloths dry so quickly.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;WHAT IS THIS THING?!?! IT&#x27;S AMAZING!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those were the words uttered by my boyfriend while in the shower.  I had purchased a pink Salux towel for myself and was so amazed by its performance that I decided to purchase one for him.  It lathers up great, keeps soapy, exfoliates skin, rinses off quickly and dries fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of it the seller was an absolute dream! When I first ordered the product I didn&#x27;t receive it.  I sent them an email and when neither of us could figure out where my package went (I&#x27;m willing to bet my idiotic post office lost it) they replaced the package real fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great wash cloth! Great Seller! Really is an amazing product :)</li>
            <li> I have a very dry back that flakes a lot skin.  Having arthritis in one shoulder really hinders my ability to reach everwher I need to.  I was lucky enough to have a friend recommend looking on Amazon to locate one of these long scrubbing towels to do my back.  A great accessory for the general purpose of exfoliation of your skin.  I use it everywhere on my body, and have found it to be a very thorough cleaning cloth, and would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Best scrubber ever! I&#x27;m so glad I found it online! After moving away from Hawaii, I was afraid I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find these anymore. No other scrubbers really exfoliate your skin well except for these. I recommend them 100%.</li>
            <li> Too rough , don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> I tried these towels as a recommendation on how to get ballerina skin and it works. These towels are rough at first but you get used to it and you can really see the new skin glow. You don&#x27;t have to scrub hard or you will make your skin raw. I love that you can get your whole back without asking someone else for help.</li>
            <li> I really love this product, and I&#x27;ve been using it for years...it&#x27;s great to use because of it&#x27;s length, you can reach all of those hard to scrub places with ease. Highly recommended if you&#x27;re looking for a different or new shower experience where you feel like you&#x27;re actually getting clean when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> Great washcloth, it really works!  I like that it dries out between showers, seems more hygienic.  Had a sunburn and was peeling for weeks afterwards and this helped take off the extra skin (gross, but effective!).  Doesn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive skin, but the effects are noticeable.  Won&#x27;t live without them!</li>
            <li> My family loves these wash cloths and have been using them for several years.  They are long lasting about a year.</li>
            <li> LOVE it! I got rid of all my assorted scrubbies, back brush, etc....this feels great and leaves my skin soft and clear.</li>
            <li> These Salux bath towels are fantastic! They lather up great with a soap bar or shower gel/liquid. It has a light texture to exfoliate and invigorate the skin. I&#x27;ve been using mine for three months and its still like brand new. They rinse out exceptionally well and hold lather very good. The knitting is tight and stretchy and works much better than other nylon wash products and feels much softer. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Growing up as a person of Korean ethnic background, I have used this exact wash cloth pretty much my entire life. I have tried the conventional loofahs and they soon fall apart and become a mess. This wash cloth is rough at first for those not used to it but it makes your skin feel much smoother and cleaner. It&#x27;s easy to ball up and grip with your hand and then open it up to clean your entire back area, which can be hard to do with a loofah. I&#x27;m lucky since I can purchase these at nearby, Korean-owned stores for about $2.00-$2.50. Great product! I would recommend that everyone try it out.</li>
            <li> it is a great product. my towel was a gift and i use it every time i shower. i gave them out as gifts for xmas</li>
            <li> These are the only wash cloths I use. They are large enough to wash your entire back and they feel great \\&quot;scrubbing\\&quot; your skin. They rinse clean in seconds, dry in minutes. I have found nothing better.</li>
            <li> It is a little scratchy the first time but it really exfoliates well.This bath cloth is just incredible! Side note: You can find this cheaper other places on the web.</li>
            <li> its long so you can reach anything. perfect amount of abrasiveness, but not too rough on the skin. really makes showering feel cleansing</li>
            <li> love this towel---i&#x27;ve given up terrycloth; this holds suds wonderfully, is thicker than ones i&#x27;ve gotten before (good) / with this i can and shower in 2 minutes; the roughness is stimulating and i feel dead cells sloughing off nicely!</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail today and i&#x27;m in love!&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take that much soap for it to lather up, and it also works great for your back!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I can get these bath towels from Amazon!  I used to have to stock up and buy a whole bunch of them when visiting family in Hawaii, or beg them to send me some in the mail.  The rest of the mainland hasn&#x27;t caught on yet (at least not mainstream stores - unless one is lucky enough to live near an Asian supermarket/store).  Thanks for making these available - I can buy them anytime now!</li>
            <li> Unlike a regular washcloth, this one exfoliates.  And, unlike a regular shower puff ball, this can be held from both ends around your back.  Leaves your skin feeling super smooth.</li>
            <li> I found this accidentally on Amazon while looking for an exfoliating shower glove. I saw the rave reviews and figured it wouldn&#x27;t be too bad if it didn&#x27;t work since it was less than $10 with shipping. Like everyone else says this thing is HUGE. It&#x27;s literally about 3 feet long. If I were you I would just fold it up and use it. I cut mine and it started fraying. Its still very useable and hasn&#x27;t frayed more than few pieces but it&#x27;d probably last longer if I hadn&#x27;t cut it. It&#x27;s pretty rough so it&#x27;s great for exfoliating the tougher skin but I can still use it on sensitive areas like my face. I really like it because I use it everyday consistently and afterwards my skin is very smooth. The only thing is that doesn&#x27;t perfectly exfoliate areas of the body like the arms where most people have the redness but there&#x27;s an improvement. I plan on getting another when mine is no longer useable.</li>
            <li> I have used a Japanese Beauty Cloth for a dozen years.  The cloth is long-lasting, invigorates and scrubs the skin very effectively and resists mildew.  If you like a vigorous scrub, it is the best!</li>
            <li> Great as expected! it is pretty long so you can scrub in hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> This summer I went to Japan and had the pleasure of experiencing one of these long exfoliating towels. As soon as I returned, I looked up these Salux wash cloths on Amazon and have not looked back. These towels are just abrasive enough to give your skin a good scrub without irritating the skin. The long length allows for you to give your back a good horizontal, vertical or diagonal scrub. I have never been able to clean every inch of my body so thoroughly. Due to the weaved nature of the fabric, after a quick rinse, the cloth will dry exceptionally quickly after use.</li>
            <li> i prefer this over the italy spa mitt/towel for deep exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for this for sooo long at the asian stores &amp; I found it on Amazon for $4.98 -- AMAZING !! I had these growing up &amp; they scrub soo good nothing like the ones they sell at the store nowadays with soft material that doesnt do the job , I will purchase more in the near future. Very fast shipping too !</li>
            <li> I have used Salux wash cloths for years. When this arrived I immediately noticed it was a knock-off of the original and appeared to be of poor quality. I am returning the product and getting a refund from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is not even a salux product.  Just some cheap knock off brand mad in china.  Don&#x27;t even think about buying it.  Just hit the back button a few times to get away from this dreadful product.  Will never buy things from the vender again.  It wasn&#x27;t even made in japan as indicated but from china.  This is a horribly product that i shouldn&#x27;t have even buy it.  Words cannot express my anger at the moment and an angry customer is not a repeating customer.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered received as stated!!</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m a Japanese, this is the wash cloth I grew up with. I&#x27;m so happy that I can get it on Amazon again. Some people may feel rough on skin though.</li>
            <li> Amazing way to exfoliate your skin, it will be so so soft. Also makes it easy to exfoliate and wash your back. Use it on your legs before shaving and you&#x27;ll notice a big difference in the smoothness of your skin and closeness of your shave.</li>
            <li> This is a &amp;#34;cloth&amp;#34; that is made from the same nylon fibers that make up the &amp;#34;loofah&amp;#34; scrubbers, so it stays clean when you rinse it out in the shower over many uses, rather than washcloths that may start to grow mold. This dries faster than the &amp;#34;loofah&amp;#34; scrubbers because it is a single sheet of material. I have used &amp;#34;loofahs&amp;#34; for years, but I&#x27;m now sold on this. It can create suds just as well as the loofahs, but the design makes it easier to reach your back and exfoliate your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the rough-weave. I was a little nervous reading some of the reviews that said this was too rough, but I think the texture is perfect (although if you don&#x27;t want something rough - definitely buy one that is not rough-weave).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a nylon scrubbie for years.  The Salux bath towel is much better!  I received it as a gift from someone who had one and knew how wonderful it was.  It has a fairly rough texture which is a fantastic exfoliator.  I use it with a bath gel (never soap, it&#x27;s too drying) and my skin has never been softer.  It&#x27;s extra long length makes it perfect for getting your entire back.  It drys very quickly - Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> cant live without these</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this now for ? three years and it still looks and does the job great. It is far better than the jute products that I owe which typically don&#x27;t last more than a year.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I started using these years ago and always keep some around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, they&#x27;re great for scrubbing your back (or your butt).  You can crumple them into your hand if you want to use them like a traditional srubbie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UNLIKE the traditional scrubbie when you&#x27;re done with your shower, you can hold it up lengthwise toward the shower flow and watch all of the old soap &amp; crud rinse out.  Then just hang somewhere where it will air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After ~6 months of daily use, the texture gets a bit weird and I usually replace them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know if go into an Asian market, they carry different brands.  Some of them are slightly longer than others.  They also have different levels of coarseness.  Any of them have been fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also the best gift to take to friends in the hospital as it allows them to easily scrub their own back.</li>
            <li> I love this. It&#x27;s great when showering gets rid of all the dead cells leaving Ur body feeling great will buy again</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon, but I usually buy this from local Korean markrts and price may less than here. I grow up in Korea and every household uses this wash cloth in daily bases.  Basically, this is invented by Korean, but as always, Japanese took the idea and sell as theirs. Oh well.  This is great wash cloth, once you start to use, you won&#x27;t go back to your old one.</li>
            <li> I love this thing, it really exfoliates well. Feels a little rough but your skin will be so smooth. Excellent for using before applying self-tanner-no streaks or dry dark patches.</li>
            <li> I use this daily. Feels great and lathers well.</li>
            <li> I had to buy this when i heard in a blog all the great things about it.  I was shocked by how rough it was at first, but it really exfoliates my skin and my skin feels so soft. Im not sure i could ever go back to a regular loofah puff.</li>
            <li> I have been using this type of wash cloth for about 10 years and I love them. I decided to try these cloths because of the reviews and I found them even better and longer lasting than the ones I had purchased before. I will continue to order them and use them for a long time to come. The size is big and they are sturdy and they exfoliate my skin nicely. (I also have given these as gifts to my family and friends, that is just how much I like them!)</li>
            <li> When my loofa wasn&#x27;t cutting it exfoliation-wise, I started looking into products that might serve me better. Don&#x27;t waste your money on one of those stick pumice things. This is the best shower product I&#x27;ve ever used. Put a little shower gel on there, lather it up and rub yourself down. You&#x27;ll feel amazingly soft afterwards! Dries extremely fast, too, so no weird smell!</li>
            <li> This cloth is awesome, cleans skin very well, exfoliates perfectly without being too rough, but rough enough to clear skin. I even used it on my face and it made a difference, my skin has been clearing up great! I feel clean, soft, and not too mention actually clean. This thing is a gem and totally worth the price, by many times over!</li>
            <li> It work very good for me, I dont use it at the daily basics,  fiber are in some way abrasive...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been exfoliating with various scrubby devices for years now but this one is better than all the others I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s a very vigorous scrub so if you&#x27;re not used to that, take it easy to avoid that \\&quot;freshly peeled\\&quot; feeling. I love finally being able to scrub my own back thoroughly! For the rest of my body I cut and sewed the cloth into mitts -- one cloth is enough for 2 pairs of mitts.</li>
            <li> there are a cheaper variety out there.  sometimes it pays off to get the best.  this is one of those times.</li>
            <li> I heard about this towel from a travel blog and I thought I&#x27;d buy it since it was relatively cheap. I&#x27;m glad I did. It&#x27;s quite invigorating when you use it, and it&#x27;s got a lot of surface area so you can use it on your back. The towel is slightly rough so you use it for exfoliation. When I use it I feel refreshed, and my arms are soft (they don&#x27;t stay soft for long but initially they are).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would get this again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and long, but personally I find it a little too rough.  Would prefer something with more natural fibers that could be used for scrubbing that wouldn&#x27;t make my skin sore.  For the record, I use Apricot scrub all over my body, but for a washcloth, I need a little more softness.</li>
            <li> Really exfoliates your skin. Towel has been very durable so far. Be careful using, as it can really strip your skin with little effort.</li>
            <li> These come with 2 in a package. They are big enough I cut mine in half, so they last a long time. I also throw mine in the washer, but it does make it less abrasive after a while. I put body oil of my choice (almond or coconut, etc.) on it and scrub my skin. It achieves the same result as a good salt/oil scrub you buy, it exfoliates and moisturizes at the same time. Works great in the winter when my skin gets flaky and dry.</li>
            <li> Great product! Exfoliates well. Easy access to back. You need less soap to cleanse skin lathers well. Less soap equals less drying affect on the skin.</li>
            <li> Great body scrubber. All you need is a bit of soap and a little goes a long way. Skin glows after using.</li>
            <li> This product literally rubs off all your old skin and leaves you body soft and silky.  I have very dry skin and was afraid this nylon product would irritate it but it made my skin so much softer.  No more flakey skin even after I moisturize as this nylon body wash gently takes it all off.  It is long so it can do your back and is so simple to wash and hang in the shower.</li>
            <li> This towel was a godsend. It&#x27;s absolutely the best money I&#x27;ve ever spent on any shower or bath goods. A little soap lasts forever on this towel, and it&#x27;s extra length was great for me since I have wide shoulders that make it hard to clean my back. Unfortunately, after about a year, the towel tore as I was gripping it to clean my back. It&#x27;s still cheap enough that I had no problems buying another one, I was just disappointed that my normal use could cause a tear. Still, it hasn&#x27;t soured me at all on this towel. Great product. Also, FYI, the towel is not colorfast with bleach. If you get bleach on it, it will turn light blue, as I found out recently while cleaning my bathroom.</li>
            <li> This product is actually quite dangerous if used on the face. I tried it out and even with only a gentle rub it caused skin abrasions. So, what to do with this large piece of wash cloth? Use it in the kitchen sink for scrubbing dishes, Teflon, and even pots. It really works well for that purpose. Just don&#x27;t buy this wash cloth thinking you can use on your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and I think it&#x27;s the best wash cloth for exfoliating the skin. Because of the length it&#x27;s great for washing the back. It&#x27;s just awesome the way it feels. It really makes my skin feel so much softer.</li>
            <li> I use this every day in the shower and it is literally like the cloth never ages or loses its texture. It exfoliates really well and suds up with soap nicely. I&#x27;m going to get some for stocking stuffers for my mom and sister for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I get the idea, but it&#x27;s just way too rough for me.</li>
            <li> Based upon a travel site suggestion, I bought one to take with us to Europe.  It was great to be able to gentle scrub your back without pulling your arm out!  I scrunched it up to use for legs and arms.  It rinses easily and dries quickly.  Even my husband used it!  I think I forgot to repack it in Salzburg and will buy another one for home.  May be a great stocking stuffer for the girls this year.</li>
            <li> Just as described! Cleans your body very thoroughly and leaves skin feeling soft and smooth. Received item faster than expected. Will buy from again!</li>
            <li> Long enough to give your back a good cleaning and take off any skin you don&#x27;t want at the same time.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for years, wouldn&#x27;t think of using anything else.  They last so long.  Using anything else is like using a cottonball.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed using this in the shower.  I can notice a difference in my skin.  Also, I like to use &amp;#34;fake tanning&amp;#34; products, and for the product to be even, an good exfoliation is necessary.  This does the job!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  works a described, dries quickly, long enough to wash back&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  there is only 1 cloth in the package.  Although it is long, it is a bit too large for wash cloths.  I will probably cut them into smaller &amp;#34;single-serving&amp;#34; size.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I love my washcloth, it is the best I have ever used. It lathers so well even with a small amount of body wash. I use it all over and the lather never wavers. It eliminates the need for a back brush. It exfoliates without being too abrasive and leaves my skin clean and very soft. I will never use anything else again.</li>
            <li> I love these wash cloths, they are the bomb - as an Asian, I grew up with these.  They are bit rough for the face or other, ahem, sensitive areas, but for anywhere else you want to be squeaky clean and exfoliated, there&#x27;s nothing better.  And they dry quickly - no yucky sponges or poofs.  I toss them in the wash as well.</li>
            <li> Came on time! Saw an improvement after just one use; my skin was softer and smoother. Really long so I can exfoliate my back well. I&#x27;ve been told this can help heal keratosis pilaris so I&#x27;ll edit my review in a month and explain my progress. So far so good! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand wash cloth for years! It&#x27;s always in any shower I&#x27;ve ever used and will always be there.  It truly makes me feel clean not like those other cloths from Walmart or anywhere else. I definitely recommend this, it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it was cheaper though.</li>
            <li> Now these are different but I really like them!  But beware of copies.  Get the originals.  They sell both on Amazon.  Read the reviews of others so you can select the real thing.</li>
            <li> I dont know why anyone gave this a bad review. It is exactly like the description. i love it. its a great material, delivered super fast, and is long enough to wrap around my back and wash it. grreat product!</li>
            <li> Ever since visiting Japan and using these wash clothes, I was hook&#x27;d.  I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere in any of the local stores.  Would recommended these wash clothes over a standard loufa.</li>
            <li> Unbeknownst to me, the item was packed pressed up close against the very outer layer of the packing envelope. When I opened it carefully with sharp scissors, I immediately slit into the product. The tiny nip raveled, grew, and did not do well. Otherwise great.</li>
            <li> This towels are the best to scrub your body with. I have been searching for them and now I ordered a lot to have on hand.</li>
            <li> My mother has been buying these washcloths from an Asian Market for her family for the past 20 years.  We are so excited to see this now available through Amazon at a great price!!  Once you use this cloth, you will never use another.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these clothes for 3 yrs now, ever since I found them by accident on Amazon.  They are the best thing about my shower.  It only requires minimum shower gel to get a great long-lasting lather, which means I&#x27;ve actually noticed I buy less shower gel over the months!  The length is great for cleaning your back and any other hard to reach places. But most importantly after every shower my skin feels SO SMOOTH AND SOFT!  It&#x27;s better than any of the (often expensive) exfoliating scrubs I&#x27;ve used in the past.  This is really important in winter months when I suffer from really dry skin. It by no means cures my dry skin, but since I started using these I no longer get alligator skin on my legs like I used to.  They&#x27;re also really durable and easy to rinse clean.  I usually get a new one each year, just to be safe when it comes to a hygiene, but they could easily last longer than that.  Best shower/bath-related purchase I&#x27;ve ever made!</li>
            <li> I decided to give this towel a try because of all the amazing reviews on amazon. Definately worth the 5 or 6 dollars I payed. It is wide and long so you can really get all areas of your body, I started using it with a regular body wash, and its true, you only need a tiny bit because the towel lathers like crazy.. I will say it is slightly painful as it kind of scrapes the surface of your skin.. but that is what its suppoesed to do. I just switched washes, and the dove deep moisture with the towel is amazing! my skin is buttery soft and super glowy:) thanks! hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this wash cloth for a month now, and I&#x27;m very satisfied with it. It is rougher than a loofah, but after a month and a few washes in the laundry, I&#x27;ve gotten used to it and like it. I&#x27;m not sure if it builds lather as easily as a loofah, but I like lots of lather and found this wash cloth builds enough lather for my tastes. And it&#x27;s long enough to scrub my back, which I was definitely missing with the loofah.</li>
            <li> The cloth is the best. It never looses its texture and never retains any dirt or soap scum.</li>
            <li> I read about these on Reddit and decided to give it a shot. My wife and I both love them. Much better than your typical loofa.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this by an anesthesiologist I used to work with.  She told me all about it and I had to see for myself...4yrs later I am still using them!! Once you try it you won&#x27;t go back to anything else!</li>
            <li> I liked it for scrubbing my back in the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for at least thirty years.  They work great and clean-up easily without laundering.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for some simple way to add skin exfoliation to my daily routine. After reading the reviews for this product, I figured it was worth 5 bucks to try. I have been very pleasantly surprised, as it works wonderfully and my skin has been so much softer since I started using this as part of my routine. The size is also very convenient--makes it easy to clean everywhere. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great scrubber, delivered earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> When I was a little girl, I used the the natural gourd loofah grown and dried by mo grandmother. It wasn&#x27;t the cutest thing, but it worked a lot. As I moved to the cities, I stopped using it. I could use the ones available in the market, but it seemed ridiculous to spend money on something I had for free. Anyway, I really needed a loofah and I came across Salux wash cloth by accident. I read the reviews and knew immediately that I had to buy it. This is so good. The texture is just perfect for exfoliation. It&#x27;s a little rougher than the gourd loofah I used as a child, but that makes it even better. Not too rough, not too soft. Another thing I love so much is the length of it. My gourd loofah couldn&#x27;t reach my backs so well, but this works wonderful on the back. I finally feel like my back is getting just as much exfoliation as the other parts. Anyone who is search for a really good loofah, try this one.</li>
            <li> When I got this product, I was shocked that many reviews referred to it being comfortable/stimulating to use.  If you&#x27;re used to the normal bath poof, this is going to feel like sandpaper.  HOWEVER - I do use it consistently on my back, which I like.  After a few months of use, I use it about once per week everywhere and have kind of gotten use to it, but use it a few times per week on my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I think about it, stimulating might be the right word to use, I guess it just depends on what kind of stimulation you like.</li>
            <li> I always but these - Everyone loves them.  My kids request them.  They last a LONG time and for me they are the best at exfoliating and taking care of your skin!</li>
            <li> Using this product leaves my skin smooth and velvety. Excellent product!!</li>
            <li> These are the BEST for exfoliating/showering. Makes your skin sooo soft. My boyfriend is constantly commenting on how soft and smooth my skin is. And the size and shape makes scrubbing your back really easy. I will continue to purchase these through Amazon (cheaper than the Salux website).</li>
            <li> I read about this on a blog and thought it might be just what I was looking for.  The price was right (so right!) and it got here in a hurry.  I love the size, I love the way it makes my skin feel.  It&#x27;s perfect for scrubbing one&#x27;s back and then wadding up to get all of your other places.  I hang mine on the towel rack at the end of the shower/tub after rinsing and it&#x27;s ready next time I want to use it.  I&#x27;m thinking of buying a few more for friends.  This is a great exfoliator.  My skin has never looked or felt better.  Please note: I only use this on my body.  It&#x27;s far too rough to use on the face.</li>
            <li> Works great for exfoliating without irritating skin. Wet body dirt and place body wash onto cloth.  Lathers exceptionally</li>
            <li> Read online about these for encouraging collagen production and the benefits for people who suffer from psoriasis.  They seemed reasonable enough and since my skin is a chronic problem of sensitivity I bit the bullet to order a few.  To my surprise this has become a favorite shower item to really clean my skin.  It takes a bit of accustoming to the strange abrasive feel, but once you lather it up and use the length to your advantage it makes full body washing and showering a breeze.  Likewise I like the fact it sloughs off the dead skin in a clean way; you can easily squeeze it to rinse it out.  You are able to toss them in the washing machine weekly for extra cleanliness and they are made very solidly; I anticipate they will last years.  The design is rather simple since it is like a long scarf; but it manages to cover my 6&#x27;3&amp;#34; frame pretty well and I like the way it can fold into a half width or be used at full width quite comfortably.  At first you will think it is similar to a synthetic scouring pad you might use in your kitchen; but once you see how thin it is and how to manipulate it for use you will see the benefits it offers.  A great concept and it has done great things for my skin.  I feel clean and refreshed after my morning shower and I like the fact I can reach all areas of my back in a simple comfortable manner.  It is a quite simple product and that is probably what makes me appreciate it all the more; its functional.  I got two at a very reasonable sum and will probably order a few more just to have on hand for guests, etc.  Definitely worth a try and if you have psoriasis or other skin conditions I would say it is amongst the &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; items for making sure you do not have plaque development.</li>
            <li> Been using these for years and love them. It&#x27;s more sanitary than a sponge because it can be thoroughly rinsed and drys quickly, and it scrubs better than just using a regular washcloth. I&#x27;ve gotten two from Amazon and I&#x27;m pretty sure neither one was a knockoff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how a person can use this on their skin. It is so rough and scratchy that it hurts. Thank god I didn&#x27;t use it on my face because it probably would have ripped my skin off. I just don&#x27;t get how people gave this product good reviews.  I must have gotten a fake product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a towel, not much to say. it&#x27;s alright! I used it to pick up my pot off the stove and it melted to the handle but I know it&#x27;s not made for that. I swapped it out for a bandana. More durable and can be used for more than one thing.</li>
            <li> Found this after someone on Ask MetaFilter raved about it and others agreed. It is an excellent exfoliator and feels amazing, waking up my skin and making me feel more alive in the mornings—no exaggeration. It stays very clean (and hair-free!) and dries quickly, so even though I use it daily, it&#x27;s still like brand new after months of use. I love, love, love this thing.</li>
            <li> Salux makes my skin soft, silky, smooth, clean, removes dead skin, prevents breakouts, prevents dry, flaky skin, prevents itchy skin as it removes the dead skin. Skin glows.</li>
            <li> This skin cloth works great for the body. A bit ti much for the face but your skin feels great after using.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!! Especially for the price. I can not believe how much better my skin feels after I shower for $6.00. It&#x27;s awesome and I will use it forever! Even have my mom using it. Silky smooth skin everyday, and I feel like I&#x27;m really getting clean!</li>
            <li> I felt so clean after using this. It gives you lots of lather and exfoliates. It&#x27;s tremendous size allows you to comfortably clean every area of your body thoroughly! Seemed expensive, but it&#x27;s a good product. I only hope it lasts a long time to justify the cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this wash cloth for a couple months now, and I won&#x27;t ever go back to cotton wash cloth or body scrub!&lt;br /&gt;This is a great body exfoliator, and ever since I started using it, I&#x27;ve been seeing a LOT less ingrown hair on my legs (I tend to get a lot of those a couple days after shaving). My skin is smoother &amp; absorbs lotion really well.&lt;br /&gt;This nylon wash cloth is certainly a lot more sanitary than cotton ones. It dries very quickly so you don&#x27;t have to worry about mildew!&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t try this on my face though, since it&#x27;s way too abrasive for facial exfoliation.</li>
            <li> AMAZING-this is the best exfoliator I have used to date.  Just lather it up and rub away! Don&#x27;t use too much pressure though!  I love that I can reach everywhere on my body-especially my back.  I always used to buy sugar scrubs from the store-and I am positive that I missed spots on my back, and probably other places.  Also, sugar scrub it difficult to use on your feet...well this product solves these pesky issues.  It works just as well, if not better than a sugar scrub, and leave your skin feeling silky smooth!</li>
            <li> Have used these for years! So glad you stock them! Thanks!</li>
            <li> This thing is for real.  I love it.  It&#x27;s like a cloth made of that material that those little loofa shower puffs are made from.</li>
            <li> Not sure what else to say. It&#x27;s a nylon towel. It was worth buying because I can now reach spots that were hard to get clean.</li>
            <li> I am on my second one of these.  The first one lasted about a year and then I found that it wasn&#x27;t exfoliating like it did when it was new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to one of these, be warned, it is not soft and cushy like a pouf that you may be used to.  Instead, with my first one, I felt like I was using a pot scrubber in the beginning.  I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d be able to get used to how rough it was!  However, I was pleasantly surprised at how much softer my skin was after using it.  You just have to get past the initial roughness.  On my second one, at first it was a little bit rough getting used to that harsher exfoliating property with a new one again, but now after a few days, I&#x27;m once again used to the somewhat harsh feeling and am enjoying the full exfoliation and cleansing properties that this wash cloth/towel offers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $5 for a year&#x27;s worth of use, give it a shot and just be patient if at first you find it too rough, as you will get used to it and actually enjoy it!</li>
            <li> American culture needs to get with the program.  Why don&#x27;t we have this things, instead of those scrungies??? Love this thing (b/c it gets the dead skin off), and it&#x27;s long (to get the back area).</li>
            <li> I was in Japan about 30 years ago and got one of these.  I have searched all over the US since that time and have not found it.  There are others out there but not the same.  This is wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is the best scrubbing towel ever, I am so delighted to have it and I am going to get more to give as gifts. AWESOME</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon these by total freak accident.  After reading many reviews, I had to buy some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok...let&#x27;s see here, I&#x27;m 35.  I&#x27;ve tried just about everything I can think of to exfoliate my body.  I wish I would have found these things 20 years ago.  I&#x27;ve tried scrubs, loofahs, mesh bath poofs (which Salux now replaced), pumice stones, natural sponges, salt scrub, I can&#x27;t think of everything.  I epilate my body hair so exfoliation is a MUST.  I don&#x27;t know if it is sad that I&#x27;m so excited over a wash cloth, but I am (it&#x27;s the small things when you get older, lol!).  I am so happy I took the chance and bought this (well, bought two, one for the husband).  I can&#x27;t wait for him to try it.  I am 5&#x27;1&amp;#34;, and it reached all of me without issues.  He is 6&#x27;1, he has some mild acne on his back that drives him mad, and I know this thing is going to get rid of that issue for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it first arrived, it felt slightly more abrasive than a mesh poof.  But wow!! WOW WOW what a difference there is when using it.  It gave me the best scrub I&#x27;ve had in years.  My skin feels NEW!  Almost like I didn&#x27;t even need lotion after showering (but I used it anyhow)  It reaches your back without any issues, lathers great when you apply body wash, it&#x27;s just awesome.  I used it twice because of how good and refreshing it made me feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already ordered another for a friend of mine who suffers from skin issues and she also waxes.  I&#x27;m ordering more for Christmas gifts.  I even decided to buy the &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; abrasive one for myself (had to get that from the MFG though because I couldn&#x27;t find it on Amazon).  I love a good hard scrub.  The seller was super responsive and great to deal with.  I&#x27;m sold.  I am never going back to any other type of body scrubber again.  Ever!  My skin is not sensitive, so the more abrasive the better!  I could only seeing you not liking this product if you have very sensitive skin, or don&#x27;t like pain.  I&#x27;m a bit of a masochist.  Buy one, you won&#x27;t regret it.Buy one, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I purchased 5 of these Salux Japanese cloths and gave them as prizes (kept one for myself).  I have heard so many friends raving about how they love these prizes and I am so happy with mine.  It makes taking a shower such a pleasure.  I especially like it for scrubbing my back.  Amazon  has a winner here.</li>
            <li> This item is fantastic!  Great for exfoliation.  I just recenlty purchased one in chinatown and it was knockoff so i highly recommend getting one from amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a great back scrubber.  My itchy unwashed back thanks you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty simple girl compared to most. I don&#x27;t really like to have a bunch of different types of scrubs and soaps and formulas. I like this cloth a lot because you barely have to use any soap to lather up with this and it really is exfoliating. It almost seems like its hurting at first, but then you realize how smooth it makes your skin feel after you get out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a really long and weird shaped rag, I cut mine into smaller pieces but WARNING if you do this, commit to stitching everything down with a sewing machine. If you don&#x27;t you are going to have little strings/fibers all over that are really annoying!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use one must try.  Great for exfoliation.  Size allows you to thoroughly clean back.  Saves money because they lather so much better and last so much longer than regular loofahs</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  The texture never dulls and great for scrubbing off dead skin cells.  My skin is more smooth than ever.  I need to huy more of this for my lifetime supply and for give away.  I highly recommend this item.  I should give 10 stars!!!</li>
            <li> Received my Salux last week and very happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is not like baby butt yet, however, its better than scrubs in a jar&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good quality sustainable product, saves a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;Bought from kasha Inc (Emma cosmetics)</li>
            <li> This is an awesome wash cloth, it delivers just the right amount of scrubbing, not too rough and not too gentle. I feel very rejuvenated after using it, it&#x27;s like massage at home. Wish it had a loop so I could hang it on a hook, but otherwise awesome quality! Love it!</li>
            <li> This washcloth is fabulous.  I was hesitant about it at first but well worth the try.</li>
            <li> I have been using these washcloths for over 10 years. When I lived in Hawaii these were a common product at any local drug store and easy to get. Now living on the East Coast, this is my only option! Package shipped promptly and arrived on time. This is a must have product for personal hygiene!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it yet , but it feels pretty griddy, will probably be realllllllly good for feet but idk about sensitive areas .</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft!!!! I used to work at a spa and after I use this my skin feels like what it did when I would get deep exfoliating treatments. Way better than any scrub I&#x27;ve ever used &amp; I&#x27;ve tried everything from The Body Shop to spa scrubs.  A must buy!</li>
            <li> I could not like this thing more.  Full body exfoliation... but FAST!  It dries easily, too. I use this in the shower in the morning, and then right after, I moisturize.  I have really dry, itchy skin this time of year, and I don&#x27;t know why, but this helps a lot.  My skin is smoother, with fewer &amp;#34;bumps&amp;#34; from KP.  By the way, I purchased from MV Trading and got a legit product.</li>
            <li> WOW! Didn&#x27;t think i&#x27;d be so impressed by a washrag, lol. I ordered mine from Pandora and received the salux version, not a knock-off brand. It&#x27;s phenominal! Especially for the feet, back, and hands, never felt cleaner. The only reason i&#x27;d even heard of them is from reading reviews on how these were recommended for black soap, as the rag doesn&#x27;t stain like regular wash cloths. It&#x27;s really long, so I will be cutting mine in half and giving the other half to my husband. I have a very small stand up shower and had no problem with it staying soapy. I used ALOT less soap than usual. I will be purchasing more in the future!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product. It made the old skin come off. That&#x27;s good for male. I need to rub more gentle than he does,though.</li>
            <li> My husband introduced me to these wash towels over 30 years ago, and we think they are fantastic.  Daily exfoliation keeps skin soft and healthy. Because the towels are made of nylon, they rinse clean quite easily, thus making them much more hygienic than loofah&#x27;s.  Each towel will last a year or longer, which makes them a terrific bargain.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive but works well. Kind of like a puff scrubber. But this one will scrub my back too. My skin gets really silky and works great on my feet.</li>
            <li> Have to add my two cents since we&#x27;ve been using these on our RV for 10 years or more. Absolutely the best thing to take into the showers: you can scrub yourself all over with it folded, also with it unfolded, your back and the bottom of your feet! The slightly rough texture is just right for getting you clean. I carried two extras for guests, who took them back to Australia with them. Soap foams in them nicely, and they rinse really clean when you finish your shower.Quick drying. Love them !!!</li>
            <li> Been looking for this item for a long time! Glad I found it. Great Item!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been looking for a small back brush to take on trips, but couldn&#x27;t find anything the right size, one that wouldn&#x27;t take up much room in a suitcase.  This nylon cloth works well as it dries quickly and is coarse in texture, similar to a brush.</li>
            <li> Comes in different colors. This is an excellent exfoliater and it lasts for a very long time. I have bought a lot of knockoffs but after a while they stop having scrubbing power. These bath wash towels stay strong and scrub forever. I love this item couldnt be happier. I use this everytime i go into the shower. It helps exfoliate dead skin cells and helps you feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this product in a magazine article or online beauty page somewhere (i think). As with everything, I immeditaely went on amazon to search for it.  The price cannot be beat, its basically the price of a good quality washcloth.  I suffer from KP on my upper arms, which has worsened over the years and this has really helped exfoliate that area.  I do not use soap or showel gel with it, only water and elbow grease. (I wash with shower gel seperately bc of my dry skin). I will say, the cloth is rough.  My skin has no problem with that, but more sensitive people may not respond well to this.  I have such profound dry skin I even use this on my face from time to time.  As others have mentioned, its great for washing your own back to, which feels so great after a really sweaty gym workout : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash mine in the washing machine with the rest of my towels, and allow it to air dry.  I have not had mine as long as some others here, but I have noticed no deterioration in the cloth whatsoever.  This would make a gerat gift for the beauty savvy person in your life.</li>
            <li> 1 year into using mine and I absolutely love it! Gentle enough for my face but also rough enough for when I need it to be. I use a small hanger to hang mine next to the rest of my towels for easy use :) Absolutely recommend! Do not know if mine is a knock-off but I enjoy mine well enough to assume it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a couple of years, and just recently replaced it.  I&#x27;ve also bought an additional one for my teenage son who loves it.  It&#x27;s a bit scratchy, but not too much so - just enough to let you scrub as much or as little as needed.  These things last and last.  I use it in the shower, rinse it, then hang it over the shower rod.  It&#x27;s never molded or needed to be washed any more than that.  The size makes it easy to hold in both hands and wash your back.</li>
            <li> I was turned onto this product while looking for a solution to ingrown hairs caused by leg shaving.  After about a week of use I do see some improvement in the little bumps on my legs.  After the first use I noticed a shocking amount of dead skin floating toward the shower drain, so I know it&#x27;s effective.  The scrubbing surface is a little more aggressive than I&#x27;d anticipated and can be uncomfortable in some areas, but it definitely gets the job done.  It drains well when hanging in the shower so it won&#x27;t grow sea monkeys when not in use.  The quality is such that I believe I will be able to use it for years.  Not bad for under ten bucks.</li>
            <li> Seriously, how could anyone NOT give this 5 stars?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using these things since I was a kid and if I don&#x27;t use one during a shower, I feel dirty as heck.  This thing can scrub away every ounce of dirt on you - I even keep one with me when I travel.  And for $3 or less, how could you NOT want one of these things???  I bought 5 - 2 to use in in shower, 1 to travel, and 2 as  a back up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, these last about a year to a year and a half before you should replace.</li>
            <li> Not everyone can use a back brush due to physical problems and even age. These wash cloths allow scrubbing the back in a more natural manner much like drying your back with a bath towel. The webbed material scrubs yet doesn&#x27;t damage your skin. Actually you feel like you&#x27;ve visited an expensive spa with the clean tingle you feel when done...</li>
            <li> why are they sending Leyjie knock-offs. this isnt what i paid for! sorry ... i thought that when your order slip says one thing, the product is supposed to be the same thing.</li>
            <li> It is as wonderful as the african local sponge that gives you a natural exfoliative effect and it stays true for as long as ever! You probably would throw it away because you can&#x27;t stand using a sponge for years and not because it changes one bit in its prowess to keep your skin feeling good after having a bath with it.</li>
            <li> this thing is great.  you want a good scrub down?  well I suggest you purchase one of these bad boys.  The item shipped very quickly.  loved it.  In fact, i loved it so much I am purchasing another right now.</li>
            <li> Just like the one I receive as a gift over 25 years ago from Japan.  Hard to wear out unless you snag them.  Texture is great for exfoliation.  First 2 or 3 times will take a little getting use to, because of the coarseness.  I am very well pleased!  I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Good price, works perfect, easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need back exfoliation, may I recommend this product?</li>
            <li> This thing works great!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Lathers like crazy and rubs off dead skin as well.  I have bought many of these.</li>
            <li> which were so tough I almost didn&#x27;t want to use them--these are good scrubbers, still but entirely livable for me.</li>
            <li> You know those bath poufs that most people use, the ones you can get at Walmart? Well, I thought those were the best and for years I used them to keep my skin soft. Then, I recently read a review for the Salux cloth, and how great it was for treating back acne issues as well as exfoliation. I ordered one immediately to try it. I have only used it once but I could see a difference after the very first use; my skin is much more soft. I&#x27;m not sure if I will continue to use this daily as it is quite abrasive, but I am so glad that I bought it.</li>
            <li> This product is cheap, seems so far long lasting, and really gets the job done.  Exfoliates and lathers with even under performing body wash and bar soaps and leaves skin super smooth and soft!  I wont be without this again if I can help it!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an easy way to scrub most of your back skin off, this is what you want!</li>
            <li> This washcloth is of excellent quality and definitely exfoliates well.  I rubbed too hard and it stung after my shower, but I&#x27;ve learned to be a little more gentle.  I have gotten rid of ingrown bikini hairs as well as ingrowns in my armpits with this. This is much better than using expensive chemical products to exfoliate/get rid of hairs! A great small christmas gift for ladies..</li>
            <li> Great for exfoliating (if you have keratosis pilaris, this is great stuff). Plus, you can clean it quite easily which is way better than those $3 shower puffs you get at the supermarket.</li>
            <li> Only ones i ever use, the best. Makes the soap go father and lasts the longest. i will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought these multiple times.  I like being able to scrub my back as well.  I&#x27;d recommend them</li>
            <li> This cloth is amazing. Exfoliates very well and lasts a long time. I will definitely be repurchasing this. Very happy!</li>
            <li> Been using these for years.  Have one in every bathroom.  Great to get dead skin off and super easy to wash your back.  If they had 6 stars, I&#x27;d give them 6 stars.</li>
            <li> Extremely effective at exfoliation.</li>
            <li> Scrubs the dead skin and dirt right off. It&#x27;s a bit abrasive and long, but gets you squeaky clean! Would order again.</li>
            <li> I love the Salux cloth! I was looking for an exfoliation cloth because I don&#x27;t like using the chemicals and buying exfoliation cremes can get expensive. In the beginning I used the cloth on my face but I think it was too rough and it made me breakout more so I don&#x27;t use it on my face anymore (I use microfiber which works great!). This is the best way to exfoliate my body though. It has a long length which makes it easy to reach my whole back. I also use one to exfoliate my lips and that makes them really smooth. This cloth also lasts a long time. I have been using the same cloth for about a year. It washes easily too, I just throw it in the washer. It can go through the dryer too if you want but if not it dries very quickly on its own. Highly recommend trying it!</li>
            <li> very exfoliate much scrub wow such soft so impress wow such happiness many smooths recommendations wow very five stars yes</li>
            <li> I bought a blue towel, it absorbs excellent foam and gently but effectively scrubs the skin. Good product! Highly recommended</li>
            <li> This item is great for exfoliating and it is so convenient for scrubbing the hard-to-reach back areas.  I save the old ones to scrub the tub!  It works well....not too abrasive...just enough to remove soap scum!</li>
            <li> These are the best washing cloths I&#x27;ve ever used for bathing. Great exfoliating wash cloth.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT wash cloth! It leaves my skin feeling SOO soft! I use it every day. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Always looking for a good source of these shower scrubbers. I cut them in half and use one for a few months before using the second half. Drains and drys between showers, never mildews, and nice prickly surface!</li>
            <li> Love these wash towels, I only like this brand.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this. It cleans every part of your body and most of all it definetly cleans your back very well. This is a must buy. If you are thinking about buying this; you will not be disappointed. It&#x27;s definetly worth the money. I will be buying more and more. I am a very clean person so this is a must. I love it. Purchase this; you won&#x27;t regret it. I feel absolutely clean all the time. It makes you feel super clean. I&#x27;m so super glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li> Machine washable, wonderful texture, whats not to like?&lt;br /&gt;I was introduced to these by a lady friend, I don&#x27;t think ill ever use a loofah again.</li>
            <li> If you want a good towel to make you feel squeaky clean, THIS IS IT.</li>
            <li> This is a gem. It gives just the right amount of scrub, without going over board. So much softer than the 100% nylon version I found in TJ Maxx, and the length is perfect for keeping the back clean and smooth. I will be purchasing again in the future.</li>
            <li> I was one of the lucky ones who did not get a knock-off in the mail. I remember when one of my friends linked me to this I thought it was a joke because it looks like cheap plastic. Well, it does look like cheap plastic in person, too, and it also happens to be amazing. Loofahs are not effective exfoliators for folks that have unusually dry skin, Keratosis Pilaris, etc. After one week of use the Keratosis Pilaris on the backs of arms went away, and it hasn&#x27;t come back. And for those of you who are trying to be more eco-friendly, this cloth can be washed and reused, it dries quickly, and it&#x27;s a lot better than tossing loofahs, which are harder to clean properly. Another plus: These things work up such a great lather that I&#x27;ve been using less liquid soap!</li>
            <li> use it daily and it&#x27;s been great - good as new</li>
            <li> Not to sound to gross but this cloth will remove the dead skin that collect doing the day.  After taken a shower with this cloth then I apply the body lotion so the skin does not dry out.  It feel sharp when you hold it in your hand but when you rub it on the body it is smooth.  I let a lot of my friends know about this cloth.  Two of them have gotten it and love it.</li>
            <li> I regularly buy these towels. They&#x27;re great for exfoliating.  They&#x27;re not too soft neither too rough.  I especially like the large size.</li>
            <li> Super product, only I found the product too long for me to use, so I had to cut it in half and sew the rough edge.  It does leave your skin feeling very smooth and I feel like my after shower moisturizer absorbs better.  Great for stimulating circulation.  I know because my skin is really red after use.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the product and it is recommended by a group of people who are appreciate good quality.</li>
            <li> First introduced to this wash cloth at the Grand Wailea Hydro Spa in the Japanese inspired bath. Loved it!  Found it on Amazon and will purchase many more for certain. Product is exact, shipping was fast and at an excellent price!  Perfect for your hard to reach body parts.</li>
            <li> Received quick, will use this seller again for this product. It&#x27;s the original longer ones, not cheap like swap meet ones. great product love using it. Makes a great gift.</li>
            <li> These are great  fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for many years, usually have to search for it in Asian food stores. Nice to find it online</li>
            <li> This is a really good towel to clean yourself with! Sea salt + this makes your body open more and clean to efficiently lotion yourself after. The feeling before and after when I first used this made me feel &amp;#34;ahh&amp;#34; like after a hot steamy sauna session.</li>
            <li> This worked well, but easily broke down in the shower. I would recommend not storing it in the shower like one would with a shower poof.</li>
            <li> This is basically the best body washing implement that money can buy.  I knew these existed, and had been searching for them for years.  Nothing you can get in any of the big department stores can compare.  These things are delightfully abrasive, and last forever.</li>
            <li> This is great for scrubbing all over with only a small amount of body wash it makes so many suds! It really leaves you feeling a lot cleaner than a loofah will.</li>
            <li> Best thing ever! Leaves your skin feeling soft and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> I first purchased these years ago. They really do change your bathing game, and I can&#x27;t imagine not having them now. It creates an amazing lather, which helps me use less soap overall. When I get out of the shower my skin is very smooth and soft from all the exfoliation. I don&#x27;t use them every time I shower, but twice or so a week, since I&#x27;m not sure if the constant exfoliation would be too much. Everyone should experiment for themselves on what they feel comfortable with.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Cheap, easy to use.  I will probably buy multiples for each shower in the house!</li>
            <li> These are really great for an all around good scrub of the body and they last long and very easy to clean before getting out of the shower, just hang in the shower to dry.</li>
            <li> This scrubber does take some getting use to but once you try it, your shower time will never be the same again.&lt;br /&gt;I first used this type of body scrubber when I lived in Japan. They are great for exfoliating your entire body, even your hard to reach back and shoulders. I have given these to many of my American friends and they all admit it took some getting use to but their skin is softer and they can never go back to their boring old loofah.&lt;br /&gt;It sounds kind of gross but the first time you try it you will see how much stuff your previous loofahs, sponges, wash cloths and scrubs have been missing. Prepared to be surprised.</li>
            <li> I first was introduced to these wonderful bath towels in Hawaii when visiting my brother and have been hooked ever since. I do all I can to keep them on hand and often give them to special friends as gifts. All I can say is you have not had a invigorating bath/shower until you use this item. My husband likes it as well.</li>
            <li> I use plastic loofah gloves already, but read on a beauty blog that this towel was really good for exfoliation. It does work really well, but perhaps too strong for a daily use like I can with the gloves. The gloves have a finer feel to them. However this towel rinses so much better than the gloves and I like that I can get my back really well without having to switch to the loofah on a stick that I use for that area. This towel dries really fast, much more so than the gloves, so it&#x27;s gone into my travel kit for now. I will probably use it more often in the summer.</li>
            <li> These are the cure for the winter dry skin, itchy back. Combined with a good moisturiizing soap, the exfoliation of the slightly rough texture is just what the doctor ordered!</li>
            <li> Received a Salux wash cloth. It feels similar to a loofa and is not irritating to the skin. It is a large wash cloth and rinses and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> My entire life I have just used a standard bar of soap in the shower but saw this recommended on a site that I visit regularly. Wow was I surprised by what a difference it made. It cut the time to lather soap up and scrub my body by about 80% and I felt cleaner after using it due to the exfoliating effect. I will definitely be purchasing more after this one wears out.</li>
            <li> this is so abrasive, and just what I was looking for.  I actually cut mine in two pieces when I got (one for body and I can use the other as a back up or use it on my face) I find the most abrasive wash cloth in my linen closet and use it to bathe with because I&#x27;m big on exfoiliating. I just don&#x27;t seem to feel clean if I can&#x27;t get my scrub on. . . this is just what I wanted!</li>
            <li> If you like getting your back scratched this wash cloth is for you!  It is heavenly to use.  The delivery was quick and the wash clothes as promised.</li>
            <li> This thing is great. I bought this because for some reason as an adult I&#x27;d been breaking out on my back. Those deep, under skin blemishes, and they were leaving some marks. I&#x27;ve used this towel twice and can already see and feel a difference. My skin is smooth, no dryness. The blemishes also appears less pronounced. My back also doesn&#x27;t itch like it did before I assumed due to dry skin or hair growth or who knows.. so far soo good, enjoying it. Makes a great lather as well.</li>
            <li> I really like this towel.  You put a small amount of soap on it and squeeze it a bunch of times and you have tons of suds.  It exfoliates your skin and your body actually feels cleaner and softer afterwards.  It also increases your blood circulation, and you just feel more relaxed after using it.  My daughter says it \\&quot;scratches all her itchies\\&quot;  Great towel.  Great price.  I received the brand and towel shown in the picture.  No problems for me.</li>
            <li> These things are AWSOME , wash and massage your body together, great for removing dead skin</li>
            <li> So be careful using it the first time!  Start from feet and start very very gently on other part of body.  Once I figured out my tolerance it works ok .  Doesn&#x27;t fall apart like the supermarket ones.  It dries relaxed and doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 5 of these for my trips and places I stay.  The cloth I use is firm and easily cleans after each use. I have noticed  a clearer smoother back.  It is so simple in design yet so practical.</li>
            <li> I got tired of those cheap luffas that fall apart way too often so I decided to give this a try. I love this washcloth. It&#x27;s not too rough on the skin, the length is perfect for getting your back, and you never have to wash it or worry about it getting smelly.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price and it does a nice job</li>
            <li> very very harsh and scratchy. Would not suggest it unless youre trying to scrub your back raw</li>
            <li> Love these!! Can&#x27;t shower without it! Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> These cloths are soft enough but also course enough to take off dead skin.  Love these!!</li>
            <li> this is great.  its maybe a little rough at first, but it wears down a little  i will definitely keep buying this.  if there&#x27;s an asian grocery store near you, they had this on the shelf for $5.</li>
            <li> bought this,which I cut up and shared with a couple of my grandchildren, I made up a facial scrub  by grinding up oatmeal, almonds, rose petals and some lavender and added clay..this along with either water or honey makes the best facial scrub to use with this facial cloth.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this! The scrubber is quite long so she can easily hold it with both hands and scrub her shoulders and back. Very high quality.</li>
            <li> best wash cloth out dont waste your time with other cloths this is the top choice leaves you feeling smooth and clean</li>
            <li> This is literally one of the best things I have bought here on Amazon. I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it. I feel so revitalized every time i use it in the shower. It really does seem to stimulate your skin and gives you a tingle, in a good way. The product is just a long rectangular towel, it makes it super easy to wash your back, and it lathers soap so well. For those who have trouble with the size of it, I just fold it up into a small square, and use it like a sponge/loofah and scrub every where, and when I want to scrub my back, I just open it back up to full size. I love it so much I bought my mom one too, and she couldn&#x27;t agree more that this is an awesome product.</li>
            <li> These are great! I got mine around Christmas time and use it every time I shower. Smooths rough skin very well. Just rinse &amp; hang it to dry when finished &amp; it is ready for the next time you need it. No need to wachine wash.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I couldn&#x27;t find the African Bathing Net I was looking for. Upon receiving, I saw this wasn&#x27;t exactly what I wanted. Although I am slightly disappointed because it wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting, it&#x27;s not too bad and does a decent job exfoliating. However, I will continue to search for the bathing net.</li>
            <li> It is really great, I had trouble finding it but now I know where to go to get more. You can really wash your back yourself.</li>
            <li> This wash cloth is just too very rough on the skin for our use.&lt;br /&gt;REVISED REVIEW: My wife still will not use it, but I have now used it several times and, while I still will not use it regularly, I see that it has merit for some people, but not to us. The original order was lost in the mail several weeks and the sender, JapanSupermall, quickly sent me a second order free.</li>
            <li> I loved it while I was using it, but within a few hours I was covered in itchy bumps from head to toe! Never, ever again!  I&#x27;m glad I used it before my family used theirs!!</li>
            <li> This product exfoliates very well and is made of a very sturdy material.  I&#x27;ve used other exfoliating cloths which were horrible--they tore and did not exfoliate as well.  This is an A+ cloth.</li>
            <li> Being a guy I still like this stuff! Better than that dove shower tool by a mile! Never going back. Easy to clean, exfoliates superbly, and makes efficient use of soap.  Nothing wrong with this!</li>
            <li> (JUST BE SURE THAT YOURS-RECEIVED IS A GENUINE &amp;#34;SALUX&amp;#34; PRODUCT, MANUFACTURED IN JAPAN [NOT in China], or its quality WILL NO-WHERE NEARLY MATCH THIS REVIEW)!&lt;br /&gt;If you DO receive a look-alike from an unscrupulous merchant and the package says &amp;#34;Made In China,&amp;#34; !SEND IT BACK IMMEDIATELY, UNOPENED, FOR A REFUND!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW OF THE ORIGINAL, &amp;#34;SALUX&amp;#34; JAPANESE-MADE CLOTH: .......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WATCH OUT DIRT AND BODY-GREASE...HERE IT COMES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an almost-all synthetic, long washcloth with a REAL &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; propensity to &amp;#34;sloth&amp;#34; away dead skin, dirt and body oils that leave you feeling &amp;#34;invigorated&amp;#34; after every shower or bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They produce copious amounts of foam with small amounts of almost any body-wash liquid or bar soaps and the cloths, themselves, last me at least a couple of years before they must be replaced (always, because a couple of inches of their ends begin to tear off after that amount of time/usage, during the type of back-scrub motions as exhibited on the package&#x27;s front side)...I THEN continue to use the now-shorter, &amp;#34;spent&amp;#34; cloth for house-hold scrubbing of bath-stalls, stoves, ovens, soiled pots/pans, etc. This &amp;#34;recycling&amp;#34; act extends their VERY useful life-span ANOTHER few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It usually fully-dries in less then a couple or hours when hung from its end or draped in its middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S GREAT!! (especially if you&#x27;re really dirty and don&#x27;t have sensitive skin!!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why there is so much hype about a cheap piece of rough nylon cloth.  Yes, I&#x27;m talking about the authentic Salux nylon, made in Japan, not some imitation some here have complained about.  I bought this based on all the rave reviews only to find out it&#x27;s no more than a piece of cheaply made nylon that gave me dermatitis, especially on my hands.  No matter how gentle and careful I was when using it, it always made palms of my hands red, raw, dry and incredibly itchy like nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps a imitation product would have worked better. I suspect a lot of positive reviews are fake.  Do no buy this product, especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love this thing!  I&#x27;ve bought other \\&quot;Korean Washcloths\\&quot; in the past, all of which turned out to be too fine-woven and flimsy to scrub well.  The blue Salux scrubbers I bought are perfect; they have enough \\&quot;body\\&quot; not to just bunch up into a skinny rope when I try to scrub my back, and the texture is aggressive enough to feel that they&#x27;re really doing something.&lt;br /&gt;  Besides being thicker than the others I&#x27;ve bought, the Salux is at least 6\\&quot; longer too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The one improvement I could suggest is to mold a soft rubber bead across each end to help&lt;br /&gt;keep it spread out flat while I do my back.  (I tried doing that with silicone glue, which seemed to work but was too slippery to hold onto...)&lt;br /&gt;  Also, it does shed a few threads from time to time.</li>
            <li> I really like these. More so than the sponge poufs I&#x27;ve been using in the past. A little coarse and abrasive at first but you get used to it. These last a long time and exfoliate the skin well.</li>
            <li> I love taking a shower and scrubbing my back with this product.  Really feel clean and it reminds me of getting a body scrub at a spa without the high price.</li>
            <li> I first tried the Salux brand skin cloths about five years ago. At the time I was having some serious issues with contact dermatitis caused by exposure to various plants - I have ridiculously sensitive skin - and, while I tried my best to avoid the irritants, secondhand exposure via my husband was also a concern. We were using mesh loofas in the shower - cheap, flimsy, disposable - but I wanted a more durable option, preferably something that could be washed and reused. Traditional washcloths were my least favorite options because they don&#x27;t exfoliate or work up the desired lather. After much research, I stumbled upon the Japanese-style nylon washcloths and decided to give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast-forward to today and I&#x27;m STILL using the original six cloths! We cycle through about one a week - more during the summer, when my husband&#x27;s likely to have brushed up against poison ivy and other problem plants - so each cloth has been through the washer at least 43 times (on average). They&#x27;re starting to fray around the edges the teeniest bit, but otherwise are in excellent shape. (Pro tip: to wash them in a machine, put the cloths in a pillowcase and tie it shut. Wash in cold water and then air dry.) Their washability make them a sanitary, economical, and green alternative to those bunched-up mesh loofas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike cloth washcloths and loofas, the Salux skin cloths are HUGE; they&#x27;re designed so that you can grip one end in each hand and scrub your back. They do an excellent job of exfoliating, but are still gentle enough that you can use them on your face. And they feel heavenly on tired feet. I&#x27;ll never use anything else again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure you get the Salux brand and not a knockoff. Some reviewers mentioned that they ordered the Salux but received the Leyjie brand. If this is the case, don&#x27;t even bother opening it - just register a complaint with Amazon and get your money back!</li>
            <li> A little more rough than I expected,  but the results are great.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to see these on Amazon. I have had my \\&quot;back scrubby\\&quot; for so long it had lost texture and had a small rip. (Granted it lasted probably 15 yrs before it got in that condition.)  The cloth is long enough to stretch over your back and scrub. It has a nice rough texture. I definitely feel clean after using this cloth - I love it; I will probably get more as gifts.</li>
            <li> Love the exfoliating experience achieved from this nylon bath towel.</li>
            <li> This is a great thing for getting rid of the bumps on skins (ingrown hairs especially). It is very large so you can easily reach back etc.</li>
            <li> This works great! Just as advertised, it rinses clean of suds in just one go. I&#x27;ll be ordering more of these.</li>
            <li> oh, man, does this do the job!!  very scratchy, I know I am getting my back exfoliated because it is no longer itchy between showers!</li>
            <li> I use this every morning in the shower, and my skin feels amazing. I used to use the tube-o-exfoliant, but I often found that to feel too harsh -- then I found out that it often is, as they use gritty materials (like ground walnut shells) that are really bad for your skin. THIS, though, makes me feel smooth, soft, and is gentle enough to use every day.</li>
            <li> Starting using these in the &#x27;80&#x27;s.  Just bought one for a friend and she loves it.  It&#x27;s the best product to make your skin  soft and it is relaxing, if that makes any sense.  If I don&#x27;t use it for a few days I&#x27;m very aware of tension in my skin.  This is a great gift for yourself.</li>
            <li> Bought this item several years ago from different vendor (do not remember name). This product great for cleansing the entire body in a showering setting. Have never found a better one.</li>
            <li> A little rough, but definitely gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I bought my first Salux Nylon on the island of Kauai several years ago.  It&#x27;s long enough to grab with both hands and reach your back.  Using this cloth makes your skin &amp;#34;baby soft.&amp;#34;  I now order several at a time and give as gifts......</li>
            <li> I cant wash up with normal wash clothes idk why but i dont feel clean .i love weaved wash clothes and i thought i was going to regret buy but the cloth is huge so i cut it into 4 wash clothes they exfoliate great and i will purchuse again</li>
            <li> I randomly found a glowing review of this thing online and thought, hey why not.. It was cheap so I ordered one. I can now tell you IT&#x27;S GLORIOUS. I&#x27;m totally ordering a bunch more.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really nice. Easy to scrub your back, holds soap well, scrubby but not too scrubby. It&#x27;s awesome. Awesome possum.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Works perfect.</li>
            <li> With the summer being so intense in Texas, I slather on sunscreen 2-3 times per days - if not more per day! I&#x27;ve needed a way to remove the leftover sunscreen. When I mix the Salux Wash Cloth with my body wash, it does a great job of removing the residue from my skin. Another bonus, my skin is really exfoliated and has been looking great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The towel is pretty big and as the picture denotes on the package, I suppose you could use the whole thing to scrub your back but I&#x27;ve cut the wash cloth in thirds. Its helped to extend the life and make it a better value.</li>
            <li> This towel is not too hard and not too soft for my skin. It exfoliates and lathers perfectly with Dr. Bronner liquid soap.</li>
            <li> Purchased for Mom, as a second cloth.  The first was a gift. It is very easy for her to use on her back.  Easy to keep clean and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I just received this &amp; used it for the 1st time.  It&#x27;s the authentic Salux one (not the Chinese imitation).  Before I ordered it I  e-mailed 2 of the sellers - Lucca &amp; Fat Cupid, asking if they sold the Salux or the imitation.&lt;br /&gt;Both replied that they Only carry the Salux.  After reading the reviews I was expecting something that felt rough.  I was expecting to have to grit my teeth when I used it, but I figured it would be worth it.  When I took it out of the package I was surprised that it didn&#x27;t feel rough at all.  After using it in the shower I was puzzled about all the reviews saying that it takes getting used to.  Really, it only felt maybe a tad rougher than those nylon poufs that are sold in every drug store, &amp; that&#x27;s not rough at all!  And I&#x27;ve been using those poufs for a long time.  I even used it 1st w/o any soap, then used it w/soap.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe for people who are used to a washcloth it feels rough -- but not to me at all. I even used it with considerable pressure on my arms &amp; legs (as opposed to people saying to be very gentle with it).  I used it on soft skin like my stomach (but with less pressure). As for the results, Hopefully I&#x27;ll see some after more use.  As for after using it just once I think the results are about the same as using a nylon pouf.  It&#x27;s easier to rinse out though because there are no folds, &amp; smaller to pack for travel. So for those reasons I&#x27;m glad I got it, but it&#x27;s not the magic cloth I was hoping for !</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this cloth. I have bought one for all my friends and even my boyfriend uses one and loves it. A must-own!</li>
            <li> These are the best wash towels I have ever used hands down. I have tried other brands and these tend to keep their rough texture for a longer period of time. Great for exfoliating! Warning: If you have soft or sensitive skin, this will scratch you up and it takes some getting used to. If you have (or want) tough, but smooth skin, this towel is for you. If you are looking for the best exfoliation products, this towel is for you. If you&#x27;re a jokester and want to hear your house guests scream in the shower, this towel is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Be nice, warn girlfriends/guests about this towel and provide an alternative before they actually go in to take a shower.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this thing! Let me start of by saying that I&#x27;ve purchased this item twice already. My first purchase was with the seller &amp;#34;ON CLOUD 9.&amp;#34; The Salux I received from them was a 100% legitimate Salux that was created in Japan. My second purchase was with &amp;#34;JapanSuperMall.&amp;#34; I purchased the item on December 27th for a total of $4.27 with free shipping and I received it from USPS on the 2nd of January. The Salux I received from JSM was ALSO a 100% legit Salux from Japan so I would recommend buying from these sellers if they&#x27;re in stock! The product itself is a long sheet of 60% nylon and 40% polyester. It is extremely long and rigid, you can cut it into sheets if you&#x27;d like to but I personally keep mine whole. This product is perfectly fine for highly sensitive skin as I have extremely sensitive skin, you don&#x27;t have to be extremely abrasive with this product at all, just a gentle rub and you&#x27;re good to go! I don&#x27;t perfect loofahs because they&#x27;re too flimsy and simply don&#x27;t get the job done, washcloths are the same deal. I sometimes use this for dry rubbing too because it is gentle enough to use dry. Once you&#x27;re done using the Salux just throw it on a towel rack and it&#x27;ll be dry within a few hours!</li>
            <li> I prefer this 100 times more than a traditional shower loofah.  It stimulates your blood circulation, massages and does an excellent job exfoliating.  I also love how it dries fast.  It grosses me out how it takes forever for the inside of those loofahs to dry.  Who knows what&#x27;s growing in there with all that moisture?</li>
            <li> It felt harsh to my skin on my first use, but I got used to it after a few times. Like others mentioned, my skin feels smooth after each use.</li>
            <li> Great travel washcloths.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing addition to my shower ever.  I end up playing games with it to see how much sudsiness I can get with how little amount of body wash (Oil of Olay, Victoria&#x27;s Secret).  Can it feel a little rough?  Yes, but sometimes a girl needs it a little rough.  My skin has never felt smoother, no dry patches, no ashy elbows.  It really helps before shaving too, my razor gets less clogged after exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s large enough you can clean your back easily, even if your range of motion isn&#x27;t great.  I tell everyone about this, and plan on throwing it in Christmas presents this year.</li>
            <li> These are my holy grail for exfoliation. Pairs great with expensive soap you want to hold onto for a while. Just rub soap on this and lather away! I have these in my travel bag and at home. I don&#x27;t feel clean without it.</li>
