            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF!!  </li>
            <li>For example, oxybenzone (found in many sunscreens, including BABY sunscreens).  Yikes!!    </li>
            <li>Loving Naturals is A BARGAIN FOR WHAT YOU GET!</li>

            <li>and I find it pleasant.</li>
            <li>The customer service from Loving Naturals is spectacular, the product amazing, and I feel great knowing my family is using the best.</li>
            <li>I have fair complexion</li>
            <li>Yes, they have lots of good reviews, but I tell you ignore them.  </li>
            <li>We have had no sunburns and we feel good knowing that the ingredients aren&#x27;t going to harm our children.</li>
            <li>I am so happy to have found a sunscreen that is safe for my child and myself to use.  </li>
            <li>We love it!</li>
            <li>Love this sunblock!</li>
            <li>We love it!</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen!</li>
            <li>We love this!</li>
            <li>Well, I LOVE LOVING NATURALS SPF 30 SUNSCREEN!   </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to have found a product that I feel good about putting on myself and my family!</li>
            <li>We love it!  </li>
            <li>This is the most effective sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>It is even safe for babies!</li>
            <li>Then when I compared my skin and the skin of my traveling companions, who used the grocery store sunscreens (Coppertone, Banana Boat, you know), I couldn&#x27;t believe how much more effective the Loving Naturals SPF 30 was!</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with this sunblock.  </li>
            <li>It lives up to it&#x27;s description, and has a nice texture and scent as well.</li>
            <li>but I would say that it&#x27;s effective as a sunscreen.</li>
            <li>See how well Loving Naturals is rated at:  </li>
            <li>When I apply Loving Naturals Sunscreen under my makeup it acts as a nice moisturizer and isn&#x27;t even noticeable.</li>
            <li>I found Loving Naturals on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s website and ordered it.</li>
            <li>The sun was intense in both locations, but the Loving Naturals SPF 30 Sunscreen protected me perfectly.     </li>
            <li>I did lots of research online &amp; via cosmeticdatabase.com before deciding to order Loving</li>
            <li>All in all, I feel very good and very smart about using this product.</li>
            <li>I found it easy and pleasant to use.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>In researching safe AND effective sunscreens for my family, I decided to try Loving Naturals.  </li>
            <li>Loving Naturals is far superior!!  </li>
            <li>Luckily I found this product and after using it during our trip I am definitely a happy customer.</li>
            <li>Best part is the stuff works &amp; my skin doesn&#x27;t burn -- as in no sunburn and doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin feel like it&#x27;s on fire when it&#x27;s applied.</li>
            <li>I purchased this sunscreen in a effort to find a safe, effective, and reliable sunblock for my children.  </li>
            <li>I love Loving Naturals.  </li>
            <li>It is not scented, but that is perfect for me, because I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li>Bonus points to the company for a good dispenser, not tested on animals, free shipping and being caring people you can contact.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s a fair price to pay for a safe, chemical free product.</li>
            <li>I feel very comfortable putting this on my babies.</li>
            <li>The sunscreen goes on easily and the rich oils used to make it feel good on the skin.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Loving Naturals goes on smooth and stays all day even if my boy is playing in water/sand.</li>
            <li>so I can check periodically to be sure none of it has rubbed off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a lotion consistancy, without being too oilly.</li>
            <li>This sunblock is the best rated on the skin deep website.</li>
            <li>I am trusting EWG rating when it says it is a safe sunscreen to use.</li>
            <li>I like the sunscreen, feel safe using it, and will purchase it again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a safe sunscreen as my daughter</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is OK.  </li>
            <li>You can read more about Non-nano particles on their website too.    </li>
            <li>and my daughter and I stayed burn-free and my husband was able to return to the sun.  </li>
            <li>this sunblock is just okay.</li>
            <li>It is the lightest and most protective sunscreen with the highest percentage of zinc out there.  </li>
            <li>overall it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how the product can be changed so it doesn&#x27;t rub off so much, but that would be great.</li>
            <li>Today there are many more.</li>
            <li>I love that it is ORGANIC.</li>
            <li>Many of my companions were burnt, in fact.</li>
            <li>Well, despite its great EWG protection rating, I am very tan as I sit here today.</li>
            <li>, I think it looks quite good on me, but the whole DNA damage thing is something I kind of want to avoid if I&#x27;m going to be swimming every day.    </li>
            <li>Luckily, I found Loving Naturals which not only works brilliantly but feels better on my skin than a massage from a supermodel...</li>
            <li>they have darker skin and dont burn as easily as me.  </li>
            <li>It spreads easily and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes.</li>
            <li>I purchased this after much research for the safest and most effective sunscreen for my children.  </li>
            <li>I did need to shake it up before using it because the oils would separate, but it goes on smoothly, has a very mild nutty scent that I didn&#x27;t notice even after applying to my face.</li>
            <li>and they both were just fine.</li>
            <li>The smell is perfectly fine, boys are fine with it (they are 5 and 1).</li>
            <li>This is my choice for effective, safe, and natural sunscreen!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m comfortable using this on everyone in my family.</li>
            <li>And,truly chemical free.  </li>
            <li>It is important to reapply.  </li>
            <li>Check out the larger bottle page to see LOTS of great reviews.  </li>
            <li>A lot of sunscreen say they are chemical free but have lots of chemicals in them.</li>
            <li>but he&#x27;s been outside plenty and we&#x27;ve had great results.</li>
            <li>The lotion is not runny and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>There is a light odor that some describe as sunflower (I would have said cocoa butter)</li>
            <li>I started looking for a CHEMICAL FREE, NO NANO PARTICLES,</li>
            <li>The sun on the water was intense; by day 3 all the cousins were using my daughter&#x27;s (Loving Naturals) sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Tanning is a reaction to DNA damage by UV light.</li>
            <li>I was really impressed with the customer service and fast shipping, unfortunately shortly after applying the sunscreen to my face, neck, chest and arms, it started to sting and burn.</li>
            <li>I was so happy that I loved it as much as I did/do because it&#x27;s such a better product than your main stream brands &amp; I</li>
            <li>It is much more lotion-y than other mineral sunscreens, which is great.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and is super waterproof.</li>
            <li>First of all, I love the organic ingredients...</li>
            <li>Loving Naturals uses NON-NANO zinc oxide, which is way better than most other sunscreen products on the market.  </li>
            <li>We have now returned to our home in Sweden (which has one of the highest rates of skin cancer in the world due to so many people not protecting themselves in the sun) and are confident our daughter will be protected when wearing loving naturals out in the sun.</li>
            <li>The mild, organic ingredients in this product make me feel comfortable that I am not risking my health by exposure to chemicals while helping it by limiting my exposure to the sun.</li>
            <li>Growing up, my fair skin always burnt when using the SPF products available at our local store.</li>
            <li>Actually I think it is rather pleasant.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used - fantastic protection for long durations.  </li>
            <li>I tried this sunscreen based on the strong ranking it has in the EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep database and am glad I did!  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen DOES hold up in the water as good or better than conventional sunscreens that claim to be waterproof.</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>I have found this to be true of all \\&quot;natural\\&quot; sunscreens though.</li>
            <li>To quote EWG: Overall score - 1 (1-10 with 10 worst); UVB protection (SPF)- good; UVA protection - excellent; UVA/UBV balance - good; sunscreen stability - excellent; health concern - low.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not smelly and is easy to apply (aside from reeling in a wriggling baby ;-) ).  </li>
            <li>It also provides adequate sun protection.  </li>
            <li>Because I have a mild case of rosacea, I don&#x27;t use this sunscreen on my FACE.</li>
            <li>So after reading many positive reviews, I randomly chose Loving Naturals and I am VERY PLEASED with this product!</li>
            <li>Loving Naturals sunscreen is safe and well priced compared to other sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a safe sunscreen for my kids - we live in Florida and go through tons of it.  </li>
            <li>, I have the whole family using it!!    </li>
            <li>It does leave a white tint, but I don&#x27;t mind since it&#x27;s helpful to be able to see if I&#x27;ve missed a spot!  </li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey, but shipping is free and fast.</li>
            <li>My only wish is that Loving Naturals made lip balm.</li>
            <li>Loving Naturals has a tan tint to it but when applied it&#x27;s still basically white.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price for avoiding sun-reactive filters like oxybenzone, octinoxate and octocrylene.</li>
            <li>I wrote this for the larger size bottle, but wanted to make sure people viewing the smaller bottle also knew how good this stuff is.  </li>
            <li>Save yourself from having those yucky chemicals absorbed into your skin (if you can&#x27;t eat it, why would you lather it on your skin?).    </li>
            <li>I do not do so, but was told that you can minimize the whiteness by rubbing the product in more completely.</li>
            <li>a mother, this product is at the top of my list &amp; aiding in my shift to all natural products.</li>
            <li>You buy a learn right?   </li>
            <li>and I both have fair skin and live in Southern California.</li>
            <li>We are sensitive to the sun and burn easily.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t heavily scented, goes on easily, works wonderfully (even on the most sensitive baby skin), is long lasting, and is all natural/non-toxic/free of chemicals.</li>
            <li>It does go on white, but it seems to absorb much better than some others.  </li>
            <li>I should have paid more attention when ordering, but it is not much bigger than a \\&quot;hotel sized\\&quot; shampoo bottle...</li>
            <li>But it feels sort of hot against my skin while applying.    </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using this for several months now and love it.</li>
            <li>that too is a bit white but leaves my skin feeling much more hydrated.</li>
            <li>Because of this repetitive use, I wanted a product I was confident was safe.</li>
            <li>some of it cancer causing (isn&#x27;t that what we&#x27;re trying to avoid by using the sunscreen in the first place??)</li>
            <li>but you do really get what you pay for sometimes!</li>
            <li>However, don&#x27;t be deceived; this sunscreen lasts much longer than the bottle appears and it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I had to wait until the next day to try it, but so worth it!!  </li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s still technically winter, it&#x27;s been sort of like summer where I live, very sunny and warm.</li>
            <li>I have been using Blue Lizard Sensative Skin, which gets a 2 from EWG, and I think that I like the Loving Naturals a little better.</li>
            <li>Despite being under the hot Spanish sun my son (where you can easily burn underneath an umbrella)</li>
            <li>presentation is simple and easy to carry in the purse.</li>
            <li>The mild, natural, organic, and non-harful ingredients did their job of protecting me from any burn and did not irritate my skin at all.  </li>
            <li>By 30 minutes it should all be absorbed and you should look normal, though I haven&#x27;t really checked since I&#x27;m already out the door by then.    </li>
            <li>However, it dissapears after certain time.</li>
            <li>My older son is fair skinned &amp; usually burns, but by the days end he showed no signs of redness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll do a little more experimenting and get back to you if I find something better.</li>
            <li>it is really runny but goes on smooth enough.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The content is really what it matters.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much or you will end up looking like a ghost.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I whole heartedly recommend.</li>
            <li>Every so often you find a product that really makes your day</li>
            <li>That really needs to be added to the directions.     </li>
            <li>I find the trick to be not applying too much.</li>
            <li>unless you rub it in very well.</li>
            <li>The scent is subtle and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I use sunscreens frequently and am concerned about possible health issues with most products.</li>
            <li>I feel great using this after trying dozens of \\&quot;commercial\\&quot; products that either gave her a rash from head to toe or had such a long list of unpronounceables that I could hardly feel comfortable applying this to my baby&#x27;s largest organ (her skin!).</li>
            <li>Smells great, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>I had read about what harm conventional sunscreens cause and vowed to never put one on his precious skin.</li>
            <li>When I first received the sunscreen, I thought the bottle would never last my first trip; I was certain I would run out of the sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Although I previously thought all of the organic and health products were ineffective scams, I tried Loving Naturals SPF 30 Sunscreen when I needed a totally natural protect.</li>
            <li>It can leave you a bit whiteish if you put a lot on, but what a small price to pay for a sunscreen that is so effective and non toxic.</li>
            <li>It goes on slightly white, but if you keep rubbing you can get rid of the white tint for the most part.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to a friend (and I have).</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product (and have).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and will buy it again and again.</li>
            <li>I purchased Loving Naturals because of its ingredients, which are possibly safer than other sunscreens.    </li>
            <li>After a week in the hot, bright sun, my skin was not damaged, or burnt, or uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on the skin (does not burn even sensitive faces).</li>
            <li>I love this product and wear it on my face everyday.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I have been using this sunscreen on ourselves and our children for the past month and can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>There are few of the many sunscreens on the market that get a \\&quot;recommended\\&quot; from EWG and this was one of them.</li>
            <li>Protected them from the sun fine, smells ok, but goes on like rubbing sand on them, they refuse to let me put it on them anymore, also left them a little blueish white (must be the zinc)</li>
            <li>And, most importantly, my 2.5 year old, 4.5 year old, and husband all use it without complaint!  </li>
            <li>I use a very simple and pure, zinc oxide suncreen by Real Purity SPF 15 and wear a hat.</li>
            <li>and I was about to apply sunblock I was worried it would irritate my newly waxed legs</li>
            <li>It applies easily with a slight tint</li>
            <li>It is thin, which I actually think I like better than a thicker product like Badger because when we used the Badger, we used it up so quickly and it was much thicker on the body.</li>
            <li>Not excessively fragant.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It sounds to me like most of the negative reviews as far as the color and staining were made by people who used too much.</li>
            <li>The problem I&#x27;ve had with this sunscreen is that the zinc oxide particles are larger than in other products, which is why this is supposed to be safer (doesn&#x27;t get absorbed into the body as easily), but the larger particles are visible.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and it rubs in nicely too.</li>
            <li>My search for a natural sunscreen was brought on by my brand new baby.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to know it&#x27;s not packed full of dangerous chemicals.  </li>
            <li>However, other than my special SPF clothing, it has washed out without a problem.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;sunscreen is non-greasy oil-based that leaves certain white residue over the skin.</li>
            <li>I use it on myself and my 11 month old daughter.</li>
            <li>I can deal with the white when I&#x27;m not going to be seen by others, but because this is a surface sunscreen that is greasy, any sweat on the face becomes very itchy and when you scratch, or just touch a covered area</li>
            <li>I chose to go the natural route</li>
            <li>I actually developed scapbs in the creases of my neck and arms.</li>
            <li>I thought perhaps it was just me, but then my 11 year old daughter tried it and she too started to cry about how it was burning and stinging.</li>
            <li>I can only wonder at how much toxins I inadvertently introduced in to my system.</li>
            <li>If the product looks too white when applied you are using too much.</li>
            <li>Remember there is nothing natural about blocking the sun&#x27;s rays from our skin</li>
            <li>I like how it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>It has far exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>It is one of the few sun protection products out there that I feel comfortable putting on my two-year-old.</li>
            <li>We tried it out in Ohio when  it was in the upper 80&#x27;s and very sunny.  </li>
            <li>I had been on the hunt for an natural alternative to tradition sunscreen for months, before summer began.</li>
            <li>I have recently become health conscious, particularly regarding my skin.</li>
            <li>I have a baby that is under 6 mos old and live in the desert where we are outside a lot of the time.  </li>
            <li>We spent hours in the sunshine the first day we tried this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>No other product can compete.</li>
            <li>Usually I never wear sunscreen, but I bought this because I just started a daily routine of swimming at lunch hour.</li>
            <li>and I love that it is a very small family company rather than a big mega corporation.</li>
            <li>Also be careful to shut the cap tight or try to keep it in a position so the cap is up because the lotion can easily leak out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>therefore why should we complain about the natural white color/tint of a completely natural sunblock such as this one?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of products that have all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>This is an effective sunscreen without scary ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try putting more of it on, maybe that&#x27;s the problem -- or, maybe the problem is that it isn&#x27;t quite as waterproof as it claims to be -- or, the problem might be that it&#x27;s just not a great sunblock</li>
            <li>I have two little ones at home, who I knew would be out in the sun &amp; I needed to find something right away.</li>
            <li>My requests would be to make a stick version, higher SPF, and hopefully the price can come down.</li>
            <li>Back then, there were very few that fit that criteria.</li>
            <li>I expected to turn a pasty white since it has almost 25% zinc oxide, but surprisingly the tinge was slight, barely noticeable (but I&#x27;m pale already), &amp; soaked in after about 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product but for me it is only of limited value.</li>
            <li>Okay this sunscreen has a weird smell, different than normal.</li>
            <li>Not only did it physically block the sun from damaging my skin, but it is 100% completely natural.     </li>
            <li>Texas summer heat + late evening delivery &#x3D; very hot &amp; liquidy sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Wow...pretty expensive for such a tiny bottle, but has a high rating for the Environmental Work&#x27;s Group&#x27;s website for non-toxicity, so hope it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>On the plus side, it spreads pretty well and a little goes a long way.    </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I stumbled upon Loving Naturals on Amazon, price was great, and EWG ratings were excellent.  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!!  </li>
            <li> For example, oxybenzone (found in many sunscreens, including BABY sunscreens).  Yikes!!    </li>
            <li> Loving Naturals is A BARGAIN FOR WHAT YOU GET!</li>
            <li> Thank you Loving Naturals!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pleasant.</li>
            <li> and I find it pleasant.</li>
            <li> The customer service from Loving Naturals is spectacular, the product amazing, and I feel great knowing my family is using the best.</li>
            <li> I have fair complexion</li>
            <li> Yes, they have lots of good reviews, but I tell you ignore them.  </li>
            <li> We have had no sunburns and we feel good knowing that the ingredients aren&#x27;t going to harm our children.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have found a sunscreen that is safe for my child and myself to use.  </li>
            <li> We love it!</li>
            <li> Love this sunblock!</li>
            <li> We love it!</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen!</li>
            <li> We love this!</li>
            <li> Well, I LOVE LOVING NATURALS SPF 30 SUNSCREEN!   </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to have found a product that I feel good about putting on myself and my family!</li>
            <li> We love it!  </li>
            <li> This is the most effective sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> It is even safe for babies!</li>
            <li> Then when I compared my skin and the skin of my traveling companions, who used the grocery store sunscreens (Coppertone, Banana Boat, you know), I couldn&#x27;t believe how much more effective the Loving Naturals SPF 30 was!</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with this sunblock.  </li>
            <li> It lives up to it&#x27;s description, and has a nice texture and scent as well.</li>
            <li> but I would say that it&#x27;s effective as a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> See how well Loving Naturals is rated at:  </li>
            <li> When I apply Loving Naturals Sunscreen under my makeup it acts as a nice moisturizer and isn&#x27;t even noticeable.</li>
            <li> I found Loving Naturals on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s website and ordered it.</li>
            <li> The sun was intense in both locations, but the Loving Naturals SPF 30 Sunscreen protected me perfectly.     </li>
            <li> I did lots of research online &amp; via cosmeticdatabase.com before deciding to order Loving</li>
            <li> All in all, I feel very good and very smart about using this product.</li>
            <li> I found it easy and pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> In researching safe AND effective sunscreens for my family, I decided to try Loving Naturals.  </li>
            <li> Loving Naturals is far superior!!  </li>
            <li> Luckily I found this product and after using it during our trip I am definitely a happy customer.</li>
            <li> Best part is the stuff works &amp; my skin doesn&#x27;t burn -- as in no sunburn and doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin feel like it&#x27;s on fire when it&#x27;s applied.</li>
            <li> I purchased this sunscreen in a effort to find a safe, effective, and reliable sunblock for my children.  </li>
            <li> I love Loving Naturals.  </li>
            <li> It is not scented, but that is perfect for me, because I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li> Bonus points to the company for a good dispenser, not tested on animals, free shipping and being caring people you can contact.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s a fair price to pay for a safe, chemical free product.</li>
            <li> I feel very comfortable putting this on my babies.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen goes on easily and the rich oils used to make it feel good on the skin.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Loving Naturals goes on smooth and stays all day even if my boy is playing in water/sand.</li>
            <li> so I can check periodically to be sure none of it has rubbed off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a lotion consistancy, without being too oilly.</li>
            <li> This sunblock is the best rated on the skin deep website.</li>
            <li> I am trusting EWG rating when it says it is a safe sunscreen to use.</li>
            <li> I like the sunscreen, feel safe using it, and will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a safe sunscreen as my daughter</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is OK.  </li>
            <li> You can read more about Non-nano particles on their website too.    </li>
            <li> and my daughter and I stayed burn-free and my husband was able to return to the sun.  </li>
            <li> this sunblock is just okay.</li>
            <li> It is the lightest and most protective sunscreen with the highest percentage of zinc out there.  </li>
            <li> overall it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how the product can be changed so it doesn&#x27;t rub off so much, but that would be great.</li>
            <li> Today there are many more.</li>
            <li> I love that it is ORGANIC.</li>
            <li> Many of my companions were burnt, in fact.</li>
            <li> Well, despite its great EWG protection rating, I am very tan as I sit here today.</li>
            <li> , I think it looks quite good on me, but the whole DNA damage thing is something I kind of want to avoid if I&#x27;m going to be swimming every day.    </li>
            <li> Luckily, I found Loving Naturals which not only works brilliantly but feels better on my skin than a massage from a supermodel...</li>
            <li> they have darker skin and dont burn as easily as me.  </li>
            <li> It spreads easily and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after much research for the safest and most effective sunscreen for my children.  </li>
            <li> I did need to shake it up before using it because the oils would separate, but it goes on smoothly, has a very mild nutty scent that I didn&#x27;t notice even after applying to my face.</li>
            <li> and they both were just fine.</li>
            <li> The smell is perfectly fine, boys are fine with it (they are 5 and 1).</li>
            <li> This is my choice for effective, safe, and natural sunscreen!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m comfortable using this on everyone in my family.</li>
            <li> And,truly chemical free.  </li>
            <li> It is important to reapply.  </li>
            <li> Check out the larger bottle page to see LOTS of great reviews.  </li>
            <li> A lot of sunscreen say they are chemical free but have lots of chemicals in them.</li>
            <li> but he&#x27;s been outside plenty and we&#x27;ve had great results.</li>
            <li> The lotion is not runny and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> There is a light odor that some describe as sunflower (I would have said cocoa butter)</li>
            <li> I started looking for a CHEMICAL FREE, NO NANO PARTICLES,</li>
            <li> The sun on the water was intense; by day 3 all the cousins were using my daughter&#x27;s (Loving Naturals) sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Tanning is a reaction to DNA damage by UV light.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with the customer service and fast shipping, unfortunately shortly after applying the sunscreen to my face, neck, chest and arms, it started to sting and burn.</li>
            <li> I was so happy that I loved it as much as I did/do because it&#x27;s such a better product than your main stream brands &amp; I</li>
            <li> It is much more lotion-y than other mineral sunscreens, which is great.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy and is super waterproof.</li>
            <li> First of all, I love the organic ingredients...</li>
            <li> Loving Naturals uses NON-NANO zinc oxide, which is way better than most other sunscreen products on the market.  </li>
            <li> We have now returned to our home in Sweden (which has one of the highest rates of skin cancer in the world due to so many people not protecting themselves in the sun) and are confident our daughter will be protected when wearing loving naturals out in the sun.</li>
            <li> The mild, organic ingredients in this product make me feel comfortable that I am not risking my health by exposure to chemicals while helping it by limiting my exposure to the sun.</li>
            <li> Growing up, my fair skin always burnt when using the SPF products available at our local store.</li>
            <li> Actually I think it is rather pleasant.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used - fantastic protection for long durations.  </li>
            <li> I tried this sunscreen based on the strong ranking it has in the EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep database and am glad I did!  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen DOES hold up in the water as good or better than conventional sunscreens that claim to be waterproof.</li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> I have found this to be true of all \\&quot;natural\\&quot; sunscreens though.</li>
            <li> To quote EWG: Overall score - 1 (1-10 with 10 worst); UVB protection (SPF)- good; UVA protection - excellent; UVA/UBV balance - good; sunscreen stability - excellent; health concern - low.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not smelly and is easy to apply (aside from reeling in a wriggling baby ;-) ).  </li>
            <li> It also provides adequate sun protection.  </li>
            <li> Because I have a mild case of rosacea, I don&#x27;t use this sunscreen on my FACE.</li>
            <li> So after reading many positive reviews, I randomly chose Loving Naturals and I am VERY PLEASED with this product!</li>
            <li> Loving Naturals sunscreen is safe and well priced compared to other sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a safe sunscreen for my kids - we live in Florida and go through tons of it.  </li>
            <li> , I have the whole family using it!!    </li>
            <li> It does leave a white tint, but I don&#x27;t mind since it&#x27;s helpful to be able to see if I&#x27;ve missed a spot!  </li>
            <li> It is a bit pricey, but shipping is free and fast.</li>
            <li> My only wish is that Loving Naturals made lip balm.</li>
            <li> Loving Naturals has a tan tint to it but when applied it&#x27;s still basically white.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price for avoiding sun-reactive filters like oxybenzone, octinoxate and octocrylene.</li>
            <li> I wrote this for the larger size bottle, but wanted to make sure people viewing the smaller bottle also knew how good this stuff is.  </li>
            <li> Save yourself from having those yucky chemicals absorbed into your skin (if you can&#x27;t eat it, why would you lather it on your skin?).    </li>
            <li> I do not do so, but was told that you can minimize the whiteness by rubbing the product in more completely.</li>
            <li> a mother, this product is at the top of my list &amp; aiding in my shift to all natural products.</li>
            <li> You buy a learn right?   </li>
            <li> and I both have fair skin and live in Southern California.</li>
            <li> We are sensitive to the sun and burn easily.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t heavily scented, goes on easily, works wonderfully (even on the most sensitive baby skin), is long lasting, and is all natural/non-toxic/free of chemicals.</li>
            <li> It does go on white, but it seems to absorb much better than some others.  </li>
            <li> I should have paid more attention when ordering, but it is not much bigger than a \\&quot;hotel sized\\&quot; shampoo bottle...</li>
            <li> But it feels sort of hot against my skin while applying.    </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this for several months now and love it.</li>
            <li> that too is a bit white but leaves my skin feeling much more hydrated.</li>
            <li> Because of this repetitive use, I wanted a product I was confident was safe.</li>
            <li> some of it cancer causing (isn&#x27;t that what we&#x27;re trying to avoid by using the sunscreen in the first place??)</li>
            <li> but you do really get what you pay for sometimes!</li>
            <li> However, don&#x27;t be deceived; this sunscreen lasts much longer than the bottle appears and it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I had to wait until the next day to try it, but so worth it!!  </li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s still technically winter, it&#x27;s been sort of like summer where I live, very sunny and warm.</li>
            <li> I have been using Blue Lizard Sensative Skin, which gets a 2 from EWG, and I think that I like the Loving Naturals a little better.</li>
            <li> Despite being under the hot Spanish sun my son (where you can easily burn underneath an umbrella)</li>
            <li> presentation is simple and easy to carry in the purse.</li>
            <li> The mild, natural, organic, and non-harful ingredients did their job of protecting me from any burn and did not irritate my skin at all.  </li>
            <li> By 30 minutes it should all be absorbed and you should look normal, though I haven&#x27;t really checked since I&#x27;m already out the door by then.    </li>
            <li> However, it dissapears after certain time.</li>
            <li> My older son is fair skinned &amp; usually burns, but by the days end he showed no signs of redness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll do a little more experimenting and get back to you if I find something better.</li>
            <li> it is really runny but goes on smooth enough.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The content is really what it matters.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much or you will end up looking like a ghost.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I whole heartedly recommend.</li>
            <li> Every so often you find a product that really makes your day</li>
            <li> That really needs to be added to the directions.     </li>
            <li> I find the trick to be not applying too much.</li>
            <li> unless you rub it in very well.</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle and pleasant.  </li>
            <li> I use sunscreens frequently and am concerned about possible health issues with most products.</li>
            <li> I feel great using this after trying dozens of \\&quot;commercial\\&quot; products that either gave her a rash from head to toe or had such a long list of unpronounceables that I could hardly feel comfortable applying this to my baby&#x27;s largest organ (her skin!).</li>
            <li> Smells great, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I had read about what harm conventional sunscreens cause and vowed to never put one on his precious skin.</li>
            <li> When I first received the sunscreen, I thought the bottle would never last my first trip; I was certain I would run out of the sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Although I previously thought all of the organic and health products were ineffective scams, I tried Loving Naturals SPF 30 Sunscreen when I needed a totally natural protect.</li>
            <li> It can leave you a bit whiteish if you put a lot on, but what a small price to pay for a sunscreen that is so effective and non toxic.</li>
            <li> It goes on slightly white, but if you keep rubbing you can get rid of the white tint for the most part.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to a friend (and I have).</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product (and have).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it and will buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> I purchased Loving Naturals because of its ingredients, which are possibly safer than other sunscreens.    </li>
            <li> After a week in the hot, bright sun, my skin was not damaged, or burnt, or uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on the skin (does not burn even sensitive faces).</li>
            <li> I love this product and wear it on my face everyday.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using this sunscreen on ourselves and our children for the past month and can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> There are few of the many sunscreens on the market that get a \\&quot;recommended\\&quot; from EWG and this was one of them.</li>
            <li> Protected them from the sun fine, smells ok, but goes on like rubbing sand on them, they refuse to let me put it on them anymore, also left them a little blueish white (must be the zinc)</li>
            <li> And, most importantly, my 2.5 year old, 4.5 year old, and husband all use it without complaint!  </li>
            <li> I use a very simple and pure, zinc oxide suncreen by Real Purity SPF 15 and wear a hat.</li>
            <li> and I was about to apply sunblock I was worried it would irritate my newly waxed legs</li>
            <li> It applies easily with a slight tint</li>
            <li> It is thin, which I actually think I like better than a thicker product like Badger because when we used the Badger, we used it up so quickly and it was much thicker on the body.</li>
            <li> Not excessively fragant.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It sounds to me like most of the negative reviews as far as the color and staining were made by people who used too much.</li>
            <li> The problem I&#x27;ve had with this sunscreen is that the zinc oxide particles are larger than in other products, which is why this is supposed to be safer (doesn&#x27;t get absorbed into the body as easily), but the larger particles are visible.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it rubs in nicely too.</li>
            <li> My search for a natural sunscreen was brought on by my brand new baby.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice to know it&#x27;s not packed full of dangerous chemicals.  </li>
            <li> However, other than my special SPF clothing, it has washed out without a problem.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;sunscreen is non-greasy oil-based that leaves certain white residue over the skin.</li>
            <li> I use it on myself and my 11 month old daughter.</li>
            <li> I can deal with the white when I&#x27;m not going to be seen by others, but because this is a surface sunscreen that is greasy, any sweat on the face becomes very itchy and when you scratch, or just touch a covered area</li>
            <li> I chose to go the natural route</li>
            <li> I actually developed scapbs in the creases of my neck and arms.</li>
            <li> I thought perhaps it was just me, but then my 11 year old daughter tried it and she too started to cry about how it was burning and stinging.</li>
            <li> I can only wonder at how much toxins I inadvertently introduced in to my system.</li>
            <li> If the product looks too white when applied you are using too much.</li>
            <li> Remember there is nothing natural about blocking the sun&#x27;s rays from our skin</li>
            <li> I like how it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> It has far exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> It is one of the few sun protection products out there that I feel comfortable putting on my two-year-old.</li>
            <li> We tried it out in Ohio when  it was in the upper 80&#x27;s and very sunny.  </li>
            <li> I had been on the hunt for an natural alternative to tradition sunscreen for months, before summer began.</li>
            <li> I have recently become health conscious, particularly regarding my skin.</li>
            <li> I have a baby that is under 6 mos old and live in the desert where we are outside a lot of the time.  </li>
            <li> We spent hours in the sunshine the first day we tried this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> No other product can compete.</li>
            <li> Usually I never wear sunscreen, but I bought this because I just started a daily routine of swimming at lunch hour.</li>
            <li> and I love that it is a very small family company rather than a big mega corporation.</li>
            <li> Also be careful to shut the cap tight or try to keep it in a position so the cap is up because the lotion can easily leak out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> therefore why should we complain about the natural white color/tint of a completely natural sunblock such as this one?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of products that have all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> This is an effective sunscreen without scary ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try putting more of it on, maybe that&#x27;s the problem -- or, maybe the problem is that it isn&#x27;t quite as waterproof as it claims to be -- or, the problem might be that it&#x27;s just not a great sunblock</li>
            <li> I have two little ones at home, who I knew would be out in the sun &amp; I needed to find something right away.</li>
            <li> My requests would be to make a stick version, higher SPF, and hopefully the price can come down.</li>
            <li> Back then, there were very few that fit that criteria.</li>
            <li> I expected to turn a pasty white since it has almost 25% zinc oxide, but surprisingly the tinge was slight, barely noticeable (but I&#x27;m pale already), &amp; soaked in after about 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product but for me it is only of limited value.</li>
            <li> Okay this sunscreen has a weird smell, different than normal.</li>
            <li> Not only did it physically block the sun from damaging my skin, but it is 100% completely natural.     </li>
            <li> Texas summer heat + late evening delivery &#x3D; very hot &amp; liquidy sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Wow...pretty expensive for such a tiny bottle, but has a high rating for the Environmental Work&#x27;s Group&#x27;s website for non-toxicity, so hope it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> On the plus side, it spreads pretty well and a little goes a long way.    </li>
            <li> I found some other products at WholeFoods that don&#x27;t smell at all and are still natural.  </li>
            <li> Not pleasant but not unpleasant either.</li>
            <li> and you might want to try out one of the other highly rated products by EWG, maybe one that uses nano zinc oxide which has never really been shown to be harmful in any way.</li>
            <li> I love knowing that his skin is protected without the dangerous potential side effects from chemicals.  </li>
            <li> When we went to the pool last week and spent 1 hr 45 minutes (from 9:50am to 11:30ish), I only applied once</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been out in the sun that much so far this year, but the little I have it&#x27;s protected my face.  </li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t smell artificial and that it has &gt; 20% zinc oxide.</li>
            <li> but they were not natural.</li>
            <li> am now a long term</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product for other family members and friends who also feel the same way.</li>
            <li> And although a whitish residue is inevitable with a non-micronized zinc product, the \\&quot;ghost effect\\&quot; is minimal and a very small price to pay for the high level of sun protection.</li>
            <li> My skin always feels dry after.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen goes on smoothly - you&#x27;re white-faced at first, then as you rub it in you go from being a Kabuki act to just looking rather pale and sickly.</li>
            <li> With two boys at the beach all summer I look for products with limited chemical content.  </li>
            <li> The result is that this isn&#x27;t much different than using the old fashioned zinc oxide which was a greasy solid white coating that blocked the sun, but looked silly.</li>
            <li> The container needs shaking prior to use because there seems to be a little separation.</li>
            <li> It goes on your skin white but with a little rubbing in, you do not notice it.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, and it doesn&#x27;t stink or have a bunch of crazy chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> b/c of it&#x27;s \\&quot;green light\\&quot; rating on [...], but was surprised at the small size of the product.  </li>
            <li> You have to use very little and spread it around so that you don&#x27;t see the white.</li>
            <li> I bought it, anxiously waited for my UPS guy to arrive, tore open the package, and squeezed some out.  </li>
            <li> My family usually fusses at me for \\&quot;going natural,\\&quot; but they actually like this stuff.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> I thought it would make me look very pasty; however it was only a faint difference on my naturally pale skin.</li>
            <li> I was not wanting to use a traditional supermarket sunscreen with all the yucky chemicals on his delicate skin.  </li>
            <li> Also had to really blend to get it to not make skin a weird gray color.</li>
            <li> Badger was thick, weird smell, turned my skin really white, and very pricey.  </li>
            <li> I find I have to store it upside down, which the bottle was not designed for.</li>
            <li> rubbed my children down &amp; also tried it out myself.</li>
            <li> There have been facial sunscreens that I&#x27;ve tried in the past where my makeup gets a little heavy and cakey when applied over it.</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t worry while its a relatively small bottle, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> the expiration date is less than 1 year.  </li>
            <li> This is not your typical sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I hate the thought of using a ton of random chemicals on my kids and this product is a great option.  </li>
            <li> , the sunscreen is rubbed off which leaves little or no protection.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little greasy after applying</li>
            <li> Smells little bit like almond cookies, peanut butter, shortbread.  </li>
            <li> I have searched all over for a sunscreen that does not burn my face or have a harsh chemical smell.  </li>
            <li> I am very sad as I really wanted this to work!</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because of the poor packaging and difficulty of application.     </li>
            <li> and yes, we do have a pale tinge to our body.</li>
            <li> Unlike other mineral-based sunscreens we have used, this one is not chalky or thick.  </li>
            <li> The past 7 days I&#x27;ve applied this to my face and neck 30 minutes before getting into the pool.</li>
            <li> Due to a recent nasty scar on my daughter&#x27;s forehead, I want to apply sunscreen to her face every time she goes out to play, essentially daily.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little less expensive</li>
            <li> Hard to describe.  </li>
            <li> I tried some of the other brands, but I couldn&#x27;t stand the horrible perfumes and they were all very watery.</li>
            <li> It applies very nicely; it&#x27;s not too thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a fan of sunscreens with multiple strange chemicals that make me feel so nasty</li>
            <li> It leaves a terrible white cast on my face, ruins the clothes, and does not protects from the sun.</li>
            <li> When I compared the sun damage of my early youth with this product, I was shocked!</li>
            <li> Seriously - I am sure it probabaly works, but it smells terrible, like bad dirt.  </li>
            <li> never experienced any discomfort.</li>
            <li> The product is very thick and difficult to rub in.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell weird at all either.  </li>
            <li> Well needless to say it was not an issue.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this stuff.</li>
            <li> That said, it&#x27;s not a completely perfect product.    </li>
            <li> Bad idea.  </li>
            <li> When I went out with this sunscreen on I got a really bad sun burn on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> When looking for a sunscreen for my newborn daughter, I noticed that lots of so called \\&quot;organic\\&quot; sunscreens had all kinds of horrible chemicals in them...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I LOVE this sunscreen. I use it on myself and my 11 month old daughter. It goes on smoothly, and it doesn&#x27;t stink or have a bunch of crazy chemicals in it. It also is great in the water; it doesn&#x27;t just come off while swimming.   I feel great using this after trying dozens of \\&quot;commercial\\&quot; products that either gave her a rash from head to toe or had such a long list of unpronounceables that I could hardly feel comfortable applying this to my baby&#x27;s largest organ (her skin!).</li>
            <li> I tried this sunscreen based on the strong ranking it has in the EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep database and am glad I did!  In researching safe AND effective sunscreens for my family, I decided to try Loving Naturals.  Unlike other mineral-based sunscreens we have used, this one is not chalky or thick.  It does go on white, but it seems to absorb much better than some others.  The scent is subtle and pleasant.  And, most importantly, my 2.5 year old, 4.5 year old, and husband all use it without complaint!  It is a bit pricey, but shipping is free and fast.</li>
            <li> First of all, I love the organic ingredients...that&#x27;s what drew me to this product.  I have always used organic sunscreens, but my son would eventually start getting rashes from every one I tried. I think he was allergic to the titanium dioxide. This one only uses zinc oxide and he doesn&#x27;t react at all to it.  It goes on slightly white, but if you keep rubbing you can get rid of the white tint for the most part. It doesn&#x27;t smell weird at all either.  We love it!</li>
            <li> This is my choice for effective, safe, and natural sunscreen! I love that it doesn&#x27;t smell artificial and that it has &gt; 20% zinc oxide. I tried some of the other brands, but I couldn&#x27;t stand the horrible perfumes and they were all very watery. Loving Naturals goes on smooth and stays all day even if my boy is playing in water/sand. I love it so much, I have the whole family using it!!    My only wish is that Loving Naturals made lip balm.</li>
            <li> I use sunscreens frequently and am concerned about possible health issues with most products. I purchased Loving Naturals because of its ingredients, which are possibly safer than other sunscreens.    The problem I&#x27;ve had with this sunscreen is that the zinc oxide particles are larger than in other products, which is why this is supposed to be safer (doesn&#x27;t get absorbed into the body as easily), but the larger particles are visible. The result is that this isn&#x27;t much different than using the old fashioned zinc oxide which was a greasy solid white coating that blocked the sun, but looked silly. Loving Naturals has a tan tint to it but when applied it&#x27;s still basically white. I can deal with the white when I&#x27;m not going to be seen by others, but because this is a surface sunscreen that is greasy, any sweat on the face becomes very itchy and when you scratch, or just touch a covered area, the sunscreen is rubbed off which leaves little or no protection.    I really wanted to like this product but for me it is only of limited value. Because I do believe that it is healthier I will use it when working on my property where no one can see me, but I will have to keep a mirror nearby so I can check periodically to be sure none of it has rubbed off.</li>
            <li> I tried this sunscreen because it ranks #1 on EWG&#x27;s website. I was very pleased with it! I did need to shake it up before using it because the oils would separate, but it goes on smoothly, has a very mild nutty scent that I didn&#x27;t notice even after applying to my face. Works great in the sun and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothing. I&#x27;m comfortable using this on everyone in my family. I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price for avoiding sun-reactive filters like oxybenzone, octinoxate and octocrylene. This mineral&lt;br /&gt;sunscreen is non-greasy oil-based that leaves certain white residue over the skin. However, it dissapears after certain time. I have fair complexion and i get moderate sunburn if i don&#x27;t use sunscreen. With these premises, this sunscreen works well and it&#x27;s pleasant. Not excessively fragant.&lt;br /&gt;The presentation is simple and easy to carry in the purse. The content is really what it matters.&lt;br /&gt;I recomend you try it.</li>
            <li> Love this sunblock! Smells great, a little goes a long way! This sunblock feels great when applying. It&#x27;s more of a lotion consistancy, without being too oilly. It does leave a white tint, but I don&#x27;t mind since it&#x27;s helpful to be able to see if I&#x27;ve missed a spot!  It does disapear after a lit bit. The best part is that it&#x27;s the safest sunblock that I could find! This sunblock is the best rated on the skin deep website. It&#x27;s great to find a sunblock that works great and not have to worry about toxic chemicals when I&#x27;m putting it on my family and myself!!</li>
            <li> We got this sunscreen because it scored so well on the EWG list. We love it! A little goes a long way and it rubs in nicely too.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with this sunblock.  And don&#x27;t worry while its a relatively small bottle, a little goes a long way.  I was really happy when, without thinking, I waxed my legs the morning we went to a water park.  When we got there and I was about to apply sunblock I was worried it would irritate my newly waxed legs (fyi, you shouldn&#x27;t be out in the sun or applying any potential irritants, ie. lotions, for 24 hours when you wax b/c a layer of skin goes with the hair.)  Well needless to say it was not an issue.  The mild, natural, organic, and non-harful ingredients did their job of protecting me from any burn and did not irritate my skin at all.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used - fantastic protection for long durations.  And,truly chemical free.  I won&#x27;t use anything else from now on.  This is an excellent product!</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen after reading about the harmful chemicals that can be in baby sunscreens. I chose to go the natural route and I put this on my baby when he is in the sun. He has never had a sunburn and the product works great. It&#x27;s a little greasy after applying but that&#x27;s a fair price to pay for a safe, chemical free product. I would highly recommend it to a friend (and I have).</li>
            <li> I have used this product for almost two months now and I really like it. I am trusting EWG rating when it says it is a safe sunscreen to use. I&#x27;ve used it on all three of my kids during outside play and swimming. When applied as directed and reapplied as directed, I have not have any of my children burn.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after much research for the safest and most effective sunscreen for my children.  It lives up to it&#x27;s description, and has a nice texture and scent as well.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have found a sunscreen that is safe for my child and myself to use.  We are sensitive to the sun and burn easily.  Loving Naturals sunscreen is safe and well priced compared to other sunscreens.  I like how it is not greasy on my skin.  It is important to reapply.  I have reapplied every two hours and have not been burnt while using it.  Also be careful to shut the cap tight or try to keep it in a position so the cap is up because the lotion can easily leak out of the bottle.  I like the sunscreen, feel safe using it, and will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I have searched all over for a sunscreen that does not burn my face or have a harsh chemical smell.  I love this product and wear it on my face everyday.  I have ordered this product for other family members and friends who also feel the same way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a safe sunscreen as my daughter and I both have fair skin and live in Southern California. I was really impressed with the customer service and fast shipping, unfortunately shortly after applying the sunscreen to my face, neck, chest and arms, it started to sting and burn. I actually developed scapbs in the creases of my neck and arms. I thought perhaps it was just me, but then my 11 year old daughter tried it and she too started to cry about how it was burning and stinging. Hm. I am very sad as I really wanted this to work! Has anyone else had this experience? Do you have any idea which ingredient it might be that is causing the problem? I&#x27;d like to avoid it in the future.</li>
            <li> I have tried every sunscreen under the sun. Given I have found some that worked but they were not natural. I can only wonder at how much toxins I inadvertently introduced in to my system. You buy a learn right?   That said this product is great! Don&#x27;t use too much or you will end up looking like a ghost. Just add a dime size to your palm and rub your palms together briskly. Then apply evenly to your face, neck, and ears. If you&#x27;re a chick then you can add color to your face with face powder or not.  If the product looks too white when applied you are using too much. Remember there is nothing natural about blocking the sun&#x27;s rays from our skin therefore why should we complain about the natural white color/tint of a completely natural sunblock such as this one?  I love this product!!!</li>
            <li> I got this product thru Vikas Jain.  Great product but the expiration date is less than 1 year.  I probably won&#x27;t buy this thru Vikas Jain online store.</li>
            <li> This product is tiny!  I should have paid more attention when ordering, but it is not much bigger than a \\&quot;hotel sized\\&quot; shampoo bottle...I bought it b/c of it&#x27;s \\&quot;green light\\&quot; rating on [...], but was surprised at the small size of the product.  It also leaves quite a white film on the skin, that will eventually go away, but only with A LOT of rubbing in.  It does seem to hold up to it&#x27;s promise to be waterproof.</li>
            <li> MY SHORT ADVICE:  BUY THIS!!  YOU&#x27;LL LOVE IT!!  Want to know why?  Here you go:  My family of seven goes through lots of sunscreen -- especially during summer.  I&#x27;ve been using Badger brand but only because I hadn&#x27;t found anything else yet.  Badger was thick, weird smell, turned my skin really white, and very pricey.  Yes, they have lots of good reviews, but I tell you ignore them.  Loving Naturals is far superior!!  I LOVE THIS STUFF!!  I stumbled upon Loving Naturals on Amazon, price was great, and EWG ratings were excellent.  I bought it, anxiously waited for my UPS guy to arrive, tore open the package, and squeezed some out.  Bad idea.  Texas summer heat + late evening delivery &#x3D; very hot &amp; liquidy sunscreen.  I had to wait until the next day to try it, but so worth it!!  It is thinner consistency, but makes it easier to rub in. I expected to turn a pasty white since it has almost 25% zinc oxide, but surprisingly the tinge was slight, barely noticeable (but I&#x27;m pale already), &amp; soaked in after about 15 minutes.  Smells little bit like almond cookies, peanut butter, shortbread.  Hard to describe.  Best part is the stuff works &amp; my skin doesn&#x27;t burn -- as in no sunburn and doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin feel like it&#x27;s on fire when it&#x27;s applied. After a week of using, I ordered another bottle.  My family usually fusses at me for \\&quot;going natural,\\&quot; but they actually like this stuff.  So, I&#x27;m back to order another two bottles.  FYI: I wrote this for the larger size bottle, but wanted to make sure people viewing the smaller bottle also knew how good this stuff is.  Check out the larger bottle page to see LOTS of great reviews.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this stuff.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is OK.  On the plus side, it spreads pretty well and a little goes a long way.    But it feels sort of hot against my skin while applying.    I will use it up, but will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen wasn&#x27;t greasy to me. It went on well. I like how it&#x27;s natural. I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far but I would say that it&#x27;s effective as a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is great. A lot of sunscreen say they are chemical free but have lots of chemicals in them. I feel very comfortable putting this on my babies. It goes on easy and is super waterproof. Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a fan of sunscreens with multiple strange chemicals that make me feel so nasty I&#x27;d rather be burned.  Luckily, I found Loving Naturals which not only works brilliantly but feels better on my skin than a massage from a supermodel...ha!  The customer service from Loving Naturals is spectacular, the product amazing, and I feel great knowing my family is using the best.</li>
            <li> I Give it a \\&quot;ZERO\\&quot; star. By using it You will look like a ghost. It leaves a terrible white cast on my face, ruins the clothes, and does not protects from the sun. When I went out with this sunscreen on I got a really bad sun burn on my cheeks.  I received a email from them asking me to give it a 4 or 5 star. That&#x27;s how this product got so many fake 5 and 4 star reviews. I will never but it again and don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Wow...pretty expensive for such a tiny bottle, but has a high rating for the Environmental Work&#x27;s Group&#x27;s website for non-toxicity, so hope it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Seriously - I am sure it probabaly works, but it smells terrible, like bad dirt.  I found some other products at WholeFoods that don&#x27;t smell at all and are still natural.  ick.</li>
            <li> I purchased this sunscreen in a effort to find a safe, effective, and reliable sunblock for my children.  It has far exceeded my expectations.  It isn&#x27;t heavily scented, goes on easily, works wonderfully (even on the most sensitive baby skin), is long lasting, and is all natural/non-toxic/free of chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have a baby that is under 6 mos old and live in the desert where we are outside a lot of the time.  I was not wanting to use a traditional supermarket sunscreen with all the yucky chemicals on his delicate skin.  I have been very happy with Loving Naturals sunscreen.  I love knowing that his skin is protected without the dangerous potential side effects from chemicals.  I whole heartedly recommend.</li>
            <li> Throw out your chemically overloaded sunscreen!  Save yourself from having those yucky chemicals absorbed into your skin (if you can&#x27;t eat it, why would you lather it on your skin?).    Recent studies have shown potential cancer connections between chemically created sunscreens.  Check out [...]  Type in some of the ingredients found in \\&quot;off the shelf\\&quot; sunscreen.  For example, oxybenzone (found in many sunscreens, including BABY sunscreens).  Yikes!!    See how well Loving Naturals is rated at:  [...]    Loving Naturals uses NON-NANO zinc oxide, which is way better than most other sunscreen products on the market.  You can read more about Non-nano particles on their website too.    used this sunscreen while on vacation in Hawaii (no sunburn..yay!).</li>
            <li> This is an effective sunscreen without scary ingredients. It is one of the few sun protection products out there that I feel comfortable putting on my two-year-old. It is much more lotion-y than other mineral sunscreens, which is great. And although a whitish residue is inevitable with a non-micronized zinc product, the \\&quot;ghost effect\\&quot; is minimal and a very small price to pay for the high level of sun protection.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using this sunscreen on ourselves and our children for the past month and can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. We have had no sunburns and we feel good knowing that the ingredients aren&#x27;t going to harm our children.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen! It&#x27;s not smelly and is easy to apply (aside from reeling in a wriggling baby ;-) ).  It works great.  We tried it out in Ohio when  it was in the upper 80&#x27;s and very sunny.  My husband actually burned himself the day before and we all used it after that and my daughter and I stayed burn-free and my husband was able to return to the sun.  We have now returned to our home in Sweden (which has one of the highest rates of skin cancer in the world due to so many people not protecting themselves in the sun) and are confident our daughter will be protected when wearing loving naturals out in the sun.</li>
            <li> This is not your typical sunscreen. It applies very nicely; it&#x27;s not too thick. I thought it would make me look very pasty; however it was only a faint difference on my naturally pale skin. There have been facial sunscreens that I&#x27;ve tried in the past where my makeup gets a little heavy and cakey when applied over it. When I apply Loving Naturals Sunscreen under my makeup it acts as a nice moisturizer and isn&#x27;t even noticeable.</li>
            <li> Like the size of the bottle for travel or to carry in purse. Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but it has everything I look for in a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> With two boys at the beach all summer I look for products with limited chemical content.  Protected them from the sun fine, smells ok, but goes on like rubbing sand on them, they refuse to let me put it on them anymore, also left them a little blueish white (must be the zinc)</li>
            <li> this sunblock is just okay. it is really runny but goes on smooth enough. i feel like it protected my kids alright but I fried. they have darker skin and dont burn as easily as me.  I like the idea of it but probably wont buy again.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been out in the sun that much so far this year, but the little I have it&#x27;s protected my face.  It seems to stay on all day.  You have to use very little and spread it around so that you don&#x27;t see the white.</li>
            <li> I love Loving Naturals.  It is the lightest and most protective sunscreen with the highest percentage of zinc out there.  No other product can compete.</li>
            <li> I chose to use this sunscreen because it is #1 on EWG&#x27;s website. I am very pleased with it! I hate the thought of using a ton of random chemicals on my kids and this product is a great option.  It also provides adequate sun protection.  I would highly recommend this product (and have).</li>
            <li> I tried this product because it got a #1 ranking from EWG (Environmental Working Group) which rates sunscreens annually. There are few of the many sunscreens on the market that get a \\&quot;recommended\\&quot; from EWG and this was one of them. To quote EWG: Overall score - 1 (1-10 with 10 worst); UVB protection (SPF)- good; UVA protection - excellent; UVA/UBV balance - good; sunscreen stability - excellent; health concern - low. I found it easy and pleasant to use. The container needs shaking prior to use because there seems to be a little separation. I have been using Blue Lizard Sensative Skin, which gets a 2 from EWG, and I think that I like the Loving Naturals a little better.</li>
            <li> Okay this sunscreen has a weird smell, different than normal. Not pleasant but not unpleasant either. Also had to really blend to get it to not make skin a weird gray color. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend to a friend. Also very tiny bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> Now that I have a baby I think twice about everything I use, especially everything I buy for him. I couldn&#x27;t believe all the toxins in regular sunscreen! When I found this I knew I needed to try it. We haven&#x27;t been to the beach yet (the ultimate test in my opinion) but he&#x27;s been outside plenty and we&#x27;ve had great results. I don&#x27;t like perfumed things so I don&#x27;t mind the scent at all. Actually I think it is rather pleasant. I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I wanted a safe sunscreen for my kids - we live in Florida and go through tons of it.  It applies easily with a slight tint so I can see if I missed a spot.  The coverage is great and stays on well for our hours at the pool/beach.  We love this!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this for several months now and love it. My boys and husband have very fair skin, mine is fair to medium. When we went to the pool last week and spent 1 hr 45 minutes (from 9:50am to 11:30ish), I only applied once and they both were just fine. It is thin, which I actually think I like better than a thicker product like Badger because when we used the Badger, we used it up so quickly and it was much thicker on the body. This rubs in well and yes, we do have a pale tinge to our body. The smell is perfectly fine, boys are fine with it (they are 5 and 1). overall it&#x27;s great! and I love that it is a very small family company rather than a big mega corporation. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Great sun protection.  Non toxic-safe but does leave a white residue. My skin always feels dry after.  If you have oily skin it would be a great product.  I think I will stick to Badger-that too is a bit white but leaves my skin feeling much more hydrated.</li>
            <li> Every so often you find a product that really makes your day and you want to scream about it from the rooftops. Well, I LOVE LOVING NATURALS SPF 30 SUNSCREEN!   My search for a natural sunscreen was brought on by my brand new baby. I had read about what harm conventional sunscreens cause and vowed to never put one on his precious skin. Since we were off to Spain to visit family I knew that I&#x27;d have to find a way to protect him (even though we weren&#x27;t going to intentionally place him in the sun). Luckily I found this product and after using it during our trip I am definitely a happy customer. Despite being under the hot Spanish sun my son (where you can easily burn underneath an umbrella) never experienced any discomfort. The sunscreen goes on easily and the rich oils used to make it feel good on the skin. I also like that it is unscented.  I WILL be recommending it to anyone I see using an unsafe sunscreen, especially on children.</li>
            <li> Due to a recent nasty scar on my daughter&#x27;s forehead, I want to apply sunscreen to her face every time she goes out to play, essentially daily. Because of this repetitive use, I wanted a product I was confident was safe. The sunscreen works great. It is not scented, but that is perfect for me, because I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because of the poor packaging and difficulty of application.     The product separates in the bottle, and the oil leaks out. I find I have to store it upside down, which the bottle was not designed for. To those who think the product is greasy, I wonder if they shake it before applying it. That really needs to be added to the directions.     The product is very thick and difficult to rub in. I find the trick to be not applying too much. A little goes a very long way. I have found this to be true of all \\&quot;natural\\&quot; sunscreens though. I remember when those color zinc oxide creams were all the range. I assume that is what gives the product it&#x27;s white sheen. It sounds to me like most of the negative reviews as far as the color and staining were made by people who used too much. This bottle will easily last us all summer.</li>
            <li> When looking for a sunscreen for my newborn daughter, I noticed that lots of so called \\&quot;organic\\&quot; sunscreens had all kinds of horrible chemicals in them...some of it cancer causing (isn&#x27;t that what we&#x27;re trying to avoid by using the sunscreen in the first place??) I found Loving Naturals on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s website and ordered it. I love it! My daughter, my husband and I all use it and it smells great and works wonderfully! I&#x27;m so excited to have found a product that I feel good about putting on myself and my family!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to cut out some of the chemicals in my families lives and decided after reading reviews to give this sunscreen a try.  We love it!  It&#x27;s so nice to know it&#x27;s not packed full of dangerous chemicals.  You only need a tiny bit to cover a descent sized area too.  I wish it was a little less expensive but you do really get what you pay for sometimes!</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you are concerned about using chemicals on your baby, or yourself. I highly recommend it and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> The mild, organic ingredients in this product make me feel comfortable that I am not risking my health by exposure to chemicals while helping it by limiting my exposure to the sun. The lotion is not runny and goes on smoothly. There is a light odor that some describe as sunflower (I would have said cocoa butter) and I find it pleasant. I do not do so, but was told that you can minimize the whiteness by rubbing the product in more completely. It stays on quite well, though it does come off on clothes, etc. unless you rub it in very well. However, other than my special SPF clothing, it has washed out without a problem. My requests would be to make a stick version, higher SPF, and hopefully the price can come down. I don&#x27;t know how the product can be changed so it doesn&#x27;t rub off so much, but that would be great. Bonus points to the company for a good dispenser, not tested on animals, free shipping and being caring people you can contact.</li>
            <li> I started looking for a CHEMICAL FREE, NO NANO PARTICLES, NO FRAGRANCE sunscreen about 5 years ago for the beach and extended walking. I used [...] (evironmental working group) as a guide. Back then, there were very few that fit that criteria. Today there are many more. So after reading many positive reviews, I randomly chose Loving Naturals and I am VERY PLEASED with this product! It spreads easily and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes. I love that it is ORGANIC. The abundance of oils actually moisturizes my skin. The zinc oxide provides excellent protection and doesn&#x27;t pass into my bloodstream. Because I have a mild case of rosacea, I don&#x27;t use this sunscreen on my FACE. I use a very simple and pure, zinc oxide suncreen by Real Purity SPF 15 and wear a hat. Loving Naturals is A BARGAIN FOR WHAT YOU GET! All in all, I feel very good and very smart about using this product.</li>
            <li> I have recently become health conscious, particularly regarding my skin. Growing up, my fair skin always burnt when using the SPF products available at our local store. Now at age 40, it shows. Although I previously thought all of the organic and health products were ineffective scams, I tried Loving Naturals SPF 30 Sunscreen when I needed a totally natural protect. I wanted to protect my skin during a week-long outdoor music festival, and then the following week while in Denver. The sun was intense in both locations, but the Loving Naturals SPF 30 Sunscreen protected me perfectly.     When I compared the sun damage of my early youth with this product, I was shocked! After a week in the hot, bright sun, my skin was not damaged, or burnt, or uncomfortable. Then when I compared my skin and the skin of my traveling companions, who used the grocery store sunscreens (Coppertone, Banana Boat, you know), I couldn&#x27;t believe how much more effective the Loving Naturals SPF 30 was! Many of my companions were burnt, in fact. Yet, I did not burn at all! I was amazed at just how well it works. Not only did it physically block the sun from damaging my skin, but it is 100% completely natural.     When I first received the sunscreen, I thought the bottle would never last my first trip; I was certain I would run out of the sunscreen. However, don&#x27;t be deceived; this sunscreen lasts much longer than the bottle appears and it&#x27;s worth every penny. Now I am no longer a sceptic. This is the most effective sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used! I highly recommend it and will buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> I had been on the hunt for an natural alternative to tradition sunscreen for months, before summer began. I have two little ones at home, who I knew would be out in the sun &amp; I needed to find something right away. I did lots of research online &amp; via cosmeticdatabase.com before deciding to order Loving Naturals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rubbed my children down &amp; also tried it out myself. We spent hours in the sunshine the first day we tried this sunscreen. My older son is fair skinned &amp; usually burns, but by the days end he showed no signs of redness. None of us did. It did the job. I was so happy that I loved it as much as I did/do because it&#x27;s such a better product than your main stream brands &amp; I am now a long term customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loving Naturals squeezes out looking almost like vanilla bean, and smelling like it too! It goes on your skin white but with a little rubbing in, you do not notice it. You will smell delicious &amp; be protected all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a mother, this product is at the top of my list &amp; aiding in my shift to all natural products. Thank you Loving Naturals!!!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen DOES hold up in the water as good or better than conventional sunscreens that claim to be waterproof. It was the ONLY sunscreen that kept the kids from burning on our family vacation at the lake this summer. The sun on the water was intense; by day 3 all the cousins were using my daughter&#x27;s (Loving Naturals) sunscreen. It worked the best. It is gentle on the skin (does not burn even sensitive faces). It can leave you a bit whiteish if you put a lot on, but what a small price to pay for a sunscreen that is so effective and non toxic. It is even safe for babies! Thank you Loving Naturals! Also, it is not greasy and it has a great nutty smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of companies that care about the health of their consumers. I&#x27;m a big fan of products that have all natural ingredients. I&#x27;m a big fan of consumer watchdogs like EWG and they give this product their highest rating. That said, it&#x27;s not a completely perfect product.    This sunscreen goes on smoothly - you&#x27;re white-faced at first, then as you rub it in you go from being a Kabuki act to just looking rather pale and sickly. By 30 minutes it should all be absorbed and you should look normal, though I haven&#x27;t really checked since I&#x27;m already out the door by then.    Usually I never wear sunscreen, but I bought this because I just started a daily routine of swimming at lunch hour. Even though it&#x27;s still technically winter, it&#x27;s been sort of like summer where I live, very sunny and warm. The past 7 days I&#x27;ve applied this to my face and neck 30 minutes before getting into the pool. Well, despite its great EWG protection rating, I am very tan as I sit here today. Tanning is a reaction to DNA damage by UV light. I have no complaints about being tan, I think it looks quite good on me, but the whole DNA damage thing is something I kind of want to avoid if I&#x27;m going to be swimming every day.    I&#x27;ll try putting more of it on, maybe that&#x27;s the problem -- or, maybe the problem is that it isn&#x27;t quite as waterproof as it claims to be -- or, the problem might be that it&#x27;s just not a great sunblock and you might want to try out one of the other highly rated products by EWG, maybe one that uses nano zinc oxide which has never really been shown to be harmful in any way. I&#x27;ll do a little more experimenting and get back to you if I find something better.</li>
