            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I am more than satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I love Kai products.  </li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I love this scent of this lotion</li>
            <li>I love the smell when my wife puts it</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t were many perfumes or lotions since I get migraines very easily from overpowering smells, and most scents are too strong.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very nice and the consistancy of the lotion is very creamy.</li>
            <li>The lotion absorbs beautifully and leaves my skin feeling so soft.</li>
            <li>I have to admit i enjoy it more for the smell than the moisturizing factor, but it still is moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>You will love it&#x27;s smooth consistency and the scent of gardenias.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s ideal for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Tropical and light.  </li>
            <li>I use this lotion when I want to enjoy a sensory lift.</li>
            <li>It has a lovely fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Since the smell was absolutely amazing and lasted all night (which is unusual for a body butter)</li>
            <li>and she married the guy, who when he hugged her, fell in love with her because of the Kai scent.</li>
            <li>It feels fresh and clean and easy to rub into your skin.</li>
            <li>Used Kai Body Lotion today for the very first time and it is FABULOUS.  </li>
            <li>It has a light pleasant smell and the lotion helps keep my very dry skin moisturized.</li>
            <li>I order this product it arrives quickly and boxed and protected.</li>
            <li>Smells delicious and doesn&#x27;t go on to heavily while at the same time very absorbing !</li>
            <li>It has a nice, clean scent that&#x27;s not &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; and heavy.</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t prefer lotions with perfume smells that cling all day long because I think that means they are more synthetic.?</li>
            <li>This is a lot of lotion to use, so it would be better for the price if the scent lasted as long as the lotion did.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and is nice and thick.  </li>
            <li>Very fragrant.</li>
            <li>As someone said, a little does go a long way and that is great.  </li>
            <li>Kai is a marvelous product, however, it is very expensive for my blood to maintain it as an every day delight.  </li>
            <li>La Prairie Cellular Body Mosturizer exceedingly high</li>
            <li>I decided on the lotion which smells just as wonderful and lasts just as long for a little less of a price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to experience although I am not sure how long the smell really lasts.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I had an Amazon gift card for $10 that brought it down from $30 to $19.</li>
            <li>What I really like about this product and why I initially bought it is for the smell.</li>
            <li>I am giving this four stars only because it is pricey and the shipping costs really hiked it up there.</li>
            <li>since  I showered and the scent of the gardenia is still alive and thriving.  </li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t use this as your main lotion to replace your regular deep every day over all body moisturizing lotion.</li>
            <li>During this hard winter, I use it after a hot shower and I am transported to Hawaii!</li>

            <li> The fragrance was just what I was hoping for.  Tropical and light.  As someone said, a little does go a long way and that is great.  However, the scent doesn&#x27;t stay as long as I was hoping.</li>
            <li> Great smelling lotion that&#x27;s ideal for dry skin. It feels fresh and clean and easy to rub into your skin. Lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this lotion on a trip to Hawaii when I found it in our hotel gift shop.  It was expensive there so of course I searched elsewhere before purchasing.  I was happy to find it at a more reasonable price on-line. The scent is light, fresh and very pleasant.  I like applying it before bed.  I have to admit i enjoy it more for the smell than the moisturizing factor, but it still is moisturizing.  I will buy another bottle and perhaps other products as well.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion when I want to enjoy a sensory lift. You only need a little bit, which I like. I would recommend using it mostly as a hand lotion. It is creamy but somehow a little thin so I wouldn&#x27;t use this as your main lotion to replace your regular deep every day over all body moisturizing lotion. (I use Kiss My Face Calendula Honey lotion for that.) What I really like about this product and why I initially bought it is for the smell. During this hard winter, I use it after a hot shower and I am transported to Hawaii! It&#x27;s nice to experience although I am not sure how long the smell really lasts. However, I don&#x27;t prefer lotions with perfume smells that cling all day long because I think that means they are more synthetic.? I am giving this four stars only because it is pricey and the shipping costs really hiked it up there. Fortunately, I had an Amazon gift card for $10 that brought it down from $30 to $19.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for three years and love it. I tried another product and my husband noticed immediately.&lt;br /&gt;It keeps my legs and arms from going scaly and dry in the summer as I am outdoors a lot, and the scent is a constant reminder of Hawaii.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. Want to get the body wash. I had a salt &amp; sugar Scrub in NOLA and they used the Kai products. Smells so good!!!</li>
            <li> This is my very favorite body lotion. It smells so wonderful without being overpowering or strong. It reminds me of Hawaii. I use it after a shower and place it all over my body. The lotion absorbs beautifully and leaves my skin feeling so soft. It is expensive and I don&#x27;t use it everyday but whenever I do use it, there are always comments on how wonderful the lotion smells on me. My husband loves it when I wear it!!&lt;br /&gt;When I order this product it arrives quickly and boxed and protected. I recommend you try it too.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells like Hawaii! Discovered it in Los Angeles three years ago and am thrilled that I found it on Amazon, and at a lower price.  You will love it&#x27;s smooth consistency and the scent of gardenias. It exceeds all expectations.</li>
            <li> Best body lotion my wife has found...and she has tried everything!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t were many perfumes or lotions since I get migraines very easily from overpowering smells, and most scents are too strong. This lotion is great!  It has a light pleasant smell and the lotion helps keep my very dry skin moisturized. Since I found this lotion, it is the only one I use.</li>
            <li> Kai is luxurious and sensual. There just is no product quite like it and I&#x27;ve tried many over the years. I gave it as a gift to my niece and she married the guy, who when he hugged her, fell in love with her because of the Kai scent. No kidding!</li>
            <li> Love love this lotion. The light and pleasant fragrance moisturizer is just what I wanted. I also purchased the roll on perfume.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this lotion.  I have had it for a while, however, and the perfume is dissipating - the scent is now very faint.  This is a lot of lotion to use, so it would be better for the price if the scent lasted as long as the lotion did.</li>
            <li> Hawaii in a bottle. Plumeria, ginger. Refreshing. Wonderful lotion. I do not let myself run out. I love it.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites. Very fragrant. It has a lovely fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after a friend had been wearing the Kia body butter.  Since the smell was absolutely amazing and lasted all night (which is unusual for a body butter) I wanted to order Kai the next day.  I decided on the lotion which smells just as wonderful and lasts just as long for a little less of a price.  I am more than satisfied.  I know my friends will be purchasing this soon!</li>
            <li> This is a great body lotion and it&#x27;s now in my &amp;#34;favorites&amp;#34; for splurges.  There is no need to wear perfume when this is applied -- a nice, floral fragrance that&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li> I love Kai products.  Makes me feel like I&#x27;m in Hawaii.</li>
            <li> Smells delicious and doesn&#x27;t go on to heavily while at the same time very absorbing ! Love it!! Packaging was great as well.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered in a timely manner. This lotion is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It is all I use now...and has been for a year since I discovered it at an airport store. I was so happy to see I can order from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. The scent is great and it&#x27;s not greasy at all. It&#x27;s a great summer scented lotion. I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely addicted to this product. It has a nice, clean scent that&#x27;s not &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; and heavy. Great for work and play.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and am happy I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The lotion is nice but a bit strong.  It absorbs quickly and is nice and thick.  i would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this scent of this lotion</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion for years; it has a subtle fragrance and one I don&#x27;t ever tire of.</li>
            <li> I love the smell when my wife puts it</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very nice and the consistancy of the lotion is very creamy. I may purchase the perfume oil next.</li>
            <li> Used Kai Body Lotion today for the very first time and it is FABULOUS.  The floral gardenia aroma captures all your senses and you feel as though you are actually in Hawaii.  It has been 7 hrs. since  I showered and the scent of the gardenia is still alive and thriving.  Kai is a marvelous product, however, it is very expensive for my blood to maintain it as an every day delight.  Kai is in the Class of LaMer $130.00, La Prairie Cellular Body Mosturizer exceedingly high but people purchase all these products without a blink of the eye.  Unfortunitely, I have to be selective.  The only CON for me here is the price and it never goes on sale anywhere.  Today I accidently discovered a site Blush.com and it has NO Shipping/Handling so I purchased the Kai shampoo for $34.00 no S/H so I saved there.  Just a little tip, girls.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer and fragrant scent that lasts.</li>
