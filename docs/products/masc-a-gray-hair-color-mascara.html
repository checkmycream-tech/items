            <li> It would be great if it were water proofed as some eye mascaras are.</li>
            <li> It does leave you hair a bit sticky.</li>
            <li> Love this hair mascara.  I am never without it.</li>
            <li> Terrific product.  Good coverage and does not come off on clothing and pillow.  Long lasting supply in mascara-like packaging.  Have been using for many years.</li>
            <li> Great for coloring graying eyebrows!!!!</li>
            <li> Helpful between hair appointments when you don&#x27;t want to bother touching up the grey.</li>
            <li> I use it to coat only a few strandswhere the gray is most obvious.  Just like with mascara, wipe excess product off on a tissue before using on your hair.</li>
            <li> very important for those of us who&#x27;s eyebrow hair turns white along with the rest of the hair on our heads !!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s perfect for that week or so between colorings. It does have to be washed out before applying hair dyes, or the roots may turn reddish. But it&#x27;s a great cover up color. I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
            <li> Works fine for a few grays, but it would get tedious if you have a lot of gray. Stays put and doesn&#x27;t rub off onto clothing or pillows.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of grey very early and it starts showing again as soon as two weeks after I color. I had been looking for a way to be able to go longer in between because coloring so often is just not good for your hair. I had written off the use of these types of products because I thought they would run, not work etc. but I was totally WRONG! This stuff works to cover the greys in between times when you can color and no one has been able to tell but me. It also has not run even when I am exercising. It&#x27;s also quick and easy to use. I am actually really surprised and I am glad my hairstylist convinced me to try this product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a mascara-like product to cover my roots, and this product is great. You do have to wash your hands after applying it, but who cares when it looks good on. I use it to cover the roots around my face, and where I part my hair. I will buy one for my sister.</li>
            <li> It does the trick in desperation but I don&#x27;t like how it feels on my hair.  If you are in a bind though and don&#x27;t have time to go get your hair done before an event or trip, this is a temporary fix.</li>
            <li> This product helps hide the grey hairs that pop out before I see my stylist again. It is easy to use.  I wish company would figure out a way to make it softer. It makes the hairs a bit stiff after application. No one can tell but me!</li>
            <li> It a ok product. I prefer the powder.</li>
            <li> Very easy to cover gray and always looks natural</li>
