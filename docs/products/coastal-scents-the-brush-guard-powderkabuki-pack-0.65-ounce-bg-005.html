            <li>great for traveling.</li>
            <li>Great to use when traveling and great to use when drying brushes after cleaning.</li>
            <li>good to protect your makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>Love these brush guards!</li>
            <li>The netting almost ruined my nice Sigma eye brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed at how nicely they work for drying the brushes as well.</li>
            <li>I am happy to say that they not only survived but looked as good as ever when I got</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s OK -</li>
            <li>so when you protect your brushes, make sure to check for hair the would stick out.</li>
            <li>I needed more of the larger size and this was perfect.</li>
            <li>and I had to get more....</li>
            <li>They work great and so far have protected my brushes at home and while traveling in my gym bag.</li>
            <li>The guard comes on and off easily but doesn&#x27;t budge unless you want it to</li>
            <li>It is a breathable mesh so these can easily be used when brushes are drying to retain their shape.    </li>
            <li>first I used these only after washing my brushes to help them keep their shapes while drying but soon found that they are an excellent solution for travel as well.</li>
            <li>I have a kabuki brush by e.l.f. and two powder/bronzer brushes by eco tools and sigma and these fit those as those brushes are one inch or wider.</li>
            <li>These are the ones that fit my 3/4\\&quot; kabuki brushes.</li>
            <li>They are very useful for keeping my brushes&#x27; shape.</li>
            <li>These fit just right!  </li>
            <li>These guards keep them both in the shape they originally came in.    </li>
            <li>I was really excited about this product</li>
            <li>keeps all my brushes clean and ready-to-go.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely need when traveling so I am OK with that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like these brush guards because they aren&#x27;t flimsy and perfectly stable for drying your brushes upside down.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These work beautifully for drying my brushes upside down.  </li>
            <li>they do stretch so it would fit the right size brush.</li>
            <li>I purchased several packs of them and am very pleased as they are super helpful when traveling or even when in storage when your brushes are in a tube case.</li>
            <li>These little plastic guards are really great for travel or just to use at home...</li>
            <li>I only have two nice makeup brushes so instead of spending a lot of money on a brush case to hold them I bought the Brush Guards instead.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure you can purchase the raw material product on ebay and cut to your own size requirements, but for me, this was way easier as I could get the variety of sizes</li>
            <li>In order for this particular size to fit your brush you must measure the bottom of the handle of your make up brush</li>
            <li>my experience the key to success is a) to slide them on from the handle end (and slide them off toward the top),</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have a brush holder because the handles vary in size and don&#x27;t fit in a brush holder very well.</li>
            <li>I thought this type of protector would be better than the clear plastic ones because I could protect my brushes after washing them and they would dry better if they were still damp (if I had to cover them up in a hurry).</li>
            <li>When I first saw these brush guards</li>
            <li>This is a great way to protect the bristles on your expensive brushes for a really cheap price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For my last two trips I simply slid the Brush Guards onto them, placed them in my makeup case (a Fossil Frame Key-Per cosmetics case) and was good to go.</li>
            <li>Again in order to work these must fit TIGHTLY, the brush guards may not seem like they will fit by looking at them</li>
            <li>I got a variety pack of these as a gift and they make such a huge difference in keeping the shape of my brushes after cleaning.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>They fit all size larger brushes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend...</li>
            <li>My brushes look like new everytime</li>
            <li>for the eye liners and currently waiting for the medium size (.55-ounce) to be available for subscribe and save for the last 2 brushes with no guards.</li>
            <li>I collect more expensive brushes I will most likely buy a makeup brush case but will still use these guards to protect the bristles in the case - they work that well.</li>
            <li>They stretch well to fit your brush but still hold a tight grip on the bristles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got many mac brushes but no way to protect and cover the bristles making it hard to keep in my purse.  </li>
            <li>These brush guards by coastal scents are very helpful and come in all different sizes to accommodate brushes.</li>
            <li>and you will be surprised.    </li>
            <li>Enjoy using the larger makeup brush guards since it makes it so much easier to dry several large brushed at the same time.</li>
            <li>The guard needs to stretch enough to fit the brush tightly in order to not move around.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love these brush guards! They cover my brushes well (snug) and they keep the bristles in shape.</li>
            <li> When I first saw these brush guards I was a bit skeptical but am now a total fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I used these only after washing my brushes to help them keep their shapes while drying but soon found that they are an excellent solution for travel as well. I have a set of small kabuki brushes I take with me when I travel and always disliked having to bring an extra case for them to keep them protected. For my last two trips I simply slid the Brush Guards onto them, placed them in my makeup case (a Fossil Frame Key-Per cosmetics case) and was good to go. I am happy to say that they not only survived but looked as good as ever when I got home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my experience the key to success is a) to slide them on from the handle end (and slide them off toward the top), b)let the Brush Guard extend over the bristles just a bit (as shown in the product picture), and c) pick a Brush Guard that fits. Coastal Scents makes a variety of different sizes to accommodate different brushes and there is a reason for that. Putting a Kabuki Guard on a flat blush brush not only doesn&#x27;t work well but it will allow the Guard to move and in the process damage the bristles. The only brush shape these are not suitable for is a fan-shaped brush but then again that&#x27;s not a brush I absolutely need when traveling so I am OK with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100 % recommend these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got many mac brushes but no way to protect and cover the bristles making it hard to keep in my purse.  Only covers/cases I found for the \\&quot;kabuki\\&quot; or buffer brushes were at least $20 which weren&#x27;t exactly compact either.  Now with these guards, I can actually take my buffer brush around without worrying about how the bristles will get damaged or mishapen.  Which is just what I needed for my purse.  Beucase that worked out so well, I also use it for the buffer and the oversized powder brush at home as well to keep them from getting fluffed out looking.    These guards keep them both in the shape they originally came in.    I even ended up buying the smaller one (.45-ounce) for the eye liners and currently waiting for the medium size (.55-ounce) to be available for subscribe and save for the last 2 brushes with no guards.</li>
            <li> great for my brushes, they do the job. My brushes look like new everytime I use this. The only thing is that it tooks a little longer for them to dry, so if I dont have all night long, I cant use this</li>
            <li> The brush guard is a great tool for drying your makeup brushes as well as for protecting your brushes while traveling.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful!  I travel a lot &amp; these are definitely the answer for keeping your makeup brushes protected. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this product but it&#x27;s a MAJOR fail. The netting almost ruined my nice Sigma eye brushes. I thought this type of protector would be better than the clear plastic ones because I could protect my brushes after washing them and they would dry better if they were still damp (if I had to cover them up in a hurry). The bristles got caught in the netting instead of staying protected. I even bought three packs of these--what a dummy! Maybe I can find a different use for them...</li>
            <li> I bought this set of 4 brush guards to protect my IT Cosmetics kabuki four brush set. These fit just right!  I&#x27;m amazed at how nicely they work for drying the brushes as well. Just wash them as usual, slide the guard on and stand the brush up on the guard (brush head down). I was really amazed that they dried overnight!!  You&#x27;d think that compressing all of the bristles together would make drying take forever.</li>
            <li> Just did not work for me</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 sets of these - one from Walmart called The BrushGuard and one from Amazon by Coastal Scents called the same thing in (if I remember correctly) almost identical packaging.  Don&#x27;t know if these 2 companies are related or if one bought out the other or what...regardless, both contained the identical products (albeit in different sizes because I purchased different size sets)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These work beautifully for drying my brushes upside down.  I now store the brushes I am currently not using in these too (standing upright in a paintbrush holder similar to one I saw in one of EnKore&#x27;s you tube videos).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The down side is that my thicker/denser brushes do not dry overnight if placed in one of these (example:  Ecotools bronzer, any of my kabuki brushes), but that&#x27;s OK - I dry upside down overnight and lay flat to dry rest of way next a.m. (I have backup brushes to use in the interim.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure you can purchase the raw material product on ebay and cut to your own size requirements, but for me, this was way easier as I could get the variety of sizes I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend!</li>
            <li> good to protect your makeup brushes. the only downside is that sometimes the hairs would stick out  through the holes of the brush guard. so when you protect your brushes, make sure to check for hair the would stick out. they do stretch so it would fit the right size brush.</li>
            <li> I got a variety pack of these as a gift and they make such a huge difference in keeping the shape of my brushes after cleaning. I needed more of the larger size and this was perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten brush protectors from other places before. They are very useful for keeping my brushes&#x27; shape. I don&#x27;t really have a brush holder because the handles vary in size and don&#x27;t fit in a brush holder very well. So I decided to use these instead to store my brushes. They keep my brushes in very good shape. I also use them after I&#x27;ve cleaned my brushes. My brushes dries perfectly in these holders.</li>
            <li> Great idea BUT!they unraveled and stiff  and they where were only 4 or 5 for six bucks, so I found  them on e-bay .There great ! 15 guards for a 2 bucks  and they are purple . like I said great idea just not these</li>
            <li> I got one of these as a sample and was immediately hooked, so I bought them in every size to take care of all my makeup brushes.  To use them, just wash your brushes out, shape them a little by hand, and slip the brush guard up the handle and over the bristles.  Then simply let dry.  When done your brush bristles will be properly aligned and compact, not sticking out in every direction.  You can even stand the brushes up to dry in a cup on the end of the brush guard with the handle up and the bristles facing down if you make sure the brush guard extends past the end of the bristles a little.</li>
            <li> I only have two nice makeup brushes so instead of spending a lot of money on a brush case to hold them I bought the Brush Guards instead. I am happy I did! They work great and so far have protected my brushes at home and while traveling in my gym bag. They stretch well to fit your brush but still hold a tight grip on the bristles. The guard comes on and off easily but doesn&#x27;t budge unless you want it to (it has never come off in my gym bag and I am not gentel with it). This is a great way to protect the bristles on your expensive brushes for a really cheap price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I collect more expensive brushes I will most likely buy a makeup brush case but will still use these guards to protect the bristles in the case - they work that well.</li>
            <li> Great brush guards. They fit all size larger brushes. Protect your brushes and try them out. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Enjoy using the larger makeup brush guards since it makes it so much easier to dry several large brushed at the same time. Always use brush guards when drying my larger spaced makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> best brush guards on the market.  keeps all my brushes clean and ready-to-go.  great for traveling.</li>
            <li> These little plastic guards are really great for travel or just to use at home...Highly recommend...I gave them to all my family and friends ...</li>
            <li> I had a sample of some and I had to get more....love the way it protects your brush as it dries!!!</li>
            <li> I really like these brush guards because they aren&#x27;t flimsy and perfectly stable for drying your brushes upside down. I clean my makeup brushes often (because bacteria and acne are my worst enemies) and these make it way easier to dry and store my brushes.</li>

I purchased several packs of them and am very pleased as they are super helpful when traveling or even when in storage when your brushes are in a tube case. I never worry about my brushes losing form or being damaged. It is a breathable mesh so these can easily be used when brushes are drying to retain their shape.    A WORD ABOUT SIZING.  In order for these to function properly you need to downsize big time. The guard needs to stretch enough to fit the brush tightly in order to not move around. A big improvement on these brushes would be a strip of grip gel along the inside of one end of the guard. This would grip the ferrule and stop the guard from moving around or moving backwards. In order for this particular size to fit your brush you must measure the bottom of the handle of your make up brush and it must be AT LEAST ONE INCH WIDE. I have five kabuki brushes made by Beauty Junkies that are wide and dense and these are too big. I have a kabuki brush by e.l.f. and two powder/bronzer brushes by eco tools and sigma and these fit those as those brushes are one inch or wider. If your brush is LESS THAN ONE INCH but still powder/kabuki then you need to use the [[ASIN:B004ZD2M7W Coastal Scents The Brush Guard, Foundation Pack]]. These are the ones that fit my 3/4\\&quot; kabuki brushes. For your smaller brushes than that I recommend the variety pack.    Always slide the guard on from the handle of the brush and extend it so that it is half an inch beyond the end of the brush to protect it. Again in order to work these must fit TIGHTLY, the brush guards may not seem like they will fit by looking at them but they expand a lot and you will be surprised.    Recommended.</li>
            <li> Great to use when traveling and great to use when drying brushes after cleaning. Would order again and again as my brush collection gets bigger.</li>
