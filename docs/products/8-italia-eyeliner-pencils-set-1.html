            <li>there all great vibrant colors</li>
            <li>First of all there&#x27;s two many colors that just don&#x27;t have good quality.</li>
            <li>Ok so I wanted an eyeliner that was easy to glide on and woildnt rub off on top lid when closing my eyes</li>
            <li>The eyeliner themselves went on very smooth, stayed when you want it to stay on, but was also removed easily without scrubbing.</li>
            <li>At first I really loved these pencils.</li>
            <li>This is a good set for someone who&#x27;s buying eyeliner for the first time, which I was.</li>

            <li>They go on smooth and the color is vibrant and beautiful.</li>
            <li>think this was a little too smudgey for me, but seems to be perfect for others who like that kind of look.</li>
            <li>Nice bright colors, soft texture.</li>
            <li>they are easy to apply on, the colors are lovely.</li>
            <li>Although the creamy texture of the pencil does make it easy to break when sharpening (like most eye pencils)</li>

            <li>Super pigmented, really nice colors.</li>

            <li>Bright, vibrant colors with a hint of shimmer.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It however, does not stay on too well and smudges very quickly even without contact to anything.</li>
            <li>I literally cut my eyelid trying to put the color on when they say its easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>they are so easy to put on there</li>

            <li>/&gt;They are super pigmented, and go on super smooth!!</li>
            <li>They have a beautiful metallic shine to them, with the exception of the black which was a nice matte.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more natural colors, but if I use lightly and blend it still looks good.  </li>
            <li>I love that they are a full size pencil</li>
            <li>The best eyeliner pencil hands down in my opinion - I started lining my water line</li>

            <li>The light blue is a beautiful color as is the gold.</li>
            <li>After purchasing these for the price I thought they would be cheaply made and would not go on the skin easily.</li>

            <li>They glide on extremely smooth but this is why they smudge so easily.  </li>
            <li>The colors are so smooth &amp; easy to apply , I will return to your products again.</li>
            <li>That works just fine for me but wanted to mention it.</li>
            <li>These are some of my absolute FAVORITE eyeliners!</li>
            <li>The colors look great and are easy to apply but the only issue is that they tend to smudge.</li>

            <li>these pencils would be cheap and dry, but they are amazing!</li>
            <li>Very smooth application and not thin...</li>
            <li>I got this because the variety of colors specially the lavender and gold which I adore..</li>
            <li>Although  all of this is awesome it does not change the fact that it smudges easily and is very hard to wash off.</li>
            <li>Colors are bright and last all day.</li>
            <li>I use the brown liner on my eyebrows or as a lip liner, the pink one also works great on the lips.</li>
            <li>These eyeliners were a great value for the money spent.</li>
            <li>The only color is good</li>
            <li>But all in all cool colors</li>
            <li>But overall this is a good product</li>
            <li>and I can really say these are my favorite eyeliners.</li>
            <li>They Are So True To The Color</li>
            <li>but they definitely aren&#x27;t good for the waterline and</li>
            <li>They are true to the color it says.</li>
            <li>I truly loved this kit,  I use it daily .</li>
            <li>She loved the different colors</li>
            <li>i liked the array of colors, but the liners are too soft...</li>
            <li>The other colors for the most part are exactly how they appear and work amazingly, these are my favorite eyeliner pencils</li>
            <li>Love these pencils very pigmented use for both my eyes and lips when I want a bold new look!!!!</li>
            <li>Colors are lovely, vibrant and true.</li>
            <li>the dark royal blue is to die for, and the sweet light pink is the best, the pencils are really long and they smell like some kind of candy or gum :D</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually kind of hard to blend which is good since that</li>
            <li>i love these they are made very well and smell nice and glide on nicely, all the colors are pretty and last the whole day.</li>
            <li>they go on so smoothly, and the colors are vibrant and true to the picture and discription!</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>shipped quickly -&lt;br /&gt;colors</li>
            <li>mistakes happen :) I am still looking for the gold eyeliner and most likely will get this brand as well</li>
            <li>These are great eyeliners, they&#x27;re soft but not too soft.</li>
            <li>The color just fades too quickly even when used with a powder to set it.  </li>
            <li>Plus the colors are bold with out being overbearing.</li>
            <li>I really like this product they glide on so easy and love the colors and received them really fast.</li>
            <li>The colors are very rich and vibrant.</li>
            <li>Not dry at all, glide on smooth, they are easy to work with, and the color is true!</li>
            <li>It just glided on so easy and the colors are also very vibrant.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very pretty, but the color does not stay.</li>
            <li>I eagerly ripped open the package, and was very pleased with the color assortment.</li>
            <li>So smooth and creamy and very pigmented!  </li>
            <li>Smooth, exact colors depicted.</li>
            <li>You can create a lot of looks and they are very pretty colors.</li>
            <li>The colors are really cool and fun to play with and when I use them I can make all sorts of shades</li>
            <li>I was searching for good quality eye pencils for so long.</li>
            <li>the colors are a nice vibrant shade and the pencil runs very smoothly over your upper and lower eye lid.</li>
            <li>The only one that I&#x27;m not so happy with is the purple one, as I wish it were bolder, but meh, it&#x27;s not really a complaint.</li>
            <li>These long pencils will last a while, and are excellent quality - not like the chalky ones you often get with inexpensive makeup lines.  </li>
            <li>Pretty!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely going to buy more!</li>
            <li>, actually, i think i like the silver better!</li>
            <li>I was so excited when i got these even though i didnt expect much!</li>
            <li>The quality is much higher than we could expect for this price!</li>
            <li>Still, these are great pencils for everyday use or if your eyes need a quick pop of color.</li>
            <li>i love the eyeliner pencils because they make my make up pop and not only that easy to put on ...</li>
            <li>The colors go on very smoothly and you only need a light hand.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone who is starting off in makeup because you get a good variety for a very decent price.</li>
            <li>they go on smoothly and are very pigmented.</li>
            <li>This does have a lot of color and goes on smoothly, but there is a smell and a fume from these that really irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li>info always available and tey got here soo fast</li>
            <li>There was a great deposit of color, then I tried the Green and then Mocha..</li>
            <li>they are fun though.</li>
            <li>but this set of eyeliners is worth the money</li>
            <li>So careful when doing business with MissPinkCat, make sure you are ok with receiving a substitute because you will be stuck with it.</li>
            <li>The colored ones have some shimmer in them, kind of makes a \\&quot;wet\\&quot; look when solid and shimmer when smudged.</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t worth it</li>
            <li>They are very pigmented and last a good amount of time</li>
            <li>nice colorful eye color pencils only thing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fresh to doing make up.</li>
            <li>I mostly wear them on my lower eyelid, and since my eyes are sensitive I took a chance</li>
            <li>I blend two colors on my bottom lush line and it looked great and last all night.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i ran test on them b4 doing this review and they are worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the price I&#x27;d say, even if I didn&#x27;t get all 8.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are plenty of different colors, for almost any kind of look you are going for.  </li>
            <li>certainly worth the money.</li>
            <li>If you do use blues, there are several variations which is nice.  </li>
            <li>These are absolutely GORGEOUS eyeliners, they&#x27;re pretty long</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using these eyeliner pencils so far.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>The package came early and I love it.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I guess they&#x27;re okay, but I wouldn&#x27;t spend any more than $5 on them.</li>
            <li>They were quick and the product was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The pencil runs dull pretty fast, but the colors are great!  </li>
            <li>The brown is decent but doesn&#x27;t show as much, I think more because of my skin complexion.</li>
            <li>they are nice soft vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>The sticks are uber long, so no matter how many times you sharpen them, it seems they never run out!</li>
            <li>This eyeliner glides right on, and smears if you well, smear it.</li>
            <li>The price is right.</li>
            <li>I put it on right before I walked out the door.</li>
            <li>price is right but the quality is mediocre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color just glides right off the pencil.</li>
            <li>their all right</li>
            <li>The dark blue is the best.</li>
            <li>These pencils glide on as smooth as melted butter and the color is vibrant.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;ll probably last a while, and glide on very easily.</li>
            <li>The pencils do not last on the lower lash line, and the colors run and smudges very easily.</li>
            <li>also it obviously smudges very easy.</li>
            <li>The pencils are highly pigmented and they are creamy and smooth</li>
            <li>I am happy regardless because all I was really after in this were the black, brown and gold, which I did end up getting.</li>
            <li>In my more mature years I keep my make up simple but my nieces are more elaborative with theirs.</li>
            <li>--I ordered the whole set; honestly I don&#x27;t care much for wild colored eyeliners</li>
            <li>The pencils aren&#x27;t exactly true to color but are very close.</li>
            <li>The eyeliner pencils are true to color and are very pigmented.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t smudge at all if I line only my top lid with a wing tip or something, but it would be better to invest in a better black pencil and buy this set just for the fun</li>
            <li>It comes out very vibrantly and it smells like bubblegum!</li>
            <li>they came in time and also not very bad price for all of these eyeliners.</li>
            <li>These pencils are very pigmented, glide on smoothly, and blend very well.  </li>
            <li>The formula is creamy enough to go on smoothly yet still gives a precise line.</li>
            <li>The green worked better than most greens that I have tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The Pink is my favorite or all time for my waterline!</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and vivid colors.</li>
            <li>I really liked most of the colors they stay on forever, although I wish the pink was a little more darker.</li>
            <li>so it glides on easily, unlike many eye liners and eye pencils out there that have hard \\&quot;lead\\&quot; that catches on the skin on my eyelids and doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>The pencil coloring of the lighter colors is very light and requires multiple applications to show up.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery..</li>
            <li>Also I got all the colors as pictured and shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>Seller shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>My 13 year old daughter likes to experiment with fun and unique make up styles.</li>
            <li>Was pleasantly surprised at the fine quality.  </li>
            <li>Overall it cheap and worth it!</li>
            <li>Also a gift for my little sister loved it</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore these eyeliners!</li>
            <li>I will buy more in the future.  </li>
            <li>my favorite color is the royal blue</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to all girls!!</li>
            <li>These came exactly as described and pictured.  </li>
            <li>I havent worn them on my eyes yet or seen how they whether in hot weather.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend these though!</li>
            <li>buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pencils don&#x27;t come in the colors exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>So the colors are really pretty.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I love just playing with it and would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>They smudge and are too soft, and don&#x27;t glide on with precision or smoothly......</li>
            <li>Almost like it got too hot.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried drawing eyeline without doing eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>Brazen colors, very adolescent, and a lot of fun.</li>
            <li>They have lasted my daughter a whole year!  </li>
            <li>they are Hot</li>
            <li>The gold adds a pretty shimmer.</li>
            <li>I would consider getting the bigger set for more colors, along with this brands eye shadows.</li>
            <li>They also smell just like paint when you first get them.</li>
            <li>and I can say they are really pretty colors</li>
            <li>They were all in tact and looked exactly like they did in the pictures.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty and I like the texrure, but the length is what gets to me.</li>
            <li>I have started using the green and purple as more of eye shadow, frankly because they just don&#x27;t have enough color in them to be a good eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I love the colors and they last until you take them off with makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Sticks well to skin highly recommend to anyone and everyone !!</li>
            <li>There is no way I would have bought all of these colors for &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; prices, and now I am able to experiment on different styles without breaking the bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipping is incredibly fast!</li>
            <li>I will definitely get more.</li>
            <li>So pretty.</li>
            <li>they are a bunch of pretty colors that go on smooothly.</li>
            <li>Good colors although they were missing the gold.</li>
            <li>The color glides right on to my eye lids with no problem, I&#x27;m not into makeup that much</li>
            <li>The pencils are long and the liners are very smooth.  </li>
            <li>and the colors are cool, you can sharpen them easily, and they are very long!</li>
            <li>Black the most important color works very well.</li>
            <li>vibrant, color that lasts, soft pencil and easily applied.</li>
            <li>So overall I say they are good pencils, especially for the price</li>
            <li>White is commonly used as liner, this would be awesome!!</li>
            <li>I really like the eyeliners very much.</li>
            <li>set is super vivid.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fade for pretty much all of the day.</li>
            <li>Granted, it was eighty degrees Fahrenheit that day, and it doesn&#x27;t get that hot here very often, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to people living in hotter climates.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never heard of this brand but the colors looked pretty and the price was reasonable</li>
            <li>Colors are very vibrant.  </li>
            <li>Yes, they have very vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>very vibrant color.</li>
            <li>They glide on amazingly easy and last all day with NO smudging for me.  </li>
            <li>All of the colours glide on easily and smoothly and the pencils are just soft enough to work well, not hard like some of the cheaper ones out there.</li>
            <li>Certain liners irritate my eyes, but these did not</li>
            <li>The black is rich and smears easily if you want a smokey eye effect.</li>
            <li>Yes, the eyeliner leads tend to smudge and smear (as the other reviewers noted), but the colors are vibrant and you don&#x27;t need a lot of pressure to get a nice line of color.</li>
            <li>Love the black and blue the most.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have with this product is that it smears easily but other than that LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I also wanted to tell you that what looks like a light brown in the picture is actually a brown shimmer.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I love this product and it got here alot faster than expected.</li>
            <li>Really draw attention to the eyes and lips.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also really creamy.</li>
            <li>But it is very smudgy, so</li>
            <li>I was very</li>
            <li>really like them..</li>
            <li>i got them fast, and i like the product.</li>
            <li>These are very pigmented, creamy(not</li>

            <li>not as expected but ok</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and can last!</li>
            <li>Haha.).</li>
            <li>I really like these</li>
            <li>and they work very well.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented, fast delivery, and</li>
            <li>So, this product was a really low-cost purchase.</li>
            <li>AND IT STAYS ON THE WHOLE DAY.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The love the pink, and the green looks amazing.</li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really creamy</li>
            <li>The Lavender really makes my brown eyes pop.</li>
            <li>but they smudge and fade fast.</li>
            <li>For the price, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li>The light blue does not either.</li>
            <li>For $6, though, I guess it isn&#x27;t too much of a loss</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>the colours are the same only 4 more added so thats a tip for you all, its worth checking out.</li>
            <li>But they show up really well</li>
            <li>I got a partial refund from the seller for the mistake which is ok with me</li>
            <li>The delivery was fast as well</li>
            <li>When I bought these I didn&#x27;t expect much.  </li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t tan so much as I burn</li>
            <li>Shipped fast, as well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like the packaging</li>
            <li>I will definitely recommend them they are fantastic.</li>
            <li>Eyeliner arrived very promptly.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s something which follows me since I was in my teen: a wounderful rose on my left shoulder.</li>
            <li>Liked these for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I would have given this item a 5 star rating, however when I use the black eyeliner it smudges very easily and ends up all around my eyes.</li>
            <li>all, this is a amazing value and product, and I am sooo excited to use the eyeliner for everyday make up, as well as events such as Halloween!</li>
            <li>The colors are nice, but not very saturated and don&#x27;t apply as smoothly as some other liners I use.</li>
            <li>Colors!&lt;br /&gt;The pencils glides on so easy and does not smudge on your eyes after a long period of wearing.</li>
            <li>Recieved a couple of days late, but other than that, I am incredibly impressed with the eyeliners.</li>
            <li>The pencils don&#x27;t really have the deep rich pigment I was looking for.</li>
            <li>had more problems with them for other items</li>
            <li>such fun colors!  </li>
            <li>When these finally came in I was so excited to start trying each color</li>
            <li>plus they are longer than most of the other pencils i have.&lt;br</li>
            <li>they were able to send it first class (regular mail) from CA to Chicago basically, quicker than my prime items that i ordered at the same time!</li>
            <li>I think its okay, but if you touch your eyes due to allergies, take precaution, unless you find yourself smearing it all over.</li>
            <li>THEY ARE VERY PIGMENTED, vibrant colors</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that they work great with a small layer of white eye liner underneath the color.</li>
            <li>I have used many brands and these last long and the colors are very vibrant!</li>
            <li>These pencils are creamy and very pigmented whether you use them on your lids or waterline, I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these eye pencils, they are very long (so they will last a long time) and the colors are vibrant and goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li>These eyeliners are high quality and the colors are really deep and rich.</li>
            <li>You usually get what you pay for but these eyeliners are amazing.</li>
            <li>Will enjoy them for a long time&lt;br /&gt;MAuzenne</li>
            <li>Never thought I would get such a good product for such a low price.</li>
            <li>They are very pigmented, the only thing is that they don&#x27;t last all day, but other than that, very nice.</li>
            <li>I applied the black on my waterline and it ended up under my eyes without me touching it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the black.</li>
            <li>i mainly wanted this set for the gold color..</li>
            <li>Vibrant colors</li>
            <li>Vibrant color.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a decent array of eyeliners at an affordable price.  </li>
            <li>Best $6 I ever spent, whether you&#x27;re a pro or a novice in the makeup game invest in these pencils you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant.  </li>
            <li>kinda figured that there was a reason for the super low price on these eyeliners, now I know the reason!</li>
            <li>Okay, I ordered these a while back but never got around to using them, I picked them up today and finally took them out of the packaging.</li>
            <li>Decent color combo.</li>
            <li>When I use the green eyeliner it really makes the color pop out :)</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for nice, fairly long lasting eyeliner, I completely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations for these eyeliners.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t always afford to get the high in liners like mac, and Dior etc.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to people like me</li>
            <li>They work just as well as any high end brand pencil.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>From all the positive reviews these pencils received I was expecting higher quality although the price was so low.</li>
            <li>other issue I&#x27;ve had is kind of the opposite.</li>
            <li>My little mushoo love his shirt that he got for a birthday gift from me when he weres it people</li>
            <li>but I really wish that the black didn&#x27;t smudge as easily.</li>
            <li>The pencils have a sharp point which makes it easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The gold and the Brown dont show, I&#x27;m like a golden Brown skin tone, but all the other colors are beautiful, I especially like the royal blue and pink.</li>
            <li>Let me begin by saying I am not affiliated with this product and this was purcahsed with my own hard earned money.</li>
            <li>These eye pencils definitely aren&#x27;t &#x27;high end makeup&#x27;, but the colors are a lot of fun.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used them much yet, but no complaints so far.  </li>
            <li>Who would have thought I could get such amazing colors for such a low price.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the product isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>Plus you can have fun with your eyes by mixing up the colors with your eyeshadow and they give your eyes that extra pop of color that you are looking for.</li>
            <li>These are fun colors for short money and they do work.</li>
            <li>I love them, would order again they do last a long time.</li>
            <li>This set is fun for just playing around with different eyeliner colors.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t get as close to the mirror as I normally do.</li>
            <li>but they last all day, I rarely touch up.</li>
            <li>The colors are not dull, and the feel is creamy.</li>
            <li>Only downside is that they smudge easily, so use a primer before and set with eyeshadow of the same color.  </li>
            <li>picture shows a light blue color, but I&#x27;d much rather have a Dark Brown over a Light Blue.</li>
            <li>The colors are very pretty and the pencils are long.  </li>
            <li>i live in AZ</li>
            <li>Normally it&#x27;s hard for me to do the top lid with liner but these pencils make it much easier for me to do.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not super easy to bend.</li>
            <li>I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 because they do smudge easily but none the less I would purchase these again.</li>
            <li>The Pencils arrived on time and are nice however the blue pencil is missing the color filling throughout</li>
            <li>She says the colors are better than what she expected for the price and last all day.</li>
            <li>this is a honest review because i have no problem saying it was crap if it was , honestly i was excepting to dislike them because i didn&#x27;t see a lot of reviews on youtube.</li>
            <li>the pencil soft well lays down on an eye contour, fine color is steady also</li>
            <li>The green, copper, and light blue have a shimmer to them (very pretty) and the rest do not.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great price &amp; the quality isn&#x27;t really that bad, but the pencils are pretty soft (they will need sharpened a lot).  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>I was not expecting a high level of quality for the price but was pleasantly surprised with these eyeliner pencils.  </li>
            <li>The colors are not vibrant and do not show up good at all, especially the purple and pink.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this set of 8 to anyone who wants a little extra fun or bold in their makeup collection.</li>
            <li>Many eyeliners just do not line well on my skin, but this one does, with very little pressure.</li>
            <li>i received three shades of green which was a bit disappointing but the liners are very good and go on smoothly..</li>
            <li>The royal blue and gold were the whole reason I ordered!</li>
            <li>I go though a lot with being an adult model!</li>
            <li>I used the blue one immediately, to enhance my blue contacts, and was pleasantly surprised to find it went on smoothly  and evenly.  </li>
            <li>Honestly not worth it even though they&#x27;re so cheap.</li>
            <li>Usually using a primer, eyeshadow on top of the liner, or a makeup setting spray will help prevent this, but I can&#x27;t seem to find a way to make these stay.</li>
            <li>They are soft and stay on the eye all day!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend these if you are interested in playing around with some colored eyeliner and do not wish to invest a lot of money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These eyeliners are better than the ones I usually get from the drug store - ie.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>but this one seems to smudge and wipe off a little bit too easily.</li>
            <li>I received a black one as a free &amp;#34;bonus gift&amp;#34; with another cosmetic purchase years ago, and was surprised that what looked like a cheap, throwaway type cosmetic, actually glided on with ease and rivaled my Urban Decay 24/7 Glide On eye pencil!</li>
            <li>my only concern is that i got a hot pink lip liner instead of the pink pearl eyeliner but other than that there great.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t buy anything but the standard brown and black pencils from Lancôme, but I decided to take a chance on these because of the brilliant colors and the reviews.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re full size, the color is vibrant, they don&#x27;t smudge and the color is long lasting.</li>
            <li>I bought two of these while visiting Mexico about a year ago because they were so cheap--about 75 cents--and was surprised to find the exact same ones here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very very good quality and long lasting because they&#x27;re bigger than your typical tiny eyeliner pencils.</li>
            <li>Other than that flaw i love all the different colors and how long the pencils are and how fast the shipment came!</li>
            <li>I tried the first pencil which was the 1015 Royal Blue on my hand which is much darker than my face because I work outside in the sun.</li>
            <li>Colors are nice, pencils are nice and soft to put on, too bad it won&#x27;t stay on!</li>
            <li>The color glides on smooth and with little effort.</li>
            <li>I just wish they had a little more stay put time I wish I knew how to make the colors last longer</li>
            <li>I love them, I didn&#x27;t even have to press hard for it to show on my eye.</li>
            <li>came quickly and work extremely well.</li>
            <li>Most eyeliner pencils are too hard for me to use and they hurt when I apply.</li>
            <li>Soft enough to really use.</li>
            <li>The pink is a lip liner, these pencils are better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>These pencils must be old.</li>
            <li>this can be easily fixed by leaving the pencils in the freezer for a couple of minutes and then sharpening them.</li>
            <li>The colored \\&quot;lead\\&quot; is soft</li>
            <li>but I like it so far.</li>
            <li>soft</li>
            <li>The product was delivered on the date promised and completely intact.</li>
            <li>The pencils were very well wrapped with a FRAGILE shipping label on it and the pencils were wrapped in bubble wrap and the envelope was made of bubble wrap as well.</li>
            <li>I am a professional visagist</li>
            <li>I have been experimenting with lots of different styles and makeup tips (thanks to Pinterest..</li>
            <li>I have used all so far and I&#x27;m just lovin&#x27; them.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes and these liners do not irritate them.</li>
            <li>The purple and gold especially are very unnoticeable.</li>
            <li>WOW you guys these eyeliners.</li>
            <li>I like soft pencils but some of the colors are soooooooooooooooo soft that you need to sharpen the tip every time you use it.</li>
            <li>The various colors make it fun for her doing makeup and trying different looks.</li>
            <li>Huge mess!</li>
            <li>These are very creamy highly pigmented eye liners, although the pink one on my set says it&#x27;s a lip liner.</li>
            <li>just proves how long it will last.</li>
            <li>If you like name-brand high quality products, like Urban Decay, etc, this might be a gamble for you.  </li>
            <li>I have had purple, violet, lighter blue, green and emerald colored eyeliners that have gone on easily and showed up well, but these did neither.</li>
            <li>A lot of the comments said that these pencils were bold, but I have to apply at least 6 layers before the colour is really noticeable.</li>
            <li>Pencils are small so you can get detailed definition.</li>
            <li>I contacted MissPinkCat to see if I could swap the silver for the pink because that was the reason why I ordered these pencils in the first place.  </li>
            <li>the way- why uses hot pink eyeliner?  </li>
            <li>I honestly wouldnt recomend this to anyone since it hasnt come in yet and its past the due date.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i normally dont tal about shiping in reviews, becasue i believe only the item is on review.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is no fading/smearing throughout the day and my eyes look just as vivid coming home from a 10-hour work day as they did when I left the house.  </li>
            <li>One major problem however is the smudging.</li>
            <li>Other reason it might because I am living in a hot city.</li>
            <li>My favorite is the black, which is dark, and</li>
            <li>The colors are not vibrant and they don&#x27;t show up very well at all.</li>
            <li>Not to mention, normally I&#x27;d end up spending as much on a single eyeliner as I did for this entire order if I bought from one of my normal beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li>So 5 stars for these little beauties, well worth it!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It has light blue, dark blue, avocado, pink, black, light brown, purple and gold.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard finding pencils that are this smooth and affordable.</li>
            <li>The colors are great but they smear really bad.</li>
            <li>waxy), long lasting and reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you barely rub your eye you have it all over.</li>
            <li>And speaking about sharpening, i have barely had to sharpen them at all.</li>
            <li>This is the reason that my Italia eyeliners continue to sit in my drawer, barely used.</li>
            <li>early big plus..</li>
            <li>They do not drag at all</li>
            <li>the green, pink, and purple are barely seen on brown skin people ( unless you add layers), and easily rubbed away in general.</li>
            <li>I was really excited for this product to arrive, only to find two of the promised colors (gold and royal blue) missing.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have problems with smudging like other customers, but the color doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours.</li>
            <li>I gave the light blue and green to a friend who is blonde and blue eyed</li>
            <li>All the other colors showed up REALLY REALLY well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would definitely purchase again, and definitely will in the near future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The gold color is decent but again not very visible.</li>
            <li>I have never tried any other eyeliner colors but black, so getting all these different colors was new and exciting.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and there&#x27;s is plenty of product to last me a long time,</li>
            <li>Not so much that it ruins the application</li>
            <li>and they last longer in general.</li>
            <li>As far as long wear?  </li>
            <li>first of all I got another green instead of gold.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the few dollars!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say I have very oily lids, but they seriously smudge so much</li>
            <li>I dont get where women were saying you have to sharpen every time you use it, they must be really pressing down to have to do it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d even be willing to purchase multiple black ones at the same time!</li>
            <li>I have pretty pale skin and the colors pop.</li>
            <li>They work much nicer than any of the other, more expensive eyeliners I have in my collection.</li>
            <li>The black was too intense for me, as well.</li>
            <li>But for less than six bucks, I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li>First up, The orange one was missing leaving me with only 7 pencils.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pink liner is actually a lip liner not an eyeliner, but as a make-up newbie, I don&#x27;t mind having a new addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have central Heterochromia, so my eyes are dark and light blue on the outside, then have these big rings of green on the inside.</li>
            <li>: Black, Light Brown, Gold, Neon Blue, Sky Blue, Green, Lavender, Rosa&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it for amateur and professional use.  </li>

            <li> This was my first set of eyeliners--ever, and I was really excited to try these because of the awesome reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They smudge very easily and if you use them they leave lines underneath your eyes and in the crease of your eye lid if you use them on the top lid.</li>
            <li> very easily glided on, love it</li>
            <li> These eyeliner pencils are of great quality, and the price is also very reasonable, also they are the length of a writing pencil</li>
            <li> I was scared at first to try a brand I had never heard of and was thinking it wouldnt be that great.</li>
            <li> Stays on pretty well and was a great price.  </li>
            <li> These are great and arrived on time and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Very smooth.</li>
            <li> And the color isn&#x27;t very smooth.</li>
            <li> Goes on very smooth</li>
            <li> The formula is nice and creamy and easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> The colors are vibrant and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, pigmented, high quality eyeliners at a price</li>
            <li> Love the colors in this set.</li>
            <li> VERY CREAMY.. GREAT QUALITY</li>
            <li> you should not try to wear them as an all day thing because they can rub off on the top of your eyelid, so just beware.</li>
            <li> The pencils are very pigmented, look good, amazing quantity and colours.</li>
            <li> My advice is shell out another couple bucks and get a some better quality eyeliner pencils.</li>

            <li> there all great vibrant colors</li>
            <li> First of all there&#x27;s two many colors that just don&#x27;t have good quality.</li>
            <li> Ok so I wanted an eyeliner that was easy to glide on and woildnt rub off on top lid when closing my eyes</li>
            <li> The eyeliner themselves went on very smooth, stayed when you want it to stay on, but was also removed easily without scrubbing.</li>
            <li> At first I really loved these pencils.</li>
            <li> This is a good set for someone who&#x27;s buying eyeliner for the first time, which I was.</li>

            <li> think this was a little too smudgey for me, but seems to be perfect for others who like that kind of look.</li>

            <li> they are easy to apply on, the colors are lovely.</li>
            <li> Although the creamy texture of the pencil does make it easy to break when sharpening (like most eye pencils)</li>

            <li> Super pigmented, really nice colors.</li>

            <li> Bright, vibrant colors with a hint of shimmer.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It however, does not stay on too well and smudges very quickly even without contact to anything.</li>

            <li> Very lovely range of colors, large, so</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are super pigmented, and go on super smooth!!</li>
            <li> They have a beautiful metallic shine to them, with the exception of the black which was a nice matte.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more natural colors, but if I use lightly and blend it still looks good.  </li>
            <li> I love that they are a full size pencil</li>
            <li> The best eyeliner pencil hands down in my opinion - I started lining my water line</li>
            <li> I love mix and matching them with bright eyeshadows for a vibrant, fun look.  </li>
            <li> The light blue is a beautiful color as is the gold.</li>
            <li> After purchasing these for the price I thought they would be cheaply made and would not go on the skin easily.</li>
            <li> I cant say enough about these the colors are just beautiful and they go on smooth and</li>
            <li> They glide on extremely smooth but this is why they smudge so easily.  </li>
            <li> The colors are so smooth &amp; easy to apply , I will return to your products again.</li>
            <li> That works just fine for me but wanted to mention it.</li>
            <li> These are some of my absolute FAVORITE eyeliners!</li>
            <li> The colors look great and are easy to apply but the only issue is that they tend to smudge.</li>
            <li> liners are also very vibrant and have a nice creamy texture.</li>
            <li> These are very much comparable to my M.A.C eye kohl!!</li>

            <li> For the set the price is low but the quality is great.</li>
            <li> These arrived well packaged, and had a fantastic array of colors.</li>
            <li> The others need to be used on the lids, because they are too light.</li>
            <li> Smooth application.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not like I was trying to get light colored eyeliner to show up on an olive complexion, not at all.</li>
            <li> Fantastic deal for the price and quality too.</li>
            <li> The pencils glide on smooth and don&#x27;t bleed.</li>
            <li> Love it, but would liked to have seen a white color :)</li>
            <li> A great product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> They glide on smoothly, and the colors are visible on the eye.  </li>
            <li> but on there own mmmm not so much primer helps</li>
            <li> This is a great set of eyeliner pencils and the value for the money can definitely not be beat.</li>
            <li> Nice product for a very inexpensive price.  </li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s like two free.</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s cheap but the liner doesn&#x27;t stay on at all.</li>
            <li> They were cheap, so I worried..</li>
            <li> The brown and purple were light.</li>
            <li> , i wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be good but was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors and easy to apply!</li>
            <li> They do smudge pretty easily (as another reviewer already mentioned) but I love the colors.</li>
            <li> Other than that the colors are as they are shown in the picture and the price is very fair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are very creamy and vivid beautiful colors.</li>
            <li> These are the first pencil liners I used...ever!!</li>
            <li> They are very nicely pigmented and they lasted all day even with me rubbing my eyes occasionally.</li>
            <li> The purchase was very worth it.</li>
            <li> Not just fun, but good quality and vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> The pigment of the liners is extremely rich and they glide on smoothly without the need to press and pull the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They go on very smooth and are fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Bigger than normal, but the tips are sharpened great!</li>

            <li> Yeah they are cheap but they are not bad.</li>
            <li> I love it, and has a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> Love the colours, they look exactly as the picture also bigger.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Comes off cleanly with minimum tug on the eye lids.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this is the color my wife liked best as well.</li>
            <li> Very creamy, they glide on very nice, and have a really nice sharp color.</li>
            <li> these pencils would be cheap and dry, but they are amazing!</li>
            <li> Very smooth application and not thin...</li>
            <li> I got this because the variety of colors specially the lavender and gold which I adore..</li>
            <li> Although  all of this is awesome it does not change the fact that it smudges easily and is very hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> Colors are bright and last all day.</li>
            <li> I use the brown liner on my eyebrows or as a lip liner, the pink one also works great on the lips.</li>
            <li> These eyeliners were a great value for the money spent.</li>
            <li> The only color is good</li>
            <li> But all in all cool colors</li>
            <li> But overall this is a good product</li>
            <li> and I can really say these are my favorite eyeliners.</li>
            <li> They Are So True To The Color</li>
            <li> but they definitely aren&#x27;t good for the waterline and</li>
            <li> They are true to the color it says.</li>
            <li> I truly loved this kit,  I use it daily .</li>
            <li> She loved the different colors</li>
            <li> i liked the array of colors, but the liners are too soft...</li>
            <li> The other colors for the most part are exactly how they appear and work amazingly, these are my favorite eyeliner pencils</li>
            <li> Love these pencils very pigmented use for both my eyes and lips when I want a bold new look!!!!</li>
            <li> Colors are lovely, vibrant and true.</li>
            <li> the dark royal blue is to die for, and the sweet light pink is the best, the pencils are really long and they smell like some kind of candy or gum :D</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually kind of hard to blend which is good since that</li>
            <li> i love these they are made very well and smell nice and glide on nicely, all the colors are pretty and last the whole day.</li>
            <li> they go on so smoothly, and the colors are vibrant and true to the picture and discription!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> shipped quickly -&lt;br /&gt;colors</li>
            <li> mistakes happen :) I am still looking for the gold eyeliner and most likely will get this brand as well</li>
            <li> These are great eyeliners, they&#x27;re soft but not too soft.</li>
            <li> The color just fades too quickly even when used with a powder to set it.  </li>
            <li> Plus the colors are bold with out being overbearing.</li>
            <li> I really like this product they glide on so easy and love the colors and received them really fast.</li>
            <li> The colors are very rich and vibrant.</li>
            <li> Not dry at all, glide on smooth, they are easy to work with, and the color is true!</li>
            <li> It just glided on so easy and the colors are also very vibrant.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very pretty, but the color does not stay.</li>
            <li> I eagerly ripped open the package, and was very pleased with the color assortment.</li>
            <li> So smooth and creamy and very pigmented!  </li>
            <li> Smooth, exact colors depicted.</li>
            <li> You can create a lot of looks and they are very pretty colors.</li>
            <li> The colors are really cool and fun to play with and when I use them I can make all sorts of shades</li>
            <li> I was searching for good quality eye pencils for so long.</li>
            <li> the colors are a nice vibrant shade and the pencil runs very smoothly over your upper and lower eye lid.</li>
            <li> The only one that I&#x27;m not so happy with is the purple one, as I wish it were bolder, but meh, it&#x27;s not really a complaint.</li>
            <li> These long pencils will last a while, and are excellent quality - not like the chalky ones you often get with inexpensive makeup lines.  </li>
            <li> Pretty!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely going to buy more!</li>
            <li> , actually, i think i like the silver better!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when i got these even though i didnt expect much!</li>
            <li> The quality is much higher than we could expect for this price!</li>
            <li> Still, these are great pencils for everyday use or if your eyes need a quick pop of color.</li>
            <li> i love the eyeliner pencils because they make my make up pop and not only that easy to put on ...</li>
            <li> The colors go on very smoothly and you only need a light hand.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone who is starting off in makeup because you get a good variety for a very decent price.</li>
            <li> they go on smoothly and are very pigmented.</li>
            <li> This does have a lot of color and goes on smoothly, but there is a smell and a fume from these that really irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li> info always available and tey got here soo fast</li>
            <li> There was a great deposit of color, then I tried the Green and then Mocha..</li>
            <li> they are fun though.</li>
            <li> but this set of eyeliners is worth the money</li>
            <li> So careful when doing business with MissPinkCat, make sure you are ok with receiving a substitute because you will be stuck with it.</li>
            <li> The colored ones have some shimmer in them, kind of makes a \\&quot;wet\\&quot; look when solid and shimmer when smudged.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t worth it</li>
            <li> They are very pigmented and last a good amount of time</li>
            <li> nice colorful eye color pencils only thing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fresh to doing make up.</li>
            <li> I mostly wear them on my lower eyelid, and since my eyes are sensitive I took a chance</li>
            <li> I blend two colors on my bottom lush line and it looked great and last all night.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i ran test on them b4 doing this review and they are worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth the price I&#x27;d say, even if I didn&#x27;t get all 8.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are plenty of different colors, for almost any kind of look you are going for.  </li>
            <li> certainly worth the money.</li>
            <li> If you do use blues, there are several variations which is nice.  </li>
            <li> These are absolutely GORGEOUS eyeliners, they&#x27;re pretty long</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using these eyeliner pencils so far.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> The package came early and I love it.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I guess they&#x27;re okay, but I wouldn&#x27;t spend any more than $5 on them.</li>
            <li> They were quick and the product was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The pencil runs dull pretty fast, but the colors are great!  </li>
            <li> The brown is decent but doesn&#x27;t show as much, I think more because of my skin complexion.</li>
            <li> they are nice soft vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> The sticks are uber long, so no matter how many times you sharpen them, it seems they never run out!</li>
            <li> This eyeliner glides right on, and smears if you well, smear it.</li>
            <li> The price is right.</li>
            <li> I put it on right before I walked out the door.</li>
            <li> price is right but the quality is mediocre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color just glides right off the pencil.</li>
            <li> their all right</li>
            <li> The dark blue is the best.</li>
            <li> These pencils glide on as smooth as melted butter and the color is vibrant.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;ll probably last a while, and glide on very easily.</li>
            <li> The pencils do not last on the lower lash line, and the colors run and smudges very easily.</li>
            <li> also it obviously smudges very easy.</li>
            <li> The pencils are highly pigmented and they are creamy and smooth</li>
            <li> I am happy regardless because all I was really after in this were the black, brown and gold, which I did end up getting.</li>
            <li> In my more mature years I keep my make up simple but my nieces are more elaborative with theirs.</li>
            <li> --I ordered the whole set; honestly I don&#x27;t care much for wild colored eyeliners</li>
            <li> The pencils aren&#x27;t exactly true to color but are very close.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner pencils are true to color and are very pigmented.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t smudge at all if I line only my top lid with a wing tip or something, but it would be better to invest in a better black pencil and buy this set just for the fun</li>
            <li> It comes out very vibrantly and it smells like bubblegum!</li>
            <li> they came in time and also not very bad price for all of these eyeliners.</li>
            <li> These pencils are very pigmented, glide on smoothly, and blend very well.  </li>
            <li> The formula is creamy enough to go on smoothly yet still gives a precise line.</li>
            <li> The green worked better than most greens that I have tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The Pink is my favorite or all time for my waterline!</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and vivid colors.</li>
            <li> I really liked most of the colors they stay on forever, although I wish the pink was a little more darker.</li>
            <li> so it glides on easily, unlike many eye liners and eye pencils out there that have hard \\&quot;lead\\&quot; that catches on the skin on my eyelids and doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> The pencil coloring of the lighter colors is very light and requires multiple applications to show up.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery..</li>
            <li> Also I got all the colors as pictured and shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> Seller shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old daughter likes to experiment with fun and unique make up styles.</li>
            <li> Was pleasantly surprised at the fine quality.  </li>
            <li> Overall it cheap and worth it!</li>
            <li> Also a gift for my little sister loved it</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore these eyeliners!</li>
            <li> I will buy more in the future.  </li>
            <li> my favorite color is the royal blue</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to all girls!!</li>
            <li> These came exactly as described and pictured.  </li>
            <li> I havent worn them on my eyes yet or seen how they whether in hot weather.  </li>
            <li> I really recommend these though!</li>
            <li> buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pencils don&#x27;t come in the colors exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> So the colors are really pretty.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I love just playing with it and would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> They smudge and are too soft, and don&#x27;t glide on with precision or smoothly......</li>
            <li> Almost like it got too hot.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried drawing eyeline without doing eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> Brazen colors, very adolescent, and a lot of fun.</li>
            <li> They have lasted my daughter a whole year!  </li>
            <li> they are Hot</li>
            <li> The gold adds a pretty shimmer.</li>
            <li> I would consider getting the bigger set for more colors, along with this brands eye shadows.</li>
            <li> They also smell just like paint when you first get them.</li>
            <li> and I can say they are really pretty colors</li>
            <li> They were all in tact and looked exactly like they did in the pictures.</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty and I like the texrure, but the length is what gets to me.</li>
            <li> I have started using the green and purple as more of eye shadow, frankly because they just don&#x27;t have enough color in them to be a good eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and they last until you take them off with makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Sticks well to skin highly recommend to anyone and everyone !!</li>
            <li> There is no way I would have bought all of these colors for &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; prices, and now I am able to experiment on different styles without breaking the bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipping is incredibly fast!</li>
            <li> I will definitely get more.</li>
            <li> So pretty.</li>
            <li> they are a bunch of pretty colors that go on smooothly.</li>
            <li> Good colors although they were missing the gold.</li>
            <li> The color glides right on to my eye lids with no problem, I&#x27;m not into makeup that much</li>
            <li> The pencils are long and the liners are very smooth.  </li>
            <li> and the colors are cool, you can sharpen them easily, and they are very long!</li>
            <li> Black the most important color works very well.</li>
            <li> vibrant, color that lasts, soft pencil and easily applied.</li>
            <li> So overall I say they are good pencils, especially for the price</li>
            <li> White is commonly used as liner, this would be awesome!!</li>
            <li> I really like the eyeliners very much.</li>
            <li> set is super vivid.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fade for pretty much all of the day.</li>
            <li> Granted, it was eighty degrees Fahrenheit that day, and it doesn&#x27;t get that hot here very often, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to people living in hotter climates.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never heard of this brand but the colors looked pretty and the price was reasonable</li>
            <li> Colors are very vibrant.  </li>
            <li> Yes, they have very vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> very vibrant color.</li>
            <li> They glide on amazingly easy and last all day with NO smudging for me.  </li>
            <li> All of the colours glide on easily and smoothly and the pencils are just soft enough to work well, not hard like some of the cheaper ones out there.</li>
            <li> Certain liners irritate my eyes, but these did not</li>
            <li> The black is rich and smears easily if you want a smokey eye effect.</li>
            <li> Yes, the eyeliner leads tend to smudge and smear (as the other reviewers noted), but the colors are vibrant and you don&#x27;t need a lot of pressure to get a nice line of color.</li>
            <li> Love the black and blue the most.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with this product is that it smears easily but other than that LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I also wanted to tell you that what looks like a light brown in the picture is actually a brown shimmer.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I love this product and it got here alot faster than expected.</li>
            <li> Really draw attention to the eyes and lips.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also really creamy.</li>
            <li> But it is very smudgy, so</li>
            <li> I was very</li>
            <li> really like them..</li>
            <li> i got them fast, and i like the product.</li>
            <li> These are very pigmented, creamy(not</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> not as expected but ok</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and can last!</li>
            <li> Haha.).</li>
            <li> I really like these</li>
            <li> and they work very well.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented, fast delivery, and</li>
            <li> So, this product was a really low-cost purchase.</li>
            <li> AND IT STAYS ON THE WHOLE DAY.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The love the pink, and the green looks amazing.</li>
            <li> Haha</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really creamy</li>
            <li> The Lavender really makes my brown eyes pop.</li>
            <li> but they smudge and fade fast.</li>
            <li> For the price, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li> The light blue does not either.</li>
            <li> For $6, though, I guess it isn&#x27;t too much of a loss</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> the colours are the same only 4 more added so thats a tip for you all, its worth checking out.</li>
            <li> But they show up really well</li>
            <li> I got a partial refund from the seller for the mistake which is ok with me</li>
            <li> The delivery was fast as well</li>
            <li> When I bought these I didn&#x27;t expect much.  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t tan so much as I burn</li>
            <li> Shipped fast, as well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like the packaging</li>
            <li> I will definitely recommend them they are fantastic.</li>
            <li> Eyeliner arrived very promptly.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s something which follows me since I was in my teen: a wounderful rose on my left shoulder.</li>
            <li> Liked these for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I would have given this item a 5 star rating, however when I use the black eyeliner it smudges very easily and ends up all around my eyes.</li>
            <li> all, this is a amazing value and product, and I am sooo excited to use the eyeliner for everyday make up, as well as events such as Halloween!</li>
            <li> The colors are nice, but not very saturated and don&#x27;t apply as smoothly as some other liners I use.</li>
            <li> Colors!&lt;br /&gt;The pencils glides on so easy and does not smudge on your eyes after a long period of wearing.</li>
            <li> Recieved a couple of days late, but other than that, I am incredibly impressed with the eyeliners.</li>
            <li> The pencils don&#x27;t really have the deep rich pigment I was looking for.</li>
            <li> had more problems with them for other items</li>
            <li> such fun colors!  </li>
            <li> When these finally came in I was so excited to start trying each color</li>
            <li> plus they are longer than most of the other pencils i have.&lt;br</li>
            <li> they were able to send it first class (regular mail) from CA to Chicago basically, quicker than my prime items that i ordered at the same time!</li>
            <li> I think its okay, but if you touch your eyes due to allergies, take precaution, unless you find yourself smearing it all over.</li>
            <li> THEY ARE VERY PIGMENTED, vibrant colors</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that they work great with a small layer of white eye liner underneath the color.</li>
            <li> I have used many brands and these last long and the colors are very vibrant!</li>
            <li> These pencils are creamy and very pigmented whether you use them on your lids or waterline, I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these eye pencils, they are very long (so they will last a long time) and the colors are vibrant and goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li> These eyeliners are high quality and the colors are really deep and rich.</li>
            <li> You usually get what you pay for but these eyeliners are amazing.</li>
            <li> Will enjoy them for a long time&lt;br /&gt;MAuzenne</li>
            <li> Never thought I would get such a good product for such a low price.</li>
            <li> They are very pigmented, the only thing is that they don&#x27;t last all day, but other than that, very nice.</li>
            <li> I applied the black on my waterline and it ended up under my eyes without me touching it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the black.</li>
            <li> i mainly wanted this set for the gold color..</li>
            <li> Vibrant colors</li>
            <li> Vibrant color.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a decent array of eyeliners at an affordable price.  </li>
            <li> Best $6 I ever spent, whether you&#x27;re a pro or a novice in the makeup game invest in these pencils you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant.  </li>
            <li> kinda figured that there was a reason for the super low price on these eyeliners, now I know the reason!</li>
            <li> Okay, I ordered these a while back but never got around to using them, I picked them up today and finally took them out of the packaging.</li>
            <li> Decent color combo.</li>
            <li> When I use the green eyeliner it really makes the color pop out :)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for nice, fairly long lasting eyeliner, I completely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for these eyeliners.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t always afford to get the high in liners like mac, and Dior etc.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to people like me</li>
            <li> They work just as well as any high end brand pencil.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> From all the positive reviews these pencils received I was expecting higher quality although the price was so low.</li>
            <li> other issue I&#x27;ve had is kind of the opposite.</li>
            <li> My little mushoo love his shirt that he got for a birthday gift from me when he weres it people</li>
            <li> but I really wish that the black didn&#x27;t smudge as easily.</li>
            <li> The pencils have a sharp point which makes it easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The gold and the Brown dont show, I&#x27;m like a golden Brown skin tone, but all the other colors are beautiful, I especially like the royal blue and pink.</li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying I am not affiliated with this product and this was purcahsed with my own hard earned money.</li>
            <li> These eye pencils definitely aren&#x27;t &#x27;high end makeup&#x27;, but the colors are a lot of fun.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them much yet, but no complaints so far.  </li>
            <li> Who would have thought I could get such amazing colors for such a low price.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the product isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li> Plus you can have fun with your eyes by mixing up the colors with your eyeshadow and they give your eyes that extra pop of color that you are looking for.</li>
            <li> These are fun colors for short money and they do work.</li>
            <li> I love them, would order again they do last a long time.</li>
            <li> This set is fun for just playing around with different eyeliner colors.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t get as close to the mirror as I normally do.</li>
            <li> but they last all day, I rarely touch up.</li>
            <li> The colors are not dull, and the feel is creamy.</li>
            <li> Only downside is that they smudge easily, so use a primer before and set with eyeshadow of the same color.  </li>
            <li> picture shows a light blue color, but I&#x27;d much rather have a Dark Brown over a Light Blue.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pretty and the pencils are long.  </li>
            <li> i live in AZ</li>
            <li> Normally it&#x27;s hard for me to do the top lid with liner but these pencils make it much easier for me to do.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not super easy to bend.</li>
            <li> I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 because they do smudge easily but none the less I would purchase these again.</li>
            <li> The Pencils arrived on time and are nice however the blue pencil is missing the color filling throughout</li>
            <li> She says the colors are better than what she expected for the price and last all day.</li>
            <li> this is a honest review because i have no problem saying it was crap if it was , honestly i was excepting to dislike them because i didn&#x27;t see a lot of reviews on youtube.</li>
            <li> the pencil soft well lays down on an eye contour, fine color is steady also</li>
            <li> The green, copper, and light blue have a shimmer to them (very pretty) and the rest do not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great price &amp; the quality isn&#x27;t really that bad, but the pencils are pretty soft (they will need sharpened a lot).  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> I was not expecting a high level of quality for the price but was pleasantly surprised with these eyeliner pencils.  </li>
            <li> The colors are not vibrant and do not show up good at all, especially the purple and pink.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this set of 8 to anyone who wants a little extra fun or bold in their makeup collection.</li>
            <li> Many eyeliners just do not line well on my skin, but this one does, with very little pressure.</li>
            <li> i received three shades of green which was a bit disappointing but the liners are very good and go on smoothly..</li>
            <li> The royal blue and gold were the whole reason I ordered!</li>
            <li> I go though a lot with being an adult model!</li>
            <li> I used the blue one immediately, to enhance my blue contacts, and was pleasantly surprised to find it went on smoothly  and evenly.  </li>
            <li> Honestly not worth it even though they&#x27;re so cheap.</li>
            <li> Usually using a primer, eyeshadow on top of the liner, or a makeup setting spray will help prevent this, but I can&#x27;t seem to find a way to make these stay.</li>
            <li> They are soft and stay on the eye all day!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these if you are interested in playing around with some colored eyeliner and do not wish to invest a lot of money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These eyeliners are better than the ones I usually get from the drug store - ie.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> but this one seems to smudge and wipe off a little bit too easily.</li>
            <li> I received a black one as a free &amp;#34;bonus gift&amp;#34; with another cosmetic purchase years ago, and was surprised that what looked like a cheap, throwaway type cosmetic, actually glided on with ease and rivaled my Urban Decay 24/7 Glide On eye pencil!</li>
            <li> my only concern is that i got a hot pink lip liner instead of the pink pearl eyeliner but other than that there great.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t buy anything but the standard brown and black pencils from Lancôme, but I decided to take a chance on these because of the brilliant colors and the reviews.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re full size, the color is vibrant, they don&#x27;t smudge and the color is long lasting.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these while visiting Mexico about a year ago because they were so cheap--about 75 cents--and was surprised to find the exact same ones here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very very good quality and long lasting because they&#x27;re bigger than your typical tiny eyeliner pencils.</li>
            <li> Other than that flaw i love all the different colors and how long the pencils are and how fast the shipment came!</li>
            <li> I tried the first pencil which was the 1015 Royal Blue on my hand which is much darker than my face because I work outside in the sun.</li>
            <li> Colors are nice, pencils are nice and soft to put on, too bad it won&#x27;t stay on!</li>
            <li> The color glides on smooth and with little effort.</li>
            <li> I just wish they had a little more stay put time I wish I knew how to make the colors last longer</li>
            <li> I love them, I didn&#x27;t even have to press hard for it to show on my eye.</li>
            <li> came quickly and work extremely well.</li>
            <li> Most eyeliner pencils are too hard for me to use and they hurt when I apply.</li>
            <li> Soft enough to really use.</li>
            <li> The pink is a lip liner, these pencils are better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> These pencils must be old.</li>
            <li> this can be easily fixed by leaving the pencils in the freezer for a couple of minutes and then sharpening them.</li>
            <li> The colored \\&quot;lead\\&quot; is soft</li>
            <li> but I like it so far.</li>
            <li> soft</li>
            <li> The product was delivered on the date promised and completely intact.</li>
            <li> The pencils were very well wrapped with a FRAGILE shipping label on it and the pencils were wrapped in bubble wrap and the envelope was made of bubble wrap as well.</li>
            <li> I am a professional visagist</li>
            <li> I have been experimenting with lots of different styles and makeup tips (thanks to Pinterest..</li>
            <li> I have used all so far and I&#x27;m just lovin&#x27; them.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes and these liners do not irritate them.</li>
            <li> The purple and gold especially are very unnoticeable.</li>
            <li> WOW you guys these eyeliners.</li>
            <li> I like soft pencils but some of the colors are soooooooooooooooo soft that you need to sharpen the tip every time you use it.</li>
            <li> The various colors make it fun for her doing makeup and trying different looks.</li>
            <li> Huge mess!</li>
            <li> These are very creamy highly pigmented eye liners, although the pink one on my set says it&#x27;s a lip liner.</li>
            <li> just proves how long it will last.</li>
            <li> If you like name-brand high quality products, like Urban Decay, etc, this might be a gamble for you.  </li>
            <li> I have had purple, violet, lighter blue, green and emerald colored eyeliners that have gone on easily and showed up well, but these did neither.</li>
            <li> A lot of the comments said that these pencils were bold, but I have to apply at least 6 layers before the colour is really noticeable.</li>
            <li> Pencils are small so you can get detailed definition.</li>
            <li> I contacted MissPinkCat to see if I could swap the silver for the pink because that was the reason why I ordered these pencils in the first place.  </li>
            <li> the way- why uses hot pink eyeliner?  </li>
            <li> I honestly wouldnt recomend this to anyone since it hasnt come in yet and its past the due date.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i normally dont tal about shiping in reviews, becasue i believe only the item is on review.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is no fading/smearing throughout the day and my eyes look just as vivid coming home from a 10-hour work day as they did when I left the house.  </li>
            <li> One major problem however is the smudging.</li>
            <li> Other reason it might because I am living in a hot city.</li>
            <li> My favorite is the black, which is dark, and</li>
            <li> The colors are not vibrant and they don&#x27;t show up very well at all.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, normally I&#x27;d end up spending as much on a single eyeliner as I did for this entire order if I bought from one of my normal beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> So 5 stars for these little beauties, well worth it!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It has light blue, dark blue, avocado, pink, black, light brown, purple and gold.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard finding pencils that are this smooth and affordable.</li>
            <li> The colors are great but they smear really bad.</li>
            <li> waxy), long lasting and reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you barely rub your eye you have it all over.</li>
            <li> And speaking about sharpening, i have barely had to sharpen them at all.</li>
            <li> This is the reason that my Italia eyeliners continue to sit in my drawer, barely used.</li>
            <li> early big plus..</li>
            <li> They do not drag at all</li>
            <li> the green, pink, and purple are barely seen on brown skin people ( unless you add layers), and easily rubbed away in general.</li>
            <li> I was really excited for this product to arrive, only to find two of the promised colors (gold and royal blue) missing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have problems with smudging like other customers, but the color doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours.</li>
            <li> I gave the light blue and green to a friend who is blonde and blue eyed</li>
            <li> All the other colors showed up REALLY REALLY well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would definitely purchase again, and definitely will in the near future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The gold color is decent but again not very visible.</li>
            <li> I have never tried any other eyeliner colors but black, so getting all these different colors was new and exciting.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and there&#x27;s is plenty of product to last me a long time,</li>
            <li> Not so much that it ruins the application</li>
            <li> and they last longer in general.</li>
            <li> As far as long wear?  </li>
            <li> first of all I got another green instead of gold.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the few dollars!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say I have very oily lids, but they seriously smudge so much</li>
            <li> I dont get where women were saying you have to sharpen every time you use it, they must be really pressing down to have to do it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d even be willing to purchase multiple black ones at the same time!</li>
            <li> I have pretty pale skin and the colors pop.</li>
            <li> They work much nicer than any of the other, more expensive eyeliners I have in my collection.</li>
            <li> The black was too intense for me, as well.</li>
            <li> But for less than six bucks, I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> First up, The orange one was missing leaving me with only 7 pencils.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pink liner is actually a lip liner not an eyeliner, but as a make-up newbie, I don&#x27;t mind having a new addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have central Heterochromia, so my eyes are dark and light blue on the outside, then have these big rings of green on the inside.</li>
            <li> : Black, Light Brown, Gold, Neon Blue, Sky Blue, Green, Lavender, Rosa&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it for amateur and professional use.  </li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about these liners because theyre super long and are a bit hard to work with.</li>
            <li> The description says that the colors are: Black, Light Brown, Gold, Royal Blue, Sky Blue, Green, Lavender, Pink Pearl&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I usually put the same color eye shadow over the liner and that makes it last much longer.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that if I wear the black on my top lid, it tends to end up on my bottom lid after a few hours, so the staying power is a little iffy.</li>
            <li> Meanwhile, the liners do not last long on the eyelid.  </li>
            <li> Pencil length as described so they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> As an eyeliner, this doesn&#x27;t last too long and ends up making me look crazyyyy.</li>
            <li> They are quite long so they should last awhile.</li>
            <li> Yes, they will last you forever (unused, they are about as long as a brand-new lead pencil).</li>
            <li> These will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> but that has such a long tip</li>
            <li> so they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Meh... not bad, but not great either.</li>
            <li> although it  does not last very long on the waterline.</li>
            <li> They are long pencils too, which means they will last me a long time, all I have to do is sharpen them.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good to use it as an eyeshadow base rather than and actual eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I searched far and wide to find a replacement once mine got down to a nub, and found that I could only order it in a multi pack set at the time</li>
            <li> However when you consider the price I think they are far above average than other eyeliners in the price range.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as long wearing as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Be waiting a long time to try this brand but never could find in stores around my area.</li>
            <li> they are long</li>
            <li> Like others have mentioned, the pink is actually a lip pencil -  </li>
            <li> Upon opening the package, I was surprised to find a few things.</li>
            <li> These are rather long</li>
            <li> I will be back, as there is only one black.</li>
            <li> and how long it stays on!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I got all 8 as described, no substitues or different colors other than the colors listed.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t stay where u put it very long</li>
            <li> These pencils are a must have for any woman that likes non dry pencils that don&#x27;t break apart in your eyelines.</li>
            <li> I have them for a long time!!</li>
            <li> Like I used the dark blue on my waterline and then the lighter blue under my waterline/bottom lash line and the colors were gone in like an hour and a half.</li>
            <li> The only colors that worked out of the 8 I received were the brown, the black and the dark blue.</li>
            <li> The only few downsides I would say is that the pencils are kinda awkwardly long</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, The black liner was a completely different brand, Nabi, which I have never heard of.</li>
            <li> Colors are not as pigmented as I hoped they do not blend well on eyelid or even look great when using as eyeliner very disappointed</li>
            <li> The eyeliners arrived with the black one crushed; tried to contact seller, but have not heard back after a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> They go on thin and do not require to press down much at all making them last a lot longer between sharpening</li>
            <li> You can easily make thin or thick lines depending on how you like your make up</li>
            <li> The color doesn&#x27;t really last very long is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> I use the black one on my waterline everyday and it is the Only liner I have found to last all day!</li>
            <li> Soft enough to use, dont have to press very hard..</li>
            <li> 2- when I swatched the colors on my hand for a second time, some of the tips of the eyeliner smudged off (just a little bit).</li>
            <li> One only needs a little.  </li>
            <li> The pencils arrived a lot sooner than I expected, but instead of the pink/rosa pencil (as advertised in the Product Desciption section), I received a silver pencil instead.  </li>
            <li> It was a fuschia pink lip liner instead of an eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I seemed to have some sort of reaction, my eyelids were pink and puffy where I had applied the liner.</li>
            <li> so I purchased this product and received it sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> They were all wrapped carefully when mailed to me, and were already sharpened.</li>
            <li> I even threw out my wet on cause</li>
            <li> Better pigment and lasts longer than more expensive brands I&#x27;ve been disappointed by in the past.</li>
            <li> They also sharpen well, granted you do have to be somewhat careful because they are the creamier type.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brown works as an eyebrow liner, and the pink works as a lip liner as well.</li>
            <li> On occasion I will line my bottom lashes with the blue or green to give a pop of color to my look, but I don&#x27;t use the other pencils.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The black is very dramatic and all the colors glide on smoothly.</li>
            <li> nearing the point where I&#x27;ll need to replace my black pencil again; hopefully this time around someone is offering only black</li>
            <li> Lots of pencils but not very useful.  </li>
            <li> The pencils are  little over 7 inches long.</li>
            <li> I like the blue, green, and black.</li>
            <li> Not good for sensitive eyes like mine.</li>
            <li> The other colors crumble when you apply it to your eye</li>
            <li> They are a lot longer than other brands-7in.  </li>
            <li> This goes along with some of my other posts.</li>
            <li> only ordered it for the Royal Blue, so I am pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> the pink lip liner!</li>
            <li> But it looks pretty weird.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer Nxy or other drug store brands over these.</li>
            <li> and I look forward to trying some of their other products.</li>
            <li> and these came out extremely well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to get the other set too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The colored liner somewhat helps keep the black from running, but not very well.</li>
            <li> This color set in particular looks very subtle.</li>
            <li> This is bs and not worth what i paid at all.</li>
            <li> I have brown eyes and dark hair</li>
            <li> They are ok for using as a base for you eye showdown</li>
            <li> The pink on my pale face doesn&#x27;t show.</li>
            <li> These pencils are a lot nicer than other dollar liners I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> There is also a black pencil.</li>
            <li> so I ordered a black separately.</li>
            <li> The brown and black do not shimmer which works for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know when I&#x27;ll ever use navy, unless my black runs out</li>
            <li> and I can set it in with black eye shadow so that it appears black.</li>
            <li> After all, if I wanted black shadows under my eyes, I would put them there intentionally.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend lining your bottom lash line with the black.</li>
            <li> I like to line my bottom line with a color, then line my water line with the black to add definition.</li>
            <li> Be adventitious and try color instead of black and brown liners...</li>
            <li> but then i realised they had the set with 12 eyeliners for some cents less than this one and</li>
            <li> I can use the black and brown</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve used brown for eyebrows too, no problem), but I typically don&#x27;t use blues.  </li>
            <li> I ended up sharing them with my daughter, giving her the black and a couple of the brighter colors I wouldn&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> And a half / two weeks though.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about ordering because i am a black girl and</li>
            <li> not necessarily the same colors pictured, and a few of them are really unnecessary --at least for me.</li>
            <li> I use the black everyday as a liner and sometimes to define my brows.  </li>
            <li> It is a little oily, but it worked for me and my eyes.</li>
            <li> This is a little advise...</li>
            <li> I have to use a lot of it for even a little effect .</li>
            <li> Applies decently possibly a little waxy.</li>
            <li> They go on dark and stay on all day!</li>
            <li> they r a little to creamy the color</li>
            <li> not many black eyeliners are dark.</li>
            <li> and I have very, very dark skin</li>
            <li> , some of the colors don&#x27;t really show up though, which is disappointing..</li>
            <li> not to heavy.</li>
            <li> After applying it and waiting a few minutes for it to set</li>
            <li> but when I got my order those colors were missing..</li>
            <li> If you have trouble finding liner that stays on, this liner is a no-go.</li>
            <li> Biggest complaint is Italia doesn&#x27;t offer just buying the black pen.</li>
            <li> I tried and was not really pleased.</li>
            <li> It hurts my eye as soon as I used :/</li>
            <li> Not sure how well they&#x27;ll be after sharpening</li>
            <li> I have noticed that a lot of the fancy brands gave terrible liners, usually too soft and you spend half your life sharpening it down to a little nub because you can&#x27;t catch up with the breakage.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately, these pencils did not live up to the expectation.</li>
            <li> The brown didn&#x27;t show up that well for me and was somewhat dull, and I am light-medium skin toned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have hooded eyes, and so I always have a hard time getting makeup to stay.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever wear any color on my face, it just doesn&#x27;t mix for whatever reason</li>
            <li> i reccomend this to anyone wanting to add color to dull stuff to bring it to life.</li>
            <li> and she said they hardly showed up on her either</li>
            <li> The pink, however, is completely useless.  </li>
            <li> but it was confusing tho</li>
            <li> I mean the Indian brown (which I am)</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with the product, the colors aren&#x27;t all professiona except maybe the black and brown.</li>
            <li> Each liner is under $1, serious quality for that price point.  </li>
            <li> GUYS SERIOUSLY IT&#x27;S $6.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only bad thing about it.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not good.</li>
            <li> Not good for a humid environment, gets everywhere, does not stay put.  </li>
            <li> Not too crazy about the other colors,</li>
            <li> I use mine at least 3-4 times before i will resharpen!</li>
            <li> They exceded my expectations to say the least!</li>
            <li> Hard to spread and the colors are weird.</li>
            <li> it took approximately 1 week for them to come in</li>
            <li> this is FALSE ADVERTISEMENT, please change that..</li>
            <li> It is also a bit of a thick pencil - like a writing pencil so it is difficult to get a very thin line if needed.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s a little annoying.</li>
            <li> They smell weird, and they go on clumpy.</li>
            <li> im kinda sad</li>
            <li> I do like these eyeliners a lot but one thing was wrong they sent me one of them used</li>
            <li> There was a faint hint of shimmer.</li>
            <li> I find it unlikely the pencils will break upon being shipped.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The darker colours are difficult to apply and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get along the lash line.</li>
            <li> Also, the pencils smell really awkward.  </li>
            <li> I was really wrong!</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong with!</li>
            <li> the majority of it comes off but it seems to always leave faded smudge marks that are impossible to get off.</li>
            <li> :(  </li>
            <li> Nonetheless, I was definitely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had to give my sister some :(</li>
            <li> I hate these.  </li>
            <li> I hate the way it feels.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, they smear very badly.</li>
            <li> 2 1/2 stars for the seller because the items did arrive swiftly, but awful on their customer service once they&#x27;ve completed an order.  </li>
            <li> its horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> items were hi quality very pleased.</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely but can&#x27;t give them a 5 because of the smear factor. They smear easily.</li>
            <li> they are easy to apply on, the colors are lovely.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore these eyeliners! They go on smooth and the colors are very nice! Not to mention, normally I&#x27;d end up spending as much on a single eyeliner as I did for this entire order if I bought from one of my normal beauty supply stores. They&#x27;re very very good quality and long lasting because they&#x27;re bigger than your typical tiny eyeliner pencils. I&#x27;m definitely going to buy these again when I run out!</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love them, The colors are beautiful, they glade on easily and stays on all day long and they don&#x27;t cause irritation. Plus you can have fun with your eyes by mixing up the colors with your eyeshadow and they give your eyes that extra pop of color that you are looking for. Please be advised that all skin tones are diffrent so the colors may show up differently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a creamy eye liner that glides on easily! My favorite is the black, which is dark, and not many black eyeliners are dark.</li>
            <li> nite good colors though</li>
            <li> Love the colors in this set. And they eyeliner is very easy to put on. Many eyeliners just do not line well on my skin, but this one does, with very little pressure. I agree with the others who said that one of these is a lip liner, but all others are eyeliners.</li>
            <li> Ok so I wanted an eyeliner that was easy to glide on and woildnt rub off on top lid when closing my eyes and I wanted some color in my life lol. Anyhow I read the reviews on these eyeliners and decided to try it. I love them, I didn&#x27;t even have to press hard for it to show on my eye. It just glided on so easy and the colors are also very vibrant. If uou order this you won&#x27;t regret it. I doubt I&#x27;ll run out anytime soon but when I do I am finding these again.</li>
            <li> It the best pencils I have ever had.so smooth and the colors are amazing.I will buy more in the future.  This is my second time buying it . It was the fastest shipment and the the best product out there</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD PENCILS!  VERY CREAMY.. GREAT QUALITY</li>
            <li> these pencils look great. you should not try to wear them as an all day thing because they can rub off on the top of your eyelid, so just beware. but the color is awesome</li>
            <li> One of the best eyeliners I have.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for....I tossed them all.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner glides right on, and smears if you well, smear it. This feature could be used to create a &amp;#34;smoky eye&amp;#34; look if you want. I also wanted to tell you that what looks like a light brown in the picture is actually a brown shimmer. Not sparkly. But a copper color without all the red. There is also a black pencil. I didn&#x27;t know that so I ordered a black separately. These eyliners would be good for a party or middle/high schooler. There is nothing wrong with the product, the colors aren&#x27;t all professiona except maybe the black and brown. they are fun though. not to heavy. i would try this. I know that i plan to re-order again and again. Good size too. Bigger than normal, but the tips are sharpened great!</li>
            <li> these pencils eyeliners are amazing they dont brake easily and there all great vibrant colors my favorite color is the royal blue but this set of eyeliners is worth the money</li>
            <li> The only color is good Is the blue.  The other colors crumble when you apply it to your eye that&#x27;s not good. These pencils must be old. I recommend NYC or NYC brand.</li>
            <li> The pencils are very pigmented, look good, amazing quantity and colours. It also is simply a great quality, and I&#x27;m glad I chose the product.</li>
            <li> great quality and bright colors</li>
            <li> this liners are very nice for the price and I would recommend them to others. glide on easy and easy to sharpen</li>
            <li> Why? Because I&#x27;ve always lived to have a tatoo, but I&#x27;m never been so brave to make it. And it&#x27;s something which follows me since I was in my teen: a wounderful rose on my left shoulder. So after ... &amp;#34;only some years&amp;#34; ... I&#x27;ve had the idea to buy these eyeliner pencils set to finally to draw by myself this rose. I know it&#x27;s not the same thing, but in this way I can have my tatoo, I can wash it and it desapears and I can draw it again without any problems!!!&lt;br /&gt;For who is like me or for who got problems with parents who refuse absolutly you have your tatoo.</li>
            <li> These pencils are very pigmented, glide on smoothly, and blend very well.  Only downside is that they smudge easily, so use a primer before and set with eyeshadow of the same color.  So 4 stars for the pencils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for a review on the seller (which I also left on their seller profile page):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered these pencils from MissPinkCat.  The pencils arrived a lot sooner than I expected, but instead of the pink/rosa pencil (as advertised in the Product Desciption section), I received a silver pencil instead.  I contacted MissPinkCat to see if I could swap the silver for the pink because that was the reason why I ordered these pencils in the first place.  It&#x27;s been well over a week and still no response from this seller.  :(  Guess I&#x27;m stuck with the silver.  2 1/2 stars for the seller because the items did arrive swiftly, but awful on their customer service once they&#x27;ve completed an order.  So careful when doing business with MissPinkCat, make sure you are ok with receiving a substitute because you will be stuck with it.</li>
            <li> Colors are lovely, vibrant and true. Easy glide on application.</li>
            <li> My niece said they went on very smooth and loved the colors!</li>
            <li> My wife is a make up artist and I bought these pencils for her, she says....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I was concerned these pencils would be cheap and dry, but they are amazing! Not dry at all, glide on smooth, they are easy to work with, and the color is true! So 5 stars for these little beauties, well worth it!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> My eyeliners are so smooth and easy to use i ordered one set and had to re-order more for my family members they kept taking mine and wondered where i found these nice eye pencils i told them and now they can get their own. I had to order another 5 sets just to stash and save for myself ...Love Love these eyepencils and the seller was great I use this seller alot and i am happy every purchase... thanks</li>
            <li> These eyeliner pencils are like the rose-art crayons of the makeup world. They smell weird, and they go on clumpy. I only use them for Halloween makeup now because I think that&#x27;s the only thing they&#x27;re suited for. My advice is shell out another couple bucks and get a some better quality eyeliner pencils.</li>
            <li> Bright pigmentation, they are basically a box of crayons for your eye.  I was hoping for more natural colors, but if I use lightly and blend it still looks good.  I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way- why uses hot pink eyeliner?  Every heard of pinkeye?  Why!!!!!</li>
            <li> Pretty! I love the variety of colors. They all apply smoothly, and stay on all day!</li>
            <li> These pencils are creamy and very pigmented whether you use them on your lids or waterline, I highly recommend them. Although the creamy texture of the pencil does make it easy to break when sharpening (like most eye pencils) this can be easily fixed by leaving the pencils in the freezer for a couple of minutes and then sharpening them.</li>
            <li> They are very pigmented, the only thing is that they don&#x27;t last all day, but other than that, very nice.</li>
            <li> the rose colored liner was smaller than all the other ones but they work really good and look awesome! The colors are unique and make your eyes stand out :)</li>
            <li> The eyeliners arrived with the black one crushed; tried to contact seller, but have not heard back after a couple of weeks.  Meanwhile, the liners do not last long on the eyelid.  When asked where product was made, seller responded that they didn&#x27;t have item with them, and did not know.  It states on the package that they are made in China.  Please beware, as China does not have the safety/health protections that the US has.  I am going to toss the eyeliners ~</li>
            <li> this is an amazing deal for 8 eyeliners! im kinda sad i didnt get a gold one. i though it said GOLD not BROWN.. smh. this is FALSE ADVERTISEMENT, please change that.. i mainly wanted this set for the gold color..</li>
            <li> i wished they would have different colors... most were good, some colors i don&#x27;t think i ever used..but good pencil.. and could even be used as lip liner...</li>
            <li> This eyeliner rocks! My most favorite ever!</li>
            <li> I have got my eyeliner sets today. Everything was perfect and the shipping was fast.&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried to see how well the makeup works, but I&#x27;m sure it will work just fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve search everywhere to find some nice eyeliner pencils for a decent price and these were the one! Nice quality and goes on great! And it arrived only three days after I order it! The only few downsides I would say is that the pencils are kinda awkwardly long and it&#x27;s not super easy to bend. But overall it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> My little mushoo love his shirt that he got for a birthday gift from me when he weres it people&lt;br /&gt; Knows that he loves his mom .</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these eyeliners! They&#x27;re full size, the color is vibrant, they don&#x27;t smudge and the color is long lasting. It doesn&#x27;t fade for pretty much all of the day. I am so happy with this product, I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I received these eye pencils as a gift from my sister and I have to say I LOVE THEM! The colors are really cool and fun to play with and when I use them I can make all sorts of shades so I end up not using any eye shadow. The colored \\&quot;lead\\&quot; is soft so it glides on easily, unlike many eye liners and eye pencils out there that have hard \\&quot;lead\\&quot; that catches on the skin on my eyelids and doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly. They are long pencils too, which means they will last me a long time, all I have to do is sharpen them. LOVE LOVE LOVE. :)</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner! All the colors are vibrant and have good staying power. It&#x27;s actually kind of hard to blend which is good since that just proves how long it will last. The brown and black do not shimmer which works for me. I don&#x27;t want shimmer in my neutral colors. I have pretty pale skin and the colors pop.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it got here alot faster than expected.The only problem I have with this product is that it smears easily but other than that LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Recieved a couple of days late, but other than that, I am incredibly impressed with the eyeliners. Very lovely range of colors, large, so they&#x27;ll probably last a while, and glide on very easily. I especially like the gold and teal. Would definitely order again!</li>
            <li> Have no problems with this eyeliner, creamy and does not irritate my eyes.  Colors are very vibrant, don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll use all of them, I&#x27;m very fair skinned, but great value for the money.</li>
            <li> This was a gift that made my mom very happy, good variety of colors, good quality, so thank you very much</li>
            <li> I was really excited for this product to arrive, only to find two of the promised colors (gold and royal blue) missing. In their place I received mocha and purple (the set already came with a brown and lavender). The royal blue and gold were the whole reason I ordered! The quality of the pencils is ok, they do smudge a bit.</li>
            <li> My co-worker was so impressed by the color and quality, I bought her some too. Colors are bright and last all day. Really draw attention to the eyes and lips. Glides on smoothly. Pencil length as described so they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Soo, I was really excited to order these pencils but unfortunately, these pencils did not live up to the expectation. The pencils do not last on the lower lash line, and the colors run and smudges very easily.</li>
            <li> Got this product in mail today and love it. The colors are amazing and they go on so smooth. I highly recommend this product to all girls!!</li>
            <li> i really love these eyeliners. they go on smoothly and are very pigmented. my only concern is that i got a hot pink lip liner instead of the pink pearl eyeliner but other than that there great.</li>
            <li> i loveeeeeeee this product ,the colors are amazing and bright and nice +it has alot of colors +great for the price..................................</li>
            <li> made a good gift and she like them</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as long wearing as I thought it would be. The color pay off it amazing I didn&#x27;t know it would be that pigmented. It&#x27;s also really creamy.</li>
            <li> Smoothest Eyeliner!!!! So pigmented! The Pink is my favorite or all time for my waterline! I love this product. It came on time. Packaging was on point which is a point!! I&#x27;m definitely going to buy more! Love love love ♥</li>
            <li> I love eye makeup and these pencils give you a good variety of colors and the quality is excellent,  recommend</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and the color are true to what you see. Awesome colors</li>
            <li> It was a fuschia pink lip liner instead of an eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the eyeliner is very good, glides on well. But it is very smudgy, so it&#x27;s good to use it as an eyeshadow base rather than and actual eyeliner.</li>
            <li> The eyeliners are packaged new and it comes before the estimate date which is always good,  but the eyeliner colors are great.  They do tend to fade a bit but I like it so far.</li>
            <li> These came exactly as described and pictured.  They are a lot longer than other brands-7in.  I haven&#x27;t used them much yet, but no complaints so far.  The colored ones have some shimmer in them, kind of makes a \\&quot;wet\\&quot; look when solid and shimmer when smudged.</li>
            <li> Great bargain, some of the colors don&#x27;t really show up though, which is disappointing..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing u to let u know how I like this item I was only suppose to receive one item and got two tried to get ahold of the seller but no response anyways I do like these eyeliners a lot but one thing was wrong they sent me one of them used and I threw them away u can&#x27;t use someone else&#x27;s eyeliner I was going to call but it wasn&#x27;t worth it but I don&#x27;t think I will be getting anything else from this seller had more problems with them for other items</li>
            <li> This set is amazingly cheap for how many you get and how good the quality is! The colors go on very smoothly and you only need a light hand. They are easy to apply and don&#x27;t crumble. They are better than any drugstore brand you would buy and significantly cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said the two issues I&#x27;ve run into is that this eyeliner smudges rather easily. After applying it and waiting a few minutes for it to set I&#x27;ve gone to curl my eyelashes and some of it has come off on the curler. Not so much that it ruins the application but this does smudge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other issue I&#x27;ve had is kind of the opposite. Come the end day when trying to wash it off (I use baby shampoo, it is cheaper and gentler on your eyes than makeup remover) the majority of it comes off but it seems to always leave faded smudge marks that are impossible to get off. Still a great value and great colors.</li>
            <li> I like how the color shows up. They&#x27;re very pretty, but the color does not stay. I applied the black on my waterline and it ended up under my eyes without me touching it.</li>
            <li> Love that I now have a color for every outfit! Great price and product very happy with the length of them and how long it stays on!</li>
            <li> Meh... not bad, but not great either. Not good for sensitive eyes like mine. I ended up giving them all away, cuz even after make up removing them, they would leave a red mark on my skin... way too gore for me :)</li>
            <li> I actually loved them. Cute colors and the price was a plus....they smell like bubble gum yumm...and also I use the brown one to contour my nose. Awesome</li>
            <li> great price, love the variety of colors</li>
            <li> The lighter colors do not apply well but the darker colors are phenomenal! Thank you! :D the price is really good though for how many there are.</li>
            <li> AWESOME SAUCE!!!! The best eyeliner pencil hands down in my opinion - I started lining my water line and this goes on so smooth, unliek the eye pencils in the 80&#x27;s... lol!</li>
            <li> I love these eyeliner pencils! They are very nicely pigmented and they lasted all day even with me rubbing my eyes occasionally. I love that they are a full size pencil and I like the color variation. I would recommend to anyone who is starting off in makeup because you get a good variety for a very decent price.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery and great product. I was very impressed!&lt;br /&gt;The liners are also very vibrant and have a nice creamy texture. They blend very nicely.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more! Love this set! I am a total makeup junkie! I go though a lot with being an adult model! I dont get where women were saying you have to sharpen every time you use it, they must be really pressing down to have to do it everytime! I use mine at least 3-4 times before i will resharpen! Perfect alone or with shadow, works well with eye primer too. perfect for smoky eyes, I love to use the purple under my eyes and the lighter blue super sexy !</li>
            <li> Goes on extremely smooth. Doesn&#x27;t smudge easily.&lt;br /&gt;They came quickly and work extremely well. Bright, vibrant colors with a hint of shimmer.</li>
            <li> I recieved my eye pencils about 2 weeks after ordering.  They are amazing.  I tried them out on the top of my hand as soon as I opened them! they are stunning!  As far as long wear?  I havent worn them on my eyes yet or seen how they whether in hot weather.  But Im completely satisfied with the quality of these pencils! they go on so smoothly, and the colors are vibrant and true to the picture and discription! I will definatley be buying these pencils again in the future and recommend them to ANYONE! such fun colors!  Cant wait to use them all!  &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> This 8 eyeliner pencil is great and cheap. It has light blue, dark blue, avocado, pink, black, light brown, purple and gold. The colors are not dull, and the feel is creamy. Buy it!</li>
            <li> I love the way they glide on. Very smooth. They are very easy to use. Love it. I order these alot</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It is everything I expected and more for a great price! The pencils are very smooth and beautiful! I definitely would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for these eyeliners. The colors are great but they smear really bad. If you barely rub your eye you have it all over. Huge mess! That&#x27;s the only bad thing about it.</li>
            <li> love love love these liner ! for one they go on smooth and creamy the pigmentation is good and the price is just right! I can&#x27;t always afford to get the high in liners like mac, and Dior etc. so these worked out perfect.</li>
            <li> These pencils are drugstore quality comparable to inexpensive brands like Wet &#x27;n Wild. From all the positive reviews these pencils received I was expecting higher quality although the price was so low. The pencil coloring of the lighter colors is very light and requires multiple applications to show up. I didn&#x27;t have problems with smudging like other customers, but the color doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours. And the color isn&#x27;t very smooth. The line of color cracks after an hour or two.</li>
            <li> Creamy, pigmented, super easy to blend.. Love them.. Although I still can&#x27;t judge if it would smudge after a while.. Will try to update</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Vibrant colors</li>
            <li> I would have given this item a 5 star rating, however when I use the black eyeliner it smudges very easily and ends up all around my eyes. The other colors for the most part are exactly how they appear and work amazingly, these are my favorite eyeliner pencils but I really wish that the black didn&#x27;t smudge as easily. I really recommend these though!</li>
            <li> Great price. Vibrant color.</li>
            <li> These apply smoothly with a nice selection of colours. It however, does not stay on too well and smudges very quickly even without contact to anything. I did not rub or touch my eyes and my eyeliner was smudging/ fading within an hour.</li>
            <li> I love the color&#x27;s they are easy to put on  and stay&#x27;s on good they work good as face paint</li>
            <li> This does have a lot of color and goes on smoothly, but there is a smell and a fume from these that really irritated my eyes. If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin or membranes, they will be great, but I shudder to think what they&#x27;re made of.</li>
            <li> I hate these.  I literally cut my eyelid trying to put the color on when they say its easy to apply.  This is bs and not worth what i paid at all.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner glides on very smoothly and I was quite surprised at how good it was considering it&#x27;s price. I think Italia is a drug-store brand as well, so I was pretty impressed by this! You do have to reapply during the day, but I have especially watery eyes and I also draw on my water line. But overall, this was a very good buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pencils don&#x27;t come in the colors exactly as pictured. I am happy regardless because all I was really after in this were the black, brown and gold, which I did end up getting. The colors I received were:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lavender&lt;br /&gt;Gold&lt;br /&gt;Dark Brown (Love!)&lt;br /&gt;Black&lt;br /&gt;Light Brown&lt;br /&gt;Pearl Pink&lt;br /&gt;Green&lt;br /&gt;Royal Blue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picture shows a light blue color, but I&#x27;d much rather have a Dark Brown over a Light Blue. Will probably buy this again in the future if I have no problems with this from here on out!</li>
            <li> At first I really loved these pencils. Yeah they are cheap but they are not bad. Then I wore the purple one and while it looked great I seemed to have some sort of reaction, my eyelids were pink and puffy where I had applied the liner. The light blue is a beautiful color as is the gold. The black is rich and smears easily if you want a smokey eye effect. The color doesn&#x27;t really last very long is my only complaint. Good for a night out but not all day wear.</li>
            <li> Be waiting a long time to try this brand but never could find in stores around my area. I love them!!</li>
            <li> This goes along with some of my other posts. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s Amazon or the retailers but they are too eager for feedback. I&#x27;d like to give the product a fair rating but since it&#x27;s still in the mail I can not. So maybe I&#x27;ll just say to Amazon and the retailers, RELAX!</li>
            <li> I finally got them (pencils)  really like them.. Soft enough to use, dont have to press very hard.. Colors are very vibrant.  Will enjoy them for a long time&lt;br /&gt;MAuzenne</li>
            <li> I love them....I can use it to replace the shadow...... Highly recommend to people like me try to get some makeup quickly and easily</li>
            <li> Smudges....pretty colors though.</li>
            <li> vibrant, color that lasts, soft pencil and easily applied. Awesome product.</li>
            <li> After purchasing these for the price I thought they would be cheaply made and would not go on the skin easily. I was really wrong! The color options are awesome and it goes on like butter! Lasts all day!</li>
            <li> I  L O V E  T H E S E  P E N C I L S</li>
            <li> Pleased with these pencils. The pigmentation is amazingly good. Only problem is that it smears. But all in all cool colors</li>
            <li> I literally use this as a lip liner because its so creamy and know it won&#x27;t smudge all over, like it does with my eyes. As an eyeliner, this doesn&#x27;t last too long and ends up making me look crazyyyy. I&#x27;m a fan of the different colors though!</li>
            <li> Would buy from seller again. The make up is pigmented good , but comes of easily and if you want it to show up good you may have to pack it on. But overall this is a good product and i just might buy from this seller again</li>
            <li> Soft enough to really use. The price is right. I&#x27;ve had better but paid way more for them. These are fun colors for short money and they do work.</li>
            <li> This product was ok, but you have to continue putting it on throughout the day. It is a little oily, but it worked for me and my eyes. If you do buy it, try to put it on with force.</li>
            <li> first of all I got another green instead of gold. 2nd of all I got 7 eyeliners and 1 lip liner and 3rd of all they are way to creamy. they should not be used at eye pencils. I put it on right before I walked out the door. As soon as I walked into my school someone asked if I had been crying, it  turns your whole under eye the color you put on. its horrible. also it obviously smudges very easy.</li>
            <li> i got them fast, and i like the product. its got cute light colors that i daily use :) i will be buying more soon</li>
            <li> These eyeliners are high quality and the colors are really deep and rich. My daughter loves them. They are quite long so they should last awhile. The price was really good and they arrived within 2 days.</li>
            <li> Very nice , my wife like is so much , it is very good and I am planning to buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have had these for a couple of months now and I can really say these are my favorite eyeliners. They are very pigmented and last a good amount of time</li>
            <li> &amp;#34; AMAZIINNGG , I lovee them the colors are amazing they are so easy to put on there soft I also use them as eyeshadow and blend in using a brush so ita like a 2 in1 product , must buy . &amp;#34; his sister.</li>
            <li> So the colors are really pretty. I bought the, for my friends and i makeup page and its really good</li>
            <li> These Eyeliners Are Amazing For The Price! They Are So True To The Color And Stay On Well. Will Definitely Buy again!</li>
            <li> What a great price for such good quality eye liner pencil. Goes on smoothly and vivid colors. I bought a set for myself, and my niece and great-niece. Everyone loves them. I am a retired aesthetician so I do know products. In my more mature years I keep my make up simple but my nieces are more elaborative with theirs. These are a hit across all 3 generations! This is a little advise...with any eye liner pencil after applying go over by blending it out a tad with a brush. Add more if you want more color but blend with brush again. Any eye liner pencil will stay on longer if blended out with brush a bit.</li>
            <li> The price made me look at them. Liked the colors. I use them a lot they go on very easy. They seem to glide on nice, removing is no problem I love them, would order again they do last a long time.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered on the date promised and completely intact. As for the product itself, I love the colors they are bright and beautiful and they go on smoothly. The pencils are  little over 7 inches long. Although  all of this is awesome it does not change the fact that it smudges easily and is very hard to wash off. (I use hydrogen peroxide since I don&#x27;t own any makeup remover) Otherwise I love just playing with it and would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I was searching for good quality eye pencils for so long. I have very sensitive eyes so I don&#x27;t buy eye makeup on just impulse. After a fair amount of research I found these Italia pencils. The quality of the pencils is amazing. These are very pigmented, creamy(not waxy), long lasting and reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;I love these pencils more than Nyx, Mac eye pencils period.</li>
            <li> nice colorful eye color pencils only thing they are long but it was nice wear it with my outfits very nice.</li>
            <li> These eyeliners arrived today....I eagerly ripped open the package, and was very pleased with the color assortment. I used the blue one immediately, to enhance my blue contacts, and was pleasantly surprised to find it went on smoothly  and evenly.  For the price, I feel I made a wise purchase.  Happy consumer!!!</li>
            <li> Delivered perfectly. They&#x27;re just ok</li>
            <li> Best eye liner I&#x27;ve ever used! Good on like butter!  And stays on well.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Does not stay on.  Smears a lot.</li>
            <li> They go on smooth and the color is vibrant and beautiful. One star off because they do tend to smudge a bit. However when you consider the price I think they are far above average than other eyeliners in the price range.</li>
            <li> They were beautiful. Look just like the pic. Waiting for more colors. White insted of one of the blues. But they were great.</li>
            <li> Very creamy, they glide on very nice, and have a really nice sharp color.</li>
            <li> These are the only eyeliners I will use now. They are nicely pigmented and smooth. I absolutely love these liners.</li>
            <li> The pencils don&#x27;t really have the deep rich pigment I was looking for. They are ok for using as a base for you eye showdown but I will not use them as eyeliner. I tried and was not really pleased. They smudge and are too soft, and don&#x27;t glide on with precision or smoothly...... I will not re purchase these pencils again</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! There were supposed to be 8 pencils, but there turned out to be 12! The colors are great too! The formula is nice and creamy and easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;I would only change 2 things. 1- I wish that I could have tracked the package. 2- when I swatched the colors on my hand for a second time, some of the tips of the eyeliner smudged off (just a little bit). Almost like it got too hot. Granted, it was eighty degrees Fahrenheit that day, and it doesn&#x27;t get that hot here very often, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to people living in hotter climates.&lt;br /&gt;Over all, this is a amazing value and product, and I am sooo excited to use the eyeliner for everyday make up, as well as events such as Halloween!</li>
            <li> I got them two days after I ordered them.I got all the colors showing and they are amazing!(: if I were to go to a store it would of cost 3 dollars for one. But I get 8 for only 6 dollars(; great deal. Definitely would recommend others to buy!</li>
            <li> not as expected but ok</li>
            <li> The description says that the colors are: Black, Light Brown, Gold, Royal Blue, Sky Blue, Green, Lavender, Pink Pearl&lt;br /&gt;The package actually contained: Black, Light Brown, Gold, Neon Blue, Sky Blue, Green, Lavender, Rosa&lt;br /&gt;I only ordered it for the Royal Blue, so I am pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> did not like the quality</li>
            <li> I love it, and has a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> I should have known better than to order these because the price was too good to be true. The colors are not vibrant and do not show up good at all, especially the purple and pink. They smudge very easily and if you use them they leave lines underneath your eyes and in the crease of your eye lid if you use them on the top lid. They are now floating around in the bottom of my makeup drawer.</li>
            <li> They tend to smear as u wear them. They are creamy and go on easy just smear easily or smudge</li>
            <li> Out of all the pencil eye liners I&#x27;ve used (except for this one unnamed brand I have the most difficult time locating based on the fact that I only know what it looks like) THIS IS THE BEST EYELINER EVER. I LOVE the black. It goes on smoothly and can last! Especially if you set it in with eye shadow. Soooooooooooo smooth! Comes off cleanly with minimum tug on the eye lids. I will be back, as there is only one black. Not too crazy about the other colors, the green, pink, and purple are barely seen on brown skin people ( unless you add layers), and easily rubbed away in general. The gold is gorgeous. I don&#x27;t know when I&#x27;ll ever use navy, unless my black runs out and I can set it in with black eye shadow so that it appears black. Using the brown sort of goes against the grain in my case, since it&#x27;s close to my complexion, I gave it to my mom, since it&#x27;ll benefit her best. I give this two thumbs, 2 big toes, and a bubble milk tea up!</li>
            <li> Great pencils go on with vividly Color and sharpen easily.  I would our purchase again. A very nice item for a gift too.</li>
            <li> This was my first set of eyeliners--ever, and I was really excited to try these because of the awesome reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this was a little too smudgey for me, but seems to be perfect for others who like that kind of look. The black was too intense for me, as well. The brown didn&#x27;t show up that well for me and was somewhat dull, and I am light-medium skin toned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the pink lip liner! All the other colors showed up REALLY REALLY well. If you&#x27;re into a bit of smudge, great pigment, and an amazing price for this set, this is the product for you!!! :)</li>
            <li> The colors aren&#x27;t as bright as I was hoping but I still really love them!</li>
            <li> Honestly not worth it even though they&#x27;re so cheap. I wouldn&#x27;t say I have very oily lids, but they seriously smudge so much I can&#x27;t be bothered to use them. I have not tried them with any primer before, so that could make a difference. Nonetheless, I was definitely disappointed.</li>
            <li> They are amazing!! the colors are a nice vibrant shade and the pencil runs very smoothly over your upper and lower eye lid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never heard of this brand but the colors looked pretty and the price was reasonable so I purchased this product and received it sooner than expected. The color glides right on to my eye lids with no problem, I&#x27;m not into makeup that much so I don&#x27;t use primers or whatever else the professionals use but I&#x27;d say it works great just the way it is.</li>
            <li> All of the colors are greatly pigmented, and they are the exact colors as shown in the pictures! Instead of a gold eyeliner, it got replaced with silver (I guess they ran out of stock), but that&#x27;s understandable, and even so, i still got all that i wanted (I probably wasn&#x27;t even going to use the gold color anyhow e.e, actually, i think i like the silver better! Haha.). The sticks are uber long, so no matter how many times you sharpen them, it seems they never run out! And speaking about sharpening, i have barely had to sharpen them at all. It&#x27;s almost as if the points never wear out (or i just don&#x27;t wear a lot of eyeliner...). They were all wrapped carefully when mailed to me, and were already sharpened. If you&#x27;re looking for nice, fairly long lasting eyeliner, I completely recommend this product. The price is VERY inexpensive too. :D</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fresh to doing make up. The first time I tried drawing eyeline without doing eyeshadow. But it looks pretty weird. Maybe I just don&#x27;t know how to do make up. But it takes me almost an hour to get rid of the colour on my eyes with eye make-up remover.</li>
            <li> I really like these and they work very well. The color choice is excellent and I highly recommend them!:) -Shari Giacoma</li>
            <li> Also a gift for my little sister loved it</li>
            <li> I brought these and my granddaughter took them all. Lol. Soooo i brought a second set. N they disappeared . Soooo im buying a third set n hiding them.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love them .! Very pigmented, fast delivery, and they work perfect as lip liners as well ! Two in one.</li>
            <li> Lots of pencils but not very useful.  Hard to spread and the colors are weird.</li>
            <li> Love the colors in this set I just wish they had a little more stay put time I wish I knew how to make the colors last longer but I would buy them again</li>
            <li> The price for these 8 pencils was a steal. I love the richness as it glides over whatever lines I am using it for on my face. In love.</li>
            <li> The colors glide on smoothly and they show up nicely on all skin shades.  I will definitely re-order. I should have ordered two sets if I had known they would be this cute</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m too impressed with these. The pigmentation is okay but they definitely aren&#x27;t good for the waterline and blendablity is so-so. For the price they&#x27;re okay but know for sure I&#x27;d prefer Nxy or other drug store brands over these.</li>
            <li> These pencils are so nice and smooth and the cools look true when I where them. I mostly wear them on my lower eyelid, and since my eyes are sensitive I took a chance an they will not disappoint.  Certain liners irritate my eyes, but these did not and they stayed on even after the gym workout.</li>
            <li> These are some of my absolute FAVORITE eyeliners! I received a black one as a free &amp;#34;bonus gift&amp;#34; with another cosmetic purchase years ago, and was surprised that what looked like a cheap, throwaway type cosmetic, actually glided on with ease and rivaled my Urban Decay 24/7 Glide On eye pencil! I searched far and wide to find a replacement once mine got down to a nub, and found that I could only order it in a multi pack set at the time--I ordered the whole set; honestly I don&#x27;t care much for wild colored eyeliners so I mainly use the black. On occasion I will line my bottom lashes with the blue or green to give a pop of color to my look, but I don&#x27;t use the other pencils.&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so performance of the pencil: I am able to line my waterline with this pencil without worry of it smudging and giving me raccoon eyes. The formula is creamy enough to go on smoothly yet still gives a precise line. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it skipping during application or drying out over time.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m nearing the point where I&#x27;ll need to replace my black pencil again; hopefully this time around someone is offering only black so I don&#x27;t end up with a second set of colors I don&#x27;t need. I&#x27;d even be willing to purchase multiple black ones at the same time!</li>
            <li> The colors are very rich and vibrant. Quick delivery. The pencils have a sharp point which makes it easy to apply. Would recommend it to anybody. Looks great on any skin complextion.</li>
            <li> What a great value.  The pencils are long and the liners are very smooth.  The pink is a lip liner, these pencils are better than I expected.  I love the colors.  I am very happy I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love these eyeliner pencils! They go on so vivid and beautiful! They are so creamy and easy to put on! I would recommend these to any beauty freaks like myself! I was so excited when i got these even though i didnt expect much! They exceded my expectations to say the least!</li>
            <li> I bought two of these while visiting Mexico about a year ago because they were so cheap--about 75 cents--and was surprised to find the exact same ones here on Amazon. I assume they are made there, as is a surprising amount of makeup. Yes, they have nice packaging. Yes, they glide on easily. Yes, they have very vibrant colors. Yes, they will last you forever (unused, they are about as long as a brand-new lead pencil). HOWEVER, they smear very badly. This is the reason that my Italia eyeliners continue to sit in my drawer, barely used. I have hooded eyes, and so I always have a hard time getting makeup to stay. Usually using a primer, eyeshadow on top of the liner, or a makeup setting spray will help prevent this, but I can&#x27;t seem to find a way to make these stay. Maybe if you don&#x27;t have hooded eyes and don&#x27;t have issues with eye makeup staying put, these eyeliners will be perfect for you! But for me the smearing is a deal-breaker. After all, if I wanted black shadows under my eyes, I would put them there intentionally.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting a high level of quality for the price but was pleasantly surprised with these eyeliner pencils.  The colors go on easy and the color is strong. There is no fading/smearing throughout the day and my eyes look just as vivid coming home from a 10-hour work day as they did when I left the house.  I love mix and matching them with bright eyeshadows for a vibrant, fun look.  They work much nicer than any of the other, more expensive eyeliners I have in my collection.</li>
            <li> These liners are fantastic. They glide on like a dream. If you&#x27;re a fan of Prestige liners, you will love this. I have noticed that a lot of the fancy brands gave terrible liners, usually too soft and you spend half your life sharpening it down to a little nub because you can&#x27;t catch up with the breakage. This will be a wonderful change for you ladies!</li>
            <li> So, this product was a really low-cost purchase. I don&#x27;t want to say cheap, because these are amazing. They glide on well and have good pigment. The only one that I&#x27;m not so happy with is the purple one, as I wish it were bolder, but meh, it&#x27;s not really a complaint. I would recommend this set of 8 to anyone who wants a little extra fun or bold in their makeup collection.</li>
            <li> Love this liner!  Very pretty and stays on great!  Pretty colors and easy to apply! There is a hint of shimmer in most colors.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE EYELINERS , THEY ARE VERY PIGMENTED, vibrant colors AND IT STAYS ON THE WHOLE DAY.&lt;br /&gt;They are very creamy and vivid beautiful colors. Very fast delivery..</li>
            <li> I love these eyeliner pencils! the dark royal blue is to die for, and the sweet light pink is the best, the pencils are really long and they smell like some kind of candy or gum :D if they make/sell another set with more colors I&#x27;m going to get it</li>
            <li> These pencils are a must have for any woman that likes non dry pencils that don&#x27;t break apart in your eyelines. They are easy to put on and the colors are beautiful. Don&#x27;t hestitate for a second to order these because you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> The colors were bright and was easily applied. I blend two colors on my bottom lush line and it looked great and last all night. Got so many compliments...I am darked skinned and the colors showed up perfectly. I use the brown liner on my eyebrows or as a lip liner, the pink one also works great on the lips.</li>
            <li> The gold and the Brown dont show, I&#x27;m like a golden Brown skin tone, but all the other colors are beautiful, I especially like the royal blue and pink. Love it.</li>
            <li> Brazen colors, very adolescent, and a lot of fun. Apply easily.</li>
            <li> It hurts my eye as soon as I used :/</li>
            <li> Good eye pencils!  They have lasted my daughter a whole year!  They go on well.</li>
            <li> When these finally came in I was so excited to start trying each color on.&lt;br /&gt;I got all 8 as described, no substitues or different colors other than the colors listed. The love the pink, and the green looks amazing. I have never tried any other eyeliner colors but black, so getting all these different colors was new and exciting. The price is unbeatable and I love it when it says free shipping! Haha&lt;br /&gt;A+++ on my end, I love them! :)</li>
            <li> Love the colours, they look exactly as the picture also bigger.&lt;br /&gt;You can blend it, its durable when you apply them.&lt;br /&gt;Shiiping info always available and tey got here soo fast&lt;br /&gt;Recomended</li>
            <li> These eyeliners go on smoothly without pulling and leave a nice blast of color. I will definitely buy them again.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s only 8 colors....they are Hot Colors!&lt;br /&gt;The pencils glides on so easy and does not smudge on your eyes after a long period of wearing.</li>
            <li> Colors are not as pigmented as I hoped they do not blend well on eyelid or even look great when using as eyeliner very disappointed</li>
            <li> they all were wonderful very soft glides well and show up great plus they are longer than most of the other pencils i have.&lt;br /&gt;All of my colors were as described and were better than the pic. It also came early big plus..&lt;br /&gt;i ran test on them b4 doing this review and they are worth it. They did not smudge easily. they all show up on my brown skin..&lt;br /&gt;LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> Wow, these are awesome. No smudging, soft when it goes on, really great eyeliner pencils. The colors are vibrant and beautiful.</li>
            <li> these are amazing, great colors greatly pigmented. although it  does not last very long on the waterline. otherwise they are a great buy. the darker colors tend to last longer then the lighter glittery shades, :D</li>
            <li> These pencils are a lot nicer than other dollar liners I&#x27;ve tried! They&#x27;re really creamy and I&#x27;m impressed by how well the colors showed up. However, they smudge easily. I don&#x27;t recommend lining your bottom lash line with the black. It WILL smudge/fade after a short amount of time. I like to line my bottom line with a color, then line my water line with the black to add definition. The colored liner somewhat helps keep the black from running, but not very well. I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t smudge at all if I line only my top lid with a wing tip or something, but it would be better to invest in a better black pencil and buy this set just for the fun colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve liked the Lavender and Gold pencils the best. The Lavender really makes my brown eyes pop. The gold adds a pretty shimmer. Also, I feel like the blue make my eyes look clearer/whiter, but that&#x27;s just me. This set is fun for just playing around with different eyeliner colors.</li>
            <li> Really love how pigmented these were and lasted all day!  I would but theses over again. Love the black and blue the most.</li>
            <li> The Pencils arrived on time and are nice however the blue pencil is missing the color filling throughout so it is a bit of a reject that made it through the QA process.  Unfortunately this is the color my wife liked best as well.</li>
            <li> Great colors , easy to use , great price the quality&lt;br /&gt;of this pencil are good and have colors diferents&lt;br /&gt;come on time and in perfect shape too</li>
            <li> I looked at the raving reviews and bought it for myself. The package was shipped fast and arrived in good condition. The quality is great too. The minute you touch the pencil u realize it is of good quality. Has a bubblegum odor to it. Definitely not revolting.&lt;br /&gt;However, this is not for brown skinned people. I mean the Indian brown (which I am) This color set in particular looks very subtle. It would look awesome on fairer people. I have to use a lot of it for even a little effect . Would definitely recommend it for my fairer friends.</li>
            <li> Liked these for everyday use. I would consider getting the bigger set for more colors, along with this brands eye shadows.</li>
            <li> These work really good for me &amp; my mom</li>
            <li> I like the variety of colors. I just wish they came with a sharpener.</li>
            <li> I needed eyeliners with softer leads, and these pencils do not disappoint. Yes, the eyeliner leads tend to smudge and smear (as the other reviewers noted), but the colors are vibrant and you don&#x27;t need a lot of pressure to get a nice line of color. I had to take a star off because the pointed tips of the pencils can break off during application (leaving a rounded tip). Still, these are great pencils for everyday use or if your eyes need a quick pop of color.</li>
            <li> these eyeliners are the best ever! I have used many brands and these last long and the colors are very vibrant!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for myself, I truly do luv them now my eyes match every outfit I have. Yeah</li>
            <li> Were a gift, she loves them</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors that will look great on everyone. Be adventitious and try color instead of black and brown liners...yes they are also included😉</li>
            <li> I cant say enough about these the colors are just beautiful and they go on smooth and they stay on they show up really good against mine and my daughters skin I am fairer than she is she got a tannish glow to her but they looked equally good on the both of us and the package came quick very satisfied</li>
            <li> These pencils are great! They work just as well as any high end brand pencil. They go on smooth, pigmented, and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I bought it to try and instead I loved it! I even threw out my wet on cause this is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I love the colors in this collection of eye pencils. They are soft and stay on the eye all day! I am super impressed.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old daughter likes to experiment with fun and unique make up styles. These, she LOVES!!! Not just fun, but good quality and vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> very vibrant color. very easily glided on, love it, i wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be good but was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I tried these eyeliners because I was told that they did not smudge. They do smudge. I should have known that they do because they glide on perfectly without any effort whatsoever. That part is nice.  If you do use these, use lots and lots and lots and lots of primer on your lower lid to keep it from running all over the place . the colors are absolutely beautiful and show up pretty much as displayed. They also smell just like paint when you first get them.</li>
            <li> It comes out very vibrantly and it smells like bubblegum!</li>
            <li> The quality of these eyeliners are really good. They good on very smooth and they stay on all day. I highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I liked these but I don&#x27;t think I look so great with them on or maybe it&#x27;s just not my style. I hardly ever wear any color on my face, it just doesn&#x27;t mix for whatever reason but I want to!! So that&#x27;s why I bought these eyeliners and I can say they are really pretty colors, they glide on very easily but they smudge and fade fast. Like I used the dark blue on my waterline and then the lighter blue under my waterline/bottom lash line and the colors were gone in like an hour and a half. So overall I say they are good pencils, especially for the price but you need to use some kind of powder or whatever to stop it from fading or smudging. Also I got all the colors as pictured and shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> not necessarily the same colors pictured, and a few of them are really unnecessary --at least for me.</li>
            <li> i love the eyeliner pencils because they make my make up pop and not only that easy to put on ...this is a honest review because i have no problem saying it was crap if it was , honestly i was excepting to dislike them because i didn&#x27;t see a lot of reviews on youtube.</li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying I am not affiliated with this product and this was purcahsed with my own hard earned money. I recieved this product about 4 days after ordering it. I was scared at first to try a brand I had never heard of and was thinking it wouldnt be that great. The pencils were very well wrapped with a FRAGILE shipping label on it and the pencils were wrapped in bubble wrap and the envelope was made of bubble wrap as well. They were all in tact and looked exactly like they did in the pictures. I am african american and I have a caramel complexion. I tried the first pencil which was the 1015 Royal Blue on my hand which is much darker than my face because I work outside in the sun. There was a great deposit of color, then I tried the Green and then Mocha..all colors showed up just like the color tab on the bottom of the liner. There was a faint hint of shimmer. I love it and I look forward to trying some of their other products. These are very much comparable to my M.A.C eye kohl!! Keep It Up!!!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE all of the bright colors hat are in this set.....LOVE that they are easily applied to the skin, without hurting you .......LOVE that they do not smudge or run throughout the day....I just love this product....thanks!</li>
            <li> The pencils are great! I am a professional visagist and I have already used all of them. The quality is much higher than we could expect for this price!</li>
            <li> These eyeliners were a great value for the money spent. Like others have mentioned, the pink is actually a lip pencil -  though I&#x27;m sure you could use it as an eyeliner. They glide on nicely and do not tug at the skin. The colors are bright and well pigmented. I would definitely recommend these if you are interested in playing around with some colored eyeliner and do not wish to invest a lot of money.</li>
            <li> its great. amazing product colors come out so bright and beautiful.vibrant colors. wonderful there big pencils. i&#x27;m definatley ordering again. i reccomend this to anyone wanting to add color to dull stuff to bring it to life.</li>
            <li> The pencils are highly pigmented and they are creamy and smooth (the best is probably the gold). The pencils aren&#x27;t exactly true to color but are very close. The variety of colors is very good. The purchase was very worth it.</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about these liners because theyre super long and are a bit hard to work with. The colors are pretty and I like the texrure, but the length is what gets to me.</li>
            <li> The pencil runs dull pretty fast, but the colors are great!  If I could find these in a crayon instead that would be awesome !</li>
            <li> For the price, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. I got what I was expecting. First of all there&#x27;s two many colors that just don&#x27;t have good quality. The pink on my pale face doesn&#x27;t show. The light blue does not either. I have started using the green and purple as more of eye shadow, frankly because they just don&#x27;t have enough color in them to be a good eyeliner. The brown is decent but doesn&#x27;t show as much, I think more because of my skin complexion. The gold color is decent but again not very visible. Black the most important color works very well. Applies decently possibly a little waxy. Biggest complaint is Italia doesn&#x27;t offer just buying the black pen. So I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again. This is a good set for someone who&#x27;s buying eyeliner for the first time, which I was.</li>
            <li> I bought this set of eyeliner pencils because they were extremely cheap and I have Amazon Prime so I figured I should go ahead and just do it because I love colored eyeliner.  The colors of nice, some of them don&#x27;t show up well though.  They smudge very easy and I find myself having to constantly look at my eyes to see if they&#x27;ve smudged on my face.  They glide on extremely smooth but this is why they smudge so easily.  Also, the pencils smell really awkward.  For $6, though, I guess it isn&#x27;t too much of a loss and I will wear them.</li>
            <li> Bought as a birthday gift, but I ended up ordering a 2nd one of these so both my daughters had a set. So many choices and the eyeliners are very good quality.</li>
            <li> These are great eyeliners! The colors look great and are easy to apply but the only issue is that they tend to smudge.</li>
            <li> Just great , I got it for my mom she was really happy with them, and the price is fantastic ... A must have!!</li>
            <li> These pencils were a Great buy!! I love the colors and they last until you take them off with makeup remover. Will be buying more if they are still available.</li>
            <li> Super pigmented, really nice colors. I have noticed that if I wear the black on my top lid, it tends to end up on my bottom lid after a few hours, so the staying power is a little iffy. But for less than six bucks, I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> Great colors that really pop!! They are true to the color it says. I cannot pick a favorite color because they are all wonderful. Very smooth application and not thin...</li>
            <li> The pencils are long, great price! The colors go on well, but it does smudge easily so if you like the perfect line this might not be for you.</li>
            <li> Very happy long lasting great even on a humid night! Sticks well to skin highly recommend to anyone and everyone !! Thumbs up</li>
            <li> These go on so smoothe and clean, come in gorgeous colors, and you get a set for a great price. I really love these pencils and think they are a great find!</li>
            <li> These eyeliners are awesome! They go on very very smooth and the color is great. They go on thin and do not require to press down much at all making them last a lot longer between sharpening and they last longer in general. For the set the price is low but the quality is great. I love these, these are the best eyeliners I have ever used! Highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> Upon opening the package, I was surprised to find a few things. First up, The orange one was missing leaving me with only 7 pencils.&lt;br /&gt;The package was shipped in bubble wrap, so I find it unlikely the pencils will break upon being shipped.&lt;br /&gt;The pencils themselves work fairly well. The caps are sturdy and protect the tip, while there&#x27;s a color code on the bottom of the pencil.&lt;br /&gt;Using 4 of them, I can say that they all seem to work fairly well. Worth the price I&#x27;d say, even if I didn&#x27;t get all 8.</li>
            <li> I have been experimenting with lots of different styles and makeup tips (thanks to Pinterest..)and this has been an amazing purchase!  There is no way I would have bought all of these colors for &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; prices, and now I am able to experiment on different styles without breaking the bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are plenty of different colors, for almost any kind of look you are going for.  Love Love Love!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely purchase again, and definitely will in the near future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hannah Booth</li>
            <li> These pencils are by far the best ones I&#x27;ve had they glide on quick and easy and easily to remove</li>
            <li> when i received my eyeliners i was 101% satisfied! they&#x27;re so pigmented and were in good condition but then i realised they had the set with 12 eyeliners for some cents less than this one and the colours are the same only 4 more added so thats a tip for you all, its worth checking out.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my sister, she loves them.&lt;br /&gt; Nice bright colors, soft texture. All colors as shown at the picture. Would buy them again.</li>
            <li> These arrived well packaged, and had a fantastic array of colors. The eyeliner themselves went on very smooth, stayed when you want it to stay on, but was also removed easily without scrubbing. They have a beautiful metallic shine to them, with the exception of the black which was a nice matte. Would definitely purchase again!!!</li>
            <li> i love these! they came in time and also not very bad price for all of these eyeliners. the colors are perfect!</li>
            <li> The pencils in this set go on softly, are nice and bright, and have a creamy texture.  The colors are great to mix and match (one color on bottom, another color on top of eyelid), and the price is unbeatable!  These long pencils will last a while, and are excellent quality - not like the chalky ones you often get with inexpensive makeup lines.  Will definitely be buying these again, and for gifts!</li>
            <li> These are beautiful colors, and they glide on so easily! They look great and stay put! I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase. The price I paid was very low compared to the quality and amount of product you get. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase! Thank you!</li>
            <li> loved, and continue buying chefgou in record time.</li>
            <li> certainly worth the money. Better pigment and lasts longer than more expensive brands I&#x27;ve been disappointed by in the past.</li>
            <li> So smooth and creamy and very pigmented!  I love the variety of colors,  perfect for any occasion. I use the black one on my waterline everyday and it is the Only liner I have found to last all day! Worth way more than they are charging!</li>
            <li> The dark blue is the best. It shows up well on the waterline. The others need to be used on the lids, because they are too light. But they show up really well</li>
            <li> I truly loved this kit,  I use it daily . The colors are so smooth &amp; easy to apply , I will return to your products again.</li>
            <li> how many colours! the ratio the price quality suits me) the pencil soft well lays down on an eye contour, fine color is steady also</li>
            <li> shipped quickly -&lt;br /&gt;colors are beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;will deff order from again.&lt;br /&gt;packaging was exceptional&lt;br /&gt;even in the heat they did not melt which was&lt;br /&gt;a worry i had.&lt;br /&gt;super super happy with order.</li>
            <li> I got this because the variety of colors specially the lavender and gold which I adore.. but when I got my order those colors were missing.. i received three shades of green which was a bit disappointing but the liners are very good and go on smoothly.. I got a partial refund from the seller for the mistake which is ok with me mistakes happen :) I am still looking for the gold eyeliner and most likely will get this brand as well</li>
            <li> I was nervous about this product initially because they were so inexpensive but I love these liners! They go on with ease and they wear well! I will definitely order them again!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Great colors. Smooth application. Color stays on. Was pleasantly surprised at the fine quality.  Pencils are small so you can get detailed definition. Great value!</li>
            <li> Was for a gift. She loved the different colors</li>
            <li> I had to give my sister some :( I loved all of them ;)</li>
            <li> These eyeliners are great! Shipping is incredibly fast! Beautiful, pigmented, high quality eyeliners at a price you can&#x27;t go wrong with! I am very pleased to be adding these wonderful eyeliners to my makeup collection. Defidently a great buy!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great colors...easy application...</li>
            <li> They were quick and the product was exactly what I was looking for. I love the variety, and the quality is amazing.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a decent array of eyeliners at an affordable price.  If you like name-brand high quality products, like Urban Decay, etc, this might be a gamble for you.  Personally, I buy my make-up at drug stores and I&#x27;m always looking for a great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These eyeliners are better than the ones I usually get from the drug store - ie. Cover Girl, ELF, Wet&#x27;n&#x27;Wild, Maybelline, NYC, etc.  They have a nice creamy consistency, not the waxy type, and glide on super easy.  They also sharpen well, granted you do have to be somewhat careful because they are the creamier type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I am completely impressed with this set.  Each liner is under $1, serious quality for that price point.  The only issue I have is with the color selection.  I can use the black and brown (I&#x27;ve used brown for eyebrows too, no problem), but I typically don&#x27;t use blues.  If you do use blues, there are several variations which is nice.  The pink, however, is completely useless.  I don&#x27;t know whose skin this shows up on.  The green worked better than most greens that I have tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would be great for a makeup artist, someone into costume or really colorful makeup, etc.</li>
            <li> These were a great deal for the price! Good colors although they were missing the gold. Bought the bigger pack as well. Would buy again if I knew the gold was back in stock.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t buy anything but the standard brown and black pencils from Lancôme, but I decided to take a chance on these because of the brilliant colors and the reviews. They are beautiful, glide on great and the colors are super rich. I love them. I just ordered a set for my step daughter because she also loves them and won&#x27;t stay out of mine. Great product!</li>
            <li> Different colors to choose from. My daughter in law likes these eye liners and it will help her with her career as a makeup artist.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my daughter for Christmas. She loved them. The price was great! The various colors make it fun for her doing makeup and trying different looks. Shipping was perfect.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these eye pencils, they are very long (so they will last a long time) and the colors are vibrant and goes on very smooth. I have used all so far and I&#x27;m just lovin&#x27; them. Best $6 I ever spent, whether you&#x27;re a pro or a novice in the makeup game invest in these pencils you won&#x27;t regret it. Seller shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> They arrived in a timely manor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is right but the quality is mediocre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great eyeliner! One major problem however is the smudging. I was using BlackHearted eyeliner I bought from HotTopic is the same thing but this one seems to smudge and wipe off a little bit too easily. Otherwise perfect product will purchase again :)</li>
            <li> 8 eyeliners for such a low price.  The colors are very pretty and the pencils are long.  Bang for your buck!</li>
            <li> These are absolutely GORGEOUS eyeliners, they&#x27;re pretty long so I&#x27;m extremely happy with that. The pigment of the liners is extremely rich and they glide on smoothly without the need to press and pull the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I am beyond in love with them! I would definitely recommend them and purchase them again. The delivery was fast as well&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU</li>
            <li> AMAZING!! Great price and they word sooo well! I love them! They go on dark and stay on all day! Can&#x27;t get better than this!</li>
            <li> This make up is a wonderful addition to my make-up collection! Glides on very smooth and beautifuly! I would deffintly buy this collection again once I run low!</li>
            <li> Great quality / design.</li>
            <li> The color just glides right off the pencil. It doesn&#x27;t hurt my waterline like most eye pencils and it has a clean finish just like gel eyeliner. This is perfect for beginners. But I think red should have been includes. Red is a must when buying an eyeliner pencil set. But over all this product is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Amazing buy for the money.  When I bought these I didn&#x27;t expect much.  You usually get what you pay for but these eyeliners are amazing.</li>
            <li> So many colors. I loved the product.</li>
            <li> These pencils are a waxier than not, and tend to get all over you eyes</li>
            <li> The product was great :) I loved everything thing about it. I will be purchasing more sometime soon . So beware</li>
            <li> I love these eyeliners.  The colors are vibrant.  They can also be used as eye shadows.  One only needs a little.  These will last a long time.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll order many more.  And the price is GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> GOOD DEAL FOR ALL THOSE COLOR  LOOK GOOD ON YOUR EYES WILL BUY SOME FOR GIFT FOR SOMEONE BUY THEM</li>
            <li> Great colors. Creamy. Glide on. Just all around great eyeliner. I want more. Easy to sharpen. Can come off easy when whipped off. They stay on unless you whip it off or cry.</li>
            <li> The colors are not vibrant and they don&#x27;t show up very well at all. I have brown eyes and dark hair but my skin is pretty fair, I don&#x27;t tan so much as I burn and I have freckles, so it&#x27;s not like I was trying to get light colored eyeliner to show up on an olive complexion, not at all. The only colors that worked out of the 8 I received were the brown, the black and the dark blue. I have had purple, violet, lighter blue, green and emerald colored eyeliners that have gone on easily and showed up well, but these did neither. I wound up giving most of them away. I gave the light blue and green to a friend who is blonde and blue eyed and she said they hardly showed up on her either so she gave them to someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kinda figured that there was a reason for the super low price on these eyeliners, now I know the reason!</li>
            <li> These are very creamy highly pigmented eye liners, although the pink one on my set says it&#x27;s a lip liner. That works just fine for me but wanted to mention it. They do not drag at all and I&#x27;m very impressed with the quality.</li>
            <li> Love the variety of colors!  Stays on pretty well and was a great price.  Shipped fast, as well.</li>
            <li> Colors are awesome. Very bright and sheek. Last on eyes....</li>
            <li> These are great eyeliners, they&#x27;re soft but not too soft. I ended up sharing them with my daughter, giving her the black and a couple of the brighter colors I wouldn&#x27;t use. Fantastic deal for the price and quality too. Very happy.</li>
            <li> Who would have thought I could get such amazing colors for such a low price. The pencils glide on smooth and don&#x27;t bleed. I love them.</li>
            <li> i liked the array of colors, but the liners are too soft... i have to sharpen them more often, like after each use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard finding pencils that are this smooth and affordable. I have the gold and purple pencils and they are awesome and pigmented. Just wish they were waterproof and they would be a staple forever. I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 because they do smudge easily but none the less I would purchase these again.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using these eyeliner pencils so far.  They come in a nice assortment of colors and they help me practice my \\&quot;makeup techniques.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> My wife loves all the colors, so she had me buy even more of them that has even more colors because she loves experimenting with colors to her eyes. She says the colors are better than what she expected for the price and last all day.</li>
            <li> These eyeliners are very creamy, pigmented and they have a very nice scent. They are a must have. Buy them!</li>
            <li> Did not come in yet. I honestly wouldnt recomend this to anyone since it hasnt come in yet and its past the due date.</li>
            <li> Pencils soft and nice to your eyes and nice pigmentation... This was so good I bought another set. I so love it. I can use it for both my eyes and lips and it compliments everything. If you want eyepencils I 100% recommend these you won&#x27;t regret buying these</li>
            <li> These eye pencils definitely aren&#x27;t &#x27;high end makeup&#x27;, but the colors are a lot of fun. Great price &amp; the quality isn&#x27;t really that bad, but the pencils are pretty soft (they will need sharpened a lot).  Totally worth the few dollars!</li>
            <li> Okay, I ordered these a while back but never got around to using them, I picked them up today and finally took them out of the packaging. I didn&#x27;t really like the packaging, it was just bubble-wrapped with two cardboard sides taped together, but the product arrived safely so that&#x27;s what counts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, The black liner was a completely different brand, Nabi, which I have never heard of. That being said it&#x27;s still a very good quality plus it&#x27;s an extra inch longer so who am I to complain? The pink liner is actually a lip liner not an eyeliner, but as a make-up newbie, I don&#x27;t mind having a new addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I got all of the colours I was supposed to and I immediately tested them on my skin, I am African-American and I have very, very dark skin and these came out extremely well. All of the colours glide on easily and smoothly and the pencils are just soft enough to work well, not hard like some of the cheaper ones out there. Each colour has a tiny bit of shimmer on them which gives them that extra pop. The trend here is to wear bright coloured eyeliner and nothing else and these will work perfectly for that. The only downside is that the brown one doesn&#x27;t show up at all on my skin tone, but I figured that was what would happen and my best friend is raving about how good it is on her (she&#x27;s lighter than me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Say: This was an awesome buy and I&#x27;d recommend them to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> beautiful colors that make your eyes look gorgeous!  I love how they make my eyes look!  So easy to apply!</li>
            <li> Best for eyeliner and lip liner</li>
            <li> Love these pencils very pigmented use for both my eyes and lips when I want a bold new look!!!! Definitely would Recommend</li>
            <li> Love it, but would liked to have seen a white color :) White is commonly used as liner, this would be awesome!! Anyways, loved the product and what u see is definetely what u get!!</li>
            <li> The color just fades too quickly even when used with a powder to set it.  It is also a bit of a thick pencil - like a writing pencil so it is difficult to get a very thin line if needed.</li>
            <li> The colors are nice, but not very saturated and don&#x27;t apply as smoothly as some other liners I use.</li>
            <li> nice i love to buy agen</li>
            <li> A great product, especially for the price. Decent color combo. I have sensitive eyes and these liners do not irritate them. Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> their all right but it was confusing tho cause it said it arrived 27 and arrive on 17. I like the colors.</li>
            <li> Wow! I&#x27;ll be honest. I didn&#x27;t read the description very good and when I got this and saw they were pencils I was a little disappointed. I&#x27;m someone that always uses Cover Girl Glimmer Stick, it feels like Chapstick and you turn the bottom as you need more, or ELF eyeliner pen but that has such a long tip it tickles my lashes I hate the way it feels. Most eyeliner pencils are too hard for me to use and they hurt when I apply. (I guess I&#x27;m just a big baby lol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are AMAZING!!!! They are the softest pencil eyeliners I have ever used. Plus the colors are bold with out being overbearing. You can easily make thin or thick lines depending on how you like your make up and there are lots of colors. My only issue is I wear glasses and without them I need to be close to the mirror. These are rather long so I can&#x27;t get as close to the mirror as I normally do. But I guess that means. I have them for a long time!!</li>
            <li> These are awesome. I&#x27;ve found that they work great with a small layer of white eye liner underneath the color. I have central Heterochromia, so my eyes are dark and light blue on the outside, then have these big rings of green on the inside. When I use the green eyeliner it really makes the color pop out :) The brown works as an eyebrow liner, and the pink works as a lip liner as well.</li>
            <li> buenas noches la compra todo fue muy rapido y sin ningun problama y en excelentes condiciones y llego a tiempo gracias</li>
            <li> my wife loves them. they are nice soft vibrant colors. they come with tip caps to protect them as well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i normally dont tal about shiping in reviews, becasue i believe only the item is on review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but they were able to send it first class (regular mail) from CA to Chicago basically, quicker than my prime items that i ordered at the same time! Very quick seller, good doing business&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so overall this item is a WIN WIN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- JRA</li>
            <li> I just got it today and tested the product. It easy to glide and creamy. The package came early and I love it. Also when I open my package I notice how the item smells sort of fruity. Overall it cheap and worth it!</li>
            <li> Smooth, exact colors depicted. Took a week And a half / two weeks though. Still worth it in my opinion, great for using together! They don&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li> Bulk buying is a great way to save money and this is an awesome brand and product. I  will definitly buy again for our school!</li>
            <li> These are the first pencil liners I used...ever!! They go on soft and the colors are great. I enjoy using them on the top lid. Normally it&#x27;s hard for me to do the top lid with liner but these pencils make it much easier for me to do. Not sure how well they&#x27;ll be after sharpening but I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll still be great. I would suggest to purchase these if you love color liners. They DID arrive on time!</li>
            <li> A lot of the comments said that these pencils were bold, but I have to apply at least 6 layers before the colour is really noticeable. The purple and gold especially are very unnoticeable. The darker colours are difficult to apply and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get along the lash line. Other than that, I guess they&#x27;re okay, but I wouldn&#x27;t spend any more than $5 on them. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I received these in the mail today...it took approximately 1 week for them to come in and I love them. The eyeliner pencils are true to color and are very pigmented. I would encourage someone to buy these and I would purchase them again.</li>
            <li> I really like this product they glide on so easy and love the colors and received them really fast. Recommend</li>
            <li> They glide on smoothly, and the colors are visible on the eye.  BUT!!! Not good for a humid environment, gets everywhere, does not stay put.  But you do get what you pay for</li>
            <li> I like it, it is beautiful.</li>
            <li> This smeared on me, when I touched it.  I think its okay, but if you touch your eyes due to allergies, take precaution, unless you find yourself smearing it all over.</li>
            <li> they r a little to creamy the color doesn&#x27;t stay where u put it very long i live in AZ and it doesn&#x27;t stand up to the AZ heat so cause it runs i&#x27;m not a fan of stinging eyes, the colors r nice and i still use them 4 highlight colors but on there own mmmm not so much primer helps</li>
            <li> I just got mine and I love how they say they on. the price is perfect. I will definitely recommend them they are fantastic.</li>
            <li> Great for the price. Goes on very smooth</li>
            <li> Very smooth application and bright colours. I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li> I love all the colors they glide on smoothly and pigmented some of them are shimmer eyeliners i like the set</li>
            <li> This is a great set of eyeliner pencils and the value for the money can definitely not be beat. They are great pencils and I love the colors, but they do smudge easily. One thing I must say is that ALL of my pencils are eyeliner pencils. In the reviews, some were saying that some of the pencils were lip liners. Well, all of mine were eyeliner pencils, as they were supposed to be and I received all the colors I was supposed to receive as well. Highly recommended for those looking for a great deal!</li>
            <li> These eyeliner pencils are of great quality, and the price is also very reasonable, also they are the length of a writing pencil so they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> i love these they are made very well and smell nice and glide on nicely, all the colors are pretty and last the whole day. I would buy these again.</li>
            <li> These are a great buy.  Nice product for a very inexpensive price.  Very happy with the items. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Never thought I would get such a good product for such a low price. Excellent! Highly recommend it for amateur and professional use.  Item arrived on time and in perfect conditions.</li>
            <li> Love the colors! They go on very smooth and are fast and easy to use. I recommend these to any make-up user!</li>
            <li> I really like the eyeliners very much. They are soft and easy to use. I will definitely get more. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love love love these eyeliners, i have never heard of this name brand of makeup, but l look forward to buying more. The color glides on smooth and with little effort. I was hesitant about ordering because i am a black girl and most colored eyeliners dont show on my skin but these do, i am very pleased!</li>
            <li> These are great and arrived on time and exactly as described. You can create a lot of looks and they are very pretty colors.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THEM THEY COME ON MORE BEAUTIFUL THEN I EXPECTED&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD REFER THIS PRODUCT TO A FRIEND&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
            <li> I was running low and ordered these based on reviews and price.  I was surprised at how wonderful they are.  I am fair skinned and the pigmentation is fantastic.  I use the black everyday as a liner and sometimes to define my brows.  They glide on amazingly easy and last all day with NO smudging for me.  I set with my eyeshadow after I apply.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> WOW you guys these eyeliners. I am a dedicated Stila Stay-All-Day user, but I wanted to mix it up with some different colours and such for a cheaper price.&lt;br /&gt;These things are like BAM. So pigmented. So pretty. The green, copper, and light blue have a shimmer to them (very pretty) and the rest do not.&lt;br /&gt;This set is super vivid. I also work in a kitchen and shave my eyebrows off to draw them, and today after a 12 hour shift of greasy sweatiness my eyebrows are still on point. Would definitely recommend. I&#x27;m going to get the other set too.&lt;br /&gt;YOU GUYS SERIOUSLY IT&#x27;S $6. That is the price of six lesser-quality drugstore pencils. So it&#x27;s like two free. And they&#x27;re all awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do it.</li>
            <li> Nice variety of colour but I will not recommend for those who have oily skin as they tend to melt during the day. Other reason it might because I am living in a hot city.</li>
            <li> For the price, these eyeliner pencils are great. They do smudge pretty easily (as another reviewer already mentioned) but I love the colors. The black is very dramatic and all the colors glide on smoothly. I would definitely recommend these.</li>
            <li> Eyeliner arrived very promptly. Unfortunately, the product isn&#x27;t great. Yes it&#x27;s cheap but the liner doesn&#x27;t stay on at all. If you have trouble finding liner that stays on, this liner is a no-go. Colors are nice, pencils are nice and soft to put on, too bad it won&#x27;t stay on!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and good product&lt;br /&gt;Thxxxx</li>
            <li> These pencils are awesome! They are very soft and there&#x27;s is plenty of product to last me a long time, the only thing that bothered me and why I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is because the color doesn&#x27;t stay all day, it can smear or just wear off so I usually put the same color eye shadow over the liner and that makes it last much longer. Other than that flaw i love all the different colors and how long the pencils are and how fast the shipment came!</li>
            <li> انها بضاعة جيدة بل ممتازة وتستحق الاقتناء&lt;br /&gt;والتجربه خير برهان فهي عندي منذ اسبوعين ولا رأيت منها الاكل خير والحمدلله على التوفيق...........اخوكم فهد</li>
            <li> Great product.  I really liked most of the colors they stay on forever, although I wish the pink was a little more darker.</li>
            <li> 👌👌👌👍👍👍&lt;br /&gt;I love these&lt;br /&gt;They are super pigmented, and go on super smooth!! And you can&#x27;t beat that price!</li>
            <li> They were cheap, so I worried.. but they last all day, I rarely touch up. and the colors are cool, you can sharpen them easily, and they are very long! I love them!</li>
            <li> These pencils glide on as smooth as melted butter and the color is vibrant. I love the color selection included in this pack.</li>
            <li> I like soft pencils but some of the colors are soooooooooooooooo soft that you need to sharpen the tip every time you use it. And that&#x27;s a little annoying. Other than that the colors are as they are shown in the picture and the price is very fair.</li>
            <li> I just got this today. I like the blue, green, and black. The brown and purple were light. Hopefully they last!</li>
            <li> they are a bunch of pretty colors that go on smooothly. easy to sharpen and it was a great price.</li>
