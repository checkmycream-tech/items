            <li>I&#x27;ll probably keep this one since you really can&#x27;t find these anywhere - and the price is AWESOME...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s seriously nice</li>
            <li>and it is also great leaves hair clean</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an great shampoo that gets your hair clean and the scalp is invigorated.</li>
            <li>and this is the most cost effective way to buy it.</li>
            <li>I love tea tree shampoo it leaves your hair with a nice smell and when using it you can feel tingling in your scalp.</li>
            <li>strongly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I tried the Lavendar Mint shampoo first, but the Tea Tree Special is the formulation that really best gives you the relaxing mint aromatherapy and the massage-like tingling of the tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>Clarifying, tingly, gets your hair extremely clean and good for dandruff.</li>
            <li>It is probably not the best shampoo for dry, damaged hair, but it certainly smells good!</li>
            <li>This is the shampoo my hair dresser recommended for my type of hair (oily and tinted) and I&#x27;ve used it for more than 20 years.</li>
            <li>Also love the feeling during and after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and it irritates her every time I use it.</li>
            <li>Be sure to review the packaging as well.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many products and this one does what i expect.</li>
            <li>So much better to buy a gallon and filling the shampoo Into the 1litr.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Have used this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>love this and anything Tea Tree</li>
            <li>I love the quality and everything about this brand.</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>This is such an excellent shampoo.  </li>
            <li>the price is loads better when you buy a gallon.</li>
            <li>I love Tea Tree shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the tea tree oil tingle.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice if a pump was included, but I was able to pick up a cheap one easily.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and is probably the best shampoo on the market.</li>
            <li>Assuming one takes 2 showers in the summer which is fairly common, a good grease cutter and conditional at night followed by this tea tree shampoo in the morning would be an excellent combo.  </li>
            <li>With this shampoo our family use it all most about eight months and feels clean and love the smell!!&lt;br /&gt;compare to the price</li>
            <li>it is easy to get 1 gallon of shampoo at a time.</li>
            <li>I am concerned about the strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li>Great product at a great price, much much more economical than the little bottles from the salon!</li>
            <li>This really is fantastic shampoo and buying in bulk saves you some coin.  </li>
            <li>(Paul Mitchell sells a double pack for a great price</li>
            <li>I use it on all clients and they enjoy the sensation this shampoo gives.</li>
            <li>Greatest shampoo ever for itchy scalp, dandruff and non-stop everyday use.</li>
            <li>It is much more economical to by the gallon then the  boutique sized bottles.</li>
            <li>the peppermint and lavendar tea tree shampoo and conditions are great and buying it this way only made sense.</li>
            <li>Second order Great Product.</li>
            <li>This is a great shampoo if you have occasional scalp itchiness.  </li>
            <li>Keeps me dandruff free.</li>
            <li>I like this product and was pleased to find it at a much more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Felt like your scalp was on fire..., in a good way (I miss the commentary on those old bottles).</li>
            <li>originally ordered the 33.8oz bottle.  </li>
            <li>I first bought this shampoo at a beauty shop because I love how it smells.  </li>
            <li>This was a economical  !</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, leave hair feeling very clean, its good for your scalp, it keeps bugs away when working outside, also gives you a clean feeling you just do not get from other shampoos.</li>
            <li>It leaves scalp feeling tingly and clean.  </li>
            <li>It looks clean, it smells clean, it is clean.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is awesome for getting my sons&#x27; thick hair clean.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is gentle yet cool and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>This is the most reasonably priced tea tree shampoo on the internet.</li>
            <li>and then I ordered my own 1 gallon bottle, and wow, it&#x27;s like sex for my scalp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feeling all clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I first experienced the thrill of this shampoo at a hair salon where across the counter prices were much higher for much smaller quantities.</li>
            <li>The smell is a great wakeup for me and it makes my face tingle every so slightly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this in my hair a few times too and it was great as well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for making this product available to me.</li>
            <li>Nice to spend the money for how big this is and get lots of it</li>
            <li>Nice big jug.  </li>
            <li>Mine was packaged extremely carefully, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>It is especially helpful during sports as it has effectively  cut out staph infections occuring during contact sports.</li>
            <li>The gallon size is nice, but I bought a smaller bottle with a pump a while ago...</li>
            <li>other then that it was good.</li>
            <li>Is that right?</li>
            <li>If you have room in your shower/bath just get the pump and it is convenient to use right from the bottle.</li>
            <li>Which is when I spotted this - and thought perfect - much less likely</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re surfing for a new shampoo, then look no further, this TEA TREE shampoo is made of pure amazing!  </li>
            <li>The first time I came across this shampoo was at the salon, The cool tingle and aroma of mint is second to none, this my favorite shampoo to-date</li>
            <li>the first time my husband used it, he converted over immediately.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my favorite shampoo - I love the smell of Tea Tree Oil and this gallon will last several years.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the real stuff!</li>
            <li>The only way they&#x27;ll ever learn to pack better is if they get feedback.</li>
            <li>I was willing to shell out more for my first small tube of this product which I used sparingly until I could find better pricing.</li>
            <li>the lid will actually break - and a MUCH better price (about $.70/</li>
            <li>A friend gifted some of his bottle to me ~4yrs ago, and finally a month ago I asked him \\&quot;what was that shampoo you gave me?\\&quot;  ...</li>
            <li>Very good product and is very inexpensive especially when you compare it to other stores.</li>
            <li>Using this every few days keeps my scalp healthy and free of flaky yuk.  </li>
            <li>Wife had this on her wish list for Christmas - it&#x27;s her absolute favorite shampoo and was literally a big surprise!</li>
            <li>I prefer this brand and never get it for a good price at the local stores in town, So I decided to save some money and purchase a larger amount to benefit from the lower cost per volume.</li>
            <li>The scent remains strong from the first day to the last - I purchased it in gallon containers before.  </li>
            <li>the Tea Tree Special smells great, tingles a little and doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out.</li>
            <li>I would say be absolutely sure you like a shampoo before you buy a gallon of it - its a long term relationship...</li>
            <li>i just fill up my smaller bottle for easy use in the shower.</li>
            <li>I would recommend a funnel for easy pouring into a smaller bottle.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Does a very job and with a mint smell.</li>
            <li>- but this stuff is so much nicer on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lid is screwtop, but doesn&#x27;t have a lot of thread, so if it&#x27;s not packaged well, leakage could be a real problem.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need much product each time</li>
            <li>But, the seller was really responsive and sent out a replacement at no cost.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>I purchased a smaller amount initially, liked it, and then purchased the gallon, and would fill up the smaller bottle as needed.  </li>
            <li>I use a funnel to fill up my original pump bottle from the salon, and this gallon will probably last me over a year.</li>
            <li>Also makes me feel good that using it on my children makes them less likely to carry lice home should a child at school expose them.</li>
            <li>The idea of buying this much and saving 40% from the smaller bottle size was appealing, but only washing my hair twice a week means that I won&#x27;t have to buy shampoo for 5-6 years.  </li>
            <li>This shipment was carefully wrapped and arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li>so I am careful about using products with strong scents.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and have introduced it to my family and grandchildren, who also agree.</li>
            <li>The few minutes of it sitting creates a cool, relaxing sensation which is great for a tense neck and shoulder.</li>
            <li>The gallon size is FAR more economical over the long run (compared to several smaller bottles.)  </li>
            <li>It has been marketed in the U.S. under various labels but, this is my first choice for hair and scalp cleaning and sterilization.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for several years now, and it still works as well today as it did when I first started using it.</li>
            <li>First, the quantity will last you FOREVER.  </li>
            <li>Wow I&#x27;m literally using it for almost a year I think.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>I wash my hair every day and this gallon of shampoo lasts nearly a year.  </li>
            <li>I am sensitive to scents in lotions and soap</li>
            <li>Reminds me of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s old Peppermint soap that I used to use when back-packing.</li>
            <li>, I have sensitive scalp and this shampoo works well with no iirritaions.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend has used it for years &amp; when he stopped he suddenly developed dandruff...</li>
            <li>it is a quite a big case with high quality.!</li>
            <li>I have itchy scalp, so far this shampoo helps, but not to a point that it eliminates the itchiness completely.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 15 years for not only shampoo but body wash and this is the right size to buy it in verses the tiny bottles at Ulta.  </li>
            <li>Not because I&#x27;m gross and never shower, but because the product is high quality</li>
            <li>It seems expensive however buying a gallon is more cost effective than over spending locally for the small bottle.</li>
            <li>First thing in the shower, I spread some of the lather from my head down onto my neck and shoulders, then let it sit while I take care of everything else.</li>
            <li>Tea Tree oil has been used for centuries by aboriginies of Australia and New Zealand for its natural antiseptic qualities as well as other medicinal purposes.</li>
            <li>why make me write more than I want to, this is a waste of my time and now is a waste of everyone&#x27;s time to read???</li>
            <li>the actual pump top was broken.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so much cheaper than buying those little bottles.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> strongly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I tried the Lavendar Mint shampoo first, but the Tea Tree Special is the formulation that really best gives you the relaxing mint aromatherapy and the massage-like tingling of the tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> Clarifying, tingly, gets your hair extremely clean and good for dandruff.</li>
            <li> It is probably not the best shampoo for dry, damaged hair, but it certainly smells good!</li>
            <li> This is the shampoo my hair dresser recommended for my type of hair (oily and tinted) and I&#x27;ve used it for more than 20 years.</li>
            <li> Also love the feeling during and after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and it irritates her every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Be sure to review the packaging as well.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many products and this one does what i expect.</li>
            <li> So much better to buy a gallon and filling the shampoo Into the 1litr.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Have used this product for many years.  </li>
            <li> love this and anything Tea Tree</li>
            <li> I love the quality and everything about this brand.</li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> This is such an excellent shampoo.  </li>
            <li> the price is loads better when you buy a gallon.</li>
            <li> I love Tea Tree shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love the tea tree oil tingle.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice if a pump was included, but I was able to pick up a cheap one easily.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and is probably the best shampoo on the market.</li>
            <li> Assuming one takes 2 showers in the summer which is fairly common, a good grease cutter and conditional at night followed by this tea tree shampoo in the morning would be an excellent combo.  </li>
            <li> With this shampoo our family use it all most about eight months and feels clean and love the smell!!&lt;br /&gt;compare to the price</li>
            <li> it is easy to get 1 gallon of shampoo at a time.</li>
            <li> I am concerned about the strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price, much much more economical than the little bottles from the salon!</li>
            <li> This really is fantastic shampoo and buying in bulk saves you some coin.  </li>
            <li> (Paul Mitchell sells a double pack for a great price</li>
            <li> I use it on all clients and they enjoy the sensation this shampoo gives.</li>
            <li> Greatest shampoo ever for itchy scalp, dandruff and non-stop everyday use.</li>
            <li> It is much more economical to by the gallon then the  boutique sized bottles.</li>
            <li> the peppermint and lavendar tea tree shampoo and conditions are great and buying it this way only made sense.</li>
            <li> Second order Great Product.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo if you have occasional scalp itchiness.  </li>
            <li> Keeps me dandruff free.</li>
            <li> I like this product and was pleased to find it at a much more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Felt like your scalp was on fire..., in a good way (I miss the commentary on those old bottles).</li>
            <li> originally ordered the 33.8oz bottle.  </li>
            <li> I first bought this shampoo at a beauty shop because I love how it smells.  </li>
            <li> This was a economical  !</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, leave hair feeling very clean, its good for your scalp, it keeps bugs away when working outside, also gives you a clean feeling you just do not get from other shampoos.</li>
            <li> It leaves scalp feeling tingly and clean.  </li>
            <li> It looks clean, it smells clean, it is clean.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is awesome for getting my sons&#x27; thick hair clean.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is gentle yet cool and refreshing.  </li>
            <li> This is the most reasonably priced tea tree shampoo on the internet.</li>
            <li> and then I ordered my own 1 gallon bottle, and wow, it&#x27;s like sex for my scalp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feeling all clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I first experienced the thrill of this shampoo at a hair salon where across the counter prices were much higher for much smaller quantities.</li>
            <li> The smell is a great wakeup for me and it makes my face tingle every so slightly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this in my hair a few times too and it was great as well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for making this product available to me.</li>
            <li> Nice to spend the money for how big this is and get lots of it</li>
            <li> Nice big jug.  </li>
            <li> Mine was packaged extremely carefully, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> It is especially helpful during sports as it has effectively  cut out staph infections occuring during contact sports.</li>
            <li> The gallon size is nice, but I bought a smaller bottle with a pump a while ago...</li>
            <li> other then that it was good.</li>
            <li> Is that right?</li>
            <li> If you have room in your shower/bath just get the pump and it is convenient to use right from the bottle.</li>
            <li> Which is when I spotted this - and thought perfect - much less likely</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re surfing for a new shampoo, then look no further, this TEA TREE shampoo is made of pure amazing!  </li>
            <li> The first time I came across this shampoo was at the salon, The cool tingle and aroma of mint is second to none, this my favorite shampoo to-date</li>
            <li> the first time my husband used it, he converted over immediately.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo - I love the smell of Tea Tree Oil and this gallon will last several years.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the real stuff!</li>
            <li> The only way they&#x27;ll ever learn to pack better is if they get feedback.</li>
            <li> I was willing to shell out more for my first small tube of this product which I used sparingly until I could find better pricing.</li>
            <li> the lid will actually break - and a MUCH better price (about $.70/</li>
            <li> A friend gifted some of his bottle to me ~4yrs ago, and finally a month ago I asked him \\&quot;what was that shampoo you gave me?\\&quot;  ...</li>
            <li> Very good product and is very inexpensive especially when you compare it to other stores.</li>
            <li> Using this every few days keeps my scalp healthy and free of flaky yuk.  </li>
            <li> Wife had this on her wish list for Christmas - it&#x27;s her absolute favorite shampoo and was literally a big surprise!</li>
            <li> I prefer this brand and never get it for a good price at the local stores in town, So I decided to save some money and purchase a larger amount to benefit from the lower cost per volume.</li>
            <li> The scent remains strong from the first day to the last - I purchased it in gallon containers before.  </li>
            <li> the Tea Tree Special smells great, tingles a little and doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> I would say be absolutely sure you like a shampoo before you buy a gallon of it - its a long term relationship...</li>
            <li> i just fill up my smaller bottle for easy use in the shower.</li>
            <li> I would recommend a funnel for easy pouring into a smaller bottle.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Does a very job and with a mint smell.</li>
            <li> - but this stuff is so much nicer on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lid is screwtop, but doesn&#x27;t have a lot of thread, so if it&#x27;s not packaged well, leakage could be a real problem.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t need much product each time</li>
            <li> But, the seller was really responsive and sent out a replacement at no cost.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I purchased a smaller amount initially, liked it, and then purchased the gallon, and would fill up the smaller bottle as needed.  </li>
            <li> I use a funnel to fill up my original pump bottle from the salon, and this gallon will probably last me over a year.</li>
            <li> Also makes me feel good that using it on my children makes them less likely to carry lice home should a child at school expose them.</li>
            <li> The idea of buying this much and saving 40% from the smaller bottle size was appealing, but only washing my hair twice a week means that I won&#x27;t have to buy shampoo for 5-6 years.  </li>
            <li> This shipment was carefully wrapped and arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li> so I am careful about using products with strong scents.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and have introduced it to my family and grandchildren, who also agree.</li>
            <li> The few minutes of it sitting creates a cool, relaxing sensation which is great for a tense neck and shoulder.</li>
            <li> The gallon size is FAR more economical over the long run (compared to several smaller bottles.)  </li>
            <li> It has been marketed in the U.S. under various labels but, this is my first choice for hair and scalp cleaning and sterilization.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years now, and it still works as well today as it did when I first started using it.</li>
            <li> First, the quantity will last you FOREVER.  </li>
            <li> Wow I&#x27;m literally using it for almost a year I think.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hair every day and this gallon of shampoo lasts nearly a year.  </li>
            <li> I am sensitive to scents in lotions and soap</li>
            <li> Reminds me of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s old Peppermint soap that I used to use when back-packing.</li>
            <li> , I have sensitive scalp and this shampoo works well with no iirritaions.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has used it for years &amp; when he stopped he suddenly developed dandruff...</li>
            <li> it is a quite a big case with high quality.!</li>
            <li> I have itchy scalp, so far this shampoo helps, but not to a point that it eliminates the itchiness completely.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 15 years for not only shampoo but body wash and this is the right size to buy it in verses the tiny bottles at Ulta.  </li>
            <li> Not because I&#x27;m gross and never shower, but because the product is high quality</li>
            <li> It seems expensive however buying a gallon is more cost effective than over spending locally for the small bottle.</li>
            <li> First thing in the shower, I spread some of the lather from my head down onto my neck and shoulders, then let it sit while I take care of everything else.</li>
            <li> Tea Tree oil has been used for centuries by aboriginies of Australia and New Zealand for its natural antiseptic qualities as well as other medicinal purposes.</li>
            <li> why make me write more than I want to, this is a waste of my time and now is a waste of everyone&#x27;s time to read???</li>
            <li> the actual pump top was broken.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so much cheaper than buying those little bottles.  </li>
            <li> the lids on these specific items are clearly not designed to be shipped in a box with some air-puff for protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am suprised it lasted so long, but I dont regret the decision of buying the gallon.  </li>
            <li> Those who remain skeptical can venture a small risk by purchasing a smaller quantity; however, once you try it, I am sure you&#x27;ll be recommending it to you friends and relatives.</li>
            <li> My husband uses daily, me about every other day.  </li>
            <li> Rinses off any oil and make my hair crispy and dry.</li>
            <li> Works well for dry hair too.</li>
            <li> - I was looking at a $1 of wasted shampoo &amp; a useless pump top, so I returned that.  </li>
            <li> The very same shampoo as I bought at the boutique for a LOT less money.  </li>
            <li> wary of leaks when shipping such a large bottle via Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The only thing it&#x27;s missing is caffeine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> first bottle arrived broken in the shipping (thank God it was in a box, so when I opened it, the mess was contained).  </li>
            <li> It also helps with fungal infections in other parts of my body.  </li>
            <li> I have used Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree shampoo for years and will never use any other shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It seems to work as well as any other shampoo or soap for cleaning your hair.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think this is a lot to spend on shampoo, but when you consider that this bottle will last a long time, it&#x27;s seriously a STEAL.</li>
            <li> Normally I&#x27;d be like no big deal, but seeing as this is something we&#x27;re hoping to have last a while, the thought of storing this under my sink with a faulty lid - I can just see myself going to get it in a few months &amp; finding a puddle of very expensive shampoo caused by us shoving something else in front of it</li>
            <li> not realizing it was down there...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent way too much money on salon designer products only to be disappointed...</li>
            <li> The per oz cost is considerably less than what you&#x27;d pay for the bottles (which I use this to refill).</li>
            <li> This product works for my Autistic son.</li>
            <li> I used the head &amp; shoulders green apple stuff (since all the official dandruff shampoos smell</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy &amp; since it&#x27;s liquid it shifts the weight around during shipment.  </li>
            <li> I like the product and have been using this for the past 5 years or so.</li>
            <li> I guess anyone with a small apartment and a Costco membership would have this problem with anything they buy in bulk.</li>
            <li> It is expensive but buying it in this larger volume makes it somewhat cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I suggest buying the small size pump container and then refill with this gallon size.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to beat the value of the bulk size bottle of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Buying it by the gallon is VERY MUCH less expensive.  </li>
            <li> Like all men, I don&#x27;t shower every day: by the end of day 2 [of not showering] my hair is oily looking &amp; my scalp is beginning to itch like a mofo, but since using this shampoo my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch nearly as bad on that 2nd day</li>
            <li> The only thing I was disappointed in was that the lid was broke off and some of it spilled out in the box,</li>
            <li> *terrible*)</li>
            <li> I myself had never experienced dandruff until I moved to Florida.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never get tired of</li>
            <li> you shampoo (like a dime size is enough for an insane lather), and when you divide that into a GALLON, well, it&#x27;s going to take a while to get through this bottle.  </li>
            <li> My wife suffers from eczema on her scalp and before we discovered this stuff she had to get expensive creams and treatments for her scalp that damaged her hair.</li>
            <li> , I like the quality of the shampoo, but I&#x27;m afraid it could expire at some point before then, if that&#x27;s possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not that it&#x27;s a bad thing</li>
            <li> /&gt;+ Will convert &amp; heal that \\&quot;I hate Mondays\\&quot; feeling.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>

            <li> i have used this shampoo for years.  the first time my husband used it, he converted over immediately.&lt;br /&gt;the gallon is the best bang for it&#x27;s buck.  i just fill up my smaller bottle for easy use in the shower.</li>

            <li> This shamooo is wonderful.  Cleans well with a great scent and gives your scalp  a tingle!</li>
            <li> Should last me all year!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for years and this is the most cost effective way to buy it.</li>
            <li> I like this product and was pleased to find it at a much more reasonable price.</li>

This is the shampoo my hair dresser recommended for my type of hair (oily and tinted) and I&#x27;ve used it for more than 20 years.</li>
            <li> Only shampoo I will use from now on!</li>
            <li> Great price and it&#x27;s the real stuff! Nice to spend the money for how big this is and get lots of it</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for years.  I like the smell, the tingly feeling and how it cleans my hair. After using it for a while, I realized I no longer had any dandruff.  It also helps with fungal infections in other parts of my body.  What can I say... I buy it by the gallon to save money!</li>
            <li> This really is fantastic shampoo and buying in bulk saves you some coin.  Using this every few days keeps my scalp healthy and free of flaky yuk.  I highly recommend it!</li>

            <li> great shampoo in great price, fast s/h</li>
            <li> Great buy when compared to buying by the bottle at the salon.  Also love the feeling during and after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend bought this shampoo on a BOGO deal at the local salon in the mall.  I love this stuff and it irritates her every time I use it. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pump out a tiny amount of it and use it on my beard while showering.  The smell is a great wakeup for me and it makes my face tingle every so slightly.  I&#x27;ve used this in my hair a few times too and it was great as well.  The tingle was wonderful.  It may not be a good grease-cutter in the summer time but it sure does smell good!  Assuming one takes 2 showers in the summer which is fairly common, a good grease cutter and conditional at night followed by this tea tree shampoo in the morning would be an excellent combo.  The only thing it&#x27;s missing is caffeine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be wary of leaks when shipping such a large bottle via Amazon.  If it leaks, send it back and have them try again.  Be sure to review the packaging as well.  The only way they&#x27;ll ever learn to pack better is if they get feedback.</li>
            <li> Do all the gallon jugd come without tamper proof packaging?&lt;br /&gt;A piece of tape onthe cap was used only. Is that right?</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!  I used to get it at my hair salon at retail prices.  This is a great deal!</li>
            <li> Best shampoo out there</li>
            <li> It cools and soothes my scalp when nothing else will. I have tried many products and this one does what i expect. Thanks.</li>
            <li> The idea of buying this much and saving 40% from the smaller bottle size was appealing, but only washing my hair twice a week means that I won&#x27;t have to buy shampoo for 5-6 years.  Not that it&#x27;s a bad thing, I like the quality of the shampoo, but I&#x27;m afraid it could expire at some point before then, if that&#x27;s possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily I have enough room to store it, but in a smaller apartment where space is a premium this would get on my nerves.  I guess anyone with a small apartment and a Costco membership would have this problem with anything they buy in bulk.</li>
            <li> I love tea tree shampoo it leaves your hair with a nice smell and when using it you can feel tingling in your scalp. great product. I also use the conditioner same make and it is also great leaves hair clean</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to beat the value of the bulk size bottle of this shampoo. The tea tree extract gives the shampoo a minty scent and makes your scalp tingle a bit. It does burn like crazy if you get it in your eyes, but there&#x27;s no denying how nice it makes your hair feel.</li>
            <li> So much better to buy a gallon and filling the shampoo Into the 1litr. PM shampoo bottles.  That Way we don&#x27;t get stuck with conditioner (Paul Mitchell sells a double pack for a great price but I have tons of conditioner, cause I&#x27;m the only one in my family that uses conditioner.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. I use it on all clients and they enjoy the sensation this shampoo gives. It&#x27;s an great shampoo that gets your hair clean and the scalp is invigorated. I highly recommend this product. Thanks Amazon for making this product available to me.</li>
            <li> I tried the Lavendar Mint shampoo first, but the Tea Tree Special is the formulation that really best gives you the relaxing mint aromatherapy and the massage-like tingling of the tea tree oil. Try this: First thing in the shower, I spread some of the lather from my head down onto my neck and shoulders, then let it sit while I take care of everything else. The few minutes of it sitting creates a cool, relaxing sensation which is great for a tense neck and shoulder.</li>
            <li> This gallon of tea tree shampoo should last me awhile. It would have been nice if a pump was included, but I was able to pick up a cheap one easily.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Cooling effect is the best. Makes my hair feeling all clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> The tea tree scent in this shampoo is delightful and tingly too. It is probably not the best shampoo for dry, damaged hair, but it certainly smells good!</li>
            <li> A quality product with medicinal qualities.  The gallon size is FAR more economical over the long run (compared to several smaller bottles.)  I&#x27;M GLAD I BOUGHT IT &amp;#60;----- the BEST recommendation.</li>
            <li> Tea tree is the best.  Buy it. I am a man and cannot express the joy and invigoration I feel.</li>
            <li> Wow I&#x27;m literally using it for almost a year I think. Rinses off any oil and make my hair crispy and dry.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for many years.  It keeps my scalp from flaking and my hair very healthy as well.</li>
            <li> why make me write more than I want to, this is a waste of my time and now is a waste of everyone&#x27;s time to read???</li>
            <li> Very good product and is very inexpensive especially when you compare it to other stores. Does a very job and with a mint smell.</li>
            <li> I first experienced the thrill of this shampoo at a hair salon where across the counter prices were much higher for much smaller quantities. I was willing to shell out more for my first small tube of this product which I used sparingly until I could find better pricing. The feel of the lather almost &#x27;sparkles&#x27; under the skin. Tea Tree oil has been used for centuries by aboriginies of Australia and New Zealand for its natural antiseptic qualities as well as other medicinal purposes. During WWII it was used in field dressing kits to treat wounds and hinder infection. It has been marketed in the U.S. under various labels but, this is my first choice for hair and scalp cleaning and sterilization. I highly recommend this product and have introduced it to my family and grandchildren, who also agree. It&#x27;s a truly envigorating, spa-like experience. Those who remain skeptical can venture a small risk by purchasing a smaller quantity; however, once you try it, I am sure you&#x27;ll be recommending it to you friends and relatives.</li>
            <li> Wow.  Good deal on the best shampoo on the market.</li>
            <li> love this and anything Tea Tree</li>
            <li> I have used Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree shampoo for years and will never use any other shampoo.  It is expensive but buying it in this larger volume makes it somewhat cheaper.  I wash my hair every day and this gallon of shampoo lasts nearly a year.  The tea tree scent and feel is wonderful!  I am sensitive to scents in lotions and soap so I am careful about using products with strong scents.  This shampoo is gentle yet cool and refreshing.  I suggest buying the small size pump container and then refill with this gallon size.  My pump container has lasted for years.</li>
            <li> overall cost me about 50% of what it would at a salon</li>
            <li> My husband lives this shampoo! It takes forever to use up this gallon but it lasts nicely and smells really nice. I love the quality and everything about this brand.</li>
            <li> Greatest shampoo ever for itchy scalp, dandruff and non-stop everyday use. Works well for dry hair too. Anyway... you wont regret buying it.</li>
            <li> Great product. Reminds me of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s old Peppermint soap that I used to use when back-packing. Felt like your scalp was on fire..., in a good way (I miss the commentary on those old bottles). This shampoo seems a tad milder and is bracing enough to be part of any full-blooded wakeup ablutions. I look forward to using it every day..., just one of those things that enriches a day.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and swear by it. It is much more economical to by the gallon then the  boutique sized bottles.</li>
            <li> the peppermint and lavendar tea tree shampoo and conditions are great and buying it this way only made sense. it&#x27;s so much cheaper than buying those little bottles.  The lavendar makes your hair smell like a scent shop. Love it...</li>
            <li> great soap smells great and performs well, I have sensitive scalp and this shampoo works well with no iirritaions.</li>
            <li> Lasts me over a year. I just refill a smaller bottle in the shower. I recommend this product</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product. The only thing I was disappointed in was that the lid was broke off and some of it spilled out in the box, other then that it was good.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff. Nice big jug.  Get a pump for it.</li>
            <li> Great deal buying by the gallon. If you have room in your shower/bath just get the pump and it is convenient to use right from the bottle.</li>
            <li> Love it! Clarifying, tingly, gets your hair extremely clean and good for dandruff. Also makes me feel good that using it on my children makes them less likely to carry lice home should a child at school expose them. (Shivers)</li>
            <li> This is not the same Paul Mitchell product I have been using for years. I am concerned about the strong chemical smell. I compared it to the salon bought product and it is not the same. This should be investigated.</li>
            <li> Been using this shampoo for a couple of years now. Nothing compares. This is all that SportClips uses in their shops.</li>
            <li> This is such an excellent shampoo.  It helps control dandruff as well as control oily hair. It leaves scalp feeling tingly and clean.  Your hair is shiny and quite manageable!!</li>
            <li> I purchased a Gallon of tea tree shampoo in 2005, and today I just finished it.  I purchased a smaller amount initially, liked it, and then purchased the gallon, and would fill up the smaller bottle as needed.  I have short hair, but shower/use it every day.  I am suprised it lasted so long, but I dont regret the decision of buying the gallon.  I would say be absolutely sure you like a shampoo before you buy a gallon of it - its a long term relationship...</li>
            <li> This product works for my Autistic son. He has issues with his scalp. He would pick his head. I would recommend a funnel for easy pouring into a smaller bottle.</li>
            <li> Great deal in the gallon size...</li>
            <li> This is the same stuff I get my hair washed with when I get my hair cut. Identical smell and tingle on the scalp. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Second order Great Product. Also have the Bar soap it is also great! Now the wife is using it also. Will buy again and AGAIN!!</li>
            <li> the price is loads better when you buy a gallon. Both me and my husband use only this shampoo for the last year.</li>
            <li> Wife had this on her wish list for Christmas - it&#x27;s her absolute favorite shampoo and was literally a big surprise!</li>
            <li> I love Tea Tree shampoo.  I used to have a flakey scalp but that is no longer a problem with the Tea Tree!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years now, and it still works as well today as it did when I first started using it. The seller packaged the product well, and the shipping was prompt.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner. the Tea Tree Special smells great, tingles a little and doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out. I&#x27;ve spent way too much money on salon designer products only to be disappointed... this one is a keeper</li>
            <li> The product itself is wonderful.  My boyfriend has used it for years &amp; when he stopped he suddenly developed dandruff...I myself had never experienced dandruff until I moved to Florida.  I used the head &amp; shoulders green apple stuff (since all the official dandruff shampoos smell *terrible*) - but this stuff is so much nicer on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is the reality of shipping a 1 gallon (or 33.8oz bottle) jug of shampoo.  It&#x27;s heavy &amp; since it&#x27;s liquid it shifts the weight around during shipment.  And while amazon always is great at putting liquid stuff into it&#x27;s own separate bag...the lids on these specific items are clearly not designed to be shipped in a box with some air-puff for protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally ordered the 33.8oz bottle.  It arrived totally busted open - shampoo all over the bag it was in - and it looked like the actual pump top was broken.  Since the 33.8oz bottle is about $1.15/oz - I was looking at a $1 of wasted shampoo &amp; a useless pump top, so I returned that.  Which is when I spotted this - and thought perfect - much less likely the lid will actually break - and a MUCH better price (about $.70/oz).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well...I was wrong - at least about the lid (the price is still great).  It arrived.  And somehow a piece of the white plastic screw-on lid chipped off...like a 1/3rd of the side of the lid...maybe I&#x27;m just cursed when it comes to the lids of this product...but that kinda sucked.  Normally I&#x27;d be like no big deal, but seeing as this is something we&#x27;re hoping to have last a while, the thought of storing this under my sink with a faulty lid - I can just see myself going to get it in a few months &amp; finding a puddle of very expensive shampoo caused by us shoving something else in front of it not realizing it was down there...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end I&#x27;ll probably keep this one since you really can&#x27;t find these anywhere - and the price is AWESOME...</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful, and the cheapest way to buy it is by the gallon like this.  I use a funnel to fill up my original pump bottle from the salon, and this gallon will probably last me over a year.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gallon of tea tree shampoo! The per oz cost is considerably less than what you&#x27;d pay for the bottles (which I use this to refill). Mine was packaged extremely carefully, which is a good thing. The lid is screwtop, but doesn&#x27;t have a lot of thread, so if it&#x27;s not packaged well, leakage could be a real problem. But it was, so no worries!</li>
            <li> This is the third time I have order  this product in bulk and I love it.  This shipment was carefully wrapped and arrived very quickly.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> The very same shampoo as I bought at the boutique for a LOT less money.  Will reorder in 8 months!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re surfing for a new shampoo, then look no further, this TEA TREE shampoo is made of pure amazing!  A friend gifted some of his bottle to me ~4yrs ago, and finally a month ago I asked him \\&quot;what was that shampoo you gave me?\\&quot;  ...He told me and then I ordered my own 1 gallon bottle, and wow, it&#x27;s like sex for my scalp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you try this stuff, you&#x27;ll never use another shampoo again.  This is literally an experience to behold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;+ Like all men, I don&#x27;t shower every day: by the end of day 2 [of not showering] my hair is oily looking &amp; my scalp is beginning to itch like a mofo, but since using this shampoo my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch nearly as bad on that 2nd day (I haven&#x27;t tried 3 days yet)!&lt;br /&gt;+ Feels amazing&lt;br /&gt;+ Smells amazing&lt;br /&gt;+ Will convert &amp; heal that \\&quot;I hate Mondays\\&quot; feeling.&lt;br /&gt;+ Best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used no questions asked!&lt;br /&gt;+ Best gift you could ever give someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- None that I can think of (it&#x27;s even priced fairly considering it&#x27;s a gallon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo if you have occasional scalp itchiness.  My husband uses daily, me about every other day.  Side note. Husband sez &amp;#34;DO NOT use as a body wash, the tingle can turn on you.</li>
            <li> We use this product all year for a body wash in the shower.  It is especially helpful during sports as it has effectively  cut out staph infections occuring during contact sports.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is awesome for getting my sons&#x27; thick hair clean.  It looks clean, it smells clean, it is clean.</li>
            <li> I am going to buy this a lot. I save money this way.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Wish I could buy a gallon of the conditioner!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and perfect. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I have a skin condition on my scalp and this is the only shampoo keeps it in check.  It seems expensive however buying a gallon is more cost effective than over spending locally for the small bottle.</li>
            <li> I first bought this shampoo at a beauty shop because I love how it smells.  Buying it by the gallon is VERY MUCH less expensive.  It seems to work as well as any other shampoo or soap for cleaning your hair.  Being a man, I have no idea how it works with conditioners and whatever else the ladies may use with it. It does leave my hair with a nice fragrence, which I am very pleased with.</li>
            <li> Keeps me dandruff free. Buying in bulk makes this luxury affordable!</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price, much much more economical than the little bottles from the salon!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 15 years for not only shampoo but body wash and this is the right size to buy it in verses the tiny bottles at Ulta.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Just needed to get some hair product. I prefer this brand and never get it for a good price at the local stores in town, So I decided to save some money and purchase a larger amount to benefit from the lower cost per volume. Arrived on time and in great condition. I hope to purchase again in the future from the same proprietor when I run out.</li>
            <li> So, this stuff is incredible.  First, the quantity will last you FOREVER.  You really don&#x27;t need much product each time you shampoo (like a dime size is enough for an insane lather), and when you divide that into a GALLON, well, it&#x27;s going to take a while to get through this bottle.  I&#x27;m the only one using this bottle, and I imagine it will take me like 2 years to get through this.  Not because I&#x27;m gross and never shower, but because the product is high quality and you don&#x27;t need a lot to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is invigorating and is a great way to kick off your day.  It&#x27;s like aromatherapy in a bottle.  When house guests use it, they rave.  It&#x27;s seriously nice stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first bottle arrived broken in the shipping (thank God it was in a box, so when I opened it, the mess was contained).  But, the seller was really responsive and sent out a replacement at no cost.  So, now I&#x27;ve got almost 2 gallons of the stuff.  Good thing I&#x27;ll never get tired of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think this is a lot to spend on shampoo, but when you consider that this bottle will last a long time, it&#x27;s seriously a STEAL.</li>
            <li> I love the tea tree oil tingle. The gallon size is nice, but I bought a smaller bottle with a pump a while ago...</li>
            <li> good value at a good price</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shampoo.. This was a economical  !way to stock him up.&lt;br /&gt;Received the product the next day.</li>
            <li> very good works very good !</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever used. Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> With this shampoo our family use it all most about eight months and feels clean and love the smell!!&lt;br /&gt;compare to the price it is a quite a big case with high quality.!</li>
            <li> it is the same tea tree shampoo just in a galloon, I like it a lot</li>
            <li> Excellent products, quick shipping time, great price. Just a great way to go. My wife suffers from eczema on her scalp and before we discovered this stuff she had to get expensive creams and treatments for her scalp that damaged her hair. Since she started using this shampoo, she no longer needs any treatment beyond washing well with this. It&#x27;s amazing! Customers for life.</li>
            <li> This is the second brand of tea tree shampoo I have tried.  I have itchy scalp, so far this shampoo helps, but not to a point that it eliminates the itchiness completely.  Since it&#x27;s not a medicine, I don&#x27;t expect it to be a miracle-take-the-itch-away shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for years now.  On vacations when I do not use this one I just don&#x27;t feel as refreshed as with the tea tree one.  Going with the 1 gallon was the best decision.  I&#x27;m set for a while now.</li>
            <li> The first time I came across this shampoo was at the salon, The cool tingle and aroma of mint is second to none, this my favorite shampoo to-date</li>
