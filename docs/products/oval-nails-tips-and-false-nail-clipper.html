            <li>It would be best to get a toe nail clipper or profession spring nail clipper because these nails are very sturdy.</li>
            <li>However, the shape of these is really nice --</li>

            <li>I love the shape of them and length.</li>
            <li>I am I love with these nails.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>, I think its a better deal than the Kiss packs I have been buying.</li>
            <li>and I wish there were more sizes.</li>
            <li>These hold just as good, if not better than acrylics and they look beautiful!</li>
            <li>Perfect, last long, made strong, and mold perfectly to skin.  </li>
            <li>they seem like they are pretty good quality.  </li>
            <li>I love how strong they are.</li>
            <li>I was able to find a fit for every nail except the thumb.</li>
            <li>So easy to trim and to paint.</li>
            <li>There are a few mishaps here and there but for the most part perfect.</li>
            <li>Exactly what it says nice product</li>
            <li>I had no problem with the shipping, came right on time and the nails handle paint very easily.</li>
            <li>super sexy</li>
            <li>They are great quality and I will definitely be using these again!</li>
            <li>I actually use these for special effects teeth, mainly because if you are making a skeleton they are wonderful t looking like teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them twice already for different occasions and they fit nicely since they have so many sizes.</li>
            <li>Great quality, and very long.  </li>
            <li>are perfect if u like the long oval, i did cut them just a lil around the top so they wouldnt b extremely long..</li>
            <li>Full nails, rounded tips.</li>
            <li>Other than that, once they were painted and glued onto my nails, they looked great.</li>
            <li>its got a good curve to it,  making your nails appear more sleek and narrow anyways.  </li>
            <li>These also adhere very well to my nails and fit mostly true to size.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more!</li>
            <li>Love these nails but wish they could be purchased in individual sizes as I can&#x27;t use some of them.</li>
            <li>There are so many different sizes</li>
            <li>Got mine, the exact size I wanted</li>
            <li>They were exactly as described.</li>
            <li>first of all I got them really fast!</li>
            <li>They are kinda narrow which is good for me</li>
            <li>I had ordered from a previous company in China and never received the nails, so I was thrilled when these came immediately.</li>
            <li>They turned out way better than expected.</li>
            <li>I definitely had to cut and file them to fit my nail shape</li>
            <li>they are a bit long but thats an easy fix.</li>
            <li>They are long but can be shortened easily if you want with a toenail clipper.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;the main problem that I have with them is sizing:/&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They are okay - but you will need to cut them down!</li>
            <li>I have mine on for almost 2 weeks now and only one (my right pinky) popped off.</li>
            <li>I glue them over my entire nail, and they&#x27;re long enough to file into nice stiletto points.</li>
            <li>They look very natural</li>
            <li>The only other downside is that shipping takes a few weeks to arrive, but such a great value &amp; quality that it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>They are pretty long</li>
            <li>But as far as fake nails go that&#x27;s a good problem to have.</li>
            <li>The only filing that has to be done really is at the base so they can fit better on the nail.</li>
            <li>long lasting and well constructed looks natural</li>
    </ol>

            <li> They&#x27;re really long</li>
            <li> They are really long.  </li>
            <li> I love that these nails are thin and look like real nails - most &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; nails are thick and look like chickets on your fingers, which I hate.</li>
            <li> With all other nails I&#x27;ve tried in the past,within the first couple days, at least one of them were chipped.</li>
            <li> These nails come VERY long and will need some filing and clipping.</li>
            <li> Sadly there aren&#x27;t any wide enough for my thumbs and the widest are only barely big enough to work for my pointer fingers.</li>
            <li> but if you have wide finger nails they probably won&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li> Also suits wide nail beds like mine!</li>
            <li> and I find that the nails are very wide looking</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these on over a week and there is not one single chip or crack!!!</li>
            <li> a half mark.</li>
            <li> I will say that the widest nail (the thumb) is a little too narrow for my thumbs</li>
            <li> Regular finger nail clippers may be broken after some use.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think I have especially wide nail beds.  </li>
            <li> These suckers LAST on the nails - to the point that they are a bit difficult to remove after 3 weeks.</li>

            <li> Love these nails but wish they could be purchased in individual sizes as I can&#x27;t use some of them.</li>
            <li> Love Them!!! Will definitely buy again!!! ❤️❤️❤️</li>
            <li> Exactly what it says nice product</li>
            <li> Shipping was great and the product is best for what I do.</li>
            <li> Nice shape and they seem like they are pretty good quality.  Packaging leaves something to be desired.  Sadly there aren&#x27;t any wide enough for my thumbs and the widest are only barely big enough to work for my pointer fingers.</li>
            <li> Love these nails! I&#x27;ve used them twice already for different occasions and they fit nicely since they have so many sizes. They are pretty long but of course, you can always cut them to the size you want-which I prefer.</li>
            <li> I actually use these for special effects teeth, mainly because if you are making a skeleton they are wonderful t looking like teeth. They are great quality and I will definitely be using these again!</li>
            <li> They are okay - but you will need to cut them down!</li>
            <li> Works good..Lots of sizes</li>
            <li> Love these nails! So easy to trim and to paint. There are so many different sizes so I can find the perfect fit!</li>
            <li> I am beyond satisfied with these nails! They turned out way better than expected. These hold just as good, if not better than acrylics and they look beautiful! I had no problem with the shipping, came right on time and the nails handle paint very easily. I have mine on for almost 2 weeks now and only one (my right pinky) popped off. These also adhere very well to my nails and fit mostly true to size. There are a few mishaps here and there but for the most part perfect. The only filing that has to be done really is at the base so they can fit better on the nail. They look very natural so I am very happy with these. I will be reordering 😊👍🏼. In the picture is my nails at this week and a half mark. **** These nails come VERY long and will need some filing and clipping. It would be best to get a toe nail clipper or profession spring nail clipper because these nails are very sturdy. Regular finger nail clippers may be broken after some use.</li>
            <li> Good nails at a great price. If you use nails often these are the ones to get.</li>
            <li> Got mine, the exact size I wanted😁 can&#x27;t wait to use them😛</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really long so you have the option of long or short. No splitting or cracking from my experience. They are kinda narrow which is good for me but if you have wide finger nails they probably won&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li> I love love love these nails..I&#x27;ve been looking for this type of nails for months.&lt;br /&gt;They are perfect if u like the long oval, i did cut them just a lil around the top so they wouldnt b extremely long..&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m most def ordering more for my mom and sis :) Thx :)</li>

            <li> love these nails. very strong. they are a bit long but thats an easy fix. I was able to find a fit for every nail except the thumb. I have big nail beds.</li>
            <li> Super happy with these! I had ordered from a previous company in China and never received the nails, so I was thrilled when these came immediately. They were exactly as described. Full nails, rounded tips. I glue them over my entire nail, and they&#x27;re long enough to file into nice stiletto points. They&#x27;d work for any length and they hold up well. I&#x27;m done buying one set at a time--these are now my go-to nails!</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE,LOVE!!!! first of all I got them really fast! I love the shape of them and length. the type of plastic is way stronger then any drugstore brand. super sexy and you get your money worth and more!! trust me I am I love with these nails. PERFECT!!!!</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with these. I love how strong they are. With all other nails I&#x27;ve tried in the past,within the first couple days, at least one of them were chipped. I&#x27;ve had these on over a week and there is not one single chip or crack!!! I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and will definitely be buying more.</li>

            <li> Great  long lasting and well constructed looks natural I will buy again</li>
            <li> I like these a lot.  I will say that the widest nail (the thumb) is a little too narrow for my thumbs and I don&#x27;t think I have especially wide nail beds.  However, the shape of these is really nice -- its got a good curve to it,  making your nails appear more sleek and narrow anyways.

            <li> Recommend it for everyone 😊😊😊 so happy with my purchase 😘😘😘</li>
            <li> Price, shipping and quality are all good.  They are long but can be shortened easily if you want with a toenail clipper.  I Iike having the choice.</li>
            <li> amazing product for this price&lt;br /&gt;the main problem that I have with them is sizing:/&lt;br /&gt;I have very tiny fingers and I find that the nails are very wide looking so I have to do a tonnnnnn of filing.&lt;br /&gt;hoping that with practice the filing and sizing will become easier</li>
            <li> They are really long.  I did have to cut and file as they did not work for my nails.  I have curved nail beds, and these just kept popping off.  I do like the shape, just not for me.</li>
            <li> I love that these nails are thin and look like real nails - most &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; nails are thick and look like chickets on your fingers, which I hate.
