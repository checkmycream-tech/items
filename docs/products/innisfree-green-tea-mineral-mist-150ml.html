            <li>Thank You! :)</li>
            <li>but i still love it...</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Light and moisturizing!</li>
            <li>they really do a great job and are so much cheaper than brands at sephora, etc.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s almost like it has a bit of oil in it because it feels a lot more hydrating than just water.</li>
            <li>My skin noticeably got more brighter and smoother.  </li>
            <li>I freaky love it</li>
            <li>I have mostly oily/acne prone skin so most lotions do not work for me.</li>
            <li>I promise:) I love Korean everything products.</li>
            <li>This has a lovely smell.</li>
            <li>smell~ love it</li>
            <li>, it really does moisture your skin and feel amazing on skin even after apply makeup!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much from this product and honestly bought it out of curiosity, but I am very impressed by the results that I&#x27;ve received so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for summer when the weather makes your face dry.</li>
            <li>I love the product, it gives your skin a quick re-hydration.</li>
            <li>Is fresh and easy to use love it and leave my skin glowing.</li>
            <li>It was about $11 for a huge bottle</li>
            <li>my skin looks really toned and nice after the spray.</li>
            <li>I had been using another facial mist from Murad that I wasn&#x27;t too happy with.</li>
            <li>I honestly thought my skin was good already with my skin care routine, but this just added that extra moisturizing effect that really made my skin look, dare I say...</li>
            <li>i bought this mainly to soothe and cool my skin during these warm weather months.</li>
            <li>This one seems really nice so far</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a quick moisturizer and it does the trick.</li>
            <li>This is great for summer time, but i wouldn&#x27;t leave it in the sun, the bottle tends to get hot easily, making the product hot, and you dont want that on your skin after a long day of sun exposure, so leave it in a pretty cool temperature place.</li>
            <li>This facial mist give me a nice glow and does not feel oily at all.</li>
            <li>I really wished they made a better spray because it kind of sprays everywhere, so i would be careful on the spraying, not that it will ruin your clothes or anything.</li>
            <li>I really like the cooling sensation, as I do live in a rather warm to hot climate, and I also like how hydrated my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li>im guessing it is $16 right now</li>
            <li>The spray is a very soft mist that smells very elegant and has a definite moisturizing quality from the extract...</li>
            <li>just see if I wasn&#x27;t under the &amp;#34;placebo effect&amp;#34;, of believing that it was doing more than it actually was.</li>
            <li>My first impression on this product when I sprayed it, was this is not going to help my skin.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time I use it</li>
            <li>I totally love this stuff and will definitely recommend it to my friends!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely buying this facial mist again; it smells good too.  </li>
            <li>love the light, green scent as well.</li>
            <li>They are all about being natural and they have no bad additives.</li>
            <li>The price is great compared to other facial sprays/mists that are available in stores such as The Body Shop.</li>
            <li>and I upgraded to the bigger one because the bigger the better!</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I just wonder if I may be wasting by using too much at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>It is very cooling and just a spritz will do.</li>
            <li>This product is very well.</li>
            <li>and it sits nicely on top of my other products too.</li>
            <li>I only recently gotten into the 7-10 step Korean skin care routine and so far I am enjoying the effects of most products in the steps, especially this one since I can be reapplied over make up and through out the day.</li>
            <li>I purchased it because of a friend that swore up and down it was essential to having a good skincare routine.</li>
            <li>I researched, read reviews, and watched a bunch of YouTube videos before settling on this particular one.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone that is looking for something affordable to help boost their skin care routine.</li>
            <li>Because of the high citric content my skin did not react well to the product.</li>
            <li>There had been so much hype about perfumed rose water and even simple evian water sprays that I decided to try the innisfree green tea mineral water.</li>
            <li>First let me say that I really didn&#x27;t see the point of having a facial mist.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the green tea.</li>
            <li>It smells like green tea to me and that&#x27;s my favorite beverage, so</li>
            <li>Super refreshing when my skin is feeling tight and dry.</li>
            <li>I live in california, and its usually really hot here, so my face dries out quickly after a long day outside, and this helps replenish my skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff is perfect to carry around in my bag with me and when my skin feels a little dull, dry, or sluggish, I can go to a nearby bathroom and use a couple of spritz of this stuff on my face.</li>
            <li>Afterwards, I gently pat it in and I&#x27;m left with hydrated, soft, and moisturized skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I softly pat my face to help absorb it.</li>
            <li>I like a dewy look, and this combats the powdery look (when wearing makeup) which makes me look old.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although the container is a little bigger than I anticipated, it still glides into my bookbag and purse easily, so carrying it isn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m usually very busy and moving constantly.</li>
            <li>Will order in the near future!</li>
            <li>this one certainly didn&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li>and I use it everyday in the super dry Midwest winter.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone above other brands I&#x27;ve tested at the store (jurlique, evian, claudale, etc).</li>
            <li>My flaky dry skin really improved (along with help from my other skin care products).</li>

            <li> i mainly use it after swimming laps after my skin has had some damage from the sun and feels tight from the chlorine.</li>

            <li> When my skin is dry, I use this before my makeup on school days.</li>
            <li> i spray it liberally and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> I use it whenever I feel as if my face is a bit dry.</li>
            <li> This product does wonders for my very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and after using this product for a few days I noticed a big difference.</li>
            <li> and I can actually notice the difference in my skin in just a few days.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel less dry.</li>
            <li> It arrived earlier than what I expected and they included a small gift.</li>
            <li> , it helps a lot after i put on my other product</li>
            <li> My skin is softer and less pink (from rosacea)</li>
            <li> , is that when I do spray on my face, quite a bit of it falls down to my chest and this leaves me feeling if I am using too much or if I am using it wrong.</li>
            <li> Not that I mind since I take my skin care routine from face down to neck and chest.</li>
            <li> I have college coming up in a few weeks,</li>
            <li> I usually use it after i shower</li>
            <li> Lotions always tend to feel like an oil slick on my skin as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with, and I am not sure if it&#x27;s just me or not</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin sooth and protect my skin from the dry and the cold.</li>
            <li> before i wanted to buy this, i was afraid i would have an allergic reaction to it, but i didn&#x27;t (note: i usually dont have a reaction to tea, so there was no surprise).</li>
            <li> These things don&#x27;t need to be expensive.</li>

            <li> before i wanted to buy this, i was afraid i would have an allergic reaction to it, but i didn&#x27;t (note: i usually dont have a reaction to tea, so there was no surprise). I love the product, it gives your skin a quick re-hydration. I usually use it after i shower, it helps a lot after i put on my other product and it sits nicely on top of my other products too. I havent tried it on top of my make up though. I live in california, and its usually really hot here, so my face dries out quickly after a long day outside, and this helps replenish my skin. I really wished they made a better spray because it kind of sprays everywhere, so i would be careful on the spraying, not that it will ruin your clothes or anything. the price i got it was at $21, and im guessing it is $16 right now, i would buy it before its price raise again. This is great for summer time, but i wouldn&#x27;t leave it in the sun, the bottle tends to get hot easily, making the product hot, and you dont want that on your skin after a long day of sun exposure, so leave it in a pretty cool temperature place.</li>
            <li> First let me say that I really didn&#x27;t see the point of having a facial mist. I purchased it because of a friend that swore up and down it was essential to having a good skincare routine. I researched, read reviews, and watched a bunch of YouTube videos before settling on this particular one. I am so very glad that I did. This product does wonders for my very dry skin. I have gone days without using it just see if I wasn&#x27;t under the &amp;#34;placebo effect&amp;#34;, of believing that it was doing more than it actually was. I truly did notice that my skin wasn&#x27;t as supple and hydrated on the days that I went without. I also should say that this product doesn&#x27;t irrate my eyes like others that I&#x27;ve tried. I would highly recommend this to anyone that is looking for something affordable to help boost their skin care routine.</li>
            <li> I Love this Innisfree Mist. It makes my skin feel less dry. I use it every morning to keep my skin hydrated. I love the smell of the green tea. Overall, I would definitely recommend this product to everyone. Will order in the near future! Thank You! :)</li>
            <li> I like it.....wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be in an aresol spray can... but i still love it...</li>
            <li> When my skin is dry, I use this before my makeup on school days. It&#x27;s a quick moisturizer and it does the trick. I did buy the smaller one and I upgraded to the bigger one because the bigger the better! LOL okay that&#x27;s not why. I really like it. My flaky dry skin really improved (along with help from my other skin care products). But I do recommend it if you want a moisturizer before putting on your makeup before you start your day!</li>
            <li> Because of the high citric content my skin did not react well to the product. After spritzing this on my face I felt as though my skin got drier.</li>
            <li> I love this product it smells amazing! I have really dry skin and after using this product for a few days I noticed a big difference. It arrived earlier than what I expected and they included a small gift. I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Super refreshing when my skin is feeling tight and dry.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so refreshing and smells so good! Perfect for freshening up in the Spring and Summer. Light and moisturizing!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. There had been so much hype about perfumed rose water and even simple evian water sprays that I decided to try the innisfree green tea mineral water. I am Korean so I like Korean products...they really do a great job and are so much cheaper than brands at sephora, etc. The spray is a very soft mist that smells very elegant and has a definite moisturizing quality from the extract...it&#x27;s almost like it has a bit of oil in it because it feels a lot more hydrating than just water. It was about $11 for a huge bottle and I use it everyday in the super dry Midwest winter. I highly recommend this to anyone above other brands I&#x27;ve tested at the store (jurlique, evian, claudale, etc). These things don&#x27;t need to be expensive.</li>
            <li> My skin noticeably got more brighter and smoother.  I&#x27;m definitely buying this facial mist again; it smells good too.  It&#x27;s perfect for summer when the weather makes your face dry.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a big fan of facial mists and i know Korea brands put out some great products. this one certainly didn&#x27;t let me down. i bought this mainly to soothe and cool my skin during these warm weather months. i mainly use it after swimming laps after my skin has had some damage from the sun and feels tight from the chlorine. i spray it liberally and let it air dry. my skin looks really toned and nice after the spray. a great product that i would purchase again. love the light, green scent as well.</li>
            <li> I freaky love it, it really does moisture your skin and feel amazing on skin even after apply makeup! I highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I just got this item about 3 days ago. I had been using another facial mist from Murad that I wasn&#x27;t too happy with. This one seems really nice so far and I can actually notice the difference in my skin in just a few days. It also has a really nice scent. I have mostly oily/acne prone skin so most lotions do not work for me. Lotions always tend to feel like an oil slick on my skin as the day goes on. This facial mist give me a nice glow and does not feel oily at all. I will be getting this product again and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Great love the smell and the moisturizing feeling it gives to me skin! Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Its amazing.My face felt like a baby&#x27;s butt. YOU WILL LOVE THIS! I promise:) I love Korean everything products. They are all about being natural and they have no bad additives.</li>
            <li> Smell sooo good and refreshing!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from this product and honestly bought it out of curiosity, but I am very impressed by the results that I&#x27;ve received so far. I&#x27;ve seen quite a bit of improvement from my skin in about the two weeks I&#x27;ve had it. The mist is supposed to keep the skin hydrated and that&#x27;s what the product does. I really like the cooling sensation, as I do live in a rather warm to hot climate, and I also like how hydrated my skin looks and feels. I honestly thought my skin was good already with my skin care routine, but this just added that extra moisturizing effect that really made my skin look, dare I say... plump? But in a good and healthy way. lol. I&#x27;m hoping this will keep up as I use the rest of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I have a problem with, and I am not sure if it&#x27;s just me or not, is that when I do spray on my face, quite a bit of it falls down to my chest and this leaves me feeling if I am using too much or if I am using it wrong. Any how, it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ll adjust to. Not that I mind since I take my skin care routine from face down to neck and chest. I just wonder if I may be wasting by using too much at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I am quite happy with my purchase and will be purchasing again when I am out. I only recently gotten into the 7-10 step Korean skin care routine and so far I am enjoying the effects of most products in the steps, especially this one since I can be reapplied over make up and through out the day.</li>
            <li> My first impression on this product when I sprayed it, was this is not going to help my skin.  Well after two weeks I have noticed a big difference.  My skin is softer and less pink (from rosacea) I only use it in the evening before I go to bed, but it states it can be use during the day. It is very cooling and just a spritz will do. I am looking forward to continue the use through the summer.</li>
            <li> This mist is really great. It leaves the skin moisturized with a cooling feeling.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is to die for.&lt;br /&gt;The composition of this product is also a plus.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good. This is my first time I use it but it surprise me a lot. It keeps my skin sooth and protect my skin from the dry and the cold.</li>
            <li> Not for oily skin like I thought it would be</li>
            <li> This product is good. I am using this mist at mid day when my skin feels dry. I softly pat my face to help absorb it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is perfect for throughout the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m usually very busy and moving constantly. I have college coming up in a few weeks, my job I seem to be at constantly, and I&#x27;m always out with friends if I&#x27;m not out on a walk. This stuff is perfect to carry around in my bag with me and when my skin feels a little dull, dry, or sluggish, I can go to a nearby bathroom and use a couple of spritz of this stuff on my face. Afterwards, I gently pat it in and I&#x27;m left with hydrated, soft, and moisturized skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, may I add, the smell is awesome. It smells like green tea to me and that&#x27;s my favorite beverage, so I&#x27;m totally hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the container is a little bigger than I anticipated, it still glides into my bookbag and purse easily, so carrying it isn&#x27;t an issue. I totally love this stuff and will definitely recommend it to my friends!</li>
            <li> awesome, make my skin feel very smooth and soft</li>
            <li> This product is very well.It&#x27;s keep my make up longer,more than 12hour(seriously).I like the smell of it .Furthermore,it&#x27;s very natural and this is the best thing.</li>
            <li> This has a lovely smell. I use it whenever I feel as if my face is a bit dry. I like a dewy look, and this combats the powdery look (when wearing makeup) which makes me look old. The price is great compared to other facial sprays/mists that are available in stores such as The Body Shop.</li>
            <li> Is fresh and easy to use love it and leave my skin glowing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so big!!!! and nice smell~ love it</li>
