            <li>Much more convienant.</li>
            <li>I checked out many brands and found this to be the most inclusive.  </li>
            <li>I chose Eye Science because they had a greater content of these vitamins.  </li>
            <li>GREAT PRICE-SUPER FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li>I do not know if they are any better than anything else that I have taken although they seem to work.</li>
            <li>but I think it is helping me see better.</li>
            <li>and I am satisfied with this product</li>
            <li>If my father had known about nutrition and how important antioxidants are, he may have better sight.  </li>
            <li>Easy to take, does not bother my stomach at all</li>
            <li>I buy this product weekly from this seller and have always been satisfied with freshness of vitamins and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Have only been using this for about 3 weeks, kind of soon to tell for sure</li>
            <li>great, I got my stuff faster than expected!</li>
            <li>High quality eye care and a better price than at stores.  </li>
            <li>This formula contains all of the ingredients which make up a good formula for the eyes, but I personally haven&#x27;t noticed much difference in my condition.</li>
            <li>the price is right.</li>
            <li>Delivery was timely and as promised and price was right..</li>
            <li>Will keep on buying this as it has the right ingredients that address eye health.</li>
            <li>Most opthomologists say vitamins will not help anything eye related, but hey, worth a try.</li>
            <li>Price was much lower than at CVS which has not had it for several weeks and receiving several bottles is great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trusting that it helps keep my eyes healthy and deters any issues I might have in the future.</li>
            <li>Eye doctor told me to start vitamins for this disease immediately, but the only guidance was to make sure it conformed with the A-Reds 2 formula.</li>
            <li>I will know more when I have my next eye exam.  </li>
            <li>Ask your doctor first before buying this product.</li>
            <li>This is a product that you don&#x27;t necessarily see results with, but it&#x27;s more for preventing eye problems.  </li>
            <li>Not sure how good it is, but look at its ingredients (no pictures here, had to go to their website):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Eye exams have been very stable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried others, but this really is helping me.     </li>
            <li>Recommended by my eye doctor but really haven&#x27;t noticed any results yet.  </li>
            <li>I have no idea how much this is helping.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be working very well.</li>
            <li>and I believe this product helped me more than any other that were also sugested and that I tried.  </li>
            <li>Taking these particular antioxidants has been recommended for prevention of MD, so I take two every day.  </li>
            <li>I checked the ingredients compare to other vitamins for the eyes and it came up much more complete.</li>
            <li>pills are large hard to take, but they are ok</li>
            <li>The product was exactly as advertised and came on (actually ahead of) time.  </li>
            <li>It refreshed them.and ready to go the next day.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a must vitamin for me since I have macular degeneration ..the price is right. I buy this product weekly from this seller and have always been satisfied with freshness of vitamins and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I feel that the product met with the expectation of my eye doctor. Thank you</li>
            <li> Made me nauseous and sick to my stomach</li>
            <li> have not had a chance to see the effects but what I read about it seems to be a great product</li>
            <li> Delivery was timely and as promised and price was right..</li>
            <li> It helped my eyes comfort level from eye fatigue from computer usage and strain.  It refreshed them.and ready to go the next day.</li>
            <li> recommended by my optometrist. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and my optometrist says he sees an improvement.</li>
            <li> Recommended by the doctor....Like the product</li>
            <li> I have Age Related Macular Degeneration and use Eye Science Macular Health Formula daily.  Eye exams have been very stable.</li>
            <li> I HAVE MACULAR DEGENERATION IN MY LEFT EYE, AND ORDERED THESE BEFORE TALKING TO MY OPTHAMOLOGIST...WHEN I INQUIRED OF HIM, HE SAID IF I WAS TAKING A BLOOD THINNER MED, IT MIGHT NOT BE A GOOD IDEA...THE SELLER HAD ME RETURN THEM FOR A REFUND.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll let you know in a year.  Had a problem on an eye photo.  Most opthomologists say vitamins will not help anything eye related, but hey, worth a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others, but this really is helping me.     Just what the Dr. ordered</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to review a vitamin.... my doctor told me to take it and Amazon had the best price, so that&#x27;s where I bought it.  The product was exactly as advertised and came on (actually ahead of) time.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> Everything was what I expected</li>
            <li> pills are large hard to take, but they are ok</li>
            <li> Our doctor recommended it as the only one on the market that truly can make a difference.  Hopefully, this is the case.  Product arrived as promised.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my eye doctor but really haven&#x27;t noticed any results yet.  Still hoping!</li>
            <li> My sister started me on this product. My eye doctor had asked me if I was taking an eye supplement, although not asking what I was taking.&lt;br /&gt;When I ran out for a week, my eyes felt the lack. Darlene sent the Amazon page in which to order myself. I now will not allow myself to run out.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how much this is helping.  The product was recommended by my eye doctor, as I have the beginnings of macular degeneration which is currently asymptomatic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only time will tell if the product is effective.</li>
            <li> Good product. Worked well.</li>
            <li> This product is the only aid that works for our macular degineration.  The shipping and timing is top notch.  A great product.</li>
            <li> Price was much lower than at CVS which has not had it for several weeks and receiving several bottles is great.</li>
            <li> So much easier than running my mom 15 miles away to pay the same price. Much more convienant.</li>
            <li> Easy to take, does not bother my stomach at all</li>
            <li> Will use up this bottle and review the effects with the optometrist who recommended it. No dissatisfaction so far.</li>
            <li> High quality eye care and a better price than at stores.  I checked the ingredients compare to other vitamins for the eyes and it came up much more complete.</li>
            <li> As long as my husband takes these pills they seem to help his eyesight.</li>
            <li> Macular Health is a great product.  I had complications with my cataract surgery and I believe this product helped me more than any other that were also sugested and that I tried.  2 years ago my doctor told me that I may be having the beginning of Macular Degeneration, but cannot find any trace of it now.  I am still taking it because I want to keep my eyesight as good as it can be and I notice a difference with Macular Health.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now since my mom has macular degeneration. I&#x27;m trusting that it helps keep my eyes healthy and deters any issues I might have in the future. Will keep on buying this as it has the right ingredients that address eye health.</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with macular degeneration in both eyes.  Eye doctor told me to start vitamins for this disease immediately, but the only guidance was to make sure it conformed with the A-Reds 2 formula. This study tells you to include lutein, zeaxanthin and omega 3.  I checked out many brands and found this to be the most inclusive.  Price at CVS was roughly $50. This was a great buy!</li>
            <li> will continue to use til my next Dr. appt.</li>
            <li> This is a mixed review.  I have macular degeneration - wet macular in the left eye.  I have had injections which only lasted six months - have decided not to have further injections.  My eye doctor told me not to take vitamins as they didn&#x27;t help.  My regular doctor couldn&#x27;t  understand this -saying they can&#x27;t hurt.  I chose Eye Science because they had a greater content of these vitamins.  I think they have helped.  Placebo effet?  I don&#x27;t know but I plan on continuing to use them.  I will know more when I have my next eye exam.  I don&#x27;t expect a miracle but it they prevent the macular from getting worse - they are well worth it.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE-SUPER FAST SHIPPING-VERY PLEASED!</li>
            <li> My retina specialist says this is the best &amp; who am I to disagree?!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product</li>
            <li> I have Macular Degeneratin in both eyes, one wet, one dry, so I need to take vitamins daily for them. I found these vitamins to improve my eyesight. I do not know if they are any better than anything else that I have taken although they seem to work. I price compare these and at the time they were below what I could get locally. I will buy them again if they come under what I can buy locally.</li>
            <li> My wife was diagnosed with Macular Degeneration in 2011.  She started taking EyeScience Macular Health Formula immediately upon recommendation of her eye doctor.  So far her condition has not gotten worse.</li>
            <li> The retina doctor says this is a must vitamin for macular degeneration patients.</li>
            <li> Ask your doctor first before buying this product. Took only 2 pills, and they are not fitting with my health.</li>
            <li> This formula contains all of the ingredients which make up a good formula for the eyes, but I personally haven&#x27;t noticed much difference in my condition.</li>
            <li> was delivered on time&lt;br /&gt;safely arrived</li>
            <li> Not sure how good it is, but look at its ingredients (no pictures here, had to go to their website):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lutein:  10mg&lt;br /&gt;Zeaxanthin:  2mg&lt;br /&gt;Bilberry 25%:  15mg&lt;br /&gt;Grapeseed Extract:  20mg&lt;br /&gt;Alpha-Lipoic Acid: 20mg&lt;br /&gt;L-Glutathione: 10mg&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amount of lutein and zeaxanthin are not just about the bottom line of other similar products.</li>
            <li> great service love this</li>
            <li> Excellent results, Thank you</li>
            <li> This is a product that you don&#x27;t necessarily see results with, but it&#x27;s more for preventing eye problems.  My father has macular degeneration, and I want to protect my eyesight the best I can.  Taking these particular antioxidants has been recommended for prevention of MD, so I take two every day.  If my father had known about nutrition and how important antioxidants are, he may have better sight.  He&#x27;s legally blind and there&#x27;s nothing the medical profession can do now.</li>
            <li> Dr prescribed - hope it does the job.</li>
            <li> great, I got my stuff faster than expected!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been taking it long enough to know how it&#x27;s working....</li>
            <li> Rated No 1 by my optomitrist.</li>
            <li> Have only been using this for about 3 weeks, kind of soon to tell for sure but I think it is helping me see better.</li>
            <li> It was a really good price and we will order again from them.</li>
            <li> product as expected and delivery as defined!</li>
            <li> Recommended by my Eye Doctor.  Seems to be working very well.</li>
            <li> item was prescribe by my optometry and I am satisfied with this product&lt;br /&gt;for it can do to my eye problem.</li>
