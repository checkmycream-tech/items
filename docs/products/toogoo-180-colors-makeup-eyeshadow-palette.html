            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>pleased with the palette</li>
            <li>I was pleased</li>
            <li>We got 3 of these when they were on sale, they do take a while to arrive but you get a very nice selection of colors and these arrived with no broken pieces.</li>
            <li>The brown palette is my favorite and my daughter loves the one with the bright wild colors.</li>
            <li>I said fine.</li>
            <li>but I am super glad I got it for what I did.</li>
            <li>This is such a great product</li>
            <li>I thought, for a dollar &amp; free shipping how could i resist this?</li>
            <li>I dont use all the colors of course, so many bright, and so many dark.</li>
            <li>I had a carry on bag but the flight was full and they gate attendants asked the majority of us to check our carry ons for free.</li>
            <li>I like the true to colors, alot to choose from, they go on smoothly</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I&#x27;m enjoying this huge variety of colors and can&#x27;t wait to play with many different design combinations.</li>
            <li>Good pigmentation overall.</li>
            <li>I just received them today and already made quick work of using them.</li>
            <li>and I also like the bold colors.</li>
            <li>I seen that lucky brand made the makeup</li>
            <li>colors are bright and pretty goes on very well,great for a new makeup artist like myself.</li>
            <li>There are three palettes stacked on top of each other, removed from the case very easily with the attached side ribbons.</li>
            <li>it was worth it.</li>
            <li>So worth it.</li>
            <li>The product is very good but not excellent as I did notice the pigmentation is not too much strong.</li>
            <li>Quality wise, some didn&#x27;t have enough pigment to really show the color at all no matter how much I applied.  </li>
            <li>colors are very vibrant!  </li>
            <li>Yes, they&#x27;re chalky with a lot of fallout but they&#x27;re really soft and easy to blend.</li>
            <li>Rather spend few more bucks on a better quality eyeshadow palette than buying this.</li>
            <li>But I had to apply several layers to get a strong pigmentation as I like my makeup to be bold.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant &amp; super pigmented.</li>
            <li>Amazing colors, endless color combo options.</li>
            <li>although there are 5 different whites, none are like a bright white</li>
            <li>other than those flaws its pretty good but take my advice here and buy a different palette..</li>
            <li>I will NEVER spend $20 or more on a single color of shadow again!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Iv&#x27;e now had time to play in the eyeshadows and have to admit that they arent very pigmented, I have to cake it on in order for it to show up on my eyelid</li>
            <li>No matter how much product i apply the colour keeps fading in just mins</li>
            <li>colors are really light,it doesnt really show up on my skin like i would like,must wear concealer to see color</li>
            <li>yes it took a while to ship to me (less then 2 months but more then one),  </li>
            <li>so many different colors on 3 different pallets.</li>
            <li>Some colors are good but some are kinda dull like the white,</li>
            <li>I love to practice doing different new ways of eyeshadow, I test on me (brown hair, brown eyes) &amp; my sister (blonde hair, blue eyes) just to see what shades blend with what eye color and hair.</li>
            <li>It comes with a general colour palette, a vibrant palette, and neutrals.</li>
            <li>The shadows are very pigmented and last all day and night without fading, smudging or collecting in the crease of your eyelid.  </li>
            <li>The blues, pinks and deep purples show really well</li>
            <li>its contains very beautful and pgmegented colors u should buy for gifts and such or for urself!</li>
            <li>when I received it I surprised of its volume and it has all colors I want</li>
            <li>The browns didn&#x27;t have much pigment and had to be applied multiple times before you could see the color.</li>
            <li>I have used M.A.C., Clinique, every drug store brand, Sephora, NYX, Bobbi Brown and many other brands of shadow and the quality of these shadows are comparable to the most expensive, name brand shadows I have used.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for something just for play make up or occasional, then this would be ok but not top quality at all.</li>
            <li>Save your money and go with another palette that is around the same price, it may have less colors but it&#x27;ll be worth it.</li>
            <li>They were shipped pretty securely but I&#x27;m still pretty disappointed...</li>
            <li>They were packaged very well, not a single pot was cracked or broken and the shipping was very speedy.</li>

            <li> but alas I still find that I need to go back over it with my other eyeshadows that are more pigmented.</li>
            <li> My packaging came fully intact except the complete destruction of one pot (a dark brown color I&#x27;d never use anyway).</li>
            <li> so it will last a long time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional makeup artist, but I do dabble with the finer points of it.</li>
            <li> Even when you wet the brush and tap the specific color you want the eyeshadow is NOT intensified (when using primer).</li>
            <li> I wish I would have found these shadows a long time ago and saved myself hundreds and hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li> The key to always getting a great color pay off is to always use an eyeshadow base or primer!</li>
            <li> Dark skinned women may find it not enough pigmented for them.</li>
            <li> Paid the $1 and got it less then 3 weeks later.</li>
            <li> I was so bummed out not what I expected.</li>
            <li> the only thing i would change is that the colors a a bit repetitive...</li>
            <li> I got the first 2 today and out of 360 only two were broken!!</li>
            <li> I cant wait to try other items.</li>
            <li> The yellows and greens need to be applied generously to be seen (but then again I have really dark skin).</li>
            <li> I ordered this to replace a lot of my shadow palates that were old and broken.</li>
            <li> I packed my things neatly and tightly.  </li>
            <li> Have to apply a few coats for colour to show.&lt;br /&gt;Colours are powdering away with a few uses,</li>
            <li> only I got a broken eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I have never used these without applying Loreal Decrease Eye Primer, so I am not sure how they are without.  </li>
            <li> It sucks.</li>
            <li> at least 3 of each color...</li>
            <li> I was surfing late one night for makeup and this caught my eye.</li>
            <li> a day late.</li>
            <li> but each color is very small</li>
            <li> This palette sucks!</li>
            <li> My item just arrived today and 8 pots were broken.</li>
            <li> About 4 colors came broken, had to fix them.</li>
            <li> 7 came broken.</li>
            <li> ribbons broken..</li>
            <li> Not one eyeshadow was broken.</li>
            <li> I must have caught this on a serious sale because I bought it for literally $1!</li>
            <li> How can you go wrong with 180 colours?</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, when I received my eyeshadow palette a couple of shadows were broken.</li>

            <li> This palette has every eyeshadow color you can imagine! It is really nice, especially silly if you enjoy playing with colors or a beginning makeup artist. The key to always getting a great color pay off is to always use an eyeshadow base or primer! If you are thinking of getting this palette don&#x27;t hesitate!! It&#x27;s a really great palette to add to your kit or makeup collection.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to replace a lot of my shadow palates that were old and broken. I was loking for something with a great range of shimmery color choices, and I got it!!! There are three palettes stacked on top of each other, removed from the case very easily with the attached side ribbons. I&#x27;m not a professional makeup artist, but I do dabble with the finer points of it. The pigmentation of these colors were great even without a shadow primer. I would recommend this product to my friends. Also, the item was shopped promptly with no delays.</li>
            <li> My item just arrived today and 8 pots were broken. They were shipped pretty securely but I&#x27;m still pretty disappointed...Once I have played with the colors I will come back and update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/12/12-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iv&#x27;e now had time to play in the eyeshadows and have to admit that they arent very pigmented, I have to cake it on in order for it to show up on my eyelid and I use a primer and base(white) every time I apply eyeshadow...I wanted these to be awesome because there are SO many colors but alas I still find that I need to go back over it with my other eyeshadows that are more pigmented. Save your money and go with another palette that is around the same price, it may have less colors but it&#x27;ll be worth it.</li>
            <li> I took my FASH makeup out of state. I had a carry on bag but the flight was full and they gate attendants asked the majority of us to check our carry ons for free. I said fine. Got back home to see that my eyeshadow palettes were destroyed. I was so made!! Shadow was everywhere. I packed my things neatly and tightly.  But you know when you hand your bags over the people toss em, they fall the the floor and all. Ugh...anyway. I thought to buy this since Amazon was out of FASH at the time. This palette sucks! Even when you wet the brush and tap the specific color you want the eyeshadow is NOT intensified (when using primer). It sucks. I would not recommend this for women of color.</li>
            <li> These colours are amazing. I just received them today and already made quick work of using them. How can you go wrong with 180 colours? Well, you can&#x27;t! They were packaged very well, not a single pot was cracked or broken and the shipping was very speedy. I absolutely love this palette. It comes with a general colour palette, a vibrant palette, and neutrals. The images are very accurate and I&#x27;m thankful for it. I&#x27;m using ELF primer with them and they come out absolutely great!</li>
            <li> They made it to Hawaii in perfect condition!  The shadows are very pigmented and last all day and night without fading, smudging or collecting in the crease of your eyelid.  I have never used these without applying Loreal Decrease Eye Primer, so I am not sure how they are without.  I have used M.A.C., Clinique, every drug store brand, Sephora, NYX, Bobbi Brown and many other brands of shadow and the quality of these shadows are comparable to the most expensive, name brand shadows I have used.  I will NEVER spend $20 or more on a single color of shadow again!  I wish I would have found these shadows a long time ago and saved myself hundreds and hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li> Mine literally just got here about 30minutes ago. I played with most of them for a bit and here&#x27;s what I came up with. The yellows and greens need to be applied generously to be seen (but then again I have really dark skin). The blues, pinks and deep purples show really well and it takes a bit of elbow grease to get them off. My packaging came fully intact except the complete destruction of one pot (a dark brown color I&#x27;d never use anyway). All in all I&#x27;m really pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Thanks, excellent item.... recommended seller.</li>
            <li> For the price, the choice of color is really good. Some colors are good but some are kinda dull like the white, although there are 5 different whites, none are like a bright white it is almost like a see through white. Use a primer so the colors hold to your eyelid.</li>
            <li> VERY NICE COLOR WOULD BUY IT AGAIN AS GIFT NICE COLORS FOR WINTER AND SUMMERLOTS OF COLOR THREE ROWS OF COLORS</li>
            <li> I bought this over a year ago but haven&#x27;t used it. I&#x27;ve done a lot of swatches and I&#x27;m happy with the pigmentation. Yes, they&#x27;re chalky with a lot of fallout but they&#x27;re really soft and easy to blend. Some colors are better than others but you get 180 colors to play with for $20. I got mine for a &amp;#34;once-in-a-lifetime&amp;#34; steal so I can&#x27;t complain. I keep it around as a backup in case I can&#x27;t find a color that I need. Good pigmentation overall.</li>
            <li> We got 3 of these when they were on sale, they do take a while to arrive but you get a very nice selection of colors and these arrived with no broken pieces.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! its contains very beautful and pgmegented colors u should buy for gifts and such or for urself! i got it for 1.00$ at the time</li>
            <li> I like the true to colors, alot to choose from, they go on smoothly and I also like the bold colors.</li>
            <li> I love this palette with 180 colors of eye shadows. But I had to apply several layers to get a strong pigmentation as I like my makeup to be bold. Nevertheless, I&#x27;m enjoying this huge variety of colors and can&#x27;t wait to play with many different design combinations. The product is very good but not excellent as I did notice the pigmentation is not too much strong. Dark skinned women may find it not enough pigmented for them.</li>
            <li> Love it. About 4 colors came broken, had to fix them. But WITH  PRIMER they work wonders!!!</li>
            <li> So many wonderful colors</li>
            <li> It was receive in great conditions..loving it. I recommend it to customers, no dought I will buy it again .</li>
            <li> It came in great condition... colors are very vibrant!  the only thing i would change is that the colors a a bit repetitive... at least 3 of each color... but each color is very small so it will last a long time</li>
            <li> I ordered when they were $1!!! I ordered 4 with FREE SHIPPING!! I got the first 2 today and out of 360 only two were broken!! Love it love it love it!! Yes I waited over a month but it was ONE DOLLAR!!Worth the wait!!</li>
            <li> I must have caught this on a serious sale because I bought it for literally $1! I was surfing late one night for makeup and this caught my eye. Paid the $1 and got it less then 3 weeks later. It is great and I would definitely have paid the current price of $21 for but I am super glad I got it for what I did. The brown palette is my favorite and my daughter loves the one with the bright wild colors.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift. Wished I could purchase another for same price as I pd. My daughter loved it. Great purchase I made.</li>
            <li> I bought this eyeshadow palette as a Christmas present for myself and I loved It. I cant wait to try other items.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product and I only got it for $1 ! yes it took a while to ship to me (less then 2 months but more then one),  it was worth it. so many different colors on 3 different pallets. I thought, for a dollar &amp; free shipping how could i resist this? So glad I didnt not pass it up. I use it every day! I dont use all the colors of course, so many bright, and so many dark. I love to practice doing different new ways of eyeshadow, I test on me (brown hair, brown eyes) &amp; my sister (blonde hair, blue eyes) just to see what shades blend with what eye color and hair. I love it. So worth it.</li>
            <li> Colours dont have intensity and lasting. Have to apply a few coats for colour to show.&lt;br /&gt;Colours are powdering away with a few uses,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mixed on this one.  For the price, it was a great buy, tons and tons of colors to chose from.  Quality wise, some didn&#x27;t have enough pigment to really show the color at all no matter how much I applied.  Darker colors did seem to show up well.  If you are looking for something just for play make up or occasional, then this would be ok but not top quality at all.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, when I received my eyeshadow palette a couple of shadows were broken. I was so bummed out not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Love the colors but they don&#x27;t show up good...</li>
            <li> Doesnt have any company name on it. Its some china manufactured product. No matter how much product i apply the colour keeps fading in just mins and i guess i got allergic to this product. Rather spend few more bucks on a better quality eyeshadow palette than buying this.</li>
            <li> 7 came broken. a day late. yellows and oranges dont turn out too good. ribbons broken.. there the size of a dime exactally. other than those flaws its pretty good but take my advice here and buy a different palette.. (also it has several repeats of colors so its actually like 170 colors.. alwell) amazon has some finer palettes for sale..</li>
            <li> I asked this plate and I was afried if it has good quality or no , and about pigment and shaeds of colors&lt;br /&gt;but when I received it I surprised of its volume and it has all colors I want and when I tested some colors , they rflect same shade in plate and stay with no changeing untill I come from GYM</li>
            <li> colors are really light,it doesnt really show up on my skin like i would like,must wear concealer to see color</li>
            <li> very satisfied with customer service . had some issues with my order and they took care of it in a matter of time . pleased with the palette the colors are amazing and got an amazing deal on it .</li>
            <li> Received my package today. I purchased 3 of these palettes. Each one came in perfect condition, bubble wrapped to the max to ensure their quality. Not one eyeshadow was broken. The colors are vibrant &amp; super pigmented. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering from this seller again.</li>
            <li> They are so pigmented non of them broke they came all in one piece i love them !!! everyone should purchase these product it is AMAZING (:</li>
            <li> great eyeshadows, only I got a broken eyeshadow. I made a good buy, they are beautiful, very vivid! ! !</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a Christmas gift for a family member. I received it in time and she absolutely loved it. For the price it is a great value if you&#x27;re ok with waiting forever to get it.</li>
            <li> nice i thought they where ging to be crappy but they came out to be nice i will recomend this product.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t very satisfied with this product. I seen that lucky brand made the makeup so I thought it would be good quality.  I was pleased When I received the makeup and nothing was broke and the product was packaged good. The greens and blues were very bright but came off too easy and had a chalky feeling. The browns didn&#x27;t have much pigment and had to be applied multiple times before you could see the color.</li>
