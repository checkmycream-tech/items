            <li>Very roomy and well constructed.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s ok...</li>
            <li>It was bigger than I expected and I now have room to get even more make up!</li>
            <li>The material is silky smooth with zippers strong enough to handle at least a dozen rounds of rushed airport security openings.</li>
            <li>Purchased this to replace my old make up bag.</li>
            <li>Higher quality than expected for $20.</li>
            <li>Capable of being slightly compacted/squished for travel but stands up as you need it to.</li>
            <li>This bag was both big enough to fit every single bottle, tool, and pill I needed and small enough to not be intrusive in my carry-on and on tiny hotel bathroom countertops.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s just the right size for all those items whereas other bags were too small and square shaped or way too big.  </li>
            <li> I did add 2 smaller zip gags inside for separation, but the size is small enough to travel and long enough for long handle brushes.  </li>
            <li> Flimsy but as expected for the price.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not a huge deal to me.</li>
            <li> I debated purchasing it because the image made it seem relatively small.</li>

            <li> Absolutely a great bag. I needed a bigger bag for my make up, I couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased! It was bigger than I expected and I now have room to get even more make up! ;) I absolutely recommend this bag. The only thing I wish it had were placements for brushes or pockets but that&#x27;s not a huge deal to me. Love it!!</li>
            <li> This cosmetic bag was so worth the money. it is so large despite the image. I debated purchasing it because the image made it seem relatively small. But, i bought it on a whim and i am very glad i did.</li>
            <li> I was hoping the sides would be a little more sturdy, but it is the perfect size and I don&#x27;t really have any complaints.</li>
            <li> Flimsy but as expected for the price.  Was looking for something sturdier to hold my cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to replace my old make up bag. It&#x27;s just the right size for all my needs. Great for travel! I love it!</li>
            <li> Great bag my wife said it is perfect for her makeup.</li>
            <li> Not as big as I thought.i can&#x27;t zip the bag while my facial essence is standing upright. Other than that it&#x27;s ok... You can get a bigger one for cheaper price at target. ..it serves it purpose..</li>
            <li> Heck of a lot smaller than I thought</li>
            <li> Great bag!  Very roomy and well constructed.</li>
            <li> Higher quality than expected for $20. Capable of being slightly compacted/squished for travel but stands up as you need it to. Pectfect size to fit makeup, brushes, toothpaste, and some lotion.</li>
            <li> Love This, Fits Everything Perfect</li>
            <li> Love this makeup bag, perfect size.</li>
            <li> This cosmetic bag is perfect to hold all of my makeup and beauty products. Whether I&#x27;m on the go or just at home, I use this case daily. The handle is sturdy and the bag has a nice satin finish. Easy to clean, medium sized, and definitely stylish. This is a great organizer and I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my granddaughter, and she loved it!</li>
            <li> It was perfect size and great quality!</li>
            <li> This bag is exactly what I was looking for.  It is the perfect size and very stylish looking.  I had an old bag that I loved but it was falling apart and had been searching for something similar and this bag totally fits the bill.  I use it for more than cosmetics and put my hairbrush, deodorant, face lotion, and other toiletries in it and everything fits and the bag packs perfectly in my suitcase for traveling.  It&#x27;s just the right size for all those items whereas other bags were too small and square shaped or way too big.  I would recommend this bag for someone who is looking for something to hold multiple toiletry items in a stylish travel bag.</li>
            <li> Needed a sturdy bathroom bag that could carry all my toiletries to a series of grad school interviews. This bag was both big enough to fit every single bottle, tool, and pill I needed and small enough to not be intrusive in my carry-on and on tiny hotel bathroom countertops. The material is silky smooth with zippers strong enough to handle at least a dozen rounds of rushed airport security openings. Best of all, it flattens down to nothing when you don&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li> this was a gift but she said she really liked it</li>
            <li> I love this bag.  I did add 2 smaller zip gags inside for separation, but the size is small enough to travel and long enough for long handle brushes.  I love it!!</li>
