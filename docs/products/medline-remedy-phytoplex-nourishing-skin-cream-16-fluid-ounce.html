            <li>Well pleased with product.</li>
            <li>paraben free!</li>

            <li>it works well and the smell is lovely.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>If you want fragrance-free, this is NOT the product for you as the fragrance is strong and lasts.</li>
            <li>Some of the extract ingredients have been removed and the new version doesn&#x27;t smell as good to me.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and easy to distribute evenly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not watery like most lotions I&#x27;ve purchased, which is a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>but I enjoy the smell and the feel of my skin afterwards</li>
            <li>It has kept her skin smooth.</li>
            <li>I guess the product is still good as an option for sensitive skin, but this is no longer one that I would buy again.</li>
            <li>I had to have more and thanks to amazon, I have the pump bottle.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and how it leaves my skin feeling for the whole day.</li>
            <li>A light and fresh citrus scent.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion its not greasy and it is really feel fresh when you used them.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; but does the best job at healing dry skin, then look no further..!!  </li>
            <li>The seller is very trust worthy, no problems at all.  </li>
            <li>so we got large bottles of the cleansing foam and moisturizer instead and are so not sorry we did!  </li>
            <li>First introduced to the product at Mayo Clinic Hospital in Rochester, MN.  </li>
            <li>The first time I applied this product, the itching stopped.</li>
            <li>I first found this in a hospital.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to use these medical lotions because they&#x27;re designed better: they don&#x27;t grow bacteria like commercial lotions will.</li>
            <li>I first used this when I was in the hospital</li>
            <li>I bought this for my grandson&#x27;s dry skin because the Medline sales rep said it was safe for babies.</li>
            <li>In only 1 or 2 applications my skin was very smooth and soft in the leg area that had difficulty.</li>
            <li>Smooths and softens longterm rough skin problem better than anything I&#x27;ve tried..</li>
            <li>Lasts very well.&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>we really like the medline products we have tried</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying this on your baby!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s advertised as hypoallergenic and non-sensitizing which I also appreciated.  </li>
            <li>For some reason this bottle is very sticky.</li>
            <li>Within ONE use, my son&#x27;s skin was much smoother.  </li>
            <li>so I will definitely be ordering more in the future.  </li>
            <li>Best luck so far with pure coconut oil immediately after bath/shower OR plain old petroleum jelly on trouble spots such as elbow or knee.</li>
            <li>and it does help with my new growing skin..</li>
            <li>I use this on me, my 4 yr old &amp; my baby.</li>
            <li>I have a coworker who is extremely sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s old or what</li>
            <li>My 101 year old mother received  a sample of this lotion while she was in the hospital.</li>
            <li>We live in a really dry climate, so I am always looking for some lotion for me and the kiddos that doesn&#x27;t have too much fragrance or alcohol in it and isn&#x27;t greasy like oil.  </li>
            <li>And it has done absolute wonders for my dry and cracked hands!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also extremely thick and doesn&#x27;t blend into the skin as easily with a consistency of vanilla cake icing.  </li>
            <li>Medline offers a whole lot of different skin products and I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THEIR PRODUCTS FOR DIFFERENT SKIN PROBLEMS...!!</li>

            <li> Medline offers a whole lot of different skin products and I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THEIR PRODUCTS FOR DIFFERENT SKIN PROBLEMS...!!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend to anyone with dry skin, or who has small children and doesn&#x27;t want something with too much perfume!</li>
            <li> These ingredients would have raised red flags had I taken the time to investigate each single element thoroughly before purchasing.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, minus these three key ingredients, I would have given Medline Remedy 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The dry, cracked skin soon has disappeared, and now is silly smooth.</li>
            <li> My grandson&#x27;s skin is so dry that it cracks.</li>
            <li> Her skin is like parchment paper...thin and dry.</li>
            <li> UPDATE:  Repurchased late 2016, different bottle label and different formulation (see second answer to &amp;</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> No burning sensation on very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Within hours of applying the cream his skin seemed to heal and be less dry.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is a bit stronger than I expected, but my daughter LOVES it!  </li>
            <li> other products we&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Not oily, not sticky, has a slight vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> My son has started potty training and for some reason the change from diapers has really dried out his little tush.  </li>
            <li> The hospital sent me a small size container of the Phytoplex.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> For several years I&#x27;ve been battling dry, cracked and itchy skin which resulted in open sores and horrible rashes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is thick but not greasy.</li>
            <li> Little expensive though.</li>
            <li> mean miracle -- I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> It was too expensive</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after dissecting the listed ingredients, I discovered it contains two toxic entities, Phenoxyethanol and Butylene Glycol, and one supposed skin carcinogen,</li>

    <ol>
            <li> UPDATE:  Repurchased late 2016, different bottle label and different formulation (see second answer to &amp;#34;What are the ingredients&amp;#34; question).  Some of the extract ingredients have been removed and the new version doesn&#x27;t smell as good to me.  It&#x27;s also extremely thick and doesn&#x27;t blend into the skin as easily with a consistency of vanilla cake icing.  The product wouldn&#x27;t dispense through the pump because of the thickness.  Should be packaged in a jar rather than a bottle.  I guess the product is still good as an option for sensitive skin, but this is no longer one that I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff.  Smooths and softens longterm rough skin problem better than anything I&#x27;ve tried..&lt;br /&gt;Not oily, not sticky, has a slight vanilla scent. Lasts very well.&lt;br /&gt;Got a tiny bottle from a hospital visit,.  Wanted more, but couldn&#x27;t find this product in retail stores.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best skin cream around.</li>
            <li> Excellent service. Just as stated!</li>
            <li> Use it for treating my over-dry skin related to T2 diabetes.  First introduced to the product at Mayo Clinic Hospital in Rochester, MN.  Helps repair cracked skin and prevent further damage.  Works wonderfully.  Keep a bottle at work and one at home.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Moisturizes very well, non-greasy and smells great! Lotion stays on for hours.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this lotion does a wonderful job of nourishing it.  I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  We used the face spray and ran out so I came looking for it again.  It was too expensive so we got large bottles of the cleansing foam and moisturizer instead and are so not sorry we did!  I love the smell of them.  They make my skin look and feel refreshed.  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t skin cream. This is a miracle. For several years I&#x27;ve been battling dry, cracked and itchy skin which resulted in open sores and horrible rashes. The first time I applied this product, the itching stopped. By the second use, the sores were healing. The dry, cracked skin soon has disappeared, and now is silly smooth. My favourite thing is the light, pleasant smell. This is just the best cream --I mean miracle -- I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> we really like the medline products we have tried</li>
            <li> The fragrance is a bit stronger than I expected, but my daughter LOVES it!  She asks for it every morning and night.  It&#x27;s definitely not watery like most lotions I&#x27;ve purchased, which is a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job. Was recommended by a Nurse Practitioner in a local wound clinic and some of her staff members who also named Amazon as their source.  In only 1 or 2 applications my skin was very smooth and soft in the leg area that had difficulty. I continue to use it daily. It works!</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion that I have found! I work in the healthcare field and look into the skin care products for our hospital, so I see all the fancy stuff. This is the best! After I used up the samples our rep. gave us I had to have more and thanks to amazon, I have the pump bottle. I use this on me, my 4 yr old &amp; my baby. The smell is a pleasant vanilla. I have a coworker who is extremely sensitive to smells and she not only complimented the scent but began using it herself! Just try it and you&#x27;ll be hooked. Way to go medline!</li>
            <li> Well pleased with product. I received a tube during a recent hospital stay &amp; found lotion to be smoothe on skin, GREAT scent &amp; moisterizes skin wonderfully!</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer. .. paraben free! Excellent deal! Plus it smells like vanilla cupcakes! Yummy!</li>
            <li> I use this on my newborn after she broke out from Johnson&#x27;s and Aveeno.  Even with the vanilla scent it still doesn&#x27;t irritate her skin.  I highly recommend trying this on your baby!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff...!!  If you&#x27;re looking for something &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; but does the best job at healing dry skin, then look no further..!!  For me, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  Of course, everyone is different and it may not work for some but I enjoy the smell and the feel of my skin afterwards so I will definitely be ordering more in the future.  The seller is very trust worthy, no problems at all.  Medline offers a whole lot of different skin products and I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THEIR PRODUCTS FOR DIFFERENT SKIN PROBLEMS...!!</li>
            <li> I first found this in a hospital. Love the smell and how it leaves my skin feeling for the whole day. Little expensive though.</li>
            <li> This is the best skin care product EVER!</li>
            <li> I work as a Radiation Therapist and read a report in one of my journals that this skin cream was excellent for radiation dermatitis  (skin irritation). I recommended it to patient, who happened to be a nurse, she used it daily with excellent results.  She said she used it all over her body because it felt so good. She said she would recommend to anyone for any reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon her recommendation I got a bottle for my wife and she uses it every day.  She says that her skin is moisturized without feeling greasy. We have reordered it several times and my wife does not want to be without it.  A great product!  Try it.</li>
            <li> Great lotion! I wash my hands a LOT! This stuff is good to have in the kitchen.</li>
            <li> I had an fire accident last April of 2015 which 40%of my body was burned. The hospital sent me a small size container of the Phytoplex.&lt;br /&gt; I love this lotion its not greasy and it is really feel fresh when you used them. I used them on my face, my arms and my legs and it does help with my new growing skin..</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandson&#x27;s dry skin because the Medline sales rep said it was safe for babies. My grandson&#x27;s skin is so dry that it cracks. Within hours of applying the cream his skin seemed to heal and be less dry. I just wish I could find this product locally at Longs, Walmart or Walgreens.</li>
            <li> All of this Companies line of Skin Care Products are superior to most others.</li>
            <li> It is good  for  Sikes. I liked and very good  siken cram.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first-time user of Medline Remedy Phytoplex Skin Cream.  I chose this product after scanning the list of nature-based ingredients present in this skin cream&#x27;s contents. It&#x27;s advertised as hypoallergenic and non-sensitizing which I also appreciated.  The cream goes on and absorbs like silk with no oily or greasy feeling whatsoever.  However, before I purchased, I should have further researched each and every component contained in Medline Remedy Skin Cream. Unfortunately, after dissecting the listed ingredients, I discovered it contains two toxic entities, Phenoxyethanol and Butylene Glycol, and one supposed skin carcinogen, PEG-100. These ingredients would have raised red flags had I taken the time to investigate each single element thoroughly before purchasing.  Therefore, minus these three key ingredients, I would have given Medline Remedy 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Non-offensive smell.  Goes on smooth and easy to distribute evenly.  No burning sensation on very dry skin.  Did not moisturize as well as other products we&#x27;ve tried.  Best luck so far with pure coconut oil immediately after bath/shower OR plain old petroleum jelly on trouble spots such as elbow or knee.</li>
            <li> Although a bit pricy this is the best or second bets (Heptz ids great too) moisturizing lotion I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;m an RN, and my hospital uses this line of soap and lotion. I goggled it and found it here on Amazon. It&#x27;s better to use these medical lotions because they&#x27;re designed better: they don&#x27;t grow bacteria like commercial lotions will. I attended a class taught by an infection control nurse who said putting commercial lotion on after washing your hands is equivalent to not washing your hands at all: you&#x27;re just putting bacteria back on your hands! So I stick to this stuff. And it smells great! It has a cookie/vanilla sent going on.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I have ever used!!</li>
            <li> The first bottle I got was wonderful. For some reason this bottle is very sticky. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s old or what but it doesn&#x27;t feel as good on my skin...</li>
            <li> I received the lotion promptly and in great condition.  My 101 year old mother received  a sample of this lotion while she was in the hospital. Her skin is like parchment paper...thin and dry. This lotion has made a wonderful improvement  to her skin health. I have also started  using it and it leaves my hands silky. Will definitely  purchase  it again.</li>
            <li> We live in a really dry climate, so I am always looking for some lotion for me and the kiddos that doesn&#x27;t have too much fragrance or alcohol in it and isn&#x27;t greasy like oil.  While I love coconut oil, this is awesome to use when you don&#x27;t have time for the greasy feeling to soak into your hands.  I feel like it actually coats your skin without feeling greasy.  My son has started potty training and for some reason the change from diapers has really dried out his little tush.  I was trying everything, and my sister (who is a nurse) said that they use this at her hospital, so I thought I would try it.  Within ONE use, my son&#x27;s skin was much smoother.  I use this all of the time now.  I would definitely recommend to anyone with dry skin, or who has small children and doesn&#x27;t want something with too much perfume!</li>
            <li> Bottle had leaked.  I order this regularly for my mother who had venous stasis leg ulcers.  After they were treated and healed the wound care doctor suggested this moisturizer.  It has kept her skin smooth.</li>
            <li> I first used this when I was in the hospital and I am sooo thankful to have found it on Amazon! It truly is the best hand lotion I have ever used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is thick but not greasy. A light and fresh citrus scent. And it has done absolute wonders for my dry and cracked hands!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing product at a great price!</li>
            <li> Love this- it works well and the smell is lovely.  If you want fragrance-free, this is NOT the product for you as the fragrance is strong and lasts.</li>
            <li> I work in the Medical field and use this product often.  I love this stuff.</li>
