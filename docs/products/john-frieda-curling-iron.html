            <li>My hair seems to get shinier and more beautiful looking when I curl it.</li>
            <li>she said it better be as good as one i have, i said dont worry amazon reviews say it is a great one.</li>
            <li>Being able to set the heat temperature for your hair needs keeps your hair in great condition.</li>
            <li>I love this iron and would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>This curling iron is easy to use to get great results.</li>
            <li>That was a good decision, because I love it.  </li>
            <li>So glad that I bought this - I love John Frieda hair care products!</li>
            <li>when you use it, it&#x27;s easy to accidentally change temps or turn off!</li>
            <li>The barrel is a good size and it heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I agree with others about the placement of the heat settings and having to make sure that your finger doesn&#x27;t inadvertently change it.  </li>
            <li>This curling iron is just okay.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this curling iron for a couple of weeks now, and I like it more than any curling iron I&#x27;ve ever owned (and I&#x27;ve had many).  </li>
            <li>I have changed the setting inadvertently on more than one occasion.  </li>
            <li>It curled (more like waved) the bottom but didn&#x27;t curl the top of the piece at all.</li>
            <li>I could make a better curl with my straitener.</li>
            <li>The product is ok</li>
            <li>I wanted beach waves and elegant curls.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s no way I would be able to get voluminous curls with this iron.</li>
            <li>Glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE DESIGN</li>
            <li>I love how it is anti frizz.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>The curling iron heats up quickly and makes nice curls.</li>
            <li>Also, the stand swings around so easily that it often gets in the way when I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li>The cloth it comes with lets you store it quickly and safely</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, there is no on/off indicator light.  </li>
            <li>You get done quickly with beautiful loose curls.</li>
            <li>My one complaint is that the handle gets quite warm, but for the money this is a great curling iron.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and is the best I&#x27;ve had for keeping my thick wavy hair smooth when humid.  </li>
            <li>Old school curlers used to just fry your hair, these give them a nice gloss.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect - does exactly what I need it to, loose curls and added body for my long hair - love that beach wave look!</li>
            <li>I quickly ordered it and it was here for me to use in no time.</li>
            <li>it gives great big curls and heats up really fast</li>
            <li>The gray plastic part at the end gets very hot and burns my finger when I need to hold it to curl my hair.  </li>
            <li>Setting the temperature is easy and quick, and heats super fast.</li>
            <li>heats up quickly, doesn&#x27;t pull on hair, lightweight, makes pretty curls.</li>
            <li>This iron heats up quickly and gets as hot as I need it.  </li>
            <li>Well the reviews are right she absolutey loves it</li>
            <li>The buttons are right where your hand needs to be placed.</li>
            <li>---maybe I hold it differently than most people, but I doubt it.  </li>
            <li>After many uses, I found that this doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li>The end gets hotter than my Hot Tools</li>
            <li>The tip will get quite hot at the highest temps.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I have curled a few strands on my hair and it works good.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m very careful to make sure I don&#x27;t change the setting---I don&#x27;t want to burn my hair!</li>
            <li>the heat control buttons are not in a smart location.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast, has a long cord, and overall was a good buy.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to hold, it clamps down enough, and glides through hair easily.</li>
            <li>I only realized I turned it off when the motor sound stopped.</li>
            <li>The temperature can be set where you want it, a feature I really like</li>
            <li>Heats up fast too.</li>
            <li>She said it heats up fast in like 30 seconds and curls her hair very well.</li>
            <li>It makes big smooth curls with no frizz.</li>
            <li>I use both hands, one on the part below the barrel and the other on the top tip to help curl.  </li>
            <li>This tip is much to small, so I keep touching the hot barrel.  </li>
            <li>My only issue with it, which is not that big a deal but more of a nuisance, is that it does not save the heat setting that you want it to stay at.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, heats up fast, and comes with a little mat to set on the sink to avoid burning the sink.  </li>
            <li>but I would like to communicate that the item became hot after it is used for a long period.</li>
            <li>Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do without any glitches that I have determined, so far, after a couple months&#x27; use.</li>
            <li>This curling iron definitely gets hot enough for my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very loud, but I have never had a curling iron make a noise the whole time it&#x27;s turned on.  </li>
            <li>My old curling iron sort of blew up when I was using it, and it was several years old.  </li>
            <li>I love this curling iron so far, I have been using it on my long thick hair for a week and it seems to curl well at 400 degrees.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the only flaw I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>It heats up really fast so be careful not to burn yourself.</li>
            <li>I know sometimes it takes curling irons and straighteners a few uses to get up to full potential.</li>
            <li>Some of the reviews about the buzzing had me a little worried before I ordered, but it&#x27;s very unnoticeable.</li>
            <li>The only real complaint I have it that I have burned by hand on the tip of it because it is pretty close to the same color as the whole barrel.</li>

            <li> The only real complaint I have it that I have burned by hand on the tip of it because it is pretty close to the same color as the whole barrel.</li>
            <li> Suddenly died for no apparent reason.  </li>
            <li> that may be as hot as an oven, and me clumsy, I have burned myself at times on all I have owned.</li>
            <li> - ITS BIG so BIG curls - little bigger than I wanted&lt;</li>
            <li> I have it in 2 sizes and use one or the other daily.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> So every single time when I turn the curling iron on, I need to set it to 400.</li>
            <li> so this curling iron gives me loose wavy curls.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is that the cool tip on the end is a little small.</li>
            <li> Works well but have to be careful to not burn myself.</li>
            <li> However, the settings only change if you are holding the button down for a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers...</li>
            <li> So be careful!</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair dry and frizzy looking with little crimp/clamp marks everywhere.</li>
            <li> My 2nd complaint is the tip of the curling iron is too small and is almost the same color as the barrel.  </li>
            <li> The cord is thick enough not to tangle, unlike a cheaper one I also bought (Andis brand).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always nervous that I&#x27;m turning it off or moving the temp up and down.</li>
            <li> The curling iron slides down your hair without getting tangled.</li>
            <li> frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> , I think you just can&#x27;t hold the iron so tight that you push them.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t even use it after a few try.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have any pulling with a few hairs being caught.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few curling iron that works well on my hard-to-curl hair.  </li>
            <li> It holds the hair easily no matter the lock size.</li>
            <li> My 3rd and final complaint is that the buttons are placed in a bad area.  </li>
            <li> I got used to avoiding burns (usually).</li>
            <li> I have thick hard to curl hair</li>
            <li> My 1st complaint with the product is that when I turn it on it makes a noise like the motor is running.  </li>
            <li> The buttons are in a terrible place - you hit them as you use it constantly, but that has never really been a problem.</li>
            <li> It makes it very hard to tell if it is turned on.</li>
            <li> but i got the wrong size.</li>
            <li> I am unhappy with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife because her curling iron was going bad without her approval.</li>
            <li> :((&lt;br /&gt;Turns on, says 400 degrees, and isn&#x27;t even lukewarm.</li>
            <li> Temp adjustment is in a really bad spot!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is awful.</li>
            <li> The worst curling iron ever.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> You do have to click this puppy on once you plug it in - a safety feature I guess. The buttons are in a terrible place - you hit them as you use it constantly, but that has never really been a problem. Heats up fast, has a long cord, and overall was a good buy.</li>
            <li> LOVE this curling iron.  I agree with others about the placement of the heat settings and having to make sure that your finger doesn&#x27;t inadvertently change it.  I have thick hard to curl hair and although I can&#x27;t achieve &amp;#34;ringlets&amp;#34; with this iron it gives my hair body and beachy type curls AND does not burn the ends!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife because her curling iron was going bad without her approval. she said it better be as good as one i have, i said dont worry amazon reviews say it is a great one. Well the reviews are right she absolutey loves it</li>
            <li> This was a great curling iron that heated up wonderfully and curled great.  HOWEVER, there is no on/off indicator light.  It makes it very hard to tell if it is turned on.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is just okay.  The barrel is a good size and it heats up quickly.  My 1st complaint with the product is that when I turn it on it makes a noise like the motor is running.  It&#x27;s not very loud, but I have never had a curling iron make a noise the whole time it&#x27;s turned on.  My 2nd complaint is the tip of the curling iron is too small and is almost the same color as the barrel.  When curling my hair I use both hands, one on the part below the barrel and the other on the top tip to help curl.  This tip is much to small, so I keep touching the hot barrel.  It doesn&#x27;t help that the tip is almost the same color as the barrel.  My 3rd and final complaint is that the buttons are placed in a bad area.  When curling my hair, I accidently pushed the heat temp button, which made it get hotter without me knowing.  I also pressed the on/off switch by accident. I only realized I turned it off when the motor sound stopped. The buttons are right where your hand needs to be placed. Since it was so inexpensive, I&#x27;m debating if I want to keep it or return it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I paid double the price. I could of bought elsewhere cheaper,&lt;br /&gt;It came with a American Plug, I then had to go and buy a adaptor for it.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to Rtn it but could not not print the rtns slip. I did speak to customer services and they weren&#x27;t helpful.&lt;br /&gt;And also I receceived it one day and the deadline for Rtn was the next day, what&#x27;s all that about.&lt;br /&gt;So something for £28.00 cost me just short of £80.00 criminal.&lt;br /&gt;Why do you sell American electricals when we are in UK, beggars belief.</li>
            <li> The gray plastic part at the end gets very hot and burns my finger when I need to hold it to curl my hair.  I have very long hair and I need to use both hands in order to curl my hair.  I would have to pay for shipping both way if I were to return it.  I am unhappy with this product.</li>
            <li> My old curling iron sort of blew up when I was using it, and it was several years old.  I almost bought the same one again, then I saw the John Frieda curling iron and decided to give it a try.  That was a good decision, because I love it.  It is easy to use, heats up fast, and comes with a little mat to set on the sink to avoid burning the sink.  So glad that I bought this - I love John Frieda hair care products!</li>
            <li> I saw this curling iron at Walmart, but discovered that it was several dollars cheaper through Amazon - what a surprise! I quickly ordered it and it was here for me to use in no time. It&#x27;s perfect - does exactly what I need it to, loose curls and added body for my long hair - love that beach wave look!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this curling iron for a couple of weeks now, and I like it more than any curling iron I&#x27;ve ever owned (and I&#x27;ve had many).  The temperature can be set where you want it, a feature I really like but it is related to my only caution.  I have changed the setting inadvertently on more than one occasion.  Maybe it&#x27;s me---maybe I hold it differently than most people, but I doubt it.  Now I&#x27;m very careful to make sure I don&#x27;t change the setting---I don&#x27;t want to burn my hair!</li>
            <li> Worked amazingly...for a whopping 1.5months.  Suddenly died for no apparent reason.  :((&lt;br /&gt;Turns on, says 400 degrees, and isn&#x27;t even lukewarm.</li>
            <li> Works well but my hair tends to catch in the back of the barrel. Also, the stand swings around so easily that it often gets in the way when I&#x27;m using it. The power button on the handle is also protruded so when you use it, it&#x27;s easy to accidentally change temps or turn off!</li>
            <li> Temp adjustment is in a really bad spot! When using, location of temperature setting is in the way. Nice heat ,just using it keeps causing it to change just by using it! :(</li>
            <li> After many uses, I found that this doesn&#x27;t get hot enough. I know sometimes it takes curling irons and straighteners a few uses to get up to full potential. I just found that this doesn&#x27;t heat up enough to make my hair curl.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how anyone gets curls with this iron. It curled (more like waved) the bottom but didn&#x27;t curl the top of the piece at all. I could make a better curl with my straitener. I returned this.</li>
            <li> The product is ok but I would like to communicate that the item became hot after it is used for a long period.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like it.. don&#x27;t even use it after a few try. just taking space in my bathroom drawer at this point.&lt;br /&gt;not recommend it</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron so far, I have been using it on my long thick hair for a week and it seems to curl well at 400 degrees. The end gets hotter than my Hot Tools one did, but I wear a knit glove on one hand anyway so I can hold the curl while it cools (stays longer) so it doesn&#x27;t bother me. Setting the temperature is easy and quick, and heats super fast.</li>
            <li> This iron works great, even when my hair is damp no scorching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for curl and straightening either way it does a great job.  Heats up fast too.</li>
            <li> Works well but have to be careful to not burn myself.</li>
            <li> Heats up enough to burn your hand, not to style your hair. I wanted beach waves and elegant curls. Got none.&lt;br /&gt;Just frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> The picture on the box is misleading...there&#x27;s no way I would be able to get voluminous curls with this iron. It doesn&#x27;t curl at all! I agree with the other reviewers...the heat control buttons are not in a smart location. However, the settings only change if you are holding the button down for a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m returning this. Maybe I got a defective one, because it definitely doesn&#x27;t work properly. Very disappointed. I&#x27;ve given up on 1.5\\&quot; curling irons.</li>
            <li> The curling iron heats up quickly and makes nice curls. The only negative is that the cool tip on the end is a little small.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and is the best I&#x27;ve had for keeping my thick wavy hair smooth when humid.  It holds the hair easily no matter the lock size. The tip will get quite hot at the highest temps. I got used to avoiding burns (usually). With irons reaching temps. that may be as hot as an oven, and me clumsy, I have burned myself at times on all I have owned. The cord is thick enough not to tangle, unlike a cheaper one I also bought (Andis brand). I would order this brand again.</li>
            <li> This curling iron does what it states...heats up quickly, doesn&#x27;t pull on hair, lightweight, makes pretty curls. My only issue with it, which is not that big a deal but more of a nuisance, is that it does not save the heat setting that you want it to stay at. So for example I use it at 400. So every single time when I turn the curling iron on, I need to set it to 400. Otherwise, it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. Some of the reviews about the buzzing had me a little worried before I ordered, but it&#x27;s very unnoticeable. It has to be very quiet to hear that noise. I love this iron and would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> My hair seems to get shinier and more beautiful looking when I curl it. Old school curlers used to just fry your hair, these give them a nice gloss. I just wish the makers of all hair tools would not but the on/off and temp buttons on the handle. When you&#x27;re using them I&#x27;m always nervous that I&#x27;m turning it off or moving the temp up and down. That&#x27;s the only flaw I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is easy to use to get great results. Being able to set the heat temperature for your hair needs keeps your hair in great condition. You get done quickly with beautiful loose curls. The curling iron slides down your hair without getting tangled. You don&#x27;t have any pulling with a few hairs being caught. It reduces any fly-away hairs. The cloth it comes with lets you store it quickly and safely so you don&#x27;t have things setting out or pets getting burned while you are gone. The designers out did themselves with this model.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t curl at all.  Don&#x27;t waste your time with this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> This curling iron definitely gets hot enough for my hair. It is very easy to hold, it clamps down enough, and glides through hair easily. My one complaint is that the handle gets quite warm, but for the money this is a great curling iron.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few curling iron that works well on my hard-to-curl hair.  I have it in 2 sizes and use one or the other daily.</li>
            <li> good curling iron, but i got the wrong size. The only real complaint I have it that I have burned by hand on the tip of it because it is pretty close to the same color as the whole barrel. So be careful!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who wanted s curling iron and she loves it. She said it heats up fast in like 30 seconds and curls her hair very well. It makes big smooth curls with no frizz.</li>
            <li> So so.&lt;br /&gt;Pros - its big so big curls&lt;br /&gt;Cons - ITS BIG so BIG curls - little bigger than I wanted&lt;br /&gt;It also has the heat setting as a button on the handle...the part you grip -- so when rolling up my hair, the settings were all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;I felt like my hair was fried some after use.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to replace my curling iron of about 10 years. I considered several brands but selected this one. It had great reviews. It arrived on time and works great!</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do without any glitches that I have determined, so far, after a couple months&#x27; use.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is awful. Every time I use it it leaves clamp marks in my hair even though I&#x27;m curling with the barrel, not against it. It leaves my hair dry and frizzy looking with little crimp/clamp marks everywhere. The worst curling iron ever.</li>
            <li> This iron heats up quickly and gets as hot as I need it.  I have shoulder length medium thickness hair so this curling iron gives me loose wavy curls.  I haven&#x27;t had an issue with the on/off switch like others, I think you just can&#x27;t hold the iron so tight that you push them.  The tip, while close to the same color as the barrel, is large/long enough that I haven&#x27;t had a problem with holding it-just pay attention to what you&#x27;re doing and all is well.  The price can&#x27;t be beat.  Glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have curled a few strands on my hair and it works good. It heats up really fast so be careful not to burn yourself. I LOVE THE DESIGN IT&#x27;S A GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> great curling iron I love how it is anti frizz.  it gives great big curls and heats up really fast</li>
