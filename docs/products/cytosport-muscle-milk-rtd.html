            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t have to be refrigerated in case she doesn&#x27;t get around to drinking it...</li>
            <li>this is one product that&#x27;s safe for her to have.</li>
            <li>Banana is our favorite flavor and can&#x27;t wait to try others</li>
            <li>I love Muscle Mike</li>

            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I purchased your new 40 gram shake and it is a loser in my opinion.</li>
            <li>my protein is now up to 4.0 in getting higher which is helping to get the fluid off at dialysis.</li>
            <li>Not bitter or offensive.&lt;br /&gt;Especially helpful for diabetics who need to manage their protein daily..</li>

            <li> This company provided excellent service. My order came quickly, they responded to my email within hours and I can&#x27;t have asked for more. Also, I was hesitant in ordering because someone reviewed that that didn&#x27;t carry a certain flavor although it showed as in stock.  So I will actually list what I ordered: Muscle Milk rtd banana creme 12 pack-14 ounce bottles. Again, awesome service and I will definitely order again when my 3 cases runs out!</li>
            <li> This is the best tasting Muscle Milk out there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this case to help me achieve my protein intake after workout days.&lt;br /&gt;It can be used as a small meal replacement too if needed.&lt;br /&gt;Tastes awesome and has 25g of protein.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part about it is you just pull it out of the fridge and drink.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, excellent shipping!</li>
            <li> The original Muscle Milk in Vanilla and Banana are delicious! Please continue them in the 14 oz 12 pack! I purchased your new 40 gram shake and it is a loser in my opinion. It tastes like your powdered product which I do not like and will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Nice way to get your protein - smooth and soft banana taste. Not bitter or offensive.&lt;br /&gt;Especially helpful for diabetics who need to manage their protein daily..</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son. he loves this flavor and you can hardly ever find it in stores!!</li>
            <li> I have been using these as meal replacements in the morning, add half a frozen banana, some greek yogurt and blend and its the greatest and fast high protein meal...</li>
            <li> Good product, good flavor, a bit pricey, but much less sugar than Ensure.</li>
            <li> Tastes good and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I got this for my teenage daughter to have in her school lunches and while playing 18 holes of golf. I love that it doesn&#x27;t have to be refrigerated in case she doesn&#x27;t get around to drinking it... I can put it back in the fridge and all is good. She loves the taste. Lunch is late for her school and deli sandwiches don&#x27;t stay cold enough long enough so this was a great alternative. She&#x27;s also allergic to soy protein and peanuts... this is one product that&#x27;s safe for her to have. We tried the paper containers of Muscle Milk and she says they are watery. Go for the plastic bottles.</li>
            <li> very tasty and nourishing. A nice pick me up before the workout.  Banana is our favorite flavor and can&#x27;t wait to try others</li>
            <li> low carb, great flavor</li>
            <li> Best supplement for lean protein I have used to date.  Highly recommended.  Great Taste :-D&lt;br /&gt;Great way for a positive life</li>
            <li> I love Muscle Mike it is just what the Doctor ordered . I was told that I had to get  my protein up so I had to look around for something and I found muscle milk which works great my protein is now up to 4.0 in getting higher which is helping to get the fluid off at dialysis.</li>
            <li> It is pretty calorie dense. I like it as a handy meal before exercise or a recovery drink after a long cardio session.  The taste is very sweet, and if it&#x27;s chilled it is tasty. The cost is high for a beverage, but not for a light meal, which is what this really is.</li>
            <li> Great taste and convenient!</li>
            <li> Love the taste and great product, gives me that boost of protein when I need it.</li>
            <li> The best in taste and nourishment.&lt;br /&gt;The price is right.</li>
            <li> very good taste and it gives me the healthy energy that i need throught the day</li>
