            <li>Samy Fat Hair Thickening Creme is a great product.  </li>

            <li>Great resultsi....</li>
            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>Excellent for baby fine hair like mine!</li>
            <li>I use it in conjunction with the Chi volumzing spray for even more impressive results; but this stuff is good all by itself.  </li>
            <li>Good product, good seller.</li>
            <li>I was delighted to find I could still purchase it on Amazon  </li>
            <li>good stuff.</li>
            <li>came quick, works great!</li>
            <li>product I received did not include the \\&quot;50% more free\\&quot; as printed on the product itself!</li>
            <li>I just wanted to update the review with the positive results from Febstore&#x27;s excellent customer service.</li>
            <li>It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and my hair looks amazing when I use it.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>and this is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried dozens of hair thickeners/root lifters for my fine hair, and this is the absolute best product on the market.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Scent is mild and pleasant.</li>
            <li>This does make my fine hair feel thicker, but it&#x27;s so sticky!  </li>
            <li>, my fingers will stick together and it won&#x27;t go through the hair very smoothly.</li>
            <li>DO NOT use a huge glob of this!</li>
            <li>br /&gt;and see if that has more of an effect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love Fat Hair Thickening Creme - however, what I received was not Thickening Creme, but Amplifying Creme.</li>
            <li>So glad its on Amazon.</li>
            <li>You will love this stuff if you tease your hair, which is what I do.</li>
            <li>Such an excellent product!  </li>
            <li>I love the prouct.</li>
            <li>, I thought maybe I&#x27;d do better with 2 products that match.  </li>
            <li>It did nothing to make it look like it had more body.  </li>
            <li>Neutral odor ales it appropriate for both genders.  </li>
            <li>I was glad Amazon carries this product, because Walgreen no longer carries it.</li>
            <li>I have used &amp;#34;Fat Hair&amp;#34; for a couple of years and really love how it works with my hair.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t ask for a better product.  </li>
            <li>&#x3D; poofy volume :)</li>
            <li>*just make sure</li>
            <li>ANYMORE,I LOVE THIOS HAIR CREAM.</li>
            <li>Love the product, but this is not the product I received.</li>
            <li>and it was OK.  </li>
            <li>More than that</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>* Important!  </li>
            <li>I have tried many setting lotions</li>
            <li>I  took away one star because if I use more than the tiniest dab</li>
            <li>Adds more texture to fine hair.</li>
            <li>I really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I imagine it would be great for men with thinning hair, or anyone who wants more hair or thicker hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine and it gives it body and fullness.  </li>
            <li>I keep the product for free.  </li>
            <li>Only a pea size amount works great for medium length hair.</li>
            <li>It looks just as good on day 2, not heavy or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend because it has better hold and better effects....</li>
            <li>Otherwise the hair turns too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair with a nice shine.&lt;br /&gt;For normal lift</li>
            <li>I find that if you really work it in and rough your hair up, that&#x27;s what works best.</li>
            <li>Not sure they advertise this, but really good for keeping static away!  </li>
            <li>I love this product so much.</li>
            <li>I was contacted by Febstore and issued a full refund.  </li>
            <li>This product help thicken my hair and keeps it full all day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty amazing product and I can highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have pretty fine hair and have always wished it was thicker....</li>
            <li>Seller shipped it quickly under Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li>I personally find it works best if I towel-dry my hair immediately after stepping out of the shower, wetting my hands with a bit of water and only using about the width of a dime of this product.  </li>
            <li>I can see how one could go through the 5.25oz bottle rather quickly.</li>
            <li>When my white hair began to show signs of thinning, I found Fat Hair and fell in love with my hair again!  </li>
            <li>I have lots of fine, silky, straight hair.  </li>
            <li>I have straight fine hair</li>
            <li>It does not leave my hair sticky, and just a little is all you need for great body.  </li>
            <li>I love the natural lift and body</li>
            <li>This stuff is soooo good at giving me lots of volume and body though it does stiffen my hair a bit as other reviewers have stated.  </li>
            <li>I LUV it, priced right</li>
            <li>The price is super low and this cream leaves my hair feeling great especially after using heat styling.</li>
            <li>Use a small dime sized amount, smear it around in your hands, and apply this FIRST at the roots on the very top of your head where you want the volume...make sure that you really work it in.</li>
            <li>Definitely do not use too much because it will make your hair kind of sticky along with any product used in excess.</li>
            <li>Seems to dry out my hair but does provide a nice amount of volume.</li>
            <li>I wear my hair quite short and the product I use, after shampooing, is very important.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because I read it was very much like Living Proof Thickening Cream...</li>
            <li>I apply it to damp hair before blow drying, and it makes my fine, naturally wavy hair blow out fuller.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First, I should mention I live in a drier climate, so it will work better for me than than those who live in humid areas.  </li>
            <li>FIRST OFF...</li>
            <li>only better I didn&#x27;t have to run all over town to find it.</li>
            <li>and I use this product religiously to give me volume on top.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried just about everything under the sun and this is the only stuff that makes my hair look like a model&#x27;s :)  </li>
            <li>I will definitely order more.  </li>
            <li>It is pink colored and smells nice.</li>
            <li>It will work for you, but every hair type is different, so one method of use isn&#x27;t always good for the next person.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have the type of fine hair that gets weighed down easily it may not work as well.  </li>
            <li>One warning, less is more!  </li>
            <li>This works nicely, it does give a lot of texture and thickens your hair,  but its not real easy to style with.</li>
            <li>Your product came in a very timely manner and it was exactly as I purchase at the store</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the same and does not work on my fine hair like the Thickening Creme</li>
            <li>much as I hoped this would work, I will not purchase this again.</li>
            <li>You might want to experiment with it to see how much is too much and</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need to much to thicken your hair.</li>
            <li>This product made my hair very greasy .</li>
            <li>It is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>but none did much of anything they advertised.</li>
            <li>and if you use it straight from the bottle it will be like trying to apply glue; it won&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>How I used was applied to damp hair by adding small dab to hands and rubbing together (like you would to wash hands) then rub fingertips to scalp area (especially on top and sides), and then flip head down to blow-dry hair</li>
            <li>meaning we are more susceptible to oily/greasy looking hair, so not a whole lot of any product is needed (UNLESS ITS HAIRSPRAY!</li>
            <li>Anyone with super thin hair like mine will LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li>While I won&#x27;t admit to being old, I will agree that I am &amp;#34;of a certain age&amp;#34;!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s overwhelming for my fine, thin hair, and I just want a shampoo.  </li>
            <li>to lightly comb/style (I use a pick) after you dry or else</li>
            <li>A little sticky in the beginning but OK.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice hold without the hard glue feel.</li>
            <li>I am an African American with fine, relaxed hair.  </li>
            <li>I keep searching for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>how much is too little, because MY hair is natural blonde and very very fine...</li>
            <li>experience is not the same as what the product&#x27;s description reads: &amp;#34;This ultra lightweight thickening crème adds incredible fullness, volume and body, while adding texture and shine to your style&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;For me it felt greasy when applied and remained greasy and heavy in my hair, especially if I let it air dry (which I like to do).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really expensive compared to similar products I&#x27;ve tried, which is also a plus.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was a bit pricey, but I think the bottle will last me way over a year!</li>
            <li>Small amounts when applying is better.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to only use a little bit (dime size) because otherwise it makes your hair hard and give it that \\&quot;hairspray\\&quot; look even if you do, you can brush it out pretty easily.</li>
            <li>It is a waste of money unless you have lots of fine hair.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes based on other customers&#x27; reviews.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to make my hair stand up a bit more, but nothing really dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t make hair stiff or greasy</li>
            <li>It truly does what it was designed to do - &amp;#34;plumps up&amp;#34; each strand of hair and completely eliminates flatness and dullness.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until I tried Fat Hair Thickening Cream I finally found a product that actually worked more than I ever expected.  </li>
            <li>I had absolutely no trouble receiving it---and I will order it again form them.</li>
            <li>My sister introduced me to Far Hair and it has helped quite a bit.</li>
            <li>What I don&#x27;t like is that it makes my hair too soft to hold a curl from my curling iron.  </li>
            <li>If I use a dot smaller than a pea, it really does add thickness.  </li>
            <li>I need to use just a small amount (dime size drop for my shoulderblade length fine hair)</li>
            <li>my hair looks so thick and full!</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>to AZ and used the same amount - and WOW!  </li>
            <li>What I like is that it does make my fine, thin hair feel fuller and soft after blow drying.  </li>
            <li>Great product for thin hair and takes only a small amount.  </li>
            <li>If your hair is getting a little thin and sparse, this is a fairly good solution</li>
            <li>I use the Living Proof product and when I blow dry my hair it feels soft and full...not with this.</li>
            <li>I have extremely fine and thin hair.  </li>
            <li>Use very little first, see how it works, then add if needed.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> /&gt;First, I should mention I live in a drier climate, so it will work better for me than than those who live in humid areas.  </li>
            <li> FIRST OFF...</li>
            <li> only better I didn&#x27;t have to run all over town to find it.</li>
            <li> and I use this product religiously to give me volume on top.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about everything under the sun and this is the only stuff that makes my hair look like a model&#x27;s :)  </li>
            <li> I will definitely order more.  </li>
            <li> It is pink colored and smells nice.</li>
            <li> It will work for you, but every hair type is different, so one method of use isn&#x27;t always good for the next person.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have the type of fine hair that gets weighed down easily it may not work as well.  </li>
            <li> One warning, less is more!  </li>
            <li> This works nicely, it does give a lot of texture and thickens your hair,  but its not real easy to style with.</li>
            <li> Your product came in a very timely manner and it was exactly as I purchase at the store</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the same and does not work on my fine hair like the Thickening Creme</li>
            <li> much as I hoped this would work, I will not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> You might want to experiment with it to see how much is too much and</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t need to much to thicken your hair.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair very greasy .</li>
            <li> It is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> but none did much of anything they advertised.</li>
            <li> and if you use it straight from the bottle it will be like trying to apply glue; it won&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> How I used was applied to damp hair by adding small dab to hands and rubbing together (like you would to wash hands) then rub fingertips to scalp area (especially on top and sides), and then flip head down to blow-dry hair</li>
            <li> meaning we are more susceptible to oily/greasy looking hair, so not a whole lot of any product is needed (UNLESS ITS HAIRSPRAY!</li>
            <li> Anyone with super thin hair like mine will LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li> While I won&#x27;t admit to being old, I will agree that I am &amp;#34;of a certain age&amp;#34;!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s overwhelming for my fine, thin hair, and I just want a shampoo.  </li>
            <li> to lightly comb/style (I use a pick) after you dry or else</li>
            <li> A little sticky in the beginning but OK.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice hold without the hard glue feel.</li>
            <li> I am an African American with fine, relaxed hair.  </li>
            <li> I keep searching for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> how much is too little, because MY hair is natural blonde and very very fine...</li>
            <li> experience is not the same as what the product&#x27;s description reads: &amp;#34;This ultra lightweight thickening crème adds incredible fullness, volume and body, while adding texture and shine to your style&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;For me it felt greasy when applied and remained greasy and heavy in my hair, especially if I let it air dry (which I like to do).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really expensive compared to similar products I&#x27;ve tried, which is also a plus.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was a bit pricey, but I think the bottle will last me way over a year!</li>
            <li> Small amounts when applying is better.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to only use a little bit (dime size) because otherwise it makes your hair hard and give it that \\&quot;hairspray\\&quot; look even if you do, you can brush it out pretty easily.</li>
            <li> It is a waste of money unless you have lots of fine hair.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes based on other customers&#x27; reviews.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to make my hair stand up a bit more, but nothing really dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t make hair stiff or greasy</li>
            <li> It truly does what it was designed to do - &amp;#34;plumps up&amp;#34; each strand of hair and completely eliminates flatness and dullness.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until I tried Fat Hair Thickening Cream I finally found a product that actually worked more than I ever expected.  </li>
            <li> I had absolutely no trouble receiving it---and I will order it again form them.</li>
            <li> My sister introduced me to Far Hair and it has helped quite a bit.</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like is that it makes my hair too soft to hold a curl from my curling iron.  </li>
            <li> If I use a dot smaller than a pea, it really does add thickness.  </li>
            <li> I need to use just a small amount (dime size drop for my shoulderblade length fine hair)</li>
            <li> my hair looks so thick and full!</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> to AZ and used the same amount - and WOW!  </li>
            <li> What I like is that it does make my fine, thin hair feel fuller and soft after blow drying.  </li>
            <li> Great product for thin hair and takes only a small amount.  </li>
            <li> If your hair is getting a little thin and sparse, this is a fairly good solution</li>
            <li> I use the Living Proof product and when I blow dry my hair it feels soft and full...not with this.</li>
            <li> I have extremely fine and thin hair.  </li>
            <li> Use very little first, see how it works, then add if needed.  </li>
            <li> So far, only coloring my hair seems to do this, though this product may make the hairs slightly thicker.  </li>
            <li> Do not use a whole ton, and only use on towel dried damp-ish wet hair.</li>
            <li> This does not thicken hair leaves it flat a greasy looking.</li>
            <li> I had to jump back in the shower after applying my makeup and taking the time to blow dry my hair...</li>
            <li> Be careful not to use too much, or else your hair will feel heavy and sticky.</li>
            <li> I have short, very fine hair, about medium thickness and a little dab of this very thick stuff (about the size of two petite peas!)</li>
            <li> I also tried it when I blow dried, which the instructions recommend, and it did give me a bit more volume than usual but became heavy and greasy throughout the day, weighing my hair</li>
            <li> My hair usually does not have much body for very long after washing, blowdrying and styling.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got long hair and just a small bit at the roots after I&#x27;ve towel dried &amp; brushed it, gives it so much bounce and body!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a long winter</li>
            <li> My hair is short and pretty thin, and this adds volume and texture when I use it before blow drying my hair.  </li>
            <li> wanted something that would make my hair actually \\&quot;thicker\\&quot; and this product may indeed do that, if only slightly.  </li>
            <li> and it lasts a long long time!</li>
            <li> Having said that, I can definitely say I notice some difference after using this - whether or not I&#x27;ve used it with the other Fat Hair</li>
            <li> so saving for those BAD hair days only :)</li>
            <li> Then I blow dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the only products that works on my thin, straight hair.  </li>
            <li> Just blow dry the volume and body into hair!  </li>
            <li> Only use half a dime size diameter.  </li>
            <li> When blow drying I put a dime size amount through my wet hair and blow dry.  </li>
            <li> Have fine hair and was afraid with the change in packaging, the formula changed as well.  </li>
            <li> you might loose all your volume!?</li>
            <li> Wet you hands, squeezed a nickel size amount on your wet hands, rub your hands together to distribute and then apply to hair.</li>
            <li> Thickens straightens limp hair to look younger fuller healthier!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have thin hair</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that keeps my hair from going completely limp, during the summer months.  </li>
            <li> My hair has been thin and lifeless my whole life.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected and as advertised</li>
            <li> I experimented a lot with different products and found that if I put about a teaspoon and a half of this at the bottom of my hair (from the hairline down) after shampoo and conditioner, it feels and acts like the hair I wish I were born with.</li>
            <li> Blow dry your hair upside down to get desired volume.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way--it has the consistency of a thicker handcreme.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel very soft and thick!</li>
            <li> Like I said, only use SMALL amounts at a time.</li>
            <li> Do as some other users have recommended.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this on a regular basis, as it makes my hair slightly hard to get a brush through.  </li>
            <li> I am a big fan of rockabilly and vintage hairstyles, and lately I have been doing a lot of experiments with these styles.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would advise using this product immediately after towel-drying your hair and only using a very small amount, or else your hair will look greasy.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it stiff.</li>
            <li> and I have to mix it with a little water</li>
            <li> I wanted to give this a 5 star, but one little issue....</li>
            <li> It added tons of volume and a little goes along way.</li>
            <li> It was very hard to actually style my hair with it in it.  </li>
            <li> I get this insane volume with this product which is great for the thin hair I have in the front part of my head.</li>
            <li> Use small amount on towel dried hair then blow &amp; comb.  </li>
            <li> Wet your hands to thin the product before putting it on your hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very short and very thin, This product does give it body and makes it easier to style and hold a style.</li>
            <li> If you use too much it will make your hair feel sticky and weighed down, but not an awful lot, just be careful.  </li>
            <li> This cr&amp;egrave;me made my hair very stiff and it also dulled the shine.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair a few inches past my shoulders</li>
            <li> It adds body and texture without making the hair sticky or hard to manage.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel heavy and dirty, not at all what I expected.  </li>
            <li> and it looks almost like I am wearing a hairpiece, or have lots of extensions in my hair, because it is so thick.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin hair and tried about all other thickening product on the market</li>
            <li> If you need another VERY small amount, go ahead and smear it around in your hands and then work it in through the ends of your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY thick</li>
            <li> It keeps your thin hair in place without feeling tacky.</li>
            <li> not happy.</li>
            <li> Your hair will look greasy and feel weird.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, stringy hair with not body.  </li>
            <li> and my hair got sticky and dirty</li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> It is impossible to find anywhere except amazon.</li>
            <li> cuz I was afraid they&#x27;d &amp;#34;reformulate&amp;#34; it or quit making it!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> it was so horrible.</li>

            <li> While I won&#x27;t admit to being old, I will agree that I am &amp;#34;of a certain age&amp;#34;!  When my white hair began to show signs of thinning, I found Fat Hair and fell in love with my hair again!  It truly does what it was designed to do - &amp;#34;plumps up&amp;#34; each strand of hair and completely eliminates flatness and dullness.  Excellent for baby fine hair like mine!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes based on other customers&#x27; reviews.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to make my hair stand up a bit more, but nothing really dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t make hair stiff or greasy, texture is fine.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using just a pea sized amount but maybe I&#x27;ll try a bit more&lt;br /&gt;and see if that has more of an effect.&lt;br /&gt;Scent is mild and pleasant.</li>
            <li> I have lots of fine, silky, straight hair.  If I don&#x27;t use a product it tends to not hold a style and look thin.&lt;br /&gt;My experience is not the same as what the product&#x27;s description reads: &amp;#34;This ultra lightweight thickening crème adds incredible fullness, volume and body, while adding texture and shine to your style&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;For me it felt greasy when applied and remained greasy and heavy in my hair, especially if I let it air dry (which I like to do).  I also tried it when I blow dried, which the instructions recommend, and it did give me a bit more volume than usual but became heavy and greasy throughout the day, weighing my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;As much as I hoped this would work, I will not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I went by the picture and didn&#x27;t read the description and product that was pictured was not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This is one of the only products that works on my thin, straight hair.  It adds some body and helps with styling. It is impossible to find anywhere except amazon.</li>
            <li> I love Fat Hair Thickening Creme - however, what I received was not Thickening Creme, but Amplifying Creme. It&#x27;s not the same and does not work on my fine hair like the Thickening Creme does. I was very disappointed. Note above that image number one is indeed Thickening Creme, but image number two is the Amplifying Creme.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much. Gives a nice hold without the hard glue feel. Can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. So glad its on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Another great product from Samy. Also delivered on time. Good product, good seller.</li>
            <li> This does make my fine hair feel thicker, but it&#x27;s so sticky!  I need to use just a small amount (dime size drop for my shoulderblade length fine hair) and I have to mix it with a little water so I can rub it around in my hands before applying it to my hair - otherwise, my fingers will stick together and it won&#x27;t go through the hair very smoothly.</li>
            <li> FIRST OFF...Do not use a whole ton, and only use on towel dried damp-ish wet hair. Use a small dime sized amount, smear it around in your hands, and apply this FIRST at the roots on the very top of your head where you want the volume...make sure that you really work it in. If you need another VERY small amount, go ahead and smear it around in your hands and then work it in through the ends of your hair. I find that if you really work it in and rough your hair up, that&#x27;s what works best. Blow dry your hair upside down to get desired volume. Grab a brush, and brush your hair downwards while blowdrying. You will love this stuff if you tease your hair, which is what I do. I am a big fan of rockabilly and vintage hairstyles, and lately I have been doing a lot of experiments with these styles. It gives me a lot of volume for teasing/backcombing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT...and I repeat...DO NOT use a huge glob of this! Your hair will look greasy and feel weird. You don&#x27;t need a ton of product. Like I said, only use SMALL amounts at a time. You might want to experiment with it to see how much is too much and how much is too little, because MY hair is natural blonde and very very fine...meaning we are more susceptible to oily/greasy looking hair, so not a whole lot of any product is needed (UNLESS ITS HAIRSPRAY! Can I get an amen!???)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO! Follow my advice and/or experiment with this stuff. It will work for you, but every hair type is different, so one method of use isn&#x27;t always good for the next person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT STUFF THOUGH!!! Will definitely buy again. This is by fair the BEST volumizing product I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve used A LOT of them. Great bang for your buck...and it lasts a long long time!</li>
            <li> Such an excellent product!  I&#x27;ve tried dozens of hair thickeners/root lifters for my fine hair, and this is the absolute best product on the market.  Thank you!!!!!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel heavy and dirty, not at all what I expected.  I have been getting a lot of products that are out of date&lt;br /&gt;from Amazon suppliers, maybe that is the problem.</li>
            <li> I love the prouct. Makes my hair feel very soft and thick!</li>
            <li> Works like a charm on my short haircut.  Have fine hair and was afraid with the change in packaging, the formula changed as well.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Adds more texture to fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while now.  I have fine/thin hair and this stuff is great.  It adds body and texture without making the hair sticky or hard to manage.  If you&#x27;ve tried everything else, give this product a shot.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> My hair is very short and very thin, This product does give it body and makes it easier to style and hold a style. Does make my hair appear thicker. A little sticky in the beginning but OK. Do as some other users have recommended. Wet you hands, squeezed a nickel size amount on your wet hands, rub your hands together to distribute and then apply to hair.</li>
            <li> I am searching for something I can put into my hair to add some body since my shampoo is no longer being made.  My shampoo made such a difference in my hair!  I keep searching for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I bought the shampoo that goes with this cr&amp;egrave;me, I thought maybe I&#x27;d do better with 2 products that match.  Not so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well they definitely matched in their lack of adding volume to my hair.  The shampoo I&#x27;ll review, if I can find it because I know I bought it.  This cr&amp;egrave;me made my hair very stiff and it also dulled the shine. It was very hard to actually style my hair with it in it.  It did nothing to make it look like it had more body.  I wear my hair quite short and the product I use, after shampooing, is very important.  I&#x27;ve been using a mousse and a styling gel-type product and I will continue to use those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t suggest this for anyone.</li>
            <li> Excellent hair product  it makes my hair feel thicker. Neutral odor ales it appropriate for both genders.  Reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li> If your hair is getting a little thin and sparse, this is a fairly good solution and you don&#x27;t need to much to thicken your hair. Use it sparingly. It keeps your thin hair in place without feeling tacky. I was glad Amazon carries this product, because Walgreen no longer carries it. This works best for men. My wife uses the spray version.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I read it was very much like Living Proof Thickening Cream...WRONG! This product made my hair very greasy . I use the Living Proof product and when I blow dry my hair it feels soft and full...not with this. I literally felt like I had Crisco in my hair...it was so horrible. I had to jump back in the shower after applying my makeup and taking the time to blow dry my hair...grrrrrrrrrr...not happy. Do yourself a favor... purchase Living Proof Thickening Cream.</li>
            <li> Anyone with super thin hair like mine will LOVE this product!  One warning, less is more!  If you use too much it will make your hair feel sticky and weighed down, but not an awful lot, just be careful.  Use very little first, see how it works, then add if needed.  I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome on my hair. Doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it stiff. I&#x27;ve got long hair and just a small bit at the roots after I&#x27;ve towel dried &amp; brushed it, gives it so much bounce and body! I bought 3 bottles of it cuz I was afraid they&#x27;d &amp;#34;reformulate&amp;#34; it or quit making it!</li>
            <li> Had used this before, but when I returned to the store where I initially purchased it, they no longer carried it.  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  It does not leave my hair sticky, and just a little is all you need for great body.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Use small amount on towel dried hair then blow &amp; comb.  Thickens straightens limp hair to look younger fuller healthier!</li>
            <li> Your product came in a very timely manner and it was exactly as I purchase at the store only better I didn&#x27;t have to run all over town to find it.</li>
            <li> Samy Fat Hair Thickening Creme is a great product.  My hair is fine and it gives it body and fullness.  It is easy to use and a little goes a long way. I have used &amp;#34;Fat Hair&amp;#34; for a couple of years and really love how it works with my hair.  It is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Like this product.  Only use half a dime size diameter.  Not sure they advertise this, but really good for keeping static away!  It&#x27;s been a long winter and this is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair and tried about all other thickening product on the market but none did much of anything they advertised. It wasn&#x27;t until I tried Fat Hair Thickening Cream I finally found a product that actually worked more than I ever expected.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and now cannot find it on the shelves anymore.  I was delighted to find I could still purchase it on Amazon  I thought it might have been discontinued.  I can&#x27;t ask for a better product.  I would die if they took it off the  market!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller sent it out immediately.  I had absolutely no trouble receiving it---and I will order it again form them.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 6+ months. My hair is short and pretty thin, and this adds volume and texture when I use it before blow drying my hair.  It&#x27;s not really expensive compared to similar products I&#x27;ve tried, which is also a plus.</li>
            <li> I LUV it, priced right came quick, works great!</li>
            <li> I wanted to give this a 5 star, but one little issue.... it seems to kinda break me out around forehead etc. (hairline). With that said; it actually worked I think!! I have pretty fine hair and have always wished it was thicker....so gave this a try and gotta say I was quite impressed!! How I used was applied to damp hair by adding small dab to hands and rubbing together (like you would to wash hands) then rub fingertips to scalp area (especially on top and sides), and then flip head down to blow-dry hair &#x3D; poofy volume :) **just make sure to lightly comb/style (I use a pick) after you dry or else you might loose all your volume!? ...if any of that made sense LOL? Like I said; yah it worked, but kinda broke me out a bit....so saving for those BAD hair days only :)</li>
            <li> I HAVE PURCHASED THIS HAIR CREAM BEFORE NOT ON AMAZON, I CAN&#x27;T FIND IT IN THE STORES ANYMORE,I LOVE THIOS HAIR CREAM.</li>
            <li> I have extremely fine and thin hair.  My sister introduced me to Far Hair and it has helped quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but this is not the product I received.</li>
            <li> This does not thicken hair leaves it flat a greasy looking. It is a waste of money unless you have lots of fine hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and all you need is a dot size. At first I thought it was a bit pricey, but I think the bottle will last me way over a year! Definitely do not use too much because it will make your hair kind of sticky along with any product used in excess. I get this insane volume with this product which is great for the thin hair I have in the front part of my head.</li>
            <li> I bought this in HI where we have almost constant humidity and it was OK.  I have short, very fine hair, about medium thickness and a little dab of this very thick stuff (about the size of two petite peas!) was all that was needed.  More than that and my hair got sticky and dirty looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went to AZ and used the same amount - and WOW!  Warmed it up (body heat between fingertips) then ran it through towel-dried hair.  Just blow dry the volume and body into hair!  Great resultsi....(but I am NOT moving to AZ just for &amp;#34;fat&amp;#34; hair!)</li>
            <li> What I like is that it does make my fine, thin hair feel fuller and soft after blow drying.  What I don&#x27;t like is that it makes my hair too soft to hold a curl from my curling iron.  My hair just won&#x27;t style after using this product.</li>
            <li> Seems to dry out my hair but does provide a nice amount of volume.</li>
            <li> My issue is simple. What is advertised and what your receive are not the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product I received did not include the \\&quot;50% more free\\&quot; as printed on the product itself! I received a standard quantity and so, paid way too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 5-10-13: I was contacted by Febstore and issued a full refund.  I keep the product for free.  I just wanted to update the review with the positive results from Febstore&#x27;s excellent customer service. The only reason for 4 stars is the hassle factor of getting things taken care of.  This one is on Amazon from my understanding.</li>
            <li> I am an African American with fine, relaxed hair.  My hair usually does not have much body for very long after washing, blowdrying and styling.  This stuff is soooo good at giving me lots of volume and body though it does stiffen my hair a bit as other reviewers have stated.  It makes my curls hold longer though.  I use it in conjunction with the Chi volumzing spray for even more impressive results; but this stuff is good all by itself.  Looks like I am wearing a hair weave- my hair looks so thick and full!</li>
            <li> Love this. It added tons of volume and a little goes along way. Will be buying again in the future</li>
            <li> This is my second order of this stuff.  A little goes a long way--it has the consistency of a thicker handcreme.  I apply it to damp hair before blow drying, and it makes my fine, naturally wavy hair blow out fuller.  If you have the type of fine hair that gets weighed down easily it may not work as well.  Seller shipped it quickly under Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got curly hair and I use this product religiously to give me volume on top. It gives my hair the proper texture to keep it curled and voluminous.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have thin hair but sometimes I want to look like I have a ton of hair so on those occasions I use this.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and my hair looks amazing when I use it.  It does stiffen the hair a bit but I don&#x27;t find this to be a problem, as it seems to give my hair enough body to stay in any style I put it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have photos of myself when I have used this and it looks almost like I am wearing a hairpiece, or have lots of extensions in my hair, because it is so thick.  I don&#x27;t use this on a regular basis, as it makes my hair slightly hard to get a brush through.  It adds invisible particles of some sort to the hair shaft, to bulk it up.  I really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I imagine it would be great for men with thinning hair, or anyone who wants more hair or thicker hair.  It&#x27;s a pretty amazing product and I can highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product help thicken my hair and keeps it full all day.  Only a pea size amount works great for medium length hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this product alone as well as with both the [[ASIN:B000OO0EKS Samy Fat Hair 0 Calories Thickening Shampoo, 10 Ounce]] and the [[ASIN:B000ONZA3U Samy Fat Hair \\&quot;0\\&quot; Calories Thickening Conditioner 10 fl oz (300 ml)]].  Of these three products, this is the only one I&#x27;m even remotely likely to continue purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I should mention I live in a drier climate, so it will work better for me than than those who live in humid areas.  Having said that, I can definitely say I notice some difference after using this - whether or not I&#x27;ve used it with the other Fat Hair products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted something that would make my hair actually \\&quot;thicker\\&quot; and this product may indeed do that, if only slightly.  It does,however, make my hair noticeably fuller, which helps with the illusion of thickness.  I also have an easier time styling my hair and keeping a hairdo after using this than if I don&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would advise using this product immediately after towel-drying your hair and only using a very small amount, or else your hair will look greasy.  I personally find it works best if I towel-dry my hair immediately after stepping out of the shower, wetting my hands with a bit of water and only using about the width of a dime of this product.  I then rub it between my palms and evenly coat my hair from roots to ends.  Then I blow dry my hair.  Using it like this does make my hair somewhat fuller and easier to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping for a product that would truly \\&quot;thicken\\&quot; hair, as in, make the individual hairs a bit thicker.  So far, only coloring my hair seems to do this, though this product may make the hairs slightly thicker.  Still, by making my hair appear fuller, it is still an improvement.  I love the natural lift and body it seems to give my hair.  I&#x27;ll probably continue to order this in the future.</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this product from Amazon, but I HAD to write a review.  I have straight fine hair and I&#x27;m from the humid deep South.  This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that keeps my hair from going completely limp, during the summer months.  When blow drying I put a dime size amount through my wet hair and blow dry.  After drying I put a pea sized amount through my hair and I&#x27;m set for the day.</li>
            <li> Used redken thickening lotion but this fat hair rocks. Highly recommend because it has better hold and better effects....good stuff.</li>
            <li> My hair has been thin and lifeless my whole life.  I&#x27;ve tried just about everything under the sun and this is the only stuff that makes my hair look like a model&#x27;s :)  I use a pea-sized amount per day (I have shoulder-length hair) and it lasts forever.  It looks just as good on day 2, not heavy or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Important!  Wet your hands to thin the product before putting it on your hair.  It&#x27;s VERY thick and if you use it straight from the bottle it will be like trying to apply glue; it won&#x27;t work.  (I almost threw it away before discovering this tip)</li>
            <li> I only use this on occasion and does what it says it would do.  Makes the hair fuller and also acts as your styling product.  No complaints, but I can see how one could go through the 5.25oz bottle rather quickly.</li>
            <li> The price is super low and this cream leaves my hair feeling great especially after using heat styling. I may buy another</li>
            <li> Small amounts when applying is better.  Otherwise the hair turns too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair with a nice shine.&lt;br /&gt;For normal lift the product is very good.</li>
            <li> Great product for thin hair and takes only a small amount.  I will definitely order more.  I have tried many setting lotions but this is the best yet.</li>
            <li> great product. Works as expected and as advertised</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way! I have thin hair a few inches past my shoulders and I use about a dime size amount. I rub my hands together and then distribute it evenly through my hair. It is pink colored and smells nice. Be careful not to use too much, or else your hair will feel heavy and sticky.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, stringy hair with not body.  I experimented a lot with different products and found that if I put about a teaspoon and a half of this at the bottom of my hair (from the hairline down) after shampoo and conditioner, it feels and acts like the hair I wish I were born with.</li>
            <li> I  took away one star because if I use more than the tiniest dab it&#x27;s overwhelming for my fine, thin hair, and I just want a shampoo.  If I use a dot smaller than a pea, it really does add thickness.  Use sparingly and it will do the trick!</li>
            <li> This works nicely, it does give a lot of texture and thickens your hair,  but its not real easy to style with. Make sure to only use a little bit (dime size) because otherwise it makes your hair hard and give it that \\&quot;hairspray\\&quot; look even if you do, you can brush it out pretty easily. You might have to use an additional product to style with.</li>
