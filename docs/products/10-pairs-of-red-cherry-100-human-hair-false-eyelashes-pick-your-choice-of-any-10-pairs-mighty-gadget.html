            <li>button, tel them the numbers, they will reply very soon..</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive eyes and as long as I trim them to where I don&#x27;t feel the edges, I&#x27;m fine all day.</li>
            <li>I got these lashes extremely fast as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>They are very light-weight -&amp;#62; you can&#x27;t even feel them on compared to the ones</li>
            <li>I got what I wanted fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>

            <li>The lashes are very well made and gives you the opportunity to try different styles.</li>
            <li>you can barely know they are there&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the thin strip on them, it&#x27;s much easier to hide with liner than some other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Way too long and big, I gave selected what seemed most natural but they are still way too dramatic for my taste...</li>

            <li> Way too long and big, I gave selected what seemed most natural but they are still way too dramatic for my taste...</li>
            <li> really long --if you take care of it &amp; put it back in the package and use alcohol to remove your glue and sanitize&lt;br /&gt;should be able to use at least 10 times if not more.</li>
            <li> (extra long length).&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li> But, I found these lashes to be just a tad bit more difficult to put on compared to other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> lighter coming are to other similar lash brand.</li>
            <li> Red Cherry #DW is a little longer in length.</li>
            <li> I use them till they die but usually they last a long time.</li>
            <li> Shipping was faster than expected.</li>
            <li> i request #43 and #523 .half and half.</li>
            <li> (my everyday lash), 747L</li>
            <li> Before I got these I only wore false lashes to parties and events</li>
            <li> usually wear (drugstore ones).</li>
            <li> Sometimes eyelashes feel so heavy on my eyes, they start making me feel sleepy!!</li>
            <li> Sometimes difficult to decided from pictures.</li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t really go wrong.</li>
            <li> I really am disappointed that you can&#x27;t get the DW ones with this...</li>

            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;d ever bought from Red Cherry and they did not disappoint. These lashes are grade A high quality lashes for an unbeatable price. If you can&#x27;t afford MAC lashes these are a comparable dupe!</li>

But, I found these lashes to be just a tad bit more difficult to put on compared to other brands I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m not crazy about the look of the &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; either. They look and feel more synthetic than real. My favorite still are by Benefit. But, I would buy these again for the sake of the quantity you get for the price!</li>
            <li> I really am disappointed that you can&#x27;t get the DW ones with this...</li>

            <li> First of all they came on time and came exactly how I ordered it. Love these lashes so natural, used the #DW this morning on a bride who don&#x27;t like makeup and she looked absolutely fabulous. ALso, I loved YONELAY services, I can&#x27;t believe they hand wrote a thank you note to me it felt so personalized. Thank you! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love theses lashes. Before I got these I only wore false lashes to parties and events now I wear them every day. Once you get the hang of it it&#x27;s really easy and adds instant glam. My fave is DW and 747m for every day use.. Love love love</li>

It makes any look have a bit of extra glam! I will be ordering more soon!</li>
            <li> The ones i picked looked natural on the picture, but look like drag queens</li>
            <li> I love the eyelashes,but i just got #43,when i request #43 and #523 .half and half.</li>
            <li> Awesome!!!! I ordered 5 different styles to try out. Most of them were a little long for my eyes, but the DW is PERFECT. I got these lashes extremely fast as well. I will definitely be ordering from this seller again.</li>

            <li> I really like these lashes they feel light you can barely know they are there&lt;br /&gt;They look amazing and easy to apply.  would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Super fast shipping. Very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I would recommend knowing from seeing in person what ones you want before ordering.</li>
            <li> They are perfect and I loved them</li>
            <li> Great product AND seller! Feels lighter coming are to other similar lash brand. Red Cherry #DW is a little longer in length.</li>
            <li> I love this pack of eyelashes. If you are new to wearing them and not sure which ones look best on you this is definitely the way to go. The lashes are very well made and gives you the opportunity to try different styles. Wonderful fast shipping and great service.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time. They are very light-weight -&amp;#62; you can&#x27;t even feel them on compared to the ones&lt;br /&gt;I usually wear (drugstore ones). I will re-purchase. I know the girls on youtube are raving about these &amp; bought for myself.&lt;br /&gt;I already gave some away to my friends to try.  Love them. Esp. #43 (my everyday lash), 747L (extra long length).&lt;br /&gt;Last really long --if you take care of it &amp; put it back in the package and use alcohol to remove your glue and sanitize&lt;br /&gt;should be able to use at least 10 times if not more. I use them till they die but usually they last a long time. I will lose them&lt;br /&gt;before they even wear out.</li>
            <li> I got what I wanted fast.</li>
            <li> Great deal excellent quality comparable to Mac.</li>
            <li> None of the ones I ordered looked good on...</li>

            <li> Since I have to drive miles if I want to buy this brand, this meethod of purchase is very convient and saved me a couple dollars too.  This is my favorite brand because they fit my eyes perfectly and I like the quality.  I will definitely purchase more this way.</li>
