            <li>excellent exfoliation without ever feeling too scratchy.</li>
            <li>It literally took me 10 minutes to remove all of the built up self tanner, leaving me with flawless, glowing skin.</li>

            <li>This is a very good product</li>
            <li>It smells very good</li>

            <li>Great product--exfoliates well and washes in machine with ease.  </li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>I have used mine one or two times a week for about six months and it is still in great shape.</li>
            <li>Great job on this product.</li>
            <li>This is a great exfoliating glove.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a great buy.</li>
            <li>This is a great exfoliating glove.</li>
            <li>This mitt does a great job.</li>
            <li>Skin feels great afterwards, but feels like sandpaper when using in the shower.</li>
            <li>I use it pre-spray tan and it does a great job.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not already an exfoliator, you&#x27;ll probably see great results with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best with salt scrubs but also works on its own.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for 3 months and it still works great and hasn&#x27;t gotten ripped or anything.</li>
            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>But I can see why this might be a great option for people.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>I have been using it almost every day for a month or so and have noticed a great improvement in the clarity and smoothness of my skin.  </li>
            <li>Lol, I don&#x27;t have to see dirt falling off to tell this mitten</li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>Works great but the wrist band gets moldy smelling even when I wring it out and hang it up in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Great shave prep</li>
            <li>great quality.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>The texture was sturdy and did a great job exfoliating my skin.</li>
            <li>Lol.</li>
            <li>Works so great</li>
            <li>It does a great job.</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS GLOVE!!</li>

            <li>Amazing product!</li>
            <li>this glove does an amazing job exfoliating your body!</li>
            <li>and it did an amazing job!</li>
            <li>This glove is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>It is amazing!</li>
            <li>Nice!</li>
            <li>It is a very pleasant feeling and it helps me feel more awake.</li>
            <li>This is a good exfoliating glove, but nothing hugely remarkable.  </li>
            <li>This is a very good product, it is like a micro sand paper or something and works better than anything I have seen.  </li>
            <li>glove is good</li>
            <li>and it is outstandingly good at exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>I think this is a good thing&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;i was searching for a glove for the Moroccan Hammam liquid soap and it is really good one to have.</li>
            <li>is definitely is a good product -</li>
            <li>and he loved it.  </li>
            <li>This is a good Moroccan bath mitt.</li>
            <li>It does as good of a job as my body salt scrub.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>so I feel I got a good deal.  </li>
            <li>Superior to anything I have tried.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good for.</li>
            <li>and I loved it--swore I would continue to buy the product until they stopped making it.</li>
            <li>Definitely a very good mit and makes your skin smooth as silk.</li>
            <li>This is a great product...not sure why or how it works so well</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the glove.  </li>
            <li>I love this glove!</li>
            <li>I love this glove!</li>
            <li>The softness just got better!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I do still love it!</li>
            <li>This glove is so much better than loofahs!</li>
            <li>I love the scrubber!  </li>
            <li>I truly can&#x27;t believe people use this on their body, and even more so their face!</li>
            <li>It worked beautifully, but they do wear out after awhile and don&#x27;t seem to be available here anymore</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lovely!</li>
            <li>LOVE!</li>
            <li>SO pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li>Ooooooooo I love this!  </li>
            <li>For best result stay in the warm to hot water before use it</li>
            <li>exactly what i was looking for!!!!</li>
            <li>I use it on my face and it makes my skin look amazing....</li>
            <li>this is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This is amazing.</li>
            <li>It is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I exfoliate a couple of times a week and my skin feels amazing after.</li>
            <li>amazing.</li>
            <li>This tells me that it may not be the product doing amazing work, but the body washes used with the product.</li>
            <li>OMGâ€¦this thing is amazing.</li>
            <li>This glove is a really amazing tool to use when you exfoliate.  </li>
            <li>If you like a really good scrub you will love this.</li>
            <li>I use my Dove body wash or baroody olive soap (depending what I&#x27;m in the mood for), I put some on my skin and some on the glove, and it exfoliates so nicely.</li>
            <li>After months of use, no color bleeding at all which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, scratchy feel on your skin and is durable.</li>
            <li>Deft buying again.</li>
            <li>I am from morocco where we use this kind of exfoliating gloves.</li>
            <li>Mitt has nice texture but be gentle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Must be a gimmick of some kind.</li>
            <li>I paid about $20 for this and don&#x27;t think that it does the job any better than a good wash cloth or one of those exfoliating gloves that they sell at the beauty store for $5.</li>
            <li>the smooth, clean feeling is wonderful!</li>
            <li>I follow up with some body lotion and it feels great to know how clean I am.</li>
            <li>But for normal skin, it is great!  </li>
            <li>By far the best exfoliating glove I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>However, it is like a very fine sandpaper.</li>
            <li>This is the best, have always used Exfoliating Glove so my skin is very smooth &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>I think that it is more suitable for ladies</li>
            <li>Aesthetically, the glove is a beautiful terracotta color, it&#x27;s made from sturdy fabric, and the wrist is a very luxurious terrycloth.</li>
            <li>I needed a new shower scrubber, so I searched Amazon for something that was reasonably priced, had good reviews, and was eligible for prime, and this seemed to be my best bet.  </li>
            <li>Just seems to exfoliate better that way.</li>
            <li>Interesting and not quite what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>so I have been able to use it.</li>
            <li>Love this glove.</li>
            <li>, I use it mostly on my legs, feet, and arms</li>
            <li>My organic shea butter was the cherry on the top, after I showered with this glove.</li>
            <li>I have an authentic Hammam glove from Morocco and was looking for something comparable.  </li>
            <li>9 months ago I went to Morocco and fell in love with the level of exfoliation the gloves offered.</li>
            <li>Love this</li>
            <li>I am in love with it.....</li>
            <li>way better than any towel could.</li>
            <li>love this exfoliating glove....</li>
            <li>It was an amazing feeling, my skin had never felt that smooth.  </li>
            <li>perfectly so if you have large hands this product may not be right for you.</li>
            <li>and I love to go</li>
            <li>/&gt;Looking for more that can be delivered to Canada.</li>
            <li>And I have to say - I love it.</li>
            <li>It exfoliates better that I thought.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the way this glove makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have smooth skin again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times &amp; cannot vouch for durability - but performance is excellent.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Most of the time I use a rinse off scrub.</li>
            <li>This works so much better than those exfoliating gloves you can buy in the store.</li>
            <li>I love this mitt.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>many years I have been search for a body scrubber that was as aggressive as one that was used on me in a bathhouse when I visited Tunisia.  </li>
            <li>The product is just ok.</li>
            <li>Overall, great product, watch the videos on Hammam Gloves, and give it a try!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a polishing that over time could get to deeper parts of the skin over time, layer by layer.</li>
            <li>I would not pay much more for it.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this glove.  </li>
            <li>but it worked well for pre-sunless tanning, more even exfoliation compared to a scrub.</li>
            <li>AM SO GLAD</li>
            <li>I DECIDED TO GO CHEAP!</li>
            <li>I love how it feels after scrubbing my arms.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s BETTER than the Magic Glove, sturdier, and stays on my hand better (no shifting around) than the Magic Glove.  </li>
            <li>I love seeing the exfoliation happening.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to switch hands during use.  :-)</li>
            <li>I love the feel on this mitt.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>cannot recommend any health/beauty product I&#x27;ve bought more than this one.</li>
            <li>for whatever reason, it seems like this Kae gets the skin rolling off my legs better and easier than the Baiden.  </li>
            <li>But I can see how some individuals might not be able to fully use it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>somehow you are able to sleep better.</li>
            <li>Love love love this....</li>
            <li>I seriously love it.</li>
            <li>You will need to use quite a bit of moisturizing soap, since the glove doesn&#x27;t create many suds, and the suds that do appear tend to dissipate quickly.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so smooth!</li>
            <li>I bought this glove and at first it worked good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>Few products are perfect but this thing is amazing in how it exfoliates my skin.</li>
            <li>Easy, quick and effective.  </li>
            <li>You will notice such an incredible difference in how your skin feels after using it.  </li>
            <li>This glove appears soft at first but it exfoliates wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I purchased another for my mother because I loved it so much</li>
            <li>If you have a tremendous amount of expendable income, this glove does exactly what it says it does--exfoliates nicely, keeps a lather, keeps nicely in the shower.</li>
            <li>Great for deep exfoliation and just feels good like a good back scratch.  </li>
            <li>I should be much more excited about it.  </li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s easy):  </li>
            <li>This issue can easily be remedied by having a lady friend(s) use the glove to bath you instead.</li>
            <li>but when it got wet it fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>Really nice product good quality I use it in combination with Moroccan back Soap with argan oil</li>
            <li>I have fair and sensitive skin and have not scrubbed the top layer of skin off like some reviews.</li>
            <li>Compared to a hammam mit right which we have that&#x27;s straight out of Turkey, this thing feels like sandpaper....not happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for a thicker, more padded glove, like the ones used in the Korean baths, but this one is no less good at what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>It consistently gives me amazing results.</li>
            <li>On the whole, I am very pleased with this purchase and hope to stay that way.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and quite effective.</li>
            <li>This is the best exfoliator ever, hands down.</li>
            <li>I can fit 4 fingers in easily, but that means not using the end of the mitt.</li>
            <li>Oh yea and I did buy it with the Savon Noir black soap these two go together and work wonderfully</li>
            <li>It works fine though.</li>
            <li>it will help your skin tremendously!</li>
            <li>Best glove hands down!</li>
            <li>It removes dead skin cells and makes your skin feel so wonderful and smooth.</li>
            <li>The glove looks HUGE</li>
            <li>Generous size can fit even a man&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li>This glove has been perfect for the shower to get dead skin off of my arms and legs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this for about a few months and it still works real good.</li>
            <li>I ordered it because I have razor bumps on my thighs from lack of exfoliation and using cheap razors</li>
            <li>I continue to use the mitt, but with a light touch.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit abrasive, being that it feels like sand paper and all; but it does leave your body feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li>With a light touch this could be used on the face.  </li>
            <li>Smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>Its made from a fiber that is very sturdy and effective so this mitt has a lot of life in it.</li>
            <li>I wear Medium sized gloves and these fit</li>
            <li>Perfect for when I&#x27;m using self tanner and need all the dead skin gone.</li>
            <li>smooth baby skin afterwards.</li>
            <li>I lightly used it on my face-</li>
            <li>and I stress LIGHTLY-</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.&lt;br /&gt;Works heavenly.&lt;br /&gt;Skin</li>
            <li>and I cannot fit my hand into it.</li>
            <li>It did leave my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>but overall, it does the trick and feels great.</li>
            <li>and I feel smooth after bathing.</li>
            <li>have Keratosis pilaris, and I have never used ANY product that can do what this does to help smooth out my skin.</li>
            <li>My hands are  medium sized, and they fit inside.</li>
            <li>I had a man medium size hands just fit</li>
            <li>Overall great product.</li>
            <li>and I definitely think it works great.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Amazing for the skin I&#x27;ve never been so soft!!!</li>
            <li>Honestly, a fine sandpaper would be more gentle than this thing!</li>
            <li>Very nice and soft skin right out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>They feel smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an authentic hammam glove and I was excited to use it for the first time.</li>
            <li>As long as you do this, your gonna get great results.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I bought this to use with the black soap by Kae and they do not go very good together.  </li>
            <li>It would certainly make bathing a more comfortable experience.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling really clean.</li>
            <li>, I just like to have that squeaky clean feeling that you get from scrubbing.  </li>
            <li>and you will love the amazing squeak clean feeling and softness of your entire body skin!</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and smooth and nice and clean</li>
            <li>However, I do wish I could more easily fit my whole hand inside the thing.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin a bright pink after I use it, and I feel more clean after a shower.</li>
            <li>Just use any kind of soap with it, it will leave your skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I think most people would have the same reaction unless they&#x27;re using it as a pumice on their heels or something (and honestly, my pumice stone is much more gentle than this</li>
            <li>Nothing special.  </li>
            <li>Good for overall scrub.</li>
            <li>After using this daily for over a week, I started seeing really good results.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes, I almost do not feel like soaping after I scrub, because my skin feels super clean after using just it.  </li>
            <li>I feel SUPER clean after.</li>
            <li>I love this glove so much.  </li>
            <li>This is much better but you can&#x27;t use it on really sensetive skin.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine that regular use of this mitt is good for your skin.  </li>
            <li>This kae glove will have you SO FRESH and SO CLEAN (CLEAN).</li>
            <li>This is more convenient however, because you can do in the shower and you get good results with less time.  </li>
            <li>This chips manicures super fast, so be sure to refresh your nails AFTER you shower.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>Pretty cool!</li>
            <li>I had KP, so exfoliating is very important to keep my skin looking decent.</li>
            <li>The product arrive really quickly.</li>
            <li>The glove dries quickly when I hang it in the shower, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting moldy or funky.</li>
            <li>The kae exfoliating glove is great: sheds dead skin and comfortably.</li>
            <li>Something like a mild sand paper.</li>
            <li>My skin is gross looking with clogged hair follicles before, then nice and smooth after I use this in the shower.</li>
            <li>I will steam-wash it or soak it in very hot water every so often to keep it clean, and I expect it will continue to keep me clean, clear and smooth!</li>
            <li>not uncomfortably so - it&#x27;s supposed to fit like a mitten.</li>
            <li>(1) Apply soap to your body first, then to the glove, then use a light touch.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying a new one to replace it :-)</li>
            <li>No pressure needed, and works great with black soap.</li>
            <li>This glove is much \\&quot;fancier\\&quot; but the material is EXACTLY as the authentic one from Morocco.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it since and my skin is healthier, dewy and sooo summer ready!!</li>
            <li>I will continue to keep my eyes open for a more enjoyable/effective exfoliating product and I predict that eventually this will go to the graveyard under my sink!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never done intense exfoliation like this, prepare to be grossed out!!  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say that I&#x27;ve never felt so clean and smooth before with any other type of sponge.</li>
            <li>But gets mouldy far too quickly had to throw it away !!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great size and shape and the texture really grabs dead skin, yet rinses easily.</li>
            <li>would say it actually works better if you are taking a bath, but the shower is fine as well.</li>
            <li>my whole body is smooth,</li>
            <li>That being said This product is great for everyday scrubbing.</li>
            <li>This glove does a great job of getting rid of dead skin cells without tearing you to shreds.  </li>
            <li>This glove takes off amazing amounts of dead skin (I love scrubbing</li>
            <li>Talk about SOFT &amp; SMOOTH skin!</li>
            <li>Definitely will exfoliate you well, just have a nice body cream for after.</li>
            <li>I love this exfoliating glove, my skin is now renewed and soft, my hands and arms no longer feel like sand paper.</li>
            <li>I spent more time trying to keep the glove on than actually enjoying</li>
            <li>totally worth the price</li>
            <li>Soooooo worth it.</li>
            <li>I think if the mit were bigger, it would move around while I am scrubbing and not be as effective.</li>
            <li>Would be nice if it had different sizes too</li>
            <li>It is really worth it when I do set aside the time, though.</li>
            <li>I really love this glove so far.</li>
            <li>So overall, a very good product, however the glove DOESN&#x27;T FIT the average man&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li>I am not into exfoliating as much as I want to feel clean.</li>
            <li>but after I use it I feel super clean and my skin feels very soft.</li>
            <li>This nice exfoliating glove arrived swiftly but as a person with large hands, it is not possible to use it correctly.</li>
            <li>This will certainly exfoliate you!</li>
            <li>feels so soft and is able to absorb lotion much easier and quicker.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I am young and able-bodied, so this glove is easy for me to use.</li>
            <li>it gets your skin very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s true, once you rinse off and feel your skin, it feels super taut and soft</li>
            <li>I like it very much</li>
            <li>my entire body just feels smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>its leaves my skin baby smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>It would have been better if the cuff around it were a darker or different color as it did have a tendency to mildew, but overall, I love it.  </li>
            <li>Just soak in hot tub or shower and rub against your skin...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the glove for 4 months now, using at least 1-2x a week, and it is still in great condition.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better than regular exfoliating gloves, also it seems to have been having a minimizing effect on my shaving habits.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a sucker for exfoliation and this is great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy ten more.</li>
            <li>This is equal to or better than others on Amazon</li>
            <li>but so much cheaper!</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This mitten is made very well!</li>
            <li>I used it on areas of my back that I haven&#x27;t been able to get to otherwise</li>
            <li>This thing really exfoliates!</li>
            <li>An absolute staple!</li>
            <li>For anyone interested, I used Softsoap&#x27;s Body Butter Coconut Scrub with this mitten.</li>
            <li>This really does work!  </li>
            <li>Exfoliates my skin very well!</li>
            <li>Love how this exfoliating hamam gove work I just purchased a second one</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be sure to look up the youtube video on how to properly use this product-</li>
            <li>First off, I was underwhelmed when it arrived -</li>
            <li>It no longer was exfoliating as it did when I first got it.</li>
            <li>This really, really works!</li>
            <li>I plan to buy another, to be able to do both sides of my body at the same time.</li>
            <li>I have always used a glycolic acid lotion with both, so I have a good amount of dead skin to rub off.</li>
            <li>The material is very fine with a sandpaper like feel to it but not to abrasive as long as you don&#x27;t apply a ton of pressure to the area you are exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>In about 2 and half weeks my thighs were so smooth and razor bump free!</li>
            <li>I normally save reviews until I&#x27;ve used a product for awhile, but after the very first use, I want to stand on the rooftop and praise this mitt!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This mitt is fairly inexpensive, but does just as well as the more expensive ones.  </li>
            <li>I will be honest, I&#x27;ve exfoliated in the shower on a near daily basis for over a decade.</li>
            <li>, even my husband noticed how smooth my skin is (that&#x27;s major)..</li>
            <li>A little less abrasive than what I experienced in Morocco but does a fair enough job.</li>
            <li>THIS MAKES YOUR SKIN SUPER SOFT!</li>
            <li>, the color is much nicer than the original authentic black</li>
            <li>Be gentle on the rest of your body at first.  </li>
            <li>First when I received it, it felt very silky</li>
            <li>The fit is excellent for my small hands, although it can also be used as a small cloth instead of as a glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all over, and the resulting exfoliation makes my skin feel soft, smooth, and brand new!  </li>
            <li>My skin is SUPER soft now -- like a baby&#x27;s bottom.  </li>
            <li>It had no dramatic effect on my skin.</li>
            <li>It seems like the Kae requires less finesse - if your legs are generally somewhat wet and you squeezed out the Kae glove, you can start rubbing off the skin, in contrast for the Baiden you have to futz with getting your skin to exactly the right amount of just barely damp and the mitten squeezed perfectly and even then start rubbing in the right direction and keep rubbing until maybe the moisture evaporates to the right degree</li>
            <li>Honestly, I did not notice a change in my skin, but that may be because I do a lot of other things too keep it smooth like daily saunas, good moisturizing, and occasional dry brushing.  </li>
            <li>and i have large hands.</li>
            <li>The thumb side had a large hole.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have not seen the dead skin that others stated they saw as they rinsed away their bodies, but I haven&#x27;t seen it on me either; so I&#x27;m satisfied!</li>
            <li>This is only true if you soak your body completely in hot water for 30minutes so don&#x27;t expect it to work with a hot shower.</li>
            <li>I really like the mild exfoliation this offers.</li>
            <li>Definitely easier than holding a loofah, and it works better and does not get so gross so quickly.  </li>
            <li>So much less rubbing for good exfoliation, and I see way more dead skin coming off with this.</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I&#x27;ve been able to exfoliate my whole body and even my face on the other side of the sponge.</li>
            <li>No need to use much force with this glove - it&#x27;s like super-ultra-fine sandpaper.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how much it exfoliated.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Korean, so I&#x27;m very used to body scrubs.</li>
            <li>I really like this glove</li>
            <li>It does its job very well.</li>
            <li>I am a real consumer and therefore a real reviewer.  </li>
            <li>I give five stars to this spong because it exfoliates very well.</li>
            <li>I would recomend this to anyone who wants to exfoilate, and who suffer from KP</li>
            <li>This glove works really well, just like everyone says.</li>
            <li>Use this mitt gently as it is a bit scatchy.  </li>
            <li>It exfoliates really well.</li>
            <li>I really have a morbid curiosity every time I use it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It really scrubs you well.</li>
            <li>It really buffs the skin well.</li>
            <li>Works very well, so well that my mom got one too.</li>
            <li>and amazed at how much skin really comes off.</li>
            <li>It was really helped my eczema.</li>
            <li>but it really works on my body</li>
            <li>But would really like to have a thumb.</li>
            <li>This mitt is like a chemical peel for your whole body.</li>
            <li>This mitt really did the trick fo me.  </li>
            <li>but they are not at intense as this one.  </li>
            <li>Appears to be durable and it dries very fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li>price was cheap, the delivery was almost instant -</li>
            <li>Also I use it before shaving (everywhere, really everywhere)  keeps me smoother</li>
            <li>Really like this glove.</li>
            <li>Exfoliates very well.  </li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t figure how in the world it is capable of exfoliating.</li>
            <li>I started using it because I had ingrown hairs on the back of my legs, and now I&#x27;m all smooth.  </li>
            <li>it helps to remove the skin and it is very smoothy</li>
            <li>Works really well on my skin.</li>
            <li>This glove REALLY does work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to use this daily without problems all over and have seen marked improvement to my skin health.    </li>
            <li>This product is not for the sensitive kind as it is on the \\&quot;rough side\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I mean, it&#x27;s kind of ick-inducing, but the results are so worth</li>
            <li>BABY SOFT TO THE MAX WITHOUT LOTION!!!</li>
            <li>It exfoliates more effectively than any other implements I&#x27;ve tried, such as Salux cloths, loofahs, wash cloths, and regular sponges.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even see signs of wear other than the string used to hang it with, so I will be using it for many months to come.</li>
            <li>had recently been to a Korean spa where I had my whole body scrubbed down and loved it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am happy to report this glove worth the price so far, and I hope it will last at least a year.</li>
            <li>I just use regular body wash from Target with this--no special hammam clay scrub, etc.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have problems working with the size of the glove and find it to be a minor issue, you&#x27;ll really enjoy it&#x27;s quality.</li>
            <li>Boyfriend loves it too, especially on his back (but who doesn&#x27;t like a good back scratch from time to time?)</li>
            <li>First I thought it&#x27;s too soft but water made the difference.</li>
            <li>I put a nice all natural lotion all over my skin, let it soak in really well and soften up all the dead cells, then use this in the shower.</li>
            <li>There are other products out there that are similar, but are much more costly, so I figured I would give this one a try, and I am glad I did because it appears to do the same thing as the pricier gloves!  </li>
            <li>Only thing I wish is that it was in a light color, so I could see all the dead skin it sloughs offs better.</li>
            <li>I love the result it helped me to get rid of the dark skin in my tummy which I got as a result of three pregnancies.</li>
            <li>I am still old but my whole body is clean, fresh and pink.  </li>
            <li>Even better with the Kae Savon Noir black soap that it&#x27;s recommended to be purchased with.</li>
            <li>Be sure and buy it with the black soap.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks with moroccan black soap with argan and my face feels smoother and softer plus most of the blackheads are gone.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed this glove while it lasted (I used it in conjunction with the black soap).</li>
            <li>quickly-- started coming apart at the seams after the third use!</li>
            <li>I have small hands so this is not a problem, but I&#x27;m pretty sure you could still use this product without wearing it as a glove.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for men&#x27;s thick back skin.  </li>
            <li>If I were to use this regularly I&#x27;d end up with super irritated and inflamed skin -</li>
            <li>this glove really exfoliates your skin and leaves it very soft  </li>
            <li>I decided to quickly use this right before I got out of the tub just to see if it would work the way other reviewers said it would.</li>
            <li>I naturally have pretty soft skin that doesn&#x27;t need much exfoliation (or so I thought)</li>
            <li>Works well, just go easy the first few times you use it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this glove.  </li>
            <li>That said, I can highly recommend this glove now.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this</li>
            <li>It does feel like fine grit sandpaper going over wet soapy skin so if that is not what you are looking for, this glove is not for you.</li>
            <li>I thought I had scrubbed kind of hard but weren&#x27;t exfoliated well.  </li>
            <li>(Do this kind of serious scrubbing once every 2-3 weeks - regular washing is okay on a daily basis)</li>
            <li>I like using an exfoliating mitt so much better than the gloves or bottled cleansers, but tis mitt is extremely rough and harsh and can hurt if you don&#x27;t have a light touch.  </li>
            <li>It really exfoliates leaving your skin soft.  </li>
            <li>for someone who may have sensitive skin this mitt may be too much.</li>
            <li>great product, wrong price.</li>
            <li>It is pretty big, covers my whole hand and does not slip off.</li>
            <li>use it not only on my KP, but also pretty much everywhere else as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lovely to see all the dead skin coming off.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin with eczema, and sensitive skin(bruise easily) and it doesnt irritate my skin at all.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty gross, but hey it&#x27;s better down the drain than on your body!</li>
            <li>I had to buy a new one while waiting for my mother-in-law to sew the one that I washed.</li>
            <li>I have a spray tan machine and you have to exfoliate it off before you apply a new one.</li>
            <li>I always feel like new after using it.</li>
            <li>I have very wide women&#x27;s hands and find the glove to fit well.  </li>
            <li>They should seriously call this the Amazing Exfoliating Glove, because it is that</li>
            <li>As far as the actual glove goes, it gives really nice exfoliation--jut a slight circular motion</li>
            <li>I went to brick &amp; mortar stores looking for something that would give me a similar level of exfoliation, but everything was too gentle to really help me out.    </li>
            <li>I used this and another Japanese kind of dry skin brush (both in the shower) and after doing that -- I felt so sleepy and had a deep sleep.</li>
            <li>Love this little mitt!</li>
            <li>I use this glove with ultra moisturizing (hair) conditioner &amp; gently &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; my skin from neck down, then cool rinse.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and eczema and have had no problems with this at all.</li>
            <li>Best used after you have been in the shower for a while, you will see the skin come off like crazy!</li>
            <li>Best gome glove I&#x27;ve found on Amazon, though a couple of reviewers have taken issue:  (A) \\&quot;Too rough\\&quot;?</li>
            <li>( my mom is 60 years old and never ever have a selulit!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li>When I first received it and tried it on it was too big</li>
            <li>I have used the baiden mitt in the past and it was okay,</li>
            <li>wow!  </li>
            <li>In the past, I&#x27;ve purchased and come across many bath brushes.</li>
            <li>I have used it 6-7 times now and it still works the same as it did the first day.</li>
            <li>Wow, I feel like I have new skin!&lt;br</li>
            <li>(unless you pull on it excessively, and often), which is the real problem with cheap, elastic gloves.   </li>
            <li>The first time I used this it left my skin baby soft and i noticed that the bumps behinds my legs started dissapearing over time.</li>
            <li>For the price I think that this defect should not be expected, but after a quick read, replacement does not seem to be an Amazon option.</li>
            <li>It is a little bit too rough but it definitely works like hammam gloves and it help the skin exfoliate; and I could see the result by my own eyes!</li>
            <li>I noted no skin actually peeling off my body as some reviews, but I exfoliate often, so this is not a factor for me; however for me, my results have been positive.</li>
            <li>On my first use, I noticed the glove shrinks when wet, and while I got a really great exfoliating experience with this glove, the size did made it uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li>My 7 year old could not believe how soft my skin was after using it!  </li>
            <li>I used it along with my Moroccan Black Soap and can I say baby soft, smooth skin.</li>
            <li>It is a tight fit for my hand.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not like a scuba tight fit to your hand</li>
            <li>Well, it certainly works well following their directions.  </li>
            <li>I surprised how much smoother my skin was, especially my feet and knees!</li>
            <li>I use the glove with the black soap and it leaves my skin soft,smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>it was just the glove in a clear bag.  </li>
            <li>and you can see the dirt and old skin just roll off.</li>
            <li>I recommend using it lightly on any other body area other than the feet at first.  </li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>but sometimes I use it with regular soap and exfoliates really well.</li>
            <li>and I get out of the shower so soft</li>
            <li>I bought one for several on my Christmas list ABSOLUTELY a must for any woman wanting to exfoliate and skin looking radiant</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>With my sensitive skin, I can&#x27;t afford to exfoliate my face with anything without breaking out but this exfoliating glove was somehow designed for skin like mine.</li>
            <li>Otherwise these cleanser makes your skin soft and exfoliater will not work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin was old and gray looking.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and with out ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s silky and soft if you touch it.</li>
            <li>A lot of old skin comes off making you feel like a newborn.</li>
            <li>Does not work for bottom of feet, and makes face sensitive to applying moisturizer</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin baby soft as ever.</li>
            <li>i use it once in a while because i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it once so far</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and have to rub superhard to get exfoliated at all.</li>
            <li>This is the closest I have come so far.  </li>
            <li>The only exfoliating glove that really exfoliates.</li>
            <li>For individuals with the KP that is only bumpy, you may really benefit with continued use.</li>
            <li>I also took someones advice and used Soft Soap Body Butter Coconut Scrub with it.  </li>
            <li>My husband stole my old one</li>
            <li>I was surprised it got here</li>
            <li>I use this once a week to exfoliate and my skin is so soft afterwards.  </li>
            <li>far too abrasive.</li>
            <li>I self tan frequently and purchased this glove in hopes of dramatically reducing the time it takes to remove self tanner build up.</li>
            <li>I spray tan frequently and use this to prep my skin for a spray tan as well as exfoliate off old spray tans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>like the Baiden for more delicate areas like my torso, but for the legs and arms</li>
            <li>this glove has completely taken care of my keratosis pilaris.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft</li>
            <li>It makes my skin really soft.</li>
            <li>During my first use, the orange fabric shrunk up to a long \\&quot;pickle shape\\&quot; that is now narrower than the cuff.</li>
            <li>You can actually see the dead skin floating on the top of the water in the tub.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly, no breakouts!!&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I also bougrht a good expensive razor so that helped out as well.</li>
            <li>I could see how a person with very large hands would have trouble, but I wear a woman&#x27;s large size glove and have no problem.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty large hands for a woman and it is a really tight squeeze to get this thing on and off my hand.</li>
            <li>You really do see your dead skin roll right off.</li>
            <li>Is any more rough than other gome gloves?</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this item and initially did not think I would have problems with the size as my hand is small, but this one will just have to go back.</li>
            <li>(Not really - if you have very large hands, maybe).</li>
            <li>However, after a month of use, I already notice my skin is smoother, more even in appearance, and much less dry.</li>
            <li>For a man with average or large hands - the size of this thing could be a real problem.</li>
            <li>The only downside (which is not the gloves fault really) is my bathtub is full of dead skin after using this.</li>
            <li>I wanted to prep my skin for my custom spray tan for a special occasion, and I wanted to get all the little flaky patches and bumps from a lot of outdoor exposure gone.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried any of the less expensive versions I saw out there, but this one does really work great.</li>
            <li>This is actually the second one I&#x27;ve purchased as I lost the first in a move across country.</li>
            <li>I was originally going to get a Baiden mitt ($45+?!?)but this seemed like a more economical start.&lt;br /&gt;Purchasing some raw shea butter to follow the scrubbings with, I now have soft velvety skin all over and it even cleared up some face blemishes (if you even try this, use very LIGHT circular motions on the face, don&#x27;t go crazy with the delicate areas).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for a female.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this if your looking for a level of exfoliation you can only find at the spa!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this glove to anyone looking for spa quality exfoliation, and especially to those who are self tan junkies like myself.</li>
            <li>I can just see the dead skin that it&#x27;s removing on the glove without any special soap used or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It REALLY makes your skin feel super soft, but I will say that the glove is just a smidge small (but I have big hands).  </li>
            <li>I like the quality and it does the job as promised, however, once it gets wet after the first use, it shrinks</li>
            <li>and it is pretty rough.</li>
            <li>When I first used it, I saw dead skin rolling off from mainly my legs.</li>
            <li>I have some KP in certain areas of my body (upper arms and upper thighs) and it does help.</li>
            <li>My fianc&amp;eacute; has big hands and can&#x27;t fit them in this little wunderkind.</li>
            <li>I began using a new body wash scrub product shortly before introducing this mitten into my regimen.</li>
            <li>When done, rinse thoroughly, gently wring out excess water &amp; hang to dry.</li>
            <li>It is on par with the results I got when I used to do a very thorough dry brushing each and every day.  </li>
            <li>Especially a real pain to do it, when I&#x27;m wet and it is wet during bathing.</li>
            <li>I know it may sound gross but the dead skin just sloths off of you.</li>
            <li>still enjoying it, a little rough on the skin, but I think that&#x27;s the point!</li>
            <li>Just bare skin people!</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s wet, it does shrink quite a bit, but you can stretch it right back out</li>
            <li>It is crazy rough and can easily leave scratch marks or remove healthy layers of skin with even the lightest amount of pressure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a detailed review person, but this product works very well!!  </li>
            <li>Was afraid during that first shower that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get it off.</li>
            <li>After reading several reviews I bought this glove, WOW..</li>
            <li>I only used it 3 times so far</li>
            <li>TOO well if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li>I usually have sensitive skin and turn red easily even during a facial,  but the glove doesn&#x27;t make me red.  </li>
            <li>right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the issue with minimal sudsing, it&#x27;s relatively time consuming to use this, so I only find myself reaching for this 1-4 times per month.</li>
            <li>you exfoliate on a regular basis, with items such as the extra strength Buff Puff, you might not find this mitten miraculous, but it&#x27;s texture is different than most exfoliating puffs and gloves; its tightly woven, giving a slightly different type of exfoliation than what we exfoliation junkies are used too.</li>
            <li>My advice is to use it with black soap in a hot steamy shower.   </li>
            <li>They coordinate very well with each other.</li>
            <li>It works well as an exfoliator for sure, but is a little too harsh for me.  </li>
            <li>Wow, never knew an exfoliating glove could get as much dirt or dead skin out as this one.</li>
            <li>I like the glove, it makes my skin feel really soft but the only draw back</li>
            <li>But you have to soak in hot water  for a little bit before using it.</li>
            <li>I use African black soap first to wash the body and  get rid of oiliness, rise it of then use the glove to exfoliate.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any trouble getting the glove on, as other reviewers have stated they cannot fit their hand in.  </li>
            <li>you do deep exfoliation throughout the week so perhaps there isn&#x27;t much to come off in comparison to other reviewers who don&#x27;t exfoliate daily.\\</li>
            <li>Stay in the hot water a few minutes with no cleanser&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>maybe a tight fit for the average size male hand.</li>
            <li>I was concerned after reading others&#x27; reviews about the size being too small, but it was just right for me.</li>
            <li>I try not to use it every day, as it appears to dry my skin, but the skin also does feel really soft from it.</li>
            <li>Really enjoy this glove,  i don&#x27;t use it everyday but once a week with the black sea salt soap that i got as a gift.  </li>
            <li>Super tight weave, extremely abrasive yet in a microfiber way.</li>
            <li>And as others have stated, it will not fit large hands.  </li>
            <li>However, if you can not fit the black soap in your budget, being that it&#x27;s on the pricey side, I am very confident in it working just as well with any body wash of your choice; in fact, I actually find it easier to use the glove with my usual dove soap.</li>
            <li>Before this glove, it would typically take an hour+ for me to get rid of old self tanner and start over fresh, and by the end my skin would be raw and irritated.</li>

            <li> Great job on this product.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Overall, a great buy.</li>
            <li> This is a great exfoliating glove.</li>
            <li> This mitt does a great job.</li>
            <li> Skin feels great afterwards, but feels like sandpaper when using in the shower.</li>
            <li> I use it pre-spray tan and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not already an exfoliator, you&#x27;ll probably see great results with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Best with salt scrubs but also works on its own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for 3 months and it still works great and hasn&#x27;t gotten ripped or anything.</li>
            <li> This product is great.</li>
            <li> But I can see why this might be a great option for people.</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> I have been using it almost every day for a month or so and have noticed a great improvement in the clarity and smoothness of my skin.  </li>
            <li> Lol, I don&#x27;t have to see dirt falling off to tell this mitten</li>
            <li> Works great</li>
            <li> Works great but the wrist band gets moldy smelling even when I wring it out and hang it up in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Great shave prep</li>
            <li> great quality.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>

            <li> It is amazing!</li>
            <li> Nice!</li>
            <li> It is a very pleasant feeling and it helps me feel more awake.</li>
            <li> This is a good exfoliating glove, but nothing hugely remarkable.  </li>
            <li> This is a very good product, it is like a micro sand paper or something and works better than anything I have seen.  </li>
            <li> glove is good</li>
            <li> and it is outstandingly good at exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> I think this is a good thing&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;i was searching for a glove for the Moroccan Hammam liquid soap and it is really good one to have.</li>
            <li> is definitely is a good product -</li>
            <li> and he loved it.  </li>
            <li> This is a good Moroccan bath mitt.</li>
            <li> It does as good of a job as my body salt scrub.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> so I feel I got a good deal.  </li>
            <li> Superior to anything I have tried.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good for.</li>
            <li> and I loved it--swore I would continue to buy the product until they stopped making it.</li>
            <li> Definitely a very good mit and makes your skin smooth as silk.</li>
            <li> This is a great product...not sure why or how it works so well</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the glove.  </li>
            <li> I love this glove!</li>
            <li> I love this glove!</li>
            <li> The softness just got better!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I do still love it!</li>
            <li> This glove is so much better than loofahs!</li>
            <li> I love the scrubber!  </li>
            <li> I truly can&#x27;t believe people use this on their body, and even more so their face!</li>
            <li> It worked beautifully, but they do wear out after awhile and don&#x27;t seem to be available here anymore</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lovely!</li>
            <li> LOVE!</li>
            <li> SO pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Ooooooooo I love this!  </li>
            <li> For best result stay in the warm to hot water before use it</li>
            <li> exactly what i was looking for!!!!</li>
            <li> I use it on my face and it makes my skin look amazing....</li>
            <li> this is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This is amazing.</li>
            <li> It is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I exfoliate a couple of times a week and my skin feels amazing after.</li>
            <li> amazing.</li>
            <li> This tells me that it may not be the product doing amazing work, but the body washes used with the product.</li>
            <li> OMGâ€¦this thing is amazing.</li>
            <li> This glove is a really amazing tool to use when you exfoliate.  </li>
            <li> If you like a really good scrub you will love this.</li>
            <li> I use my Dove body wash or baroody olive soap (depending what I&#x27;m in the mood for), I put some on my skin and some on the glove, and it exfoliates so nicely.</li>
            <li> After months of use, no color bleeding at all which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> It has a nice, scratchy feel on your skin and is durable.</li>
            <li> Deft buying again.</li>
            <li> I am from morocco where we use this kind of exfoliating gloves.</li>
            <li> Mitt has nice texture but be gentle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Must be a gimmick of some kind.</li>
            <li> I paid about $20 for this and don&#x27;t think that it does the job any better than a good wash cloth or one of those exfoliating gloves that they sell at the beauty store for $5.</li>
            <li> the smooth, clean feeling is wonderful!</li>
            <li> I follow up with some body lotion and it feels great to know how clean I am.</li>
            <li> But for normal skin, it is great!  </li>
            <li> By far the best exfoliating glove I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> However, it is like a very fine sandpaper.</li>
            <li> This is the best, have always used Exfoliating Glove so my skin is very smooth &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> I think that it is more suitable for ladies</li>
            <li> Aesthetically, the glove is a beautiful terracotta color, it&#x27;s made from sturdy fabric, and the wrist is a very luxurious terrycloth.</li>
            <li> I needed a new shower scrubber, so I searched Amazon for something that was reasonably priced, had good reviews, and was eligible for prime, and this seemed to be my best bet.  </li>
            <li> Just seems to exfoliate better that way.</li>
            <li> Interesting and not quite what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> so I have been able to use it.</li>
            <li> Love this glove.</li>
            <li> , I use it mostly on my legs, feet, and arms</li>
            <li> My organic shea butter was the cherry on the top, after I showered with this glove.</li>
            <li> I have an authentic Hammam glove from Morocco and was looking for something comparable.  </li>
            <li> 9 months ago I went to Morocco and fell in love with the level of exfoliation the gloves offered.</li>
            <li> Love this</li>
            <li> I am in love with it.....</li>
            <li> way better than any towel could.</li>
            <li> love this exfoliating glove....</li>
            <li> It was an amazing feeling, my skin had never felt that smooth.  </li>
            <li> perfectly so if you have large hands this product may not be right for you.</li>
            <li> and I love to go</li>
            <li> /&gt;Looking for more that can be delivered to Canada.</li>
            <li> And I have to say - I love it.</li>
            <li> It exfoliates better that I thought.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the way this glove makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have smooth skin again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times &amp; cannot vouch for durability - but performance is excellent.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Most of the time I use a rinse off scrub.</li>
            <li> This works so much better than those exfoliating gloves you can buy in the store.</li>
            <li> I love this mitt.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> many years I have been search for a body scrubber that was as aggressive as one that was used on me in a bathhouse when I visited Tunisia.  </li>
            <li> The product is just ok.</li>
            <li> Overall, great product, watch the videos on Hammam Gloves, and give it a try!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a polishing that over time could get to deeper parts of the skin over time, layer by layer.</li>
            <li> I would not pay much more for it.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this glove.  </li>
            <li> but it worked well for pre-sunless tanning, more even exfoliation compared to a scrub.</li>
            <li> AM SO GLAD</li>
            <li> I DECIDED TO GO CHEAP!</li>
            <li> I love how it feels after scrubbing my arms.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s BETTER than the Magic Glove, sturdier, and stays on my hand better (no shifting around) than the Magic Glove.  </li>
            <li> I love seeing the exfoliation happening.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to switch hands during use.  :-)</li>
            <li> I love the feel on this mitt.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> cannot recommend any health/beauty product I&#x27;ve bought more than this one.</li>
            <li> for whatever reason, it seems like this Kae gets the skin rolling off my legs better and easier than the Baiden.  </li>
            <li> But I can see how some individuals might not be able to fully use it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> somehow you are able to sleep better.</li>
            <li> Love love love this....</li>
            <li> I seriously love it.</li>
            <li> You will need to use quite a bit of moisturizing soap, since the glove doesn&#x27;t create many suds, and the suds that do appear tend to dissipate quickly.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so smooth!</li>
            <li> I bought this glove and at first it worked good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> Few products are perfect but this thing is amazing in how it exfoliates my skin.</li>
            <li> Easy, quick and effective.  </li>
            <li> You will notice such an incredible difference in how your skin feels after using it.  </li>
            <li> This glove appears soft at first but it exfoliates wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I purchased another for my mother because I loved it so much</li>
            <li> If you have a tremendous amount of expendable income, this glove does exactly what it says it does--exfoliates nicely, keeps a lather, keeps nicely in the shower.</li>
            <li> Great for deep exfoliation and just feels good like a good back scratch.  </li>
            <li> I should be much more excited about it.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s easy):  </li>
            <li> This issue can easily be remedied by having a lady friend(s) use the glove to bath you instead.</li>
            <li> but when it got wet it fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> Really nice product good quality I use it in combination with Moroccan back Soap with argan oil</li>
            <li> I have fair and sensitive skin and have not scrubbed the top layer of skin off like some reviews.</li>
            <li> Compared to a hammam mit right which we have that&#x27;s straight out of Turkey, this thing feels like sandpaper....not happy with it.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping for a thicker, more padded glove, like the ones used in the Korean baths, but this one is no less good at what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> It consistently gives me amazing results.</li>
            <li> On the whole, I am very pleased with this purchase and hope to stay that way.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and quite effective.</li>
            <li> This is the best exfoliator ever, hands down.</li>
            <li> I can fit 4 fingers in easily, but that means not using the end of the mitt.</li>
            <li> Oh yea and I did buy it with the Savon Noir black soap these two go together and work wonderfully</li>
            <li> It works fine though.</li>
            <li> it will help your skin tremendously!</li>
            <li> Best glove hands down!</li>
            <li> It removes dead skin cells and makes your skin feel so wonderful and smooth.</li>
            <li> The glove looks HUGE</li>
            <li> Generous size can fit even a man&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li> This glove has been perfect for the shower to get dead skin off of my arms and legs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for about a few months and it still works real good.</li>
            <li> I ordered it because I have razor bumps on my thighs from lack of exfoliation and using cheap razors</li>
            <li> I continue to use the mitt, but with a light touch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit abrasive, being that it feels like sand paper and all; but it does leave your body feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li> With a light touch this could be used on the face.  </li>
            <li> Smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> Its made from a fiber that is very sturdy and effective so this mitt has a lot of life in it.</li>
            <li> I wear Medium sized gloves and these fit</li>
            <li> Perfect for when I&#x27;m using self tanner and need all the dead skin gone.</li>
            <li> smooth baby skin afterwards.</li>
            <li> I lightly used it on my face-</li>
            <li> and I stress LIGHTLY-</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.&lt;br /&gt;Works heavenly.&lt;br /&gt;Skin</li>
            <li> and I cannot fit my hand into it.</li>
            <li> It did leave my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> but overall, it does the trick and feels great.</li>
            <li> and I feel smooth after bathing.</li>
            <li> have Keratosis pilaris, and I have never used ANY product that can do what this does to help smooth out my skin.</li>
            <li> My hands are  medium sized, and they fit inside.</li>
            <li> I had a man medium size hands just fit</li>
            <li> Overall great product.</li>
            <li> and I definitely think it works great.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Amazing for the skin I&#x27;ve never been so soft!!!</li>
            <li> Honestly, a fine sandpaper would be more gentle than this thing!</li>
            <li> Very nice and soft skin right out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> They feel smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an authentic hammam glove and I was excited to use it for the first time.</li>
            <li> As long as you do this, your gonna get great results.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with the black soap by Kae and they do not go very good together.  </li>
            <li> It would certainly make bathing a more comfortable experience.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling really clean.</li>
            <li> , I just like to have that squeaky clean feeling that you get from scrubbing.  </li>
            <li> and you will love the amazing squeak clean feeling and softness of your entire body skin!</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and smooth and nice and clean</li>
            <li> However, I do wish I could more easily fit my whole hand inside the thing.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin a bright pink after I use it, and I feel more clean after a shower.</li>
            <li> Just use any kind of soap with it, it will leave your skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I think most people would have the same reaction unless they&#x27;re using it as a pumice on their heels or something (and honestly, my pumice stone is much more gentle than this</li>
            <li> Nothing special.  </li>
            <li> Good for overall scrub.</li>
            <li> After using this daily for over a week, I started seeing really good results.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes, I almost do not feel like soaping after I scrub, because my skin feels super clean after using just it.  </li>
            <li> I feel SUPER clean after.</li>
            <li> I love this glove so much.  </li>
            <li> This is much better but you can&#x27;t use it on really sensetive skin.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine that regular use of this mitt is good for your skin.  </li>
            <li> This kae glove will have you SO FRESH and SO CLEAN (CLEAN).</li>
            <li> This is more convenient however, because you can do in the shower and you get good results with less time.  </li>
            <li> This chips manicures super fast, so be sure to refresh your nails AFTER you shower.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> Pretty cool!</li>
            <li> I had KP, so exfoliating is very important to keep my skin looking decent.</li>
            <li> The product arrive really quickly.</li>
            <li> The glove dries quickly when I hang it in the shower, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting moldy or funky.</li>
            <li> The kae exfoliating glove is great: sheds dead skin and comfortably.</li>
            <li> Something like a mild sand paper.</li>
            <li> My skin is gross looking with clogged hair follicles before, then nice and smooth after I use this in the shower.</li>
            <li> I will steam-wash it or soak it in very hot water every so often to keep it clean, and I expect it will continue to keep me clean, clear and smooth!</li>
            <li> not uncomfortably so - it&#x27;s supposed to fit like a mitten.</li>
            <li> (1) Apply soap to your body first, then to the glove, then use a light touch.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying a new one to replace it :-)</li>
            <li> No pressure needed, and works great with black soap.</li>
            <li> This glove is much \\&quot;fancier\\&quot; but the material is EXACTLY as the authentic one from Morocco.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it since and my skin is healthier, dewy and sooo summer ready!!</li>
            <li> I will continue to keep my eyes open for a more enjoyable/effective exfoliating product and I predict that eventually this will go to the graveyard under my sink!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never done intense exfoliation like this, prepare to be grossed out!!  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say that I&#x27;ve never felt so clean and smooth before with any other type of sponge.</li>
            <li> But gets mouldy far too quickly had to throw it away !!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great size and shape and the texture really grabs dead skin, yet rinses easily.</li>
            <li> would say it actually works better if you are taking a bath, but the shower is fine as well.</li>
            <li> my whole body is smooth,</li>
            <li> That being said This product is great for everyday scrubbing.</li>
            <li> This glove does a great job of getting rid of dead skin cells without tearing you to shreds.  </li>
            <li> This glove takes off amazing amounts of dead skin (I love scrubbing</li>
            <li> Talk about SOFT &amp; SMOOTH skin!</li>
            <li> Definitely will exfoliate you well, just have a nice body cream for after.</li>
            <li> I love this exfoliating glove, my skin is now renewed and soft, my hands and arms no longer feel like sand paper.</li>
            <li> I spent more time trying to keep the glove on than actually enjoying</li>
            <li> totally worth the price</li>
            <li> Soooooo worth it.</li>
            <li> I think if the mit were bigger, it would move around while I am scrubbing and not be as effective.</li>
            <li> Would be nice if it had different sizes too</li>
            <li> It is really worth it when I do set aside the time, though.</li>
            <li> I really love this glove so far.</li>
            <li> So overall, a very good product, however the glove DOESN&#x27;T FIT the average man&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li> I am not into exfoliating as much as I want to feel clean.</li>
            <li> but after I use it I feel super clean and my skin feels very soft.</li>
            <li> This nice exfoliating glove arrived swiftly but as a person with large hands, it is not possible to use it correctly.</li>
            <li> This will certainly exfoliate you!</li>
            <li> feels so soft and is able to absorb lotion much easier and quicker.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am young and able-bodied, so this glove is easy for me to use.</li>
            <li> it gets your skin very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s true, once you rinse off and feel your skin, it feels super taut and soft</li>
            <li> I like it very much</li>
            <li> my entire body just feels smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> its leaves my skin baby smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> It would have been better if the cuff around it were a darker or different color as it did have a tendency to mildew, but overall, I love it.  </li>
            <li> Just soak in hot tub or shower and rub against your skin...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the glove for 4 months now, using at least 1-2x a week, and it is still in great condition.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s better than regular exfoliating gloves, also it seems to have been having a minimizing effect on my shaving habits.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for exfoliation and this is great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy ten more.</li>
            <li> This is equal to or better than others on Amazon</li>
            <li> but so much cheaper!</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This mitten is made very well!</li>
            <li> I used it on areas of my back that I haven&#x27;t been able to get to otherwise</li>
            <li> This thing really exfoliates!</li>
            <li> An absolute staple!</li>
            <li> For anyone interested, I used Softsoap&#x27;s Body Butter Coconut Scrub with this mitten.</li>
            <li> This really does work!  </li>
            <li> Exfoliates my skin very well!</li>
            <li> Love how this exfoliating hamam gove work I just purchased a second one</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be sure to look up the youtube video on how to properly use this product-</li>
            <li> First off, I was underwhelmed when it arrived -</li>
            <li> It no longer was exfoliating as it did when I first got it.</li>
            <li> This really, really works!</li>
            <li> I plan to buy another, to be able to do both sides of my body at the same time.</li>
            <li> I have always used a glycolic acid lotion with both, so I have a good amount of dead skin to rub off.</li>
            <li> The material is very fine with a sandpaper like feel to it but not to abrasive as long as you don&#x27;t apply a ton of pressure to the area you are exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> In about 2 and half weeks my thighs were so smooth and razor bump free!</li>
            <li> I normally save reviews until I&#x27;ve used a product for awhile, but after the very first use, I want to stand on the rooftop and praise this mitt!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This mitt is fairly inexpensive, but does just as well as the more expensive ones.  </li>
            <li> I will be honest, I&#x27;ve exfoliated in the shower on a near daily basis for over a decade.</li>
            <li> , even my husband noticed how smooth my skin is (that&#x27;s major)..</li>
            <li> A little less abrasive than what I experienced in Morocco but does a fair enough job.</li>
            <li> THIS MAKES YOUR SKIN SUPER SOFT!</li>
            <li> , the color is much nicer than the original authentic black</li>
            <li> Be gentle on the rest of your body at first.  </li>
            <li> First when I received it, it felt very silky</li>
            <li> The fit is excellent for my small hands, although it can also be used as a small cloth instead of as a glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all over, and the resulting exfoliation makes my skin feel soft, smooth, and brand new!  </li>
            <li> My skin is SUPER soft now -- like a baby&#x27;s bottom.  </li>
            <li> It had no dramatic effect on my skin.</li>
            <li> It seems like the Kae requires less finesse - if your legs are generally somewhat wet and you squeezed out the Kae glove, you can start rubbing off the skin, in contrast for the Baiden you have to futz with getting your skin to exactly the right amount of just barely damp and the mitten squeezed perfectly and even then start rubbing in the right direction and keep rubbing until maybe the moisture evaporates to the right degree</li>
            <li> Honestly, I did not notice a change in my skin, but that may be because I do a lot of other things too keep it smooth like daily saunas, good moisturizing, and occasional dry brushing.  </li>
            <li> and i have large hands.</li>
            <li> The thumb side had a large hole.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not seen the dead skin that others stated they saw as they rinsed away their bodies, but I haven&#x27;t seen it on me either; so I&#x27;m satisfied!</li>
            <li> This is only true if you soak your body completely in hot water for 30minutes so don&#x27;t expect it to work with a hot shower.</li>
            <li> I really like the mild exfoliation this offers.</li>
            <li> Definitely easier than holding a loofah, and it works better and does not get so gross so quickly.  </li>
            <li> So much less rubbing for good exfoliation, and I see way more dead skin coming off with this.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I&#x27;ve been able to exfoliate my whole body and even my face on the other side of the sponge.</li>
            <li> No need to use much force with this glove - it&#x27;s like super-ultra-fine sandpaper.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how much it exfoliated.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Korean, so I&#x27;m very used to body scrubs.</li>
            <li> I really like this glove</li>
            <li> It does its job very well.</li>
            <li> I am a real consumer and therefore a real reviewer.  </li>
            <li> I give five stars to this spong because it exfoliates very well.</li>
            <li> I would recomend this to anyone who wants to exfoilate, and who suffer from KP</li>
            <li> This glove works really well, just like everyone says.</li>
            <li> Use this mitt gently as it is a bit scatchy.  </li>
            <li> It exfoliates really well.</li>
            <li> I really have a morbid curiosity every time I use it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It really scrubs you well.</li>
            <li> It really buffs the skin well.</li>
            <li> Works very well, so well that my mom got one too.</li>
            <li> and amazed at how much skin really comes off.</li>
            <li> It was really helped my eczema.</li>
            <li> but it really works on my body</li>
            <li> But would really like to have a thumb.</li>
            <li> This mitt is like a chemical peel for your whole body.</li>
            <li> This mitt really did the trick fo me.  </li>
            <li> but they are not at intense as this one.  </li>
            <li> Appears to be durable and it dries very fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li> price was cheap, the delivery was almost instant -</li>
            <li> Also I use it before shaving (everywhere, really everywhere)  keeps me smoother</li>
            <li> Really like this glove.</li>
            <li> Exfoliates very well.  </li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t figure how in the world it is capable of exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I started using it because I had ingrown hairs on the back of my legs, and now I&#x27;m all smooth.  </li>
            <li> it helps to remove the skin and it is very smoothy</li>
            <li> Works really well on my skin.</li>
            <li> This glove REALLY does work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to use this daily without problems all over and have seen marked improvement to my skin health.    </li>
            <li> This product is not for the sensitive kind as it is on the \\&quot;rough side\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s kind of ick-inducing, but the results are so worth</li>
            <li> BABY SOFT TO THE MAX WITHOUT LOTION!!!</li>
            <li> It exfoliates more effectively than any other implements I&#x27;ve tried, such as Salux cloths, loofahs, wash cloths, and regular sponges.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even see signs of wear other than the string used to hang it with, so I will be using it for many months to come.</li>
            <li> had recently been to a Korean spa where I had my whole body scrubbed down and loved it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am happy to report this glove worth the price so far, and I hope it will last at least a year.</li>
            <li> I just use regular body wash from Target with this--no special hammam clay scrub, etc.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have problems working with the size of the glove and find it to be a minor issue, you&#x27;ll really enjoy it&#x27;s quality.</li>
            <li> Boyfriend loves it too, especially on his back (but who doesn&#x27;t like a good back scratch from time to time?)</li>
            <li> First I thought it&#x27;s too soft but water made the difference.</li>
            <li> I put a nice all natural lotion all over my skin, let it soak in really well and soften up all the dead cells, then use this in the shower.</li>
            <li> There are other products out there that are similar, but are much more costly, so I figured I would give this one a try, and I am glad I did because it appears to do the same thing as the pricier gloves!  </li>
            <li> Only thing I wish is that it was in a light color, so I could see all the dead skin it sloughs offs better.</li>
            <li> I love the result it helped me to get rid of the dark skin in my tummy which I got as a result of three pregnancies.</li>
            <li> I am still old but my whole body is clean, fresh and pink.  </li>
            <li> Even better with the Kae Savon Noir black soap that it&#x27;s recommended to be purchased with.</li>
            <li> Be sure and buy it with the black soap.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks with moroccan black soap with argan and my face feels smoother and softer plus most of the blackheads are gone.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this glove while it lasted (I used it in conjunction with the black soap).</li>
            <li> quickly-- started coming apart at the seams after the third use!</li>
            <li> I have small hands so this is not a problem, but I&#x27;m pretty sure you could still use this product without wearing it as a glove.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great for men&#x27;s thick back skin.  </li>
            <li> If I were to use this regularly I&#x27;d end up with super irritated and inflamed skin -</li>
            <li> this glove really exfoliates your skin and leaves it very soft  </li>
            <li> I decided to quickly use this right before I got out of the tub just to see if it would work the way other reviewers said it would.</li>
            <li> I naturally have pretty soft skin that doesn&#x27;t need much exfoliation (or so I thought)</li>
            <li> Works well, just go easy the first few times you use it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this glove.  </li>
            <li> That said, I can highly recommend this glove now.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this</li>
            <li> It does feel like fine grit sandpaper going over wet soapy skin so if that is not what you are looking for, this glove is not for you.</li>
            <li> I thought I had scrubbed kind of hard but weren&#x27;t exfoliated well.  </li>
            <li> (Do this kind of serious scrubbing once every 2-3 weeks - regular washing is okay on a daily basis)</li>
            <li> I like using an exfoliating mitt so much better than the gloves or bottled cleansers, but tis mitt is extremely rough and harsh and can hurt if you don&#x27;t have a light touch.  </li>
            <li> It really exfoliates leaving your skin soft.  </li>
            <li> for someone who may have sensitive skin this mitt may be too much.</li>
            <li> great product, wrong price.</li>
            <li> It is pretty big, covers my whole hand and does not slip off.</li>
            <li> use it not only on my KP, but also pretty much everywhere else as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lovely to see all the dead skin coming off.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin with eczema, and sensitive skin(bruise easily) and it doesnt irritate my skin at all.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty gross, but hey it&#x27;s better down the drain than on your body!</li>
            <li> I had to buy a new one while waiting for my mother-in-law to sew the one that I washed.</li>
            <li> I have a spray tan machine and you have to exfoliate it off before you apply a new one.</li>
            <li> I always feel like new after using it.</li>
            <li> I have very wide women&#x27;s hands and find the glove to fit well.  </li>
            <li> They should seriously call this the Amazing Exfoliating Glove, because it is that</li>
            <li> As far as the actual glove goes, it gives really nice exfoliation--jut a slight circular motion</li>
            <li> I went to brick &amp; mortar stores looking for something that would give me a similar level of exfoliation, but everything was too gentle to really help me out.    </li>
            <li> I used this and another Japanese kind of dry skin brush (both in the shower) and after doing that -- I felt so sleepy and had a deep sleep.</li>
            <li> Love this little mitt!</li>
            <li> I use this glove with ultra moisturizing (hair) conditioner &amp; gently &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; my skin from neck down, then cool rinse.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and eczema and have had no problems with this at all.</li>
            <li> Best used after you have been in the shower for a while, you will see the skin come off like crazy!</li>
            <li> Best gome glove I&#x27;ve found on Amazon, though a couple of reviewers have taken issue:  (A) \\&quot;Too rough\\&quot;?</li>
            <li> ( my mom is 60 years old and never ever have a selulit!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> When I first received it and tried it on it was too big</li>
            <li> I have used the baiden mitt in the past and it was okay,</li>
            <li> wow!  </li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve purchased and come across many bath brushes.</li>
            <li> I have used it 6-7 times now and it still works the same as it did the first day.</li>
            <li> Wow, I feel like I have new skin!&lt;br</li>
            <li> (unless you pull on it excessively, and often), which is the real problem with cheap, elastic gloves.   </li>
            <li> The first time I used this it left my skin baby soft and i noticed that the bumps behinds my legs started dissapearing over time.</li>
            <li> For the price I think that this defect should not be expected, but after a quick read, replacement does not seem to be an Amazon option.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit too rough but it definitely works like hammam gloves and it help the skin exfoliate; and I could see the result by my own eyes!</li>
            <li> I noted no skin actually peeling off my body as some reviews, but I exfoliate often, so this is not a factor for me; however for me, my results have been positive.</li>
            <li> On my first use, I noticed the glove shrinks when wet, and while I got a really great exfoliating experience with this glove, the size did made it uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old could not believe how soft my skin was after using it!  </li>
            <li> I used it along with my Moroccan Black Soap and can I say baby soft, smooth skin.</li>
            <li> It is a tight fit for my hand.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not like a scuba tight fit to your hand</li>
            <li> Well, it certainly works well following their directions.  </li>
            <li> I surprised how much smoother my skin was, especially my feet and knees!</li>
            <li> I use the glove with the black soap and it leaves my skin soft,smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li> it was just the glove in a clear bag.  </li>
            <li> and you can see the dirt and old skin just roll off.</li>
            <li> I recommend using it lightly on any other body area other than the feet at first.  </li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> but sometimes I use it with regular soap and exfoliates really well.</li>
            <li> and I get out of the shower so soft</li>
            <li> I bought one for several on my Christmas list ABSOLUTELY a must for any woman wanting to exfoliate and skin looking radiant</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> With my sensitive skin, I can&#x27;t afford to exfoliate my face with anything without breaking out but this exfoliating glove was somehow designed for skin like mine.</li>
            <li> Otherwise these cleanser makes your skin soft and exfoliater will not work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin was old and gray looking.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and with out ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s silky and soft if you touch it.</li>
            <li> A lot of old skin comes off making you feel like a newborn.</li>
            <li> Does not work for bottom of feet, and makes face sensitive to applying moisturizer</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin baby soft as ever.</li>
            <li> i use it once in a while because i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it once so far</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and have to rub superhard to get exfoliated at all.</li>
            <li> This is the closest I have come so far.  </li>
            <li> The only exfoliating glove that really exfoliates.</li>
            <li> For individuals with the KP that is only bumpy, you may really benefit with continued use.</li>
            <li> I also took someones advice and used Soft Soap Body Butter Coconut Scrub with it.  </li>
            <li> My husband stole my old one</li>
            <li> I was surprised it got here</li>
            <li> I use this once a week to exfoliate and my skin is so soft afterwards.  </li>
            <li> far too abrasive.</li>
            <li> I self tan frequently and purchased this glove in hopes of dramatically reducing the time it takes to remove self tanner build up.</li>
            <li> I spray tan frequently and use this to prep my skin for a spray tan as well as exfoliate off old spray tans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> like the Baiden for more delicate areas like my torso, but for the legs and arms</li>
            <li> this glove has completely taken care of my keratosis pilaris.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft</li>
            <li> It makes my skin really soft.</li>
            <li> During my first use, the orange fabric shrunk up to a long \\&quot;pickle shape\\&quot; that is now narrower than the cuff.</li>
            <li> You can actually see the dead skin floating on the top of the water in the tub.  </li>
            <li> Most importantly, no breakouts!!&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I also bougrht a good expensive razor so that helped out as well.</li>
            <li> I could see how a person with very large hands would have trouble, but I wear a woman&#x27;s large size glove and have no problem.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty large hands for a woman and it is a really tight squeeze to get this thing on and off my hand.</li>
            <li> You really do see your dead skin roll right off.</li>
            <li> Is any more rough than other gome gloves?</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this item and initially did not think I would have problems with the size as my hand is small, but this one will just have to go back.</li>
            <li> (Not really - if you have very large hands, maybe).</li>
            <li> However, after a month of use, I already notice my skin is smoother, more even in appearance, and much less dry.</li>
            <li> For a man with average or large hands - the size of this thing could be a real problem.</li>
            <li> The only downside (which is not the gloves fault really) is my bathtub is full of dead skin after using this.</li>
            <li> I wanted to prep my skin for my custom spray tan for a special occasion, and I wanted to get all the little flaky patches and bumps from a lot of outdoor exposure gone.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any of the less expensive versions I saw out there, but this one does really work great.</li>
            <li> This is actually the second one I&#x27;ve purchased as I lost the first in a move across country.</li>
            <li> I was originally going to get a Baiden mitt ($45+?!?)but this seemed like a more economical start.&lt;br /&gt;Purchasing some raw shea butter to follow the scrubbings with, I now have soft velvety skin all over and it even cleared up some face blemishes (if you even try this, use very LIGHT circular motions on the face, don&#x27;t go crazy with the delicate areas).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for a female.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this if your looking for a level of exfoliation you can only find at the spa!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this glove to anyone looking for spa quality exfoliation, and especially to those who are self tan junkies like myself.</li>
            <li> I can just see the dead skin that it&#x27;s removing on the glove without any special soap used or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It REALLY makes your skin feel super soft, but I will say that the glove is just a smidge small (but I have big hands).  </li>
            <li> I like the quality and it does the job as promised, however, once it gets wet after the first use, it shrinks</li>
            <li> and it is pretty rough.</li>
            <li> When I first used it, I saw dead skin rolling off from mainly my legs.</li>
            <li> I have some KP in certain areas of my body (upper arms and upper thighs) and it does help.</li>
            <li> My fianc&amp;eacute; has big hands and can&#x27;t fit them in this little wunderkind.</li>
            <li> I began using a new body wash scrub product shortly before introducing this mitten into my regimen.</li>
            <li> When done, rinse thoroughly, gently wring out excess water &amp; hang to dry.</li>
            <li> It is on par with the results I got when I used to do a very thorough dry brushing each and every day.  </li>
            <li> Especially a real pain to do it, when I&#x27;m wet and it is wet during bathing.</li>
            <li> I know it may sound gross but the dead skin just sloths off of you.</li>
            <li> still enjoying it, a little rough on the skin, but I think that&#x27;s the point!</li>
            <li> Just bare skin people!</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s wet, it does shrink quite a bit, but you can stretch it right back out</li>
            <li> It is crazy rough and can easily leave scratch marks or remove healthy layers of skin with even the lightest amount of pressure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a detailed review person, but this product works very well!!  </li>
            <li> Was afraid during that first shower that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get it off.</li>
            <li> After reading several reviews I bought this glove, WOW..</li>
            <li> I only used it 3 times so far</li>
            <li> TOO well if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li> I usually have sensitive skin and turn red easily even during a facial,  but the glove doesn&#x27;t make me red.  </li>
            <li> right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the issue with minimal sudsing, it&#x27;s relatively time consuming to use this, so I only find myself reaching for this 1-4 times per month.</li>
            <li> you exfoliate on a regular basis, with items such as the extra strength Buff Puff, you might not find this mitten miraculous, but it&#x27;s texture is different than most exfoliating puffs and gloves; its tightly woven, giving a slightly different type of exfoliation than what we exfoliation junkies are used too.</li>
            <li> My advice is to use it with black soap in a hot steamy shower.   </li>
            <li> They coordinate very well with each other.</li>
            <li> It works well as an exfoliator for sure, but is a little too harsh for me.  </li>
            <li> Wow, never knew an exfoliating glove could get as much dirt or dead skin out as this one.</li>
            <li> I like the glove, it makes my skin feel really soft but the only draw back</li>
            <li> But you have to soak in hot water  for a little bit before using it.</li>
            <li> I use African black soap first to wash the body and  get rid of oiliness, rise it of then use the glove to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any trouble getting the glove on, as other reviewers have stated they cannot fit their hand in.  </li>
            <li> you do deep exfoliation throughout the week so perhaps there isn&#x27;t much to come off in comparison to other reviewers who don&#x27;t exfoliate daily.\\</li>
            <li> Stay in the hot water a few minutes with no cleanser&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> maybe a tight fit for the average size male hand.</li>
            <li> I was concerned after reading others&#x27; reviews about the size being too small, but it was just right for me.</li>
            <li> I try not to use it every day, as it appears to dry my skin, but the skin also does feel really soft from it.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy this glove,  i don&#x27;t use it everyday but once a week with the black sea salt soap that i got as a gift.  </li>
            <li> Super tight weave, extremely abrasive yet in a microfiber way.</li>
            <li> And as others have stated, it will not fit large hands.  </li>
            <li> However, if you can not fit the black soap in your budget, being that it&#x27;s on the pricey side, I am very confident in it working just as well with any body wash of your choice; in fact, I actually find it easier to use the glove with my usual dove soap.</li>
            <li> Before this glove, it would typically take an hour+ for me to get rid of old self tanner and start over fresh, and by the end my skin would be raw and irritated.</li>
            <li> I have small hands and it is a tight fit getting it on and off.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, I have small hands so with a little force</li>
            <li> I no longer have itching due to  old skin hanging on over newer skin.  </li>
            <li> This mitt is small, I have normal hands for a woman and this just barely covers them.  </li>
            <li> The cuff is small and does not have much stretch</li>
            <li> I can see it lasting a long time.</li>
            <li> if Kae made a long back scrubbing cloth, I&#x27;d be in heaven.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> would like to have a long cloth with this same texture.</li>
            <li> It will last you a LONG time, too!</li>
            <li> After each use I rinsed out the glove and hung it up to dry as directed by the instructions, however, the stitching on the seam simply came undone.  </li>
            <li> and I notice less irritation on sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> 1 month later it began to mold around the band part of the glove that takes the longest to completely dry out after each use.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I purchased a Magic Exfoliating Glove for some ridiculous price - around $40!  </li>
            <li> I about removed my face entirely applying the amount of pressure I use with my other loofa glove thingy (regular grocery store junk).  </li>
            <li> Definitely don&#x27;t scrub hard - several soft passes is all that is needed.</li>
            <li> and if you have large hands, it will not fit you!!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve mostly been too rough and disappointing, although they help me reach my back.</li>
            <li> my rubbing softly but firmly against skin.</li>
            <li> I have felt similar from the rough cloths from WalMart &amp; this one</li>
            <li> and so I am totally accustomed to using rough mitts on my skin but</li>
            <li> It removes dead skin and leave baby soft</li>
            <li> After one use, the KP on my legs has smoothed to a degree, its has rough patches still but its only been one use!</li>
            <li> I took a long bath, and used another exfoliating product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m battling is not only bumpy, but you can see the dark hair follicles in the KP, my hair is black, so even on bronze skin, its apparent simply from the color of my hair follicles alone.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to any other brand.</li>
            <li> Other &amp;#34;glove-like&amp;#34; ones out there do not exfoliate at all, they only irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I felt this product was no different than my other exfoliation scrubs.</li>
            <li> There is no salt scrub, sugar scrub, brush, mitt, pouf, loofah, or any other abrasive thing that could hold a candle to the sheer sandpapery goodness of this mitt.</li>
            <li> was a bit much to dry.  </li>
            <li> I have horrifically dry skin</li>
            <li> Hang by hook to dry after each use to keep shape.</li>
            <li> (water misuse is seriously frowned on), so after  showering, before getting out, I used the mitt  and did a fast rinse-off.</li>
            <li> The string needs to be longer to allow hanging it up yo dry.</li>
            <li> I have three different types of exfoliating turkish mittens, this Kae, the Baiden, and Active Derma.  </li>
            <li> holy crap is my skin soft,  smooth,  and glowing afterwards!</li>
            <li> I read some other reviews saying it was too small, and I could see how it might fit a little tight for some hands.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem like a negative for me though, just normal wear and tear.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t ever go loose</li>
            <li> Before wetting it, it was really loose.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a deep down exfoliating glove, this is it.  </li>
            <li> Price fluctuations- wait for the cost to go back down.</li>
            <li> Even my dry nasty skin comes out looking and feeling much softer, fresh and new!</li>
            <li> with a little water and some seriously vigorous one way scrubbing, dead skin collects and rolls off leaving sking baby smooth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am use to dry exfoliation, but this says to use it during your bath or shower (wet).  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t purchased the black soap just yet,  but will try that and come back to give an update on how they worked for me.  </li>
            <li> Also just a little hint it helps to either have your skin just barely damp and the glove wet or the glove on the drier side and your skin really wet, one or the other.</li>
            <li> Also, unless you are very flexible, which I am not, it is difficult to reach your back with this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to be rough.</li>
            <li> How to avoid a rough experience</li>
            <li> The point is to go over your skin multiple times lightly, not once or twice forcefully.    </li>
            <li> If you have super-sensitive skin, you probably shouldn&#x27;t be using any exfoliating glove, and this gome will likely cause you trouble.</li>
            <li> you actually see the dead skin roll off and onto the glove.</li>
            <li> The texture has to be rough.</li>
            <li> Buy if you make it wet, it becomes something else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not used to something quite so rough</li>
            <li> this mitt is rather rough.  </li>
            <li> I used Eden Allure argan oil which is expensive but worth it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how people think this is too rough.</li>
            <li> I have a loofah I use for regular everyday showers and</li>
            <li> actually feels like its getting all the dirt and dead skin off.</li>
            <li> Back where I am from they would use hammam gloves in the bath houses to remove dead skin</li>
            <li> Also, I felt that even after using it 3-4 times, the product is still rough on my skin.</li>
            <li> Over time, it may get all of these closed follicles and ingrown hairs stuck in the KP.</li>
            <li> Kiss that rough skin goodbye.</li>
            <li> I do used it on my face and it is NOT too rough.</li>
            <li> I use 1-2 times a week with a scrub but find it is too rough to use on my face.</li>
            <li> Its rough, it exfoliates like you want it to.</li>
            <li> I have been to a number of Hammams and none ever used something as rough and sandpaper like as this.</li>
            <li> It is a rough scrubber -</li>
            <li> but I feel for what I was looking for that was to be expected.  </li>
            <li> To me, this is not too rough.</li>
            <li> But.... when you get it wet, the texture miraculously changes to something resembling sand paper.</li>
            <li> They get stuff off my wife&#x27;s body that neither of is expected.  </li>
            <li> I used to buy it at a spa, but they stopped carrying it because people were complaining about how rough the texture was.  </li>
            <li> This glove gives the intense level of exfoliation I want, without being harsh like what you need for thick skin on the foot.</li>
            <li> My fingers and thumb are just pushed tightly together when I try to make a flat palm and use it.</li>
            <li> Not worth the cost for a glove that probably only lasted less than 5 months.</li>
            <li> However, the price of the glove has doubled in 7 months, and the value of the product is not worthy of $22 every 4 months or so (the terry part of the mitt has been detaching for that long</li>
            <li> Initially when I opened the package I was a little disappointed to see the thinness of the product (I paid almost $13 for it), but after testing it out in the shower I fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> My hand is 6 inches long and my fingers have to curl a bit to use this glove and it does not stay properly on my hand when I am scrubbing my body, the glove rotates on its own and is very annoying to readjust.</li>
            <li> or you&#x27;ll end up with raw red sore skin for a while.</li>
            <li> I wear womens small size gloves, and I can&#x27;t get my entire hand into it after it is wet.</li>
            <li> Some don&#x27;t know that KP is Red bumps on some and depending on the amount of melanin in the skin, can be little black bumps on others.</li>
            <li> If your big on the Korean-bath house culture, you&#x27;ve probably heard that you can see black dead skin roll off you with scrubs...</li>
            <li> With the baiden my arms would get too tired to finish my whole body, it seems like less work with this glove.</li>
            <li> Only problem is the cuff is small.</li>
            <li> This glove exfoliates the way it is supposed to, but it starts out small and gets smaller!</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> This glove seems to be wound tighter then any other exfoliating glove I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased two other mitts on Amazon</li>
            <li> I only am taking away one star because it is difficult for my big hands to use properly.</li>
            <li> Despite the short shower, dead skin came off!  </li>
            <li> other people talk about</li>
            <li> I definitely prefer the mitten to washing with an ordinary towel, but I will never use it without a body scrub.</li>
            <li> As other review said...</li>
            <li> The glove does shrink so medium to small hands only.</li>
            <li> I use this every other week before I shave my legs.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that the glove is not really made for a man&#x27;s hand so it is a little tight but not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if your a serious exfoliate-r!</li>
            <li> Dead skin comes off in rolls, leaves skin feeling a little raw but soft.</li>
            <li> Either one, they are ugly and not so easy to control.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a bit rough--</li>
            <li> (2) Try to use it with a glycerin, french milled, or other thick, luxurious soap.</li>
            <li> Apply black soap on wet skin  and lather an rinse, AND then use the wet glove (wet and twist from excessive water)</li>
            <li> Just a little TOO rough on my skin while in the shower.</li>
            <li> this over a loofah or other scrubbers for less $?</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see how a guy with big hands can use this because it shrinks my husband has a hard time getting his hand into it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like putting my hand in that cold wet thing when I first started using it.  </li>
            <li> I feel I have average lady hands</li>
            <li> I bought it solely based on other reviews &amp; I recommend it as well!</li>
            <li> &quot; I was about to give my sad synopsis of a review to the other daily exfoliators out there when suddenly I felt my skin after drying off.</li>
            <li> However, I bought it because I used other products and with them the rolls of dead skin fall off.</li>
            <li> I have used it with black soap gel as well as with bar soap and body wash and it works well with everything.  </li>
            <li> I use it together with Moroccan black soap with argan oil 2-3 x per week.</li>
            <li> I bought it to use with moroccan black soap</li>
            <li> I use it with Zakia&#x27;s Morrocan Black Soap with Argan Oil, an oil-based cleanser.</li>
            <li> use the glove with the black moroccan soap</li>
            <li> It feels like you are scraping your skin off with the black soap.  </li>
            <li> The amount of dead skin this pulls off is both fascinating and disgusting.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine found this one for me, so I took a chance and ordered it along with the black soap.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the black soap and the mud clay as well also by Kae.  </li>
            <li> I also purchased the black soap.</li>
            <li> it gets the black heads off my nose.</li>
            <li> and although I cant say that its helped with shaving less often</li>
            <li> I purchased this with the Kae Savon Noir - Black Soap</li>
            <li> I also bought my mother the scrubber and black soap for her birthday</li>
            <li> I use it with Moroccan Black Soap.</li>
            <li> It keeps the black head on my nose away and my makeup goes on better.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Because I had read all the reviews I was a little afraid to scrub - and was surprised after my shower that my stomach was a little red but other parts</li>
            <li> I use this with my Morracan black soap.</li>
            <li> When you use it with the Morracan black soap (after it sits on pre-humidified skin for 10 mins), use circular motions.</li>
            <li> Use this with Moroccan black soap in the infrared sauna.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the black soap.  </li>
            <li> I decided to keep my rating a four stars because the glove is a bit small and the little loop has come undone after about two weeks use (hanging on a hook to dry after using).  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this glove if you like to fake tan.</li>
            <li> People say it&#x27;s a small mitt it does shrink when it gets wet</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this glove because the price seemed a bit high.</li>
            <li> I also tried using some of the black soap others have referenced and it dried out my skin in a couple days</li>
            <li> use a gradual sunless tanner everyday and this in the shower to rub off any dark spots, it allows me to tan everyday and not worry about build up.</li>
            <li> but i wish it was a little stronger.</li>
            <li> Like sandpaper a little.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little snug, but</li>
            <li> I read other reviews that it&#x27;s too small and slips off, but I have had no problems with it.</li>
            <li> Also, it can smell a little mildew-y if you leave it in the shower.</li>
            <li> A little abrasive, so beware</li>
            <li> glove is a little small as other reviewers have mentioned</li>
            <li> I got a little overzealous in scrubbing and ended up with a scab - my fault, not the products.  </li>
            <li> I was not familiar with this type of glove but all the reviews got me lured in.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little rougher than the ones I used growing up.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the quality, but the exfoliation was nice.</li>
            <li> You have to make sure they don&#x27;t just stay wet because the can develop an awful smell.  </li>
            <li> It is too harsh for me.</li>
            <li> It would never fit over a man&#x27;s hand.  </li>
            <li> With all the yucky dead skin scrubbed off now</li>
            <li> always  ask what I use on my skin,they still  don&#x27;t  believe  this,but let me tell  you this thing  will get away all the dead skin after soaking  your  body.</li>
            <li> and I bought it to end the cycle of buying and soon throwing out those mesh bath sponges (like this: amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B001CTQMIC/ref&#x3D;mp_s_a_2?qid&#x3D;1291410691&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2) that always wear out within a few months.</li>
            <li> The texture is rough, so becareful if u have delicate skin.</li>
            <li> Boil it every few months to freshen it &amp; kill any mildew/bacteria.</li>
            <li> It helps take off a lot of dead skin.</li>
            <li> I cant say that I have ever seen the dead skin come off</li>
            <li> I never realized I had so much dead skin until I used this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of disgusting to see all the cells slough off but</li>
            <li> Gets off a lot of dead skin.</li>
            <li> There is SO MUCH dead skin hanging on to you</li>
            <li> It gets all the dead skin cells off...</li>
            <li> I like this exfoliating glove but there are a few things that could be improved.</li>
            <li> It helps to shed the layer of dead skin</li>
            <li> It worked so well that I was forced to drain the tub, and shower off because of how much crude came off of my &#x27;clean&#x27; skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too disappointed because I did find out what body wash is an amazing exfoliator, but since I bought this mitten as an exfoliator, I would call this a fail.</li>
            <li> I read in other reviews that there were issues with the size of the glove, yet I still went ahead and ordered it because I have very small hands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unless you&#x27;re looking to do some serious skin removal - like on your heels the way you&#x27;d use a pumice stone - this thing is waaay too rough!</li>
            <li> It is quite disgusting but leaves the skin smooth and exfoliated!</li>
            <li> After rinse and lather with your usual shower gel or soap</li>
            <li> I use it 2-3 times a day, especially if I plan on applying Fake Bake afterwards.</li>
            <li> I was not sure what the heck it is, but went with all the reviews and bought it.</li>
            <li> It is on the small side, but still worked for me.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t give 5 stars because this thing is too small.</li>
            <li> It can take a while to get the dirt off, lots of rubbing in circles for a few minutes!  </li>
            <li> This glove is small, even for me.  </li>
            <li> But if I&#x27;m too lazy in a given day I&#x27;ll use this glove instead.</li>
            <li> I usually use it on my legs before I shave</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m 5&#x27;5 @ 125 lbs, but I can&#x27;t relate to it being small at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is small.</li>
            <li> I usually use it once a week while having a bubble bath and every time I am shocked how much skin rolls off of me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure i they both help detoxify and</li>
            <li> you had a small hands may be o k to use.</li>
            <li> Just bought one for my 10 year old who also suffers from karentinitus piloris.</li>
            <li> I hate to give disappointing news but as reviewers and customers, we have to be honest to be helpful to one another.</li>
            <li> I had been wanting one of the really expensive exfoliating gloves for a long time but just couldn&#x27;t part with the money.</li>
            <li> It really helps get the nasty dry stuff off my legs and when I lotion afterward</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t scrub too hard or you will hurt yourself.</li>
            <li> When I used this mitten with that scrub, I thought it was the mitten doing all the hard work...until I ran out of the body scrub and realized the mitten wasn&#x27;t doing anything by itself.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t press too hard</li>
            <li> The roughness of the glove/its ability to exfoliate depends on how vigorously and how hard you apply it to your skin.</li>
            <li> I would suggest not scrubbing too hard until you see how your skin reacts.</li>
            <li> Some people have complained about the glove being a bit snug.</li>
            <li> mitten at least for me, does NOT work with all body washes.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t slip, but cold be too big for someone taller than say, 6 feet.</li>
            <li> There was no packaging or directions - and I feel like for over $30 it should at least come with directions.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if you should use it on your face / delicate skin.</li>
            <li> It has a thick elastic to hold your hand in.</li>
            <li> Once you get it on it is difficult to remove to scrub the other side.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 6&#x27; 1\\&quot; with above average size hands (4.75 inches at the base).</li>
            <li> The glove itself works well to exfoliate the skin but the mitten is very small</li>
            <li> but again im 5&#x27;2 and have very small hands</li>
            <li> I suffer from KP commonly known as the chicken skin which can be very dry and also have bumps.</li>
            <li> but the black soap is expensive.</li>
            <li> , I switched to regular soap and body washes and it&#x27;s not so bad.  </li>
            <li> Because if this awkward flaw I didn&#x27;t buy another one after my first one went bad.</li>
            <li> and I really go hard)!  </li>
            <li> so it is difficult to get on and off unless your hands are small.  </li>
            <li> Annoying and gross.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on an expensive mitt!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed because I feel like for the price I paid</li>
            <li> So when I didn&#x27;t see dead skin rolling off, I was so disappointed...</li>
            <li> You will see dirty shed of dead skin form and fall!!!  </li>
            <li> but it was difficult to do given the stiffness of the fabric.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was stolen in my checked luggage.  </li>
            <li> so sad to find out the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> BUT my poor hands can&#x27;t scrub with the sugar all the time!  </li>
            <li> It was a gamble because that seemed expensive for a bath tool to me.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for the quantity of time</li>
            <li> However, as long as they&#x27;re maintained, holy crap!  </li>
            <li> I did not see the rolls of dead skin fall off as I scrubbed and was very disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Best exfoliation glove i have ever used. its leaves my skin baby smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> This exfoliating glove is great! I&#x27;ve used mine for over a year &amp; it still works wonderfully. I use this glove with ultra moisturizing (hair) conditioner &amp; gently &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; my skin from neck down, then cool rinse. Talk about SOFT &amp; SMOOTH skin! No need to use much force with this glove - it&#x27;s like super-ultra-fine sandpaper. When done, rinse thoroughly, gently wring out excess water &amp; hang to dry. Generous size can fit even a man&#x27;s hand. I&#x27;ll never be without one of these gloves!</li>
            <li> This nice exfoliating glove arrived swiftly but as a person with large hands, it is not possible to use it correctly. I think that it is more suitable for ladies</li>
            <li> Great product--exfoliates well and washes in machine with ease.  It would have been better if the cuff around it were a darker or different color as it did have a tendency to mildew, but overall, I love it.  You also can&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
            <li> By far the best exfoliating glove I have ever used.  I will never go back to any other brand.</li>
            <li> Treated myself to a spa day and the technician used this on me.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how much it exfoliated.  I&#x27;ve been using it since and my skin is healthier, dewy and sooo summer ready!!</li>
            <li> If you like a really good scrub you will love this. Once a week or so I scrub with this and you can see the dirt and old skin just roll off. Sounds gross but I like seeing all that gunk off, lets me know it&#x27;s getting the job done! Only problem is the cuff is small. I have small hands and it is a tight fit getting it on and off.  Also just a little hint it helps to either have your skin just barely damp and the glove wet or the glove on the drier side and your skin really wet, one or the other. Just seems to exfoliate better that way.</li>
            <li> This glove has been perfect for the shower to get dead skin off of my arms and legs. Definitely will exfoliate you well, just have a nice body cream for after.</li>
            <li> I use this thing all the time! Just soak in hot tub or shower and rub against your skin...I know it may sound gross but the dead skin just sloths off of you. It is quite disgusting but leaves the skin smooth and exfoliated! I purchased another for my mother because I loved it so much and she loves hers too. I would definitely recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for almost two year.. I like it very much</li>
            <li> Love this little mitt! No pressure needed, and works great with black soap. I&#x27;ve used all over, and the resulting exfoliation makes my skin feel soft, smooth, and brand new!  Boyfriend loves it too, especially on his back (but who doesn&#x27;t like a good back scratch from time to time?)</li>
            <li> It is too harsh for me.</li>
            <li> Interesting and not quite what I was expecting.  If you want to scrub yourself w sandpaper this is probably it.  But it does exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I like the quality and it does the job as promised, however, once it gets wet after the first use, it shrinks and if you have large hands, it will not fit you!! Fortunately, I have small hands so with a little force I can get my hand in there so I have been able to use it.</li>
            <li> Love this glove. It removes dead skin cells and makes your skin feel so wonderful and smooth. I will always keep one of these.</li>
            <li> I love this glove! I&#x27;ve owned this for about a few months and it still works real good. I ordered it because I have razor bumps on my thighs from lack of exfoliation and using cheap razors lol. When I first used it, I saw dead skin rolling off from mainly my legs. I prefer not to use with soap or anything else. In about 2 and half weeks my thighs were so smooth and razor bump free! &#x3D;D I also bougrht a good expensive razor so that helped out as well.</li>
            <li> The product arrive really quickly. As far as the actual glove goes, it gives really nice exfoliation--jut a slight circular motion will do the trick. I&#x27;m Korean, so I&#x27;m very used to body scrubs. I was hoping for a thicker, more padded glove, like the ones used in the Korean baths, but this one is no less good at what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Perfect!!!! Leaves skin feeling really clean.</li>
            <li> Best exfoliating glove I have ever used. I had KP, so exfoliating is very important to keep my skin looking decent. This glove takes off skin like nothing else! Best used after you have been in the shower for a while, you will see the skin come off like crazy! Don&#x27;t scrub too hard or you will hurt yourself.</li>
            <li> This mitt is fairly inexpensive, but does just as well as the more expensive ones.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on an expensive mitt! Use this one!</li>
            <li> glove is good but i wish it was a little stronger. this glove really exfoliates your skin and leaves it very soft  i recommand it</li>
            <li> Compared to a hammam mit right which we have that&#x27;s straight out of Turkey, this thing feels like sandpaper....not happy with it.  Scared to use it on my face.</li>
            <li> This glove exfoliates the way it is supposed to, but it starts out small and gets smaller! I wear womens small size gloves, and I can&#x27;t get my entire hand into it after it is wet. It shrinks width-wise, and I can still use it if I put it on my fingers, and don&#x27;t try to jam my thumb into it.</li>
            <li> I use this mitt to assist in my exfoiliation regiment on my face. It definitely gets the grime and dirt from underneath the skin. I will be ordering another to use on my body.</li>
            <li> I really like this glove, I use it mostly on my legs, feet, and arms and it is outstandingly good at exfoliating.  I have used it with black soap gel as well as with bar soap and body wash and it works well with everything.  Definitely easier than holding a loofah, and it works better and does not get so gross so quickly.  I have used mine one or two times a week for about six months and it is still in great shape.</li>
            <li> I like using an exfoliating mitt so much better than the gloves or bottled cleansers, but tis mitt is extremely rough and harsh and can hurt if you don&#x27;t have a light touch.  It works well as an exfoliator for sure, but is a little too harsh for me.  And as others have stated, it will not fit large hands.  The cuff is small and does not have much stretch so it is difficult to get on and off unless your hands are small.  I also tried using some of the black soap others have referenced and it dried out my skin in a couple days and I had to toss it.  I continue to use the mitt, but with a light touch.</li>
            <li> I love this glove! It&#x27;s a bit abrasive, being that it feels like sand paper and all; but it does leave your body feeling silky smooth. Even better with the Kae Savon Noir black soap that it&#x27;s recommended to be purchased with. They coordinate very well with each other. However, if you can not fit the black soap in your budget, being that it&#x27;s on the pricey side, I am very confident in it working just as well with any body wash of your choice; in fact, I actually find it easier to use the glove with my usual dove soap. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a bit rough--but then again, I guess that&#x27;s what makes it an exfoliater. I have not seen the dead skin that others stated they saw as they rinsed away their bodies, but I haven&#x27;t seen it on me either; so I&#x27;m satisfied! Great job on this product. I just wish it came with washing instructions. My organic shea butter was the cherry on the top, after I showered with this glove. The softness just got better! Cons? It shrinks with each use.</li>
            <li> This is a great exfoliating glove.  Be sure and buy it with the black soap.  You can actually see the dead skin floating on the top of the water in the tub.  With a light touch this could be used on the face.  You will not regret getting it, and it should last forever.</li>
            <li> Nice! Like sandpaper a little.</li>
            <li> I have an authentic Hammam glove from Morocco and was looking for something comparable.  This glove is much \\&quot;fancier\\&quot; but the material is EXACTLY as the authentic one from Morocco.  The only drawback is that it shrinks.  It is a tight fit for my hand.  It would never fit over a man&#x27;s hand.  Other than that, the color is much nicer than the original authentic black and I would definately purchase it again. Highly recommend for a female.  It creates the softest feet and heels.  Remember that it takes a bit of getting used to if you have never used this type of product.  I recommend using it lightly on any other body area other than the feet at first.  Be gentle on the rest of your body at first.  You will notice such an incredible difference in how your skin feels after using it.  I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s eycalyptus soap with this glove.  A perfect combination.</li>
            <li> Wow. Why didn&#x27;t I learned about this years before!! With all the yucky dead skin scrubbed off now my entire body just feels smooth and clean. I have some KP in certain areas of my body (upper arms and upper thighs) and it does help. The bumps are even out. I use it together with Moroccan black soap with argan oil 2-3 x per week. Amazing product!</li>
            <li> Good for overall scrub. I bought it to use with moroccan black soap but sometimes I use it with regular soap and exfoliates really well. Kinda pricey though</li>
            <li> I needed a new shower scrubber, so I searched Amazon for something that was reasonably priced, had good reviews, and was eligible for prime, and this seemed to be my best bet.  Initially when I opened the package I was a little disappointed to see the thinness of the product (I paid almost $13 for it), but after testing it out in the shower I fell in love with it.  I naturally have pretty soft skin that doesn&#x27;t need much exfoliation (or so I thought), I just like to have that squeaky clean feeling that you get from scrubbing.  Boy was I surprised how much smoother my skin was, especially my feet and knees! I read some other reviews saying it was too small, and I could see how it might fit a little tight for some hands.  When it&#x27;s wet, it does shrink quite a bit, but you can stretch it right back out and I didn&#x27;t think it was constricting at all, but then again I have pretty small hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great buy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this if your looking for a level of exfoliation you can only find at the spa!  9 months ago I went to Morocco and fell in love with the level of exfoliation the gloves offered. I went to brick &amp; mortar stores looking for something that would give me a similar level of exfoliation, but everything was too gentle to really help me out.    I was debating this purchase for about 4 weeks, the price seemed steep for something I couldn&#x27;t touch or feel, but after other products failed decided to cut my losses, and boy was I glad! This glove gives the intense level of exfoliation I want, without being harsh like what you need for thick skin on the foot. I&#x27;m able to use this daily without problems all over and have seen marked improvement to my skin health.    The glove dries quickly when I hang it in the shower, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting moldy or funky. I&#x27;ve had the glove for 4 months now, using at least 1-2x a week, and it is still in great condition. I can&#x27;t even see signs of wear other than the string used to hang it with, so I will be using it for many months to come.</li>
            <li> Best glove hands down! I&#x27;ve used every loofah and wash cloth under the sun. Nothing beats this exfoliation! But stop raising the price already! Every year it goes up</li>
            <li> I love this exfoliating glove, my skin is now renewed and soft, my hands and arms no longer feel like sand paper.</li>
            <li> Best gome glove I&#x27;ve found on Amazon, though a couple of reviewers have taken issue:  (A) \\&quot;Too rough\\&quot;? (No). This is a Moroccan &#x27;gome&#x27; glove. (It&#x27;s an exfoliating glove). It&#x27;s supposed to be rough. Is any more rough than other gome gloves? (No).   (B) \\&quot;Too small\\&quot;? (Not really - if you have very large hands, maybe). I&#x27;m 6&#x27; 1\\&quot; with above average size hands (4.75 inches at the base). It&#x27;s a little snug, but not uncomfortably so - it&#x27;s supposed to fit like a mitten. The wrist also stretches if that&#x27;s a bottleneck for you, and as opposed to elastic that may break/fade over time, it is a fully cotton construction that will last. It won&#x27;t ever go loose (unless you pull on it excessively, and often), which is the real problem with cheap, elastic gloves.   How to avoid a rough experience (it&#x27;s easy):  (1) Apply soap to your body first, then to the glove, then use a light touch. The point is to go over your skin multiple times lightly, not once or twice forcefully.    (2) Try to use it with a glycerin, french milled, or other thick, luxurious soap. Like shaving one&#x27;s legs or face, this helps to buffer the friction that is inherent in exfoliation.   If you have super-sensitive skin, you probably shouldn&#x27;t be using any exfoliating glove, and this gome will likely cause you trouble.</li>
            <li> This glove is well made: high-quality material and sticking.  It does its job very well. My advice is to use it with black soap in a hot steamy shower.   HOW TO USE it: Apply black soap on wet skin  and lather an rinse, AND then use the wet glove (wet and twist from excessive water) my rubbing softly but firmly against skin. You will see dirty shed of dead skin form and fall!!!  After rinse and lather with your usual shower gel or soap and you will love the amazing squeak clean feeling and softness of your entire body skin!</li>
            <li> Friends  always  ask what I use on my skin,they still  don&#x27;t  believe  this,but let me tell  you this thing  will get away all the dead skin after soaking  your  body. ..Love this</li>
            <li> This is FANTASTIC!!!!  My 7 year old could not believe how soft my skin was after using it!  I would totaly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> The kae exfoliating glove is great: sheds dead skin and comfortably. This is a very good product and I bought it to end the cycle of buying and soon throwing out those mesh bath sponges (like this: amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B001CTQMIC/ref&#x3D;mp_s_a_2?qid&#x3D;1291410691&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2) that always wear out within a few months. So overall, a very good product, however the glove DOESN&#x27;T FIT the average man&#x27;s hand. So I don&#x27;t use the glove on my hand but rather as a bath rag. This issue can easily be remedied by having a lady friend(s) use the glove to bath you instead. This kae glove will have you SO FRESH and SO CLEAN (CLEAN).</li>
            <li> This is a great product...not sure why or how it works so well but it&#x27;s better than regular exfoliating gloves, also it seems to have been having a minimizing effect on my shaving habits.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week and I&#x27;m going to order another because this item goes in the list of things I&#x27;m paranoid about losing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**hey! I am a real consumer and therefore a real reviewer.  I am NOT a review-bot...check it out!</li>
            <li> I would not have believed the difference this glove can make until trying it myself...now I won&#x27;t shower without it.....I am in love with it.....I use it on my face and it makes my skin look amazing....my whole body is smooth, best product I have found in years...I won&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> I give five stars to this spong because it exfoliates very well. Just use any kind of soap with it, it will leave your skin very soft. I suffer from KP commonly known as the chicken skin which can be very dry and also have bumps. The first time I used this it left my skin baby soft and i noticed that the bumps behinds my legs started dissapearing over time. The texture is rough, so becareful if u have delicate skin. I would recomend this to anyone who wants to exfoilate, and who suffer from KP it will help your skin tremendously!</li>
            <li> this glove does an amazing job exfoliating your body! way better than any towel could. you actually see the dead skin roll off and onto the glove. it gets your skin very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Works well, just go easy the first few times you use it. I have very sensitive skin and eczema and have had no problems with this at all. My skin feels &amp;#34;polished&amp;#34; afterward! Smooth and silky. I use it with Zakia&#x27;s Morrocan Black Soap with Argan Oil, an oil-based cleanser.</li>
            <li> if you have ingrown hair on your legs and arm this for you&lt;br /&gt;I use the glove with the black moroccan soap my skin looks nicer and softer</li>
            <li> This glove seems to be wound tighter then any other exfoliating glove I have tried.  I think this is a good thing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am use to dry exfoliation, but this says to use it during your bath or shower (wet).  Well, it certainly works well following their directions.  This really helped remove the dead layer of skin and when I was done, my skin was almost baby soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is am very happy with this glove and I am buying another one for a friend.</li>
            <li> love this exfoliating glove....works well and I&#x27;ve seen a big difference in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> Why didn&#x27;t I find this product before? I went to a Korean spa two months ago and got a body scrub.  It was an amazing feeling, my skin had never felt that smooth.  So I wanted to get an exfoliating glove similar to that to try at home even though I know it won&#x27;t be the same.  After reading several reviews I bought this glove, WOW.. this is amazing.  I only used it 3 times so far and I get out of the shower so soft, even my husband noticed how smooth my skin is (that&#x27;s major)..</li>
            <li> I bought one for several on my Christmas list ABSOLUTELY a must for any woman wanting to exfoliate and skin looking radiant</li>
            <li> I got it with Moroccan soap. First I thought it&#x27;s too soft but water made the difference. It&#x27;s a very good one!</li>
            <li> This thing works SO WELL. Exactly what I was looking for. Although, I was recently advised by my dermotologist that these things collect bacteria while you don&#x27;t use them and then when you use them you are spreading the bacteria. However, every doctor will tell you something else. Just wash it every so often.</li>
            <li> I love the way this glove exfoliates my skin, but unfortunately it fell apart soo quickly-- started coming apart at the seams after the third use! After each use I rinsed out the glove and hung it up to dry as directed by the instructions, however, the stitching on the seam simply came undone.  I did sew it back up but it was difficult to do given the stiffness of the fabric.</li>
            <li> This is a great exfoliating glove. It&#x27;s an authentic hammam glove and I was excited to use it for the first time. I read in other reviews that there were issues with the size of the glove, yet I still went ahead and ordered it because I have very small hands. On my first use, I noticed the glove shrinks when wet, and while I got a really great exfoliating experience with this glove, the size did made it uncomfortable to use. Unless I kept my hand in a fist, the wrist kept riding up my hand. I spent more time trying to keep the glove on than actually enjoying it&#x27;s use. Aesthetically, the glove is a beautiful terracotta color, it&#x27;s made from sturdy fabric, and the wrist is a very luxurious terrycloth. I really wanted to love this item and initially did not think I would have problems with the size as my hand is small, but this one will just have to go back. If you don&#x27;t have problems working with the size of the glove and find it to be a minor issue, you&#x27;ll really enjoy it&#x27;s quality. However, if you seek an item that is also functional I would look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with the black soap by Kae and they do not go very good together.  It feels like you are scraping your skin off with the black soap.  I didn&#x27;t give up though, I switched to regular soap and body washes and it&#x27;s not so bad.  This will certainly exfoliate you!</li>
            <li> This glove works really well, just like everyone says. I&#x27;ve had mine for about 3 months now and I need to replace it because the seams are coming a bit undone. This doesn&#x27;t seem like a negative for me though, just normal wear and tear.</li>
            <li> Use this mitt gently as it is a bit scatchy.  Does what it supposed to.  I recommend this if you self tan.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit too rough but it definitely works like hammam gloves and it help the skin exfoliate; and I could see the result by my own eyes! Pretty cool!</li>
            <li> Using this glove improved  my skin  clearness and tone( i have keratosis pilaris). my skin became smoother and the scars began to fade.</li>
            <li> This mitt does a great job. It exfoliates really well. I read other reviews that it&#x27;s too small and slips off, but I have had no problems with it. It is pretty big, covers my whole hand and does not slip off. It makes my skin so soft. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> I wanted to prep my skin for my custom spray tan for a special occasion, and I wanted to get all the little flaky patches and bumps from a lot of outdoor exposure gone. I was originally going to get a Baiden mitt ($45+?!?)but this seemed like a more economical start.&lt;br /&gt;Purchasing some raw shea butter to follow the scrubbings with, I now have soft velvety skin all over and it even cleared up some face blemishes (if you even try this, use very LIGHT circular motions on the face, don&#x27;t go crazy with the delicate areas).&lt;br /&gt;Why this over a loofah or other scrubbers for less $? Its made from a fiber that is very sturdy and effective so this mitt has a lot of life in it. I will steam-wash it or soak it in very hot water every so often to keep it clean, and I expect it will continue to keep me clean, clear and smooth!</li>
            <li> If your big on the Korean-bath house culture, you&#x27;ve probably heard that you can see black dead skin roll off you with scrubs... This is only true if you soak your body completely in hot water for 30minutes so don&#x27;t expect it to work with a hot shower. That being said This product is great for everyday scrubbing. The glove looks HUGE but then i guess the water makes it shrink? (technologies these days!0.o) I wear Medium sized gloves and these fit perfectly so if you have large hands this product may not be right for you.</li>
            <li> With my sensitive skin, I can&#x27;t afford to exfoliate my face with anything without breaking out but this exfoliating glove was somehow designed for skin like mine. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks with moroccan black soap with argan and my face feels smoother and softer plus most of the blackheads are gone. Most importantly, no breakouts!!&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Skin feels great afterwards, but feels like sandpaper when using in the shower. I use it 2-3 times a day, especially if I plan on applying Fake Bake afterwards.</li>
            <li> This is amazing. I bought it solely based on other reviews &amp; I recommend it as well! Boil it every few months to freshen it &amp; kill any mildew/bacteria. It will last you a LONG time, too!</li>
            <li> I used exfoliating gloves all my life and I love to go hammam.i read some of the reviews and I want to let you know this glove is not a washing cloth. For best result stay in the warm to hot water before use it but don&#x27;t wash your hair or body with any shampoo or soap. Otherwise these cleanser makes your skin soft and exfoliater will not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Stay in the hot water a few minutes with no cleanser&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.Close water and don&#x27;t get wash until you finish all your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Wash and get all water out from gloves prior to use. No soap or shampoo! The texture has to be rough. Your skin will be red but only 10-15 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.After you finish it just get rinse and wash your hair, body with whatever cleanser you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. If you use it everytime you won&#x27;t have a selulit( my mom is 60 years old and never ever have a selulit!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Ive never felt smoother. I&#x27;m a sucker for exfoliation and this is great.  Perfect for when I&#x27;m using self tanner and need all the dead skin gone.</li>
            <li> Just a little TOO rough on my skin while in the shower. Stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;Some people may like it however.</li>
            <li> I had been wanting one of the really expensive exfoliating gloves for a long time but just couldn&#x27;t part with the money. I ran across this and the terrific reviews and thought I&#x27;d take a chance. Let me tell you. The amount of dead skin this pulls off is both fascinating and disgusting. I really have a morbid curiosity every time I use it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say it actually works better if you are taking a bath, but the shower is fine as well. This is actually the second one I&#x27;ve purchased as I lost the first in a move across country. It really helps get the nasty dry stuff off my legs and when I lotion afterward I have the smoothest skin! Don&#x27;t hesitate, get it.</li>
            <li> I have big hands and I can stretch the glove over my hand. It really scrubs you well. I am not into exfoliating as much as I want to feel clean. It really buffs the skin well. It is like washing with a bar of Lava soap. I&#x27;d buy ten more.</li>
            <li> Nothing special.  I have felt similar from the rough cloths from WalMart &amp; this one was a bit much to dry.  I didn&#x27;t like putting my hand in that cold wet thing when I first started using it.  It had no dramatic effect on my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought the beldi soap and argan oil from Zakia.  They are wonderful.  I chose this glove to go with them.  What came off of my skin is rather gross.  My skin was old and gray looking.  I am still old but my whole body is clean, fresh and pink.  I no longer have itching due to  old skin hanging on over newer skin.  It is amazing.  An incredible glove!</li>
            <li> This works SO well. I have horrifically dry skin and this product improves the feel of my skin after using. I use my Dove body wash or baroody olive soap (depending what I&#x27;m in the mood for), I put some on my skin and some on the glove, and it exfoliates so nicely. Some people have complained about the glove being a bit snug. I have small hands so this is not a problem, but I&#x27;m pretty sure you could still use this product without wearing it as a glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with it. I exfoliate a couple of times a week and my skin feels amazing after.</li>
            <li> This mitt is small, I have normal hands for a woman and this just barely covers them.  That aside, the texture is perfect for exfoliating.  This is equal to or better than others on Amazon but so much cheaper!</li>
            <li> This glove does a great job of getting rid of dead skin cells without tearing you to shreds.  The material is very fine with a sandpaper like feel to it but not to abrasive as long as you don&#x27;t apply a ton of pressure to the area you are exfoliating.  I would highly recommend this glove.  My only complaint would be that the glove is not really made for a man&#x27;s hand so it is a little tight but not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! My skin has never felt smoother</li>
            <li> Best exfoliating glove!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking for more that can be delivered to Canada. Leaves skin soft and with out ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased two other mitts on Amazon but this one is the best. It&#x27;s a great size and shape and the texture really grabs dead skin, yet rinses easily. No color running or anything.</li>
            <li> still enjoying it, a little rough on the skin, but I think that&#x27;s the point! I use it pre-spray tan and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> I was not sure what the heck it is, but went with all the reviews and bought it. And I have to say - I love it. It&#x27;s not what you think it is. It&#x27;s silky and soft if you touch it. Buy if you make it wet, it becomes something else. Something like a mild sand paper. It exfoliates better that I thought. But you have to soak in hot water  for a little bit before using it. A lot of old skin comes off making you feel like a newborn. I love it.</li>
            <li> This is a good exfoliating glove, but nothing hugely remarkable.  It is on the small side, but still worked for me.  Honestly, I did not notice a change in my skin, but that may be because I do a lot of other things too keep it smooth like daily saunas, good moisturizing, and occasional dry brushing.  If you&#x27;re not already an exfoliator, you&#x27;ll probably see great results with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE** After using this daily for over a week, I started seeing really good results.  My skin is SUPER soft now -- like a baby&#x27;s bottom.  It is on par with the results I got when I used to do a very thorough dry brushing each and every day.  This is more convenient however, because you can do in the shower and you get good results with less time.  I decided to keep my rating a four stars because the glove is a bit small and the little loop has come undone after about two weeks use (hanging on a hook to dry after using).  That said, I can highly recommend this glove now.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and quite effective. Best with salt scrubs but also works on its own. After months of use, no color bleeding at all which was a nice surprise. Highly recommended. Hang by hook to dry after each use to keep shape.</li>
            <li> Easy, quick and effective.  Only one pass per area necessary.  Great for men&#x27;s thick back skin.  Does not work for bottom of feet, and makes face sensitive to applying moisturizer</li>
            <li> Works great!!! Leaves your skin baby soft as ever. I highly recommend this glove if you like to fake tan. It takes off all your dead skin cells and leaves your skin really for tanning application. I&#x27;ve had it for 3 months and it still works great and hasn&#x27;t gotten ripped or anything.</li>
            <li> I put a nice all natural lotion all over my skin, let it soak in really well and soften up all the dead cells, then use this in the shower. Even my dry nasty skin comes out looking and feeling much softer, fresh and new!</li>
            <li> This glove takes off amazing amounts of dead skin (I love scrubbing and I really go hard)!  Sometimes, I almost do not feel like soaping after I scrub, because my skin feels super clean after using just it.  I try not to use it every day, as it appears to dry my skin, but the skin also does feel really soft from it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s alright. i use it once in a while because i have sensitive skin and it is pretty rough. i didn&#x27;t find it worked as well as some reviews say (i&#x27;ve tried shower and bath techniques).</li>
            <li> This product is great. I like how it doesnt hurt your skin when you use it and it doesnt fall off your hand at all. The product does require you to put some effort in its purpose by SOAKING YOUR SKIN AND OPENING YOUR PORES PRIOR TO USE. As long as you do this, your gonna get great results.</li>
            <li> I love the way this glove makes my skin feel. My skin is soft and smooth and nice and clean</li>
            <li> I went to a Hammam in Morocco and received a glove similar to this one in my spa kit.  Unfortunately, it was stolen in my checked luggage.  A friend of mine found this one for me, so I took a chance and ordered it along with the black soap.  Love it!! It works just as well as the one that was stolen from my luggage.  My skin is soft and smooth.  It helps take off a lot of dead skin.</li>
            <li> Works very well, so well that my mom got one too. It&#x27;s nice to have smooth skin again. Fits my hand perfectly.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this glove while it lasted (I used it in conjunction with the black soap). But it was only a matter of about two weeks before it started tearing at the seams. Very disappointed in the quality, but the exfoliation was nice.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any of the less expensive versions I saw out there, but this one does really work great. I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times &amp; cannot vouch for durability - but performance is excellent. I couldn&#x27;t give 5 stars because this thing is too small. I have pretty large hands for a woman and it is a really tight squeeze to get this thing on and off my hand. Especially a real pain to do it, when I&#x27;m wet and it is wet during bathing. For a man with average or large hands - the size of this thing could be a real problem. The manufacturer should either make this product bigger automatically - or else offer size options. I do still love it!</li>
            <li> Works great! This mitten is made very well! I can see it lasting a long time. I&#x27;ve used it once so far and it was like using sand paper on my body! I&#x27;m not used to something quite so rough but I think I&#x27;ll get used to it and I think I need the texture it has to exfoliate as good as I like to! Especially when using a self tanner. I used it on areas of my back that I haven&#x27;t been able to get to otherwise and it did an amazing job! Highly recommend if your a serious exfoliate-r!</li>
            <li> Works like everyone has reviewed this product. I feel SUPER clean after.</li>
            <li> This does work well if you soak for a while in the tub.  It can take a while to get the dirt off, lots of rubbing in circles for a few minutes!  Also, it can smell a little mildew-y if you leave it in the shower.</li>
            <li> amazing. and amazed at how much skin really comes off. smooth baby skin afterwards.</li>
            <li> A little less abrasive than what I experienced in Morocco but does a fair enough job.</li>
            <li> This glove appears soft at first but it exfoliates wonderfully. I used it along with my Moroccan Black Soap and can I say baby soft, smooth skin.</li>
            <li> This glove is so much better than loofahs! It has a nice, scratchy feel on your skin and is durable. Just don&#x27;t put it in the washing machine. I had to buy a new one while waiting for my mother-in-law to sew the one that I washed. Oops!</li>
            <li> This glove is small, even for me.  My hand is 6 inches long and my fingers have to curl a bit to use this glove and it does not stay properly on my hand when I am scrubbing my body, the glove rotates on its own and is very annoying to readjust.</li>
            <li> I like it although it is pricey..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i was searching for a glove for the Moroccan Hammam liquid soap and it is really good one to have.</li>
            <li> I really like the mild exfoliation this offers. It could probably be used every day without being damaging to skin. I only am taking away one star because it is difficult for my big hands to use properly. Because if this awkward flaw I didn&#x27;t buy another one after my first one went bad. But I can see why this might be a great option for people.</li>
            <li> Works great. Best exfoliator I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> I normally save reviews until I&#x27;ve used a product for awhile, but after the very first use, I want to stand on the rooftop and praise this mitt!&lt;br /&gt;I try not to take lengthy showers. living the the desert SW cured me of that (water misuse is seriously frowned on), so after  showering, before getting out, I used the mitt  and did a fast rinse-off. Despite the short shower, dead skin came off!  I lightly used it on my face- and I stress LIGHTLY- this mitt is rather rough.  My skin and especially my nose is smoooth!!!!  Wow, I feel like I have new skin!&lt;br /&gt;Now if Kae made a long back scrubbing cloth, I&#x27;d be in heaven.&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely is a good product - the smooth, clean feeling is wonderful!</li>
            <li> I love this glove so much.  I purchased the black soap and the mud clay as well also by Kae.  I use the glove with the black soap and it leaves my skin soft,smooth and clean.  I have very dry skin with eczema, and sensitive skin(bruise easily) and it doesnt irritate my skin at all.  I bought my father the hammam glove he has eczema as well and he loved it.  After the shower or bath I used Eden Allure argan oil which is expensive but worth it.  The glove is a must have and the best glove i ever used</li>
            <li> Wow, never knew an exfoliating glove could get as much dirt or dead skin out as this one. Love it.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the glove.  It really exfoliates leaving your skin soft.  As an added bonus, it helps eliminate ingrown hairs!  If you are looking for a deep down exfoliating glove, this is it.  This product is not for the sensitive kind as it is on the \\&quot;rough side\\&quot;.  But for normal skin, it is great!  I also purchased the black soap. It smells very good and I believe helps in conditioning and smoothing your skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how people think this is too rough. I have sensitive skin, and have to rub superhard to get exfoliated at all.</li>
            <li> You really do see your dead skin roll right off. I alternate between this and a washcloth. It was really helped my eczema.</li>
            <li> exactly what i was looking for!!!! I think this is the one that they use in Korean spas. The best. totally worth the price</li>
            <li> Few products are perfect but this thing is amazing in how it exfoliates my skin. I have a loofah I use for regular everyday showers and once or twice a week I&#x27;ll use this to exfoliate. I can tell once I rinse the difference between both products, and it makes me wonder about how my skin must have been all the time before I had this. I follow up with some body lotion and it feels great to know how clean I am. And it&#x27;s true, once you rinse off and feel your skin, it feels super taut and soft</li>
            <li> It works well and seems durable. However, I do wish I could more easily fit my whole hand inside the thing. I can fit 4 fingers in easily, but that means not using the end of the mitt.</li>
            <li> This is a good Moroccan bath mitt. Most of the time I use a rinse off scrub. But if I&#x27;m too lazy in a given day I&#x27;ll use this glove instead. It does as good of a job as my body salt scrub.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.&lt;br /&gt;Works heavenly.&lt;br /&gt;Skin feels so soft and is able to absorb lotion much easier and quicker.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the best. A little abrasive, so beware</li>
            <li> The glove itself works well to exfoliate the skin but the mitten is very small and I cannot fit my hand into it.</li>
            <li> I have a spray tan machine and you have to exfoliate it off before you apply a new one. This works so much better than those exfoliating gloves you can buy in the store.</li>
            <li> Soooooo worth it. Amazing for the skin I&#x27;ve never been so soft!!! Deft buying again. No cons really only pros. People say it&#x27;s a small mitt it does shrink when it gets wet but it&#x27;s not like a scuba tight fit to your hand</li>
            <li> I love this mitt. When I first received it and tried it on it was too big but again im 5&#x27;2 and have very small hands but when it got wet it fit perfectly. I can&#x27;t see how a guy with big hands can use this because it shrinks my husband has a hard time getting his hand into it. The best way to describe this mitt is to say that it feels like im sanding my skin but to me it doesnt hurt it actually feels like its getting all the dirt and dead skin off. I cant say that I have ever seen the dead skin come off but after I use it I feel super clean and my skin feels very soft. Back where I am from they would use hammam gloves in the bath houses to remove dead skin and so I am totally accustomed to using rough mitts on my skin but for someone who may have sensitive skin this mitt may be too much. Also I do use it on my face once in a blue moon it gets the black heads off my nose. I usually use it on my legs before I shave and although I cant say that its helped with shaving less often it makes your legs smoother and shinny though. Oh yea and I did buy it with the Savon Noir black soap these two go together and work wonderfully but the black soap is expensive. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> with a little water and some seriously vigorous one way scrubbing, dead skin collects and rolls off leaving sking baby smooth.  I love it. (Do this kind of serious scrubbing once every 2-3 weeks - regular washing is okay on a daily basis)</li>
            <li> This thing really exfoliates! I can&#x27;t imagine using it on my face like other people talk about but it really works on my body</li>
            <li> I love the scrubber!  I purchased this with the Kae Savon Noir - Black Soap and I have never had softer clearer skin.  I also bought my mother the scrubber and black soap for her birthday and she loves it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For many years I have been search for a body scrubber that was as aggressive as one that was used on me in a bathhouse when I visited Tunisia.  This is the closest I have come so far.  It removes dead skin and leave baby soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glove is a little small as other reviewers have mentioned but I think it is to the scrubber&#x27;s advantage.  I have very wide women&#x27;s hands and find the glove to fit well.  I think if the mit were bigger, it would move around while I am scrubbing and not be as effective.</li>
            <li> The product is just ok. The product came on time and it looked just like what I saw advertised. It did leave my skin smooth. However, I bought it because I used other products and with them the rolls of dead skin fall off. I did not see the rolls of dead skin fall off as I scrubbed and was very disappointed. Also, I felt that even after using it 3-4 times, the product is still rough on my skin. I took everyone&#x27;s advice and used it accordingly but still the result are not what I wanted from this product.</li>
            <li> I like this. But would really like to have a thumb. Once you get it on it is difficult to remove to scrub the other side. Would be nice if it had different sizes too but overall, it does the trick and feels great.</li>
            <li> This is a great exfoliating glove for winter skin!  I have been using it almost every day for a month or so and have noticed a great improvement in the clarity and smoothness of my skin.  It also helps a lot with the winter dryness and itchiness!  I looked at a couple YouTube videos for how to use a Hammam Glove before I ordered and tried this one.  There are other products out there that are similar, but are much more costly, so I figured I would give this one a try, and I am glad I did because it appears to do the same thing as the pricier gloves!  I don&#x27;t have any trouble getting the glove on, as other reviewers have stated they cannot fit their hand in.  I could see how a person with very large hands would have trouble, but I wear a woman&#x27;s large size glove and have no problem.  Overall, great product, watch the videos on Hammam Gloves, and give it a try!</li>
            <li> This was great! But gets mouldy far too quickly had to throw it away !!</li>
            <li> The only exfoliating glove that really exfoliates. Other &amp;#34;glove-like&amp;#34; ones out there do not exfoliate at all, they only irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Great for deep exfoliation and just feels good like a good back scratch.  I use it with Moroccan Black Soap.</li>
            <li> This thing does the job...TOO well if you&#x27;re not careful.  I about removed my face entirely applying the amount of pressure I use with my other loofa glove thingy (regular grocery store junk).  This thing will make you feel like a newborn baby.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I had a hammam spa experience in Chicago a couple years ago and this is the same type of glove used there.  It REALLY makes your skin feel super soft, but I will say that the glove is just a smidge small (but I have big hands).  I just use regular body wash from Target with this--no special hammam clay scrub, etc.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> I will be honest, I&#x27;ve exfoliated in the shower on a near daily basis for over a decade. So when I didn&#x27;t see dead skin rolling off, I was so disappointed... I felt this product was no different than my other exfoliation scrubs. After soaking over 20 minutes in steamy water, I had to keep reminding myself, \\&quot;Well you do deep exfoliation throughout the week so perhaps there isn&#x27;t much to come off in comparison to other reviewers who don&#x27;t exfoliate daily.\\&quot; I was about to give my sad synopsis of a review to the other daily exfoliators out there when suddenly I felt my skin after drying off. BABY SOFT TO THE MAX WITHOUT LOTION!!! Just bare skin people! A staple! An absolute staple! Lol, I don&#x27;t have to see dirt falling off to tell this mitten does what it is suppose to do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, now about the size. I was concerned after reading others&#x27; reviews about the size being too small, but it was just right for me. Before wetting it, it was really loose. After wetting it, it did shrink but my hand was still roomy inside... I feel I have average lady hands, I&#x27;m 5&#x27;5 @ 125 lbs, but I can&#x27;t relate to it being small at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you exfoliate on a regular basis, with items such as the extra strength Buff Puff, you might not find this mitten miraculous, but it&#x27;s texture is different than most exfoliating puffs and gloves; its tightly woven, giving a slightly different type of exfoliation than what we exfoliation junkies are used too. It&#x27;s more like a polishing that over time could get to deeper parts of the skin over time, layer by layer. Exfoliating products often leave the skin flaky because its not evenly exfoliating the layers of our skin. I like this mitten&#x27;s layer by layer results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for Keratosis Piliaris battlers, I&#x27;m battling it too, especially on my legs. After one use, the KP on my legs has smoothed to a degree, its has rough patches still but its only been one use! For individuals with the KP that is only bumpy, you may really benefit with continued use. I will give the mitten a chance to work over time. The KP I&#x27;m battling is not only bumpy, but you can see the dark hair follicles in the KP, my hair is black, so even on bronze skin, its apparent simply from the color of my hair follicles alone. Over time, it may get all of these closed follicles and ingrown hairs stuck in the KP. I will keep you updated if and when that day happens. I became an exfoliation junkie to help battle KP, hopefully this is my last war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Exfoliation!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW AMENDMENT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for over a month and I realized something which if I had known it before, I would not have given this mitten 5 stars... so sad to find out the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mitten at least for me, does NOT work with all body washes. The effectiveness of the mitten on my skin, totally changes based on the body wash I use it with. This tells me that it may not be the product doing amazing work, but the body washes used with the product. I began using a new body wash scrub product shortly before introducing this mitten into my regimen. When I used this mitten with that scrub, I thought it was the mitten doing all the hard work...until I ran out of the body scrub and realized the mitten wasn&#x27;t doing anything by itself. I definitely prefer the mitten to washing with an ordinary towel, but I will never use it without a body scrub. For anyone interested, I used Softsoap&#x27;s Body Butter Coconut Scrub with this mitten. I&#x27;m not too disappointed because I did find out what body wash is an amazing exfoliator, but since I bought this mitten as an exfoliator, I would call this a fail. I hate to give disappointing news but as reviewers and customers, we have to be honest to be helpful to one another.</li>
            <li> This is the best, have always used Exfoliating Glove so my skin is very smooth &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> There is no salt scrub, sugar scrub, brush, mitt, pouf, loofah, or any other abrasive thing that could hold a candle to the sheer sandpapery goodness of this mitt. My fianc&amp;eacute; has big hands and can&#x27;t fit them in this little wunderkind. I don&#x27;t have that problem, but I know some people will. He still uses it, he just holds it like a washcloth. This mitt is like a chemical peel for your whole body. Kiss that rough skin goodbye.</li>
            <li> As other review said... it is small. Not confortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;I am a male 6&#x27;1, 165 lbs, regular size hands.</li>
            <li> This mitt really did the trick fo me.  I have Keratosis Piliaris and it got rid the bumps on my arms in one use.  I also took someones advice and used Soft Soap Body Butter Coconut Scrub with it.  Very nice and soft skin right out of the shower.  The price was $11.99 when I purchased it so I feel I got a good deal.  I would not pay much more for it.  I have used mitts from the Korean spa before but they are not at intense as this one.  This is much better but you can&#x27;t use it on really sensetive skin.  Hope that is helpful.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this glove.  I use it daily.  No complaints</li>
            <li> I use this before I get spray tanned. Works like a charm for exfoliation. I use it with my regular Oil of Olay body wash.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that I&#x27;ve never felt so clean and smooth before with any other type of sponge. This is the first time that I&#x27;ve been able to exfoliate my whole body and even my face on the other side of the sponge. It doesn&#x27;t slip, but cold be too big for someone taller than say, 6 feet. Works great and I feel smooth after bathing.</li>
            <li> Works great but the wrist band gets moldy smelling even when I wring it out and hang it up in the shower.  Annoying and gross.</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying one of these.  My husband stole my old one so that&#x27;s the only reason I&#x27;m getting another because these things last years. Best exfoliating product I&#x27;ve ever used.  I never realized I had so much dead skin until I used this.  It&#x27;s kind of disgusting to see all the cells slough off but holy crap is my skin soft,  smooth,  and glowing afterwards! Great shave prep and helps prevent ingrown hairs. I will use this mitt forever.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, it is like a micro sand paper or something and works better than anything I have seen.  Appears to be durable and it dries very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was cheap, the delivery was almost instant - I was surprised it got here so soon,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would buy it again, no in fact I am buying it again because my wife is snatching mine and using it in her shower and forgets to bring it back.</li>
            <li> This really does work!  Exfoliates my skin very well!</li>
            <li> I truly can&#x27;t believe people use this on their body, and even more so their face! Honestly, a fine sandpaper would be more gentle than this thing! It is crazy rough and can easily leave scratch marks or remove healthy layers of skin with even the lightest amount of pressure. If I were to use this regularly I&#x27;d end up with super irritated and inflamed skin - I think most people would have the same reaction unless they&#x27;re using it as a pumice on their heels or something (and honestly, my pumice stone is much more gentle than this mitten.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you&#x27;re looking to do some serious skin removal - like on your heels the way you&#x27;d use a pumice stone - this thing is waaay too rough! Watchout!!</li>
            <li> I have used the baiden mitt in the past and it was okay, I personally didn&#x27;t find it life changing but it worked well for pre-sunless tanning, more even exfoliation compared to a scrub. I bought this glove when that one wore out because it was cheaper and wow!  this glove is awesome. So much less rubbing for good exfoliation, and I see way more dead skin coming off with this. I have always used a glycolic acid lotion with both, so I have a good amount of dead skin to rub off. With the baiden my arms would get too tired to finish my whole body, it seems like less work with this glove. I do used it on my face and it is NOT too rough. It keeps the black head on my nose away and my makeup goes on better.&lt;br /&gt;I use a gradual sunless tanner everyday and this in the shower to rub off any dark spots, it allows me to tan everyday and not worry about build up. Also I use it before shaving (everywhere, really everywhere)  keeps me smoother and I notice less irritation on sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;I AM SO GLAD I DECIDED TO GO CHEAP!</li>
            <li> I love how it feels after scrubbing my arms.  They feel smooth and clean.  I use 1-2 times a week with a scrub but find it is too rough to use on my face.</li>
            <li> Love how this exfoliating hamam gove work I just purchased a second one</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I purchased a Magic Exfoliating Glove for some ridiculous price - around $40!  It worked beautifully, but they do wear out after awhile and don&#x27;t seem to be available here anymore anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luck was with me though when I clicked through to this glove!!  It&#x27;s BETTER than the Magic Glove, sturdier, and stays on my hand better (no shifting around) than the Magic Glove.  I love seeing the exfoliation happening.  I mean, it&#x27;s kind of ick-inducing, but the results are so worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m buying another one so I don&#x27;t have to switch hands during use.  :-)</li>
            <li> Really enjoy this glove,  i don&#x27;t use it everyday but once a week with the black sea salt soap that i got as a gift.  It fits my hands and i have large hands. I usually have sensitive skin and turn red easily even during a facial,  but the glove doesn&#x27;t make me red.  Maybe for a second but by the time  i am out of the shower my skin is no longer irritated.  Really like this glove. There have been times when i make my hands into fists but that was to protect the nails.</li>
            <li> Exfoliates very well.  I use this once a week to exfoliate and my skin is so soft afterwards.  Gets off a lot of dead skin.</li>
            <li> great quality. excellent exfoliation without ever feeling too scratchy. i had never seen material like this; and now i will use nothing else for exfoliation.</li>
            <li> Its rough, it exfoliates like you want it to. It has a thick elastic to hold your hand in. Will order again.</li>
            <li> far too abrasive. I have been to a number of Hammams and none ever used something as rough and sandpaper like as this. I have thrown it away</li>
            <li> OMGâ€¦this thing is amazing. Superior to anything I have tried. Dead skin comes off in rolls, leaves skin feeling a little raw but soft.</li>
            <li> I am from morocco where we use this kind of exfoliating gloves. This product was above my expectations. I use African black soap first to wash the body and  get rid of oiliness, rise it of then use the glove to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> Received today and used tonight. I lov it! Mitt has nice texture but be gentle.&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit too aggressive in some places, so i&#x27;ll have to wait two or three days before using again.&lt;br /&gt;But I love the feel on this mitt. I&#x27;m thinking about purchasing a second one so I can use on both hands at same time.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to have a long cloth with this same texture. Does Kae make one?&lt;br /&gt;This maybe a tight fit for the average size male hand.</li>
            <li> I took a long bath, and used another exfoliating product. I decided to quickly use this right before I got out of the tub just to see if it would work the way other reviewers said it would. It worked so well that I was forced to drain the tub, and shower off because of how much crude came off of my &#x27;clean&#x27; skin. I love it.</li>
            <li> I self tan frequently and purchased this glove in hopes of dramatically reducing the time it takes to remove self tanner build up. Before this glove, it would typically take an hour+ for me to get rid of old self tanner and start over fresh, and by the end my skin would be raw and irritated. Not anymore! This glove is AMAZING! It literally took me 10 minutes to remove all of the built up self tanner, leaving me with flawless, glowing skin. I highly recommend this glove to anyone looking for spa quality exfoliation, and especially to those who are self tan junkies like myself. It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had recently been to a Korean spa where I had my whole body scrubbed down and loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this Kae Exfoliating glove and am so impressed with the results. I spray tan frequently and use this to prep my skin for a spray tan as well as exfoliate off old spray tans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to look up the youtube video on how to properly use this product- makes a big difference!</li>
            <li> They should seriously call this the Amazing Exfoliating Glove, because it is that awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have Keratosis pilaris, and I have never used ANY product that can do what this does to help smooth out my skin. I wish every person with KP knew about this. My skin is gross looking with clogged hair follicles before, then nice and smooth after I use this in the shower. It consistently gives me amazing results. I can just see the dead skin that it&#x27;s removing on the glove without any special soap used or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it not only on my KP, but also pretty much everywhere else as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend any health/beauty product I&#x27;ve bought more than this one. It&#x27;s lovely!</li>
            <li> after reading some of the reviews i thought i&#x27;d buy it for my self...i couldnt be happier and my skin couldnt be smoother!</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I feel like I just discovered sugar scrub and I wanted to use that all the time BUT my poor hands can&#x27;t scrub with the sugar all the time!  So, I did some review reading and decided this was what I wanted.  First off, I was underwhelmed when it arrived - it was just the glove in a clear bag.  There was no packaging or directions - and I feel like for over $30 it should at least come with directions.  Because I had read all the reviews I was a little afraid to scrub - and was surprised after my shower that my stomach was a little red but other parts I thought I had scrubbed kind of hard but weren&#x27;t exfoliated well.  It is a rough scrubber - but I feel for what I was looking for that was to be expected.  So, I will continue to use this - I&#x27;m a little disappointed because I feel like for the price I paid I should be much more excited about it.  I will continue to keep my eyes open for a more enjoyable/effective exfoliating product and I predict that eventually this will go to the graveyard under my sink!</li>
            <li> Never had an exfoliating like this!  With daily  use Keratosis Pilaris (KP) would not be a problem to control.  After one use my skin felt softer and smoother than before.  Haven&#x27;t purchased the black soap just yet,  but will try that and come back to give an update on how they worked for me.  I haven&#x27;t tried the mit by itself yet so I can&#x27;t give you a review on how it worked alone.  I use it with Mario Badescu AHA Body Soap and Perlier Agrumarium Energizing Bath &amp; Shower (100% Orange Extract).  Some don&#x27;t know that KP is Red bumps on some and depending on the amount of melanin in the skin, can be little black bumps on others. Either one, they are ugly and not so easy to control.</li>
            <li> I have three different types of exfoliating turkish mittens, this Kae, the Baiden, and Active Derma.  for whatever reason, it seems like this Kae gets the skin rolling off my legs better and easier than the Baiden.  It seems like the Kae requires less finesse - if your legs are generally somewhat wet and you squeezed out the Kae glove, you can start rubbing off the skin, in contrast for the Baiden you have to futz with getting your skin to exactly the right amount of just barely damp and the mitten squeezed perfectly and even then start rubbing in the right direction and keep rubbing until maybe the moisture evaporates to the right degree and then the skin starts rolling off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the Baiden for more delicate areas like my torso, but for the legs and arms it is simpler and faster to use the Kae.  It&#x27;s also a bit rougher/stronger so don&#x27;t press too hard or you&#x27;ll end up with raw red sore skin for a while.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works really well. Lovely to see all the dead skin coming off.</li>
            <li> I purchased this glove for $20.00. It was a gamble because that seemed expensive for a bath tool to me. In the past, I&#x27;ve purchased and come across many bath brushes. They&#x27;ve mostly been too rough and disappointing, although they help me reach my back. I am happy to report this glove worth the price so far, and I hope it will last at least a year. It seems well made. My hands are  medium sized, and they fit inside. I use this product every time I shower, which has been for a week now. The roughness of the glove/its ability to exfoliate depends on how vigorously and how hard you apply it to your skin. So there&#x27;s some room for variance there. However, it is like a very fine sandpaper. To me, this is not too rough. It makes my skin a bright pink after I use it, and I feel more clean after a shower. It is a very pleasant feeling and it helps me feel more awake. I am young and able-bodied, so this glove is easy for me to use. But I can see how some individuals might not be able to fully use it. Also, unless you are very flexible, which I am not, it is difficult to reach your back with this. On the whole, I am very pleased with this purchase and hope to stay that way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a detailed review person, but this product works very well!!  I got a little overzealous in scrubbing and ended up with a scab - my fault, not the products.  If you&#x27;ve never done intense exfoliation like this, prepare to be grossed out!!  There is SO MUCH dead skin hanging on to you that you don&#x27;t know about!  I LOVE THIS GLOVE!!</li>
            <li> A wonderful exfoliating glove.</li>
            <li> I bought this glove and at first it worked good. The texture was sturdy and did a great job exfoliating my skin. After 4 months it lost its coarse texture. It no longer was exfoliating as it did when I first got it. 1 month later it began to mold around the band part of the glove that takes the longest to completely dry out after each use. I ended up throwing it away. Not worth the cost for a glove that probably only lasted less than 5 months. I do not recommend. Too expensive for the quantity of time it&#x27;s good for.</li>
            <li> This thing is quite something. I was not familiar with this type of glove but all the reviews got me lured in. I love it. First when I received it, it felt very silky and I couldn&#x27;t figure how in the world it is capable of exfoliating. Must be a gimmick of some kind. But.... when you get it wet, the texture miraculously changes to something resembling sand paper. It does what it promises. I usually use it once a week while having a bubble bath and every time I am shocked how much skin rolls off of me. This is the best exfoliator ever, hands down. I always feel like new after using it. A little pricey, but I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> You have to make sure they don&#x27;t just stay wet because the can develop an awful smell.  However, as long as they&#x27;re maintained, holy crap!  They get stuff off my wife&#x27;s body that neither of is expected.  This exfoliates like nobody&#x27;s business</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job.  Definitely a very good mit and makes your skin smooth as silk.</li>
            <li> 4-5 Stars. It&#x27;s pretty good. It&#x27;s a little rougher than the ones I used growing up. I don&#x27;t know if you should use it on your face / delicate skin. So far so good. I do recommend buying this. I used this and another Japanese kind of dry skin brush (both in the shower) and after doing that -- I felt so sleepy and had a deep sleep. I&#x27;m not sure i they both help detoxify and somehow you are able to sleep better. Lol. I think that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> I had a man medium size hands just fit o k. After 8 months of use, the stitching on the seam became lose. The thumb side had a large hole.&lt;br /&gt;If you had a small hands may be o k to use.</li>
            <li> LOVE! Now just to order one for each of my daughters!</li>
            <li> I use this with my Morracan black soap. It is amazing! Super tight weave, extremely abrasive yet in a microfiber way. Does the job. Just bought one for my 10 year old who also suffers from karentinitus piloris. Only thing I wish is that it was in a light color, so I could see all the dead skin it sloughs offs better. When you use it with the Morracan black soap (after it sits on pre-humidified skin for 10 mins), use circular motions.</li>
            <li> Works so great that when my daughter visited.... she hijacked it! I&#x27;ll be buying a new one to replace it :-)</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this glove because the price seemed a bit high. However, after a month of use, I already notice my skin is smoother, more even in appearance, and much less dry. I can&#x27;t believe how much dead skin this mit removes and I highly recommend it! Paired with a moisturizer containing lactic acid (such as AmLactin) this glove has completely taken care of my keratosis pilaris. SO pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li> This glove is a really amazing tool to use when you exfoliate.  I started using it because I had ingrown hairs on the back of my legs, and now I&#x27;m all smooth.  I used to buy it at a spa, but they stopped carrying it because people were complaining about how rough the texture was.  This glove works best for me.</li>
            <li> Use this with Moroccan black soap in the infrared sauna.</li>
            <li> Ooooooooo I love this!  I will give this as a gift to all my girlfriends.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the black soap.  It didn&#x27;t work well with the soap because the soap stays on the mitt like a paste.  So, you have switch hands in order to keep using it with the soap.  Save the $$ and don&#x27;t get the soap.  I then used it with just regular shower gel and it definitely exfoliated but my skin felt like I had used sand paper.  I can&#x27;t imagine that regular use of this mitt is good for your skin.  I paid about $20 for this and don&#x27;t think that it does the job any better than a good wash cloth or one of those exfoliating gloves that they sell at the beauty store for $5.</li>
            <li> Love love love this.... It gets all the dead skin cells off... Makes my skin so soft</li>
            <li> I like this exfoliating glove but there are a few things that could be improved. The glove does shrink so medium to small hands only. It does feel like fine grit sandpaper going over wet soapy skin so if that is not what you are looking for, this glove is not for you. The string needs to be longer to allow hanging it up yo dry. Overall great product. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> This really, really works! I use this every other week before I shave my legs. It helps to shed the layer of dead skin/little bumps. It does a great job. I have used it 6-7 times now and it still works the same as it did the first day. This is great to use before spray tan! The only downside (which is not the gloves fault really) is my bathtub is full of dead skin after using this. It is pretty gross, but hey it&#x27;s better down the drain than on your body!</li>
            <li> i like this glove. it helps to remove the skin and it is very smoothy&lt;br /&gt;i will buy it agin</li>
            <li> I purchased this product 7 months ago and I loved it--swore I would continue to buy the product until they stopped making it. However, the price of the glove has doubled in 7 months, and the value of the product is not worthy of $22 every 4 months or so (the terry part of the mitt has been detaching for that long--therefore I considered the product replaceable after 4 months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, great product, wrong price. I cannot justify this purchase anymore. If you have a tremendous amount of expendable income, this glove does exactly what it says it does--exfoliates nicely, keeps a lather, keeps nicely in the shower.</li>
            <li> I like the glove, it makes my skin feel really soft but the only draw back is it seems to make me breakout:( I just won&#x27;t use it that often but it works well.</li>
            <li> THIS MAKES YOUR SKIN SUPER SOFT! I seriously love it. It exfoliates more effectively than any other implements I&#x27;ve tried, such as Salux cloths, loofahs, wash cloths, and regular sponges. The fit is excellent for my small hands, although it can also be used as a small cloth instead of as a glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. You will need to use quite a bit of moisturizing soap, since the glove doesn&#x27;t create many suds, and the suds that do appear tend to dissipate quickly.&lt;br /&gt;2. This chips manicures super fast, so be sure to refresh your nails AFTER you shower.&lt;br /&gt;3. Price fluctuations- wait for the cost to go back down. I have no idea why it&#x27;s $20+ right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the issue with minimal sudsing, it&#x27;s relatively time consuming to use this, so I only find myself reaching for this 1-4 times per month. It is really worth it when I do set aside the time, though. Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Really nice product good quality I use it in combination with Moroccan back Soap with argan oil I love the result it helped me to get rid of the dark skin in my tummy which I got as a result of three pregnancies. It makes my skin really soft.</li>
            <li> Works really well on my skin. I especially like to use it on my feet between pedicures. I use it about 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> I really love this glove so far. I have had it for several weeks and I definitely think it works great. I have fair and sensitive skin and have not scrubbed the top layer of skin off like some reviews. I would suggest not scrubbing too hard until you see how your skin reacts. I noted no skin actually peeling off my body as some reviews, but I exfoliate often, so this is not a factor for me; however for me, my results have been positive. I would give 5 stars save for the price, but would definitely recommend and purchase again.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so smooth! Ultimate treat to use this 1-2 times a week &amp; follow it up with that neutrogena body oil. Definitely don&#x27;t scrub hard - several soft passes is all that is needed.</li>
            <li> This glove REALLY does work. BEST I&#x27;ve ever tried. Have only used it twice. BUT, the piping on the edge has stretched/torn. I think it will continue to unravel or come apart. For the price I think that this defect should not be expected, but after a quick read, replacement does not seem to be an Amazon option. AND BOY IT SURE DOES SHRINK!! In the pic the orange fabric is larger than the wrist cuff. During my first use, the orange fabric shrunk up to a long \\&quot;pickle shape\\&quot; that is now narrower than the cuff. Was afraid during that first shower that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get it off. It works fine though. My fingers and thumb are just pushed tightly together when I try to make a flat palm and use it. I plan to buy another, to be able to do both sides of my body at the same time. I wonder if the fabric is SO expensive that they can&#x27;t afford to be a bit more generous. It would certainly make bathing a more comfortable experience. But GREAT for exfoliating!</li>
