            <li>The price is good too!  </li>
            <li>lashes look good!  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t figure out which ones were good and which ones weren&#x27;t so when I recieved the opportunity to recieve this eyelash growth enhancer for my review, I jumped on it!</li>
            <li>and I am delighted with the results!  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with EmbelLASH!  </li>
            <li>Its a shame since the customer service was great.</li>
            <li>I was offered to try EmbelLASH for a great price and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out!&lt;br /&gt;Applying</li>
            <li>I think the damage to those follicles is too great for my lower lash line to recover.</li>
            <li>Additionally, being diligent about applying both serums and seeing the progress of my lashes is a great incentive to focus my efforts on nurturing that area.</li>
            <li>Great product....informed my sister to try it.</li>
            <li>I know that that one works great.</li>
            <li>GREAT PROUCT</li>
            <li>it works perfectly great how it should be</li>
            <li>I bought this product based on the description, guarantee, and great reviews.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In case you also have thinning scalp hair like me, I have found that Amazon also carries a great shampoo for that.</li>
            <li>Great customer service, looking forward to see the result.</li>
            <li>Even the makers of EMBELLASH because I know you have a great product.</li>
            <li>&#x3D; seems results greatly  embellished .</li>
            <li>I will stick to grandelash md which I&#x27;ve had great results with.</li>
            <li>and I proudly told about this serum.</li>
            <li>In any case my report is GREAT PRODUCT, GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE, AND BEYOND EXPECTATION RESULTS.  </li>

            <li>Loving the results!</li>
            <li>What I loved the best was that my lashes are actually more CURLED now.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a more pleasant Amazon experience than with Protoge, and will be a continued customer from here on out!</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s also very easy to apply!</li>
            <li>Great productThe ingredients in Embellash are amazing and nutritious</li>
            <li>This product is so good.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t working as promised, I have used others ans felt it is good to change every now and then.</li>
            <li>My lashes look really good.  </li>
            <li>I have yet to see good results.</li>
            <li>Application wise</li>
            <li>Good job Protege Beauty!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Awesome, responsive customer service, which is so important these days when things don&#x27;t go as planned.</li>
            <li>Totally delighted with this transaction</li>
            <li>Great product and nice follow up by customer service.</li>
            <li>Price was also good.</li>
            <li>All good ingredients in one application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it feels good and for the price</li>
            <li>Mascara looks good on me now.</li>
            <li>Concerning customer support, I am RAVING about how good it is.</li>
            <li>Good customer service and good product.</li>
            <li>It does take a good 4 to 6 weeks to notice results</li>
            <li>if a company cares about animals they sure care more about humans and I am positively impressed with the gel.</li>
            <li>I bought this product after reading so many great reviews on this.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased I order this product.  </li>
            <li>I also was very pleased with the customer care portion of this purchase.  </li>
            <li>I so happy to find a product like this to work and not cost you a fortion :) I can&#x27;t wait for a month to see the difference .</li>
            <li>Price was great and it&#x27;s a 4 month supply:)</li>
            <li>If you are looking for longer, thicker lashes and/or eyebrows, you&#x27;ll love EmbelLASH from Protege!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I will buy more when this tube runs out!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>it also made my lashes notably longer to boot!  </li>
            <li>Love this product and it works!  </li>
            <li>but they are better!</li>
            <li>Now, 2 months later...her eyebrows somehow look better than they did before she started losing her hair!  </li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>but if it&#x27;s getting thicker I&#x27;m sure it will grow as well!</li>
            <li>This is amazing.</li>
            <li>Been using it for around 4 weeks now and already seen amazing results.</li>
            <li>But for me it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing eye lash serum.</li>
            <li>Amazing results after three weeks.</li>
            <li>As someone that has seen AMAZING results from Careprost/Latisse, you will NOT get that from this product.</li>
            <li>it is really precise and great for applying for lashes</li>
            <li>This product works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>Simply amazing.</li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>I started using this product and the results is it amazing.</li>
            <li>This kind of customer service cannot be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The five stars were given because I honestly felt like I have fuller lashes after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that it was all in one - brush was no separate.  </li>
            <li>Company delivered on time and in nice presentation.</li>
            <li>Best of all, it REALLY DID WORK.</li>
            <li>It says to apply twice a day but it leaves kind of a crust.</li>
            <li>Eyelashes growing faster than before and the lashes are filling in quite nicely.</li>
            <li>product comes with a eyeliner kind of wand to apply so</li>
            <li>have received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased reviews</li>
            <li>I am just so thrilled.</li>
            <li>I have been using for over a week and can honestly tell you I see some growth.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great product!</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased and feel so much more attractive now.</li>
            <li>I replied to Stephanie that in a 2 weeks period there was nothing I could honestly report about my results.</li>
            <li>that was wonderful , and in 3 weeks my eyelashes improved incredible  and last for months,  2 years ago, but they do not sell any more and that is why I change</li>
            <li>All I can do is give an honest opinion on our experience.  </li>
            <li>I am loving the EmbelLASH.</li>
            <li>It was easy and pleasant to use.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Very cool product!</li>
            <li>I can honestly state that I am very happy with its performance thus far</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>but this is the best so far!</li>
            <li>Both lash serums worked okay-ish on their own, but together, they get far more impressive results.    </li>
            <li>So far I am very happy and</li>
            <li>So far great!  </li>
            <li>By far the best customer service EVER.</li>
            <li>So far so good!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a number of lash enhancement products including Latisse and this is by far the best one yet!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use, and yes it will sting if it gets in your eye, but hey, don&#x27;t put it in your eye and you&#x27;ll be just fine!  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased and a bit relieved that I found something so effective.</li>
            <li>Not sure if I&#x27;ll ever be the &amp;#34;girl&amp;#34; that gets complimented for her beautiful lashes again but very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat that for great customer service (thanks, Stephanie!).</li>
            <li>Thought it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>I had virtually none and the lashes that were there are very light brown and invisible.</li>
            <li>This says a lot about a good customer service.&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky to receive this product under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
            <li>It worked fine on it&#x27;s own, but combined with an oil-based serum</li>
            <li>Glad it worked for others though</li>
            <li>I love how it makes me feel.</li>
            <li>Time to buy some more.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great product</li>
            <li>I try to put it on every morning and night, but believe me, I forgot many, many times, and even skipped many days consecutively.</li>
            <li>My lashes have always had a sligh curl, but now that my lashes are longer and darker, the curl is much more noticeable.</li>
            <li>Outstanding.</li>
            <li>I should have read more carefully...thought it was mascara.  </li>
            <li>Most of the fullness was gone after using Embellash for three months.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes look so much better.</li>
            <li>I have those thicker, longer and MORE eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Guess I was wishing for more to soon.</li>
            <li>are a magical combination for me.</li>
            <li>Without any serum, I&#x27;d imagine it would be more along the lines of 24 weeks, based on the rate of growth Isaw without a serum.</li>
            <li>I also believe my lashes are stronger and better rooted while using this serum as opposed to when I was using nothing.    </li>
            <li>I have used Latisse and the results were a bit quicker but at more than twice the cost.</li>
            <li>Love the brush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more than satisfied.</li>
            <li>Does seem to keep what you have healthy.</li>
            <li>Rather the top broke off.  </li>
            <li>I can still use it by dipping the brush into the container but the top is cracked off.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product and have seen growth in my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I was looking for another brand that I would get more bang for my buck.</li>
            <li>Really....... if it was so great then why would that happen.</li>
            <li>/&gt;MY EYEBROWS COULD HAVE, IN MY OPINION, USED MORE HAIR.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone looking for longer lashes or just looking to get more fuller lashes.</li>
            <li>but I love that once I reach the results I want, I can quit using it.</li>
            <li>Great seller, shipped fast.</li>
            <li>I used revitalize and it was much better.  </li>
            <li>it takes time, but it really works great product</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s refreshing to know that there are businesses out there that still cater to the people buying their products.</li>
            <li>Rubbing it in with my pinky seems to help, but I feel more like I&#x27;m rubbing it off, not in, and that may be delaying my treatment results.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely LOVE that you can see through the tube so you can tell when you need to order more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>satisfied and will purchase again.</li>
            <li>and I will keep using it to keep a healthy growth of my lashes.</li>
            <li>You can feel safe trying their products.</li>
            <li>I do recommend it for those whom have the patience to work with the product for a month or so as it truly works its&#x27; magic over time.</li>
            <li>Hope continued use will bring better results.</li>
            <li>In my case there was more fullness than lash lengthening</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m incredibly impressed with the companies follow-up and follow through to ensure that you fully understand how to properly use the product and are satisfied with the product and service.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>love curling and putting mascara on my lashes now.</li>
            <li>I was concerned, but within a couple of weeks the top ones caught up.</li>
            <li>in fact they seem shorter and more sparse.</li>
            <li>stars is the outstanding company philsophy and customer service.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I notice it more in the brow area.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Maybe even some before and after photos. :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Customer service with Prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute; Beauty is top notch.  </li>
            <li>, I have a lot more serum to use.</li>
            <li>My lower lashes are thicker and the uppers are longer and feel more fluttery.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that Protégé products do not contain any animal products and does not test their products on animals.  </li>
            <li>Three weeks in and already seeing improvements:)</li>
            <li>I love this product...</li>
            <li>I will give it more time and see if I cannot give a better review</li>
            <li>I used this product faithfully for 4-months and the only thing that got longer was th  nose of the liar who said that this product was  the  best thing since sliced-white bread.</li>
            <li>I GLAD</li>
            <li>I guess I am hoping something will magically happen that hasn&#x27;t happened already.</li>
            <li>sure</li>
            <li>and overall the results have been incredible!!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no way that anyone could love this product.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying the Eyelash Enhancer by Protégé.</li>
            <li>I had so many more lashes.</li>
            <li>but I believe it will take weeks more of using the product before I can decide if it&#x27;s a 5 star product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m satisfied with this item.</li>
            <li>:) I have not been using this product for the 5 weeks it says it takes</li>
            <li>works as well as the top drugstore brand.</li>
            <li>I WAS MORE THEN PLEASED.  </li>
            <li>Today most of my lashes measure 9mm and</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE  </li>
            <li>Most Sincerely,  Dana</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, and here&#x27;s hoping!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I did purchase this</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>and it just keeps getting better and better or should I say hairier and hairier.</li>
            <li>I like it better than Olash.</li>
            <li>I used the product once a day until I was sure my eyes and lids were used to the product.</li>
            <li>But mostly thicker.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve waited to post this review in hopes that I&#x27;d have better news to report.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad others have seen better results and appreciate that they offer a guarantee.  </li>
            <li>I also see quite a difference in my lashes, both top and bottom.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li>I feel the product needs more time, it does say &#x27;5 weeks&#x27; for results</li>
            <li>When I run out of this bottle I will order another to give it more time.</li>
            <li>The stuff that requires a prescription better</li>
            <li>Need more time, but I&#x27;m hopeful.</li>
            <li>We want to make sure everything is still going well regarding your experience with Protégé</li>
            <li>Try different products or go with the best and spend lots.</li>
            <li>I would like it better if once a day was recommended</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I decided to take a chance on this.</li>
            <li>I have tried many lash serums...</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>They seem to value that you are 100% satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use Embellash, hoping to get greater results over time.</li>
            <li>I love that this product is a family based business.  </li>
            <li>I use it day and night and follow the instructions, I feel confident that is why it is working for me.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I followed the instructions of applying the serum twice a day to both the top and bottom of my lash lines.</li>
            <li>The customer service is also top notch.</li>
            <li>I thought the growth would have been greater than it is</li>
            <li>so I will probably order one more time</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>far... I loved the packaging!</li>
            <li>I was excited when I found out I was going to get the opportunity to test this product in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>However, my top lash lines are filling nicely - I&#x27;d say about 30% of what a full lash line would be.</li>
            <li>Works great but this particular product burns some what unlike Grandelash</li>
            <li>look pretty good too.</li>
            <li>I have seen significant results!</li>
            <li>The product is easy to apply and I cannot wait to see the results after more use.  </li>
            <li>The brush is tiny and perfect for lining your make up free lash line morning and night.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many other brands of eyelash enhancers over the years, but this products has shown the best results.  </li>
            <li>The product itself feels very cool when you apply so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely happy with the results I&#x27;ve seen so far.</li>
            <li>I get it, but I prefer that the bag fit the tube most snugly...</li>
            <li>I am so happy (and frankly surprised) to see that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>I enjoy putting on the mascara now, as I have more ample lashes to coat.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So far a great product.</li>
            <li>This product has been great so far.  </li>
            <li>More over this is cruelty free and made in USA</li>
            <li>Great stuff so far .</li>
            <li>I love that this is Made in the USA and cruelty free.</li>
            <li>This product has not made a noticeable difference on my eyelash length, but I have seen my lashes becoming thicker and softer.</li>
            <li>Although I loved having thicker longer lashes, who wants eyes all red/blue &amp; swollen?  </li>
            <li>The lash results for the prescription serum seem very impressive in reviews I&#x27;ve seen, but one of the side effects of bimatoprost (the active ingredient in the prescription serum) is fat atrophy - meaning, the fat cells under the skin around your eyes begin to degrade, and can cause a permanent, sunken undereye appearance over time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;EmbelLash is extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Applies easily and leaves no residue&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This serum is easy to apply, just use the wand to apply on your lash line and eyebrows twice a day.</li>
            <li>I wrote that they could easily check my Amazon file and see that my product was still in \\&quot;transit.\\</li>
            <li>and it absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>Good product, decent price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be able to swipe the brush in the right area to get it out of the tube!</li>
            <li>So far, an amazing product!</li>
            <li>pretty amazing</li>
            <li>Besides that it works fast and effectively, I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Lashes and brows are much more full and noticeable.</li>
            <li>I am going to keep using this product and will post another review in three more weeks as I understand it takes time to get the full effect.  </li>
            <li>The applicator brush is very easy to use and just the right size.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t irritate even my own sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So relax, close your eyes, fan them a bit to hasten the drying time, and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>Can use brush it comes with or a fine liner brush, I&#x27;ve had no irritation.</li>
            <li>I deliberately waited the full six weeks before giving a review because I wanted it to be accurate and truthful</li>
            <li>but this works fine</li>
            <li>Embellash does help move things along more quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Embellash for over 3 weeks and see a tremendous difference!</li>
            <li>which is a huge thing for</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a about a month now and see a HUGE difference.  </li>
            <li>The smell of the serum is light and organic.</li>
            <li>Protege Beauty is cruelty free and the customer service is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel so comfortable about that on the tip of my eyelids.</li>
            <li>It has lengthen my lashes as well as filled out my lashes.</li>
            <li>I think it is a great product for the price, especially compared to the others out there.</li>
            <li>the area has filled in.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a happy camper.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t complain if they get longer and thicker, but I am happy with the current results.  </li>
            <li>I can actually say that I have longer and fuller eye lashes that look great with a coat of mascara.  </li>
            <li>Within the first week or two I swear my eyelashes, top &amp; bottom, as well as my eyebrows started looking thicker &amp; more full.  </li>
            <li>I have a quite light complexion and need all the color I can get.</li>
            <li>And its important to nourish them.</li>
            <li>and it applies smoothly.</li>
            <li>, if you have already started seeing results, and took before/after pictures, please send them to us and you will be entered into our weekly draw for a free product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had been losing a lot of eyelashes because of a cheap eyelash adhesive.</li>
            <li>I used it night and day and applied no mascara to give it a real chance to work on its own.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>While, I can&#x27;t comment on the results yet, so far, so good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Thanks for such a great product!</li>
            <li>fast delivery , product does not irritate eyes at all..would like to see more response ..will give more time</li>
            <li>Giving the seller 5 stars for amazingly fast shipment!!!</li>
            <li>It REALLY WORKS!!!</li>
            <li>They all work wonders for my skin, so when I was offered the opportunity to evaluate Protege EmbelLASH, I was super excited to write about my experience first hand and give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>They checked on me to be sure that I received my product first and later to see if I was happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>great product very gentle and natural...</li>
            <li>None except the price, and I am so happy to have full brows back, I will not complain&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>My lashes are growing, this super easy to apply product does what it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, dries quickly, and non-stinging.</li>
            <li>Lashes continue to look good; longer, but not in a major way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see my lashes grow</li>
            <li>so when I was given the opportunity to purchase these at a reduced cost to test for quality, I was excited.</li>
            <li>I have used the product on the lower lashes, but that hasn&#x27;t produced significant change, like it has on the uppers.   </li>
            <li>This product has not worked for me but the reason I am giving it 4 stars is because it has worked so well on so many other women and nicely too!</li>
            <li>i choose this product for its ingredients  effectiveness and gentleness - so far i am very pleased.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m excited to see some regrowth ...</li>
            <li>I was getting no results from Obagie, which costs a lot more, and this is really working!</li>
            <li>I have saved the 5 lashes that have fallen from my eyes and can see significant length.  </li>
            <li>Have not noticed any significant change.</li>
            <li>I can say that it performs noticeably better than the other over the counter serums I&#x27;ve tried, and it&#x27;s definitely more effective than no serum at all.</li>
            <li>It has a light orange-brownish color going on, but goes on clear, so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>I apply it at night after my face is clean and again in the morning after showering and cleaning my face.  </li>
            <li>I love that the ingredients are more natural</li>
            <li>I have tried several products and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>They immediately apologized and issued a full refund.</li>
            <li>I have full brow hari to the end on both sides and its getting fuller and darker  each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I approached this product with some trepidation since I wasn&#x27;t sure if a product could really enhance my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased...time for more.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>All opinions stated, whether self-purchased or provided for review, are completely those of my own.</li>
            <li>If you get a bit in your eyes, no stinging, but just a rather warmish sensation in the area (never painful).  </li>
            <li>My eyebrows now are completely full.</li>
            <li>Personally, I thing EmbelLash is a good place to start on your journey of discovering what works for you.</li>
            <li>I wish I could get a full refund of my money including my shipping and handling.</li>
            <li>cause the price is not bad at all.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows have filled in at the 2 thinning spots on my right brow.  </li>
            <li>I am really happy with the results and I haven&#x27;t even used half of my original bottle yet.</li>
            <li>Glad to have found a new productthat does what it says!</li>
            <li>To be honest, I didn&#x27;t really expect much.</li>
            <li>- IT HAS HELPED ME TREMENDOUSLY.</li>
            <li>and I had to quickly put water on it</li>
            <li>&quot;  I think it&#x27;s just starting so it will be interesting to see how they look in a couple more weeks.</li>
            <li>However, it works quick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lovely to have them back:)</li>
            <li>Finally, I thought I&#x27;m going to try the EmbelLash, with the great reviews and extremely reasonable price...</li>
            <li>I purchased this product mainly for my eyebrows to see if they would grow out some more and was hesitant to use it on my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll still give it some more time, but I kinda don&#x27;t have high expectations anymore.</li>
            <li>The company follows up with your satisfaction with the product multiple times which is very refreshing this day and age.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed new growth like how it did to my lashes, but this product was more geared towards eyelash growth</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t respond right away because I knew from experience that lash enhancers can take weeks, and sometimes months to show their full promise.  </li>
            <li>Someone said they experienced a tingling to slight stinging on the lash line.</li>
            <li>More importantly, I am seeing some hair growth on my eyebrows on the bare spots from over-plucking.  </li>
            <li>#34;enhancement serums&amp;#34; on google and found various sources that led me to this wonderful product that I&#x27;m so thankful to stumble</li>
            <li>I always wanted long lovely eyelashes and eyebrows, but never could be able to achieve them.  </li>
            <li>My original plan was to get a prescription for Latisse, but I thought I would see what an over the counter solution would do for me first.</li>
            <li>As a consumer, I appreciate that Protege Beauty is interactive with its customers, and obviously care about their well-being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using EmbeLash for about 7 weeks, and want you to know that I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this product!  </li>
            <li>This product really works!!  </li>
            <li>and I will be back for more!</li>
            <li>I used it exactly as directed, twice a day, for a month, and saw a significant increase in my lash length and volume.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about 5 weeks now and have seen significant regrowth of my very over-plucked eyebrows!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really sure if this would work and was super worried because I have extremely sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>I also appreciate the fact that Embellash is far more affordable.</li>
            <li>I figured it was worth a shot based on the reviews.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s worth it ladies.</li>
            <li>love the fact that the ingredients are mostly natural.  </li>
            <li>The lenght has taken longer but it&#x27;s from my own personal way of using it once a day and missed days.</li>
            <li>I feel that the product was worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the try for the price.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li>I think it is worth a try and easier to apply than vitamin E.</li>
            <li>Getting old has so many drawbacks and losing eye lashes is one of them.</li>
            <li>After 5 days use I can&#x27;t give a review since success will be measured by lash growth.</li>
            <li>It has alot of natural ingredients and does not make your eyes burn or sting like most do.  </li>
            <li>I would say with a 95% success rate.  </li>
            <li>My lashes did grow, but there was not a substantial change, and now the product has stopped working, and my lashes (on top of thinning and falling out) are going back to their original size.</li>
            <li>I will keep using which is better than most other eye lash products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>So as you can see,  I only review when I&#x27;m either extremely disappointed...or extremely impressed.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and works exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>applied the product every night before bed and every morning right before work.</li>
            <li>I began using this right after I received it, about 3 weeks ago.</li>
            <li>i apply once in the morning and put my mascara right over it</li>
            <li>The price is also right.</li>
            <li>I think the 14-16 week mark is when I will be able to claim full lash lines with Embellash, after starting from basically nothing.</li>
            <li>Well, after the fifth week, I was surprised and pleased to see that it really does work!  </li>
            <li>First of all, their customer service is stellar!</li>
            <li>Surely, my eye lashes grew a little but no thickness or larger amount of eye lashes occurred which had greatly upset me.</li>
            <li>It seems to be doing OK in keeping my lashes long and full.  </li>
            <li>I have only been using the product for about a week, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>taking mascara off with a soft makeup remover towelette, I noticed lashes so easily on the towel.</li>
            <li>This cerum works how it is intended to do, it made my eyelashes grow on bold spots from long wear of extension lashes and grows more lashes.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>I think the price is very reasonable</li>
            <li>I so very much wanted this product to do the trick for me.</li>
            <li>I have had success with other products and thought the price would be a nice savings</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t avidly put it on</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>When I first got this product I thought that it was working</li>
            <li>When I first started using Embellash, I did feel the stinging sensation</li>
            <li>After the first week, I no longer felt that sensation.    </li>
            <li>When I used Embellash alone, which I did for the first 3 weeks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d experienced all my life - I&#x27;m not sure how much the serums play a part in this.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I made sure to put it into my daily routine.</li>
            <li>Figured why not.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been exactly 4 weeks</li>
            <li>Seems to work; first time I&#x27;ve tried this stuff.</li>
            <li>I really do believe that this product is worth a try.</li>
            <li>However, in the first 3 weeks, there were no changes.</li>
            <li>I used it for 5 weeks and for the first 4 weeks, nothing seemed to be happening.  </li>
            <li>It is my first time buying a product to help with the growth of my lashes</li>
            <li>After about 2 weeks my lashes have grown more healthy-looking and are definitely longer.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>i saw results after the first 2 weeks - I would put another star on this</li>
            <li>At first after 2 weeks of using this I thought I had an imporvement in length (lashes), but I think it was just a placebo effect, cause</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be interested to see if my lashes &#x27;cycle&#x27; in length with EmbelLash as they did with the prescription enhancer.  </li>
            <li>Been using it consistently every morning and before bed for about 2 months.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to just use CONSISTENTLY.</li>
            <li>I have followed the directions exactly as stated and have not noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li>First day i</li>
            <li>There are many products similar to this one, but at a higher cost than Embellash.  </li>
            <li>This is the first product of this type that doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.  </li>
            <li>My gosh, this stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>For some reason I lost many of the eyelashes in the middle of my lids.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this five star because of the customer service communication and also because it nourished and seemed to condition my eyebrows, I can&#x27;t give it a five star on growth because I wasn&#x27;t consistent on application</li>
            <li>I used EmbelLash twice a day foe the first two weeks and started seein results.  </li>
            <li>This is not my first type of product that I have tried for my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case as I follow the directions exactly.</li>
            <li>This is the first product like this that I have tried.</li>
            <li>I like to use it first thing in the morning and at night.</li>
            <li>it would be very greedy of me, is to see them get darker!</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was an illusion, but undeniably, my lashes are longer and fuller.</li>
            <li>I did not see much of a difference in my eyebrows, but my lashes are visibly longer and thicker!</li>
            <li>Maybe they will start to really grow!  </li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While I am experiencing growth which is wonderful, my lashes are very thin, but after loosing most of my lashes earlier this summer after attempting to remove lash extensions, I am thankful for the growth that I am seeing.  </li>
            <li>AND I can see new hair growth (baby lashes that are on their way to full length).</li>
            <li>If I overdo it and apply too much, it crusts up, but that helps me make sure I am only using as much as needed, so no complaints there!</li>
            <li>I have appreciated and enjoyed the personal touch of the company contacting me to address some concerns I had....</li>
            <li>i haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my lashes that are positive.</li>
            <li>Please for anyone that is looking for positive results, please buy today.</li>
            <li>I have already bought another bottle to have ready when my first one runs out.  </li>
            <li>My lashes have always been long, but I noticed that I probably grew twice as many as I had</li>
            <li>The company itself is very responsive, and helpful for anyone interested in this product.</li>
            <li>I had used Latise in the past and loved the results but it took 3 months to get the results I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>This seems to be working as I said, I apply every am and pm and yes my lashes are longer.. not dramatic and is taking awhile.</li>
            <li>I bought this product after seeing all the fantastic reviews, but now i&#x27;m pretty certain that the owners of this product are simply making all these reviews themselves.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t unbearable, but it was certainly noticeable.</li>
            <li>I took before and after photos without mascara just to show them purely as they are.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using EmbelLash for 5 weeks and my eyelashes are certainly longer and appear fuller.</li>
            <li>VERY easy and accurate to use, with no mess or waste.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with my results so far and can&#x27;t wait to see my results in the next few weeks!</li>
            <li>what did I have to lose, if I can throw $160 in the waste basket, surely I can toss $35!  </li>
            <li>Overall, I think it has been more like a healthy conditioner for my lashes and it has improved their growth , although not super dramatically</li>
            <li>My lashes are SO long and many new lashes grew in as well!</li>
            <li>I did not see a huge difference with this as I did with Careprost (generic of Latisse).</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
            <li>Really WROKING in just 2 wks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so im on  very lo med for it,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Absolutely works for me after about 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li>This stuff dries fast.</li>
            <li>I then gently pat it in using my fingertip.</li>
            <li>AND MY EYEBROWS REALLY HAVE GROWN .</li>
            <li>the coming weeks, I&#x27;ll be looking for how much my lashes fall out and how evenly they grow.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much in the way of results as of yet</li>
            <li>and this seems to be doing the job very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Company is very helpful with advice and product</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are fuller and wearing mascara is now so much</li>
            <li>After 5 weeks I really didn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 14 weeks and am ready to buy one for my daughter.</li>
            <li>Length has not yet increased much.  </li>
            <li>I had thought about seeing a doctor to inquire about Latisse, but I really did not want to break the bank</li>
            <li>You really have to be patient with the product.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t see results in 1 week as the makers of this product do say to apply it for a month before you can really see if the product is living up to its name.</li>
            <li>Email hints were greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li>My lashes and eyebrows have really grown and look much fuller and thicker.</li>
            <li>I wish I had taken before and after photos to really help people see the difference, but this stuff really does work.</li>
            <li>I really noticed the change after getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an unusual thing, watching your eyelashes regrow from</li>
            <li>Really worked well on my eyelashes almost immediately.  </li>
            <li>My lashes are really thickening.</li>
            <li>Blank spots have filled in as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really appreciate thr seller sending the email with the tips.</li>
            <li>sooooo much</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t done much for my brows, but I have noticed a growth in my lashes after 5 months of use.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The applicator is too thing and doesn&#x27;t to absorb the product very well.</li>
            <li>I Believe this product is really going to work</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Ir works but it doesn&#x27;t do all the miracles, my lashes are longer and stronger, but I don&#x27;t see much yet on the volume, been using it for 4 weeks or so</li>
            <li>Growth too fast ...</li>
            <li>I have seen some growth, but not as much as with the Nutralash</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very wnoferful product.</li>
            <li>I may be putting on too much</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone !</li>
            <li>thanks for this product.  </li>
            <li>makes my eyes look fuller and dont need as much mascara</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very think liquid</li>
            <li>Thanks again so much</li>
            <li>Been using it for a couple of months and haven&#x27;t noticed much difference.</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes and eyebrows are getting much fuller.</li>
            <li>No irritation, fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>I know it will take time to see if it really makes them thicker</li>
            <li>I also really appreciate the fact that the company extended itself to me via email.</li>
            <li>not so much in thickness yet &amp; not a change in eyebrows but</li>
            <li>But waiting to see if it really produces growth.</li>
            <li>We’d really appreciate it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>This eyelash growth serum has to me, really seemed to have been working.</li>
            <li>Not too much as of yet,</li>
            <li>I will absolutely get this again.  </li>
            <li>and it can be very daunting to make a decision on just one.  </li>
            <li>this is a real Scam.</li>
            <li>burns so much</li>
            <li>It really did make my thinned out lashes grow longer</li>
            <li>My lashes were destroyed from lash extensions; after recieving this and using it in the morning before I put my makeup on, and at night when I removed my makeup, after only 2 weeks I could definitely tell that my lashes were longer, fuller, and overall more healthy.</li>
            <li>and if I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
            <li>The good thing about this packaging is that you can visually tell how much product you have left and I&#x27;m sure this would last someone using it two times a day for several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclaimer, I received this product at a heavily discounted price in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>so I was a little worried and cautious when I put it on making sure I did it right</li>
            <li>After reading through multiple reviews of similar products, I was really excited to read the fantastic reviews of &amp;#34;Embel-Lash&amp;#34; and decided to order some for myself.</li>
            <li>My own lashes are not that thin, but I have high hopes for much thicker, more noticeable lashes.....too early to tell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other similar products with good results.  </li>
            <li>the positive side, the Protege product was moisturizing, with no negative side effects.</li>
            <li>brush applicator makes it very easy and simple to apply, especially if you&#x27;ve used liquid eye liners before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it more on my brows due to eye sensitivities.</li>
            <li>within one month they not only had significant growth but as well thickness.  </li>
            <li>I have used two other products and Embellash works and better than advertised.  </li>
            <li>Last week I saw both my very best friend (who lives overseas and I only see 2-3 times a year) and my hairstylist -- both of whom usually notice everything -- and neither one said a word.  </li>
            <li>Other products work much better.</li>
            <li>but they appear thicker as well, which none of the other products were able to achieve.</li>
            <li>As ive gotten older my lashes have really become sparse.  </li>
            <li>One thing that does have me slightly concerned is that I am starting to see a light yellowish line on my top eyelash line since using this product.</li>
            <li>Still too early to see full results, but so far looks encouraging.</li>
            <li>I have looked and tried many other products and this one hands down is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Full brows are back in now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sensitive)</li>
            <li>It is not strong smelling and goes on very easy.</li>
            <li>but I really believe you have to give the product a little more time than a week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seeing new growth on my eyebrow &amp;#34;wings&amp;#34; that I had over plucked!</li>
            <li>i really do appreciate your customer service, checking in is a new experience for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m even seeing some new growth where I&#x27;ve very sparse or no eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>My lashes are longer and thicker (took less than 5 weeks, more like 3 -</li>
            <li>The main selling point for me was &#x27;not tested on animals&#x27;</li>
            <li>I mainly wanted it for my brows</li>
            <li>I mainly wanted it for my brows</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes but saw no difference in eyelash thickness.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Highly recommended this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this Growth Serum to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I continue to have high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I got this product because of the high reviews</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I should begin by mentioning that I have used so many different products over the last five years, (too many to list here), that have either done nothing, done very little, lost its effectiveness or caused so much discomfort that I had to discontinue use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it (nearly) twice a day since it arrived 4 weeks ago and was waiting to review until I was 100% certain of the results.</li>
            <li>Have used numerous lash enhancers over the years and this serum definitely keeps lashes strong and long - notice darker hue to my otherwise light lashes, too.  </li>
            <li>So far this product does seem to be working!!</li>
            <li>but i notice that my lashline around my eyes have little bit more definition to it.  </li>
            <li>I think I need a little more time to see how well it works.</li>
            <li>This particular product does not cause redness, itching, stinging or irritation of any kind, (at least, not for me</li>
            <li>However after using LiLash for such a long time and having spectacular results no other products work for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The one caveat is that you need to be very careful when applying this, since it&#x27;s all too easy to get it into your eyes and they will sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>concern that I&#x27;d heard about was that enhancements serums cause lashes to grow in straight and wild looking.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen much improvement if any with this so far.</li>
            <li>With mascara, my lashes look nearly normal.</li>
            <li>I have used several brands in the past, most recently rapidlash, which costs $50 or more.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a few more lashes have grown in</li>
            <li>I have sparse eyelashes, and I noticed more length and even some thickness within a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I always figure you could go the natural route and apply natural oils or mix of vitamins to your lashes, but this is so much easier!</li>
            <li>but after a few days of applying, it got better.  </li>
            <li>, I have noticed new growth in my brows and a little in my eyelashes, but since both are sparse, the most I ask of these products I try, is that it helps me keep what I have</li>
            <li>(Left side is before, right side is after in the photo)</li>
            <li>but luckily doesn&#x27;t for long.</li>
            <li>After about a month of applying in the morning and the evening, I now have seen my brows fill out with the growth of lots of new hairs.</li>
            <li>I started looking for a product that would encourage new growth for THICKER lashes.</li>
            <li>There is a bunch of new growth and the lashes are growing in darker.</li>
            <li>EMbelLASH is easy and literally takes less than a minute.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for such a real product and not just another claim to do product.</li>
            <li>and I have so many little lashes coming in now!  </li>
            <li>That being said, I am also very sensitive to&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable and I noticed a difference within several days.  </li>
            <li>They feel very soft, too.</li>
            <li>My eyes are very sensitive and</li>
            <li>Overall I like this product very much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it consistently for 2 weeks</li>
            <li>I use  Embellash first, applying it to my upper and lower lash lines.</li>
            <li>I just wasn&#x27;t willing to put something that burns so close to my eyes simply for a cosmetic thing.  </li>
            <li>In the past 4 wks my lashes have gotten longer and I don&#x27;t seem to lose as many.</li>
            <li>I purchased this originally for a friend and due to the reviews.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what to rate due to lack of info so mid way seemed appropriate.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>It does burn when applied at first and actually caused the skin where it was applied to peel</li>
            <li>The first week it left a brown crust on the lids..</li>
            <li>Finally i can have pretty eyes.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try something new I&#x27;ve used others in the past that worked at a minimum.</li>
            <li>My skin is a little on the sensitive side, so I do get some stinging burning when first applying, but that quickly goes away.  </li>
            <li>Okay people, I had really tiny barely visible eyelashes before, but after using this product for only two weeks now, I&#x27;ve seen a  major improvement.</li>
            <li>I guess they&#x27;re a bonus if you need more little string tie bags of this size, which I seem to have a lot of, apparently.</li>
            <li>I have had to buy new glasses because my eyelashes began rubbing against the lenses of my old ones.  </li>
            <li>If you already have full, healthy lashes and aren&#x27;t actually missing any, I imagine the results would be far less visible.</li>
            <li>It is brown with dark tiny granules which might not be a favorite for some, however it has no smell</li>
            <li>considering they were over-plucked when I was pretty young and they&#x27;ve been tiny ever since.</li>
            <li>I use to have gorgeous thick, long lashes.</li>
            <li>The eyelashes that I had left are even longer than before and my new lashes are growing in much faster than I</li>
            <li>Not red as in irritation, but it made all the little veins become very prominent, so much on the bottom lashes that blue veins actually were raised up.  </li>
            <li>Not certain that this product is strong enough to make a difference.  </li>
            <li>Once I combined it with my oil-based serum (which I had previously used on its own for several weeks a while back), the rate of growth sped up noticibly.</li>
            <li>It was usually a tiny spot on one lid that lasted only seconds &amp; was not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product, and would recommend it to anyone who has thin, brittle lashes and is looking to make them thick and healthy again!</li>
            <li>When I went back to do a little more research on amazon it is discontinued.</li>
            <li>However, it goes on clear.  </li>
            <li>It took about 4 weeks to see any results, but by week 5 there was a clear difference.  </li>
            <li>This is my least favorite so far for the cost.</li>
            <li>I have trichotillomania, so losing those precious eyebrow hairs is common for me.</li>
            <li>Unfortunatelly I will have to give it one star, since I used up the whole bottle (religiously) but saw no change in my lashes whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>And the results so far: my eyelashes and eye brows look healthier and fuller.</li>
            <li>My advice is to not apply too much product it burns a bit and to apply as close to your lash line as possible, I&#x27;m growing hair on my eyelid, whoops!  </li>
            <li>but overall highly recommend this product and will buy again!</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t seen any real growth with the eyelashes but haven&#x27;t used it regularly because of some eye problems that are being corrected.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 72 year old mother.</li>
            <li>, the evening I received the serum, was the start of my 9 1/2 days so far, of using Embellash.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleasantly surprised at how well this works.  </li>
            <li>they are so straight and short!</li>
            <li>I had very sparce short lashes &amp; now with mascara</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let this scare you if it happens early.  </li>
            <li>It was never a regular thing and happened very rarely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t noticed a change.  </li>
            <li>So far I have used the product 3 times &amp; I&#x27;ve had no burning or any side affects.</li>
            <li>I am noticing thicker and longer lashes, and I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for nearly 3 months and have seen no difference.</li>
            <li>i have no burning or any side effects and ii have sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to so far with this product</li>
            <li>So far seems to b working  </li>
            <li>but I was happily surprised with the volume my lases had after using this.</li>
            <li>I was surprised with the result.</li>
            <li>I used religiously 2x&#x27;s a day and measured them through the whole month.  </li>
            <li>but when I finally reported to them on the 30th of October 2014 ( started October 1st 2014) with my results and questions as to how much longer they might hope to get they were prompt to inform me with the info I requested.  </li>
            <li>but I only did it for 3 weeks straight...</li>
            <li>so patience is vital.</li>
            <li>after I had my radiation therapy my brows and lashes never came back very well,&lt;br /&gt;though</li>
            <li>Over-plucking in my 20&#x27;s left me without much there.</li>
            <li>No results so far, but</li>
            <li>I have tiny lashes that no matter how much mascara I put on I still look as though I have no lashes.</li>
            <li>This has really made a difference in my lashes, they are definitely longer after about 6 weeks of twice a day application.</li>
            <li>think that Latisse is the only lash growth product that really works, but is very&lt;</li>
            <li>Only time will tell, but w their track record w me, I have high hopes!</li>
            <li>Well, my daughter started using the EmbelLash on July 8th, 2014, in about 2 weeks there was a marked improvement in her eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m interested to see how long my lashes get as I continue to use the product.  </li>
            <li>I recently noticed my eyebrows are filling in and not shedding as much.</li>

            <li>The only reason this has four stars instead of five is simply because of the price, but then again, I suppose it is worth it, since it works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Follow up:  A few weeks later.......I am noticing lots more growth, especially in my eyebrows and my eyelashes</li>
            <li>I sincerely wish that I had known about this stuff a few years back.</li>
            <li>but I feel consumers have a right to know the GOOD and BAD.</li>
            <li>Love the fact this bottle lasts 3 months compare to these other brands that only last a month!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>;) I used it primarily for eyebrow growth, since I&#x27;ve always had a hard time growing my eyebrows back in.</li>
            <li>They are still very actively growing, and I expect to have 100% full lashes in another6-8 weeks.</li>
            <li>The bottle was cheaply made and when I untwisted the cap the whole top of the bottle came off:(</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have really long lashes but with a little help they are ok.</li>
            <li>Money back guarantee is a plus to try a new product!</li>
            <li>I had worn false lashes daily for a year + and as many of us know, no matter how gentle you are taking them off they take some of your natural ones with it.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>I put it on day and night; if you are going to wear makeup, be sure to let it dry before adding on shadow, liner and mascara (a few minutes should do).  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am very encouraged by the response of my lashes to this product so far and will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li>My lashes have really grew long.</li>
            <li>Complete bare spots.</li>
            <li>I normally agonize over perfecting mascara layers and curling, but this morning after I curled my lashes, I actually noticed them BEFORE I even started applying any mascara at all.</li>
            <li>I would say they&#x27;re back to normal again.</li>
            <li>I waited the full 5 weeks plus a few before posting a review because I wanted to see the effects.  </li>
            <li>In the beginning I noticed that It left a crusty residue on my lashes, I emailed customer service and received a quick response back to use less product  because it is very concentrated, I did this and the issue was resolved.</li>
            <li>but I not only saw new growth</li>
            <li>This lash treatment is new for me, and slightly different than the ones I&#x27;ve already tried.  </li>
            <li>A few weeks later my lashes are completely filled in and they are longer than ever.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve put this on my eyebrows as well, but I don&#x27;t notice a major difference.</li>
            <li>I had 1 area that thinned, but nothing major.  </li>
            <li>This tube is also large so it will last me a long time.</li>
            <li>Instead of using the stupid eyelash extensions that ripped my lashes out and seemed incredibly unsanitary.</li>
            <li>also like that the tube is clear so I can see where the product is sitting when it gets low.</li>
            <li>I guess because I&#x27;m used to different products being clear.</li>
            <li>I have used the revitalash in the past with quick dramatic results, however... it is loaded with toxic chemicals, so I opted for something more natural.  </li>
            <li>Usually early in the day and again later at night.</li>
            <li>Too early to say if Embellash is working, I have only used it for a week.  </li>
            <li>My lashes are starting to grow but I would like to use the produce up before I give a complete review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I dont&#x27; see big difference with my eye lashes</li>
            <li>I personally would not waste my money on this.</li>
            <li>Yes it does work but there is barely a difference.</li>
            <li>My eye lashes are still barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>The consistency of the liquid is not too thick and glides smoothly every time.</li>
            <li>They are long, thick and healthy.</li>
            <li>I certainly intend to try other products in their skin care line.</li>
            <li>The small brush applicator makes it really easy to get long the lines of the eyelashes.</li>
            <li>The holes are disappearing and there&#x27;s new growth where I haven&#x27;t had any in a long time.  </li>
            <li>It did burn a slight bit when I first started using it but that sensation eventually stopped.</li>
            <li>At first I had a slight reaction on my eyelids when I began using it</li>
            <li>It slightly burned my eyes at first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for three weeks, and can see a definite increase in both length and thickness of my eyelashes - WOW!  </li>
            <li>BUT THEY ALWAYS HAVE BEEN VERY LIGHT AND THIN ESPECIALLY AFTER THE CHEMO.</li>
            <li>i have used other products and noticed a difference much sooner.</li>
            <li>however, it did absolutely NOTHING&amp;#60; It is not that I used it improperly, I have used other lash enhancers that worked...</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the results, my lashes are looking a lot healthier, longer but too dramatic.</li>
            <li>had them professionally arched 15 yrs ago,  keep the shape up my self, as an actress I picked up a few tricks , but this STUFF Really grows the brows BACK&lt;</li>
            <li>This is only my second week using Embellash, I haven&#x27;t notice any change as of yet, but I was asked to give my opinion thus far.</li>
            <li>And I was surprised that this serum actually made my eyebrows grow back in places where I&#x27;ve been wanting it.</li>
            <li>but Im liking it so far :) my lashes seem softer, usually they seem a little coarse.</li>
            <li>When I put it on for the first time my lids swelled a little bit around the lashes.</li>
            <li>it does tingle a little when i first put it on.</li>
            <li>At first it seemed to sting my eyes a bit, but I got used to that after a little while.  </li>
            <li>Barely noticeable results after a couple months of daily use.  </li>
            <li>The directions state the product needs to be used twice a day for at least four weeks to achieve full effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I first put it on, the area tingled for a few minutes and then went away.</li>
            <li>The only negative is that if you put it on too heavily you will get flakes that are very unattractive so use a light hand.</li>
            <li>They are not very long</li>
            <li>They came in individual cute little pale blue suede like bags, which are a lot larger than the tube.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 40s and have had long lashes most of my life, but never super thick.  </li>
            <li>and I was already seeing results the first few weeks, but protege told me not possible so soon.</li>
            <li>Do not buy , my first order was dried out and after using for 2 months my (2nd tube) eyebrows fell out!</li>
            <li>After reading  about this product I thought this one would really work for me and that was not true.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this was normal cycling of the hair follicles, but after a while, it didn&#x27;t seem that the other product was working at all.  </li>
            <li>kind of odd in color and smell is not great.</li>
            <li>Wanted to try a different brand than I normally use to see if it worked and it works as well as any of the other eyelash growth products I have bought.  </li>
            <li>If you are a trich sufferer and you are starting with zero or very few lashes, it&#x27;s going to take more than a few weeks to get your lashes back, regardless of what serums you do or don&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li>It works a little to increase eyelashes, but not as much as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li>They did get a little longer but they are not fuller and it isn&#x27;t really much of a change.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, and causes a very slight tingling for a few seconds.</li>
            <li>This product has a darker color to it than expected; it will not be clear.  </li>

            <li> Non very good.  </li>
            <li> The amount of product you get in the bottle is very good for the value you pay.  </li>
            <li> company follows up with customers about their experience with the product which is a very good gesture and makes me feel as  a customer that the company cares about the well being of their customer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Protege has a great product at a very attractive price, and what makes the EmbelLash experience 5</li>
            <li> The price is good too!  </li>
            <li> lashes look good!  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t figure out which ones were good and which ones weren&#x27;t so when I recieved the opportunity to recieve this eyelash growth enhancer for my review, I jumped on it!</li>
            <li> and I am delighted with the results!  </li>
            <li> Good!</li>

            <li> Its a shame since the customer service was great.</li>
            <li> I was offered to try EmbelLASH for a great price and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out!&lt;br /&gt;Applying</li>
            <li> I think the damage to those follicles is too great for my lower lash line to recover.</li>
            <li> Additionally, being diligent about applying both serums and seeing the progress of my lashes is a great incentive to focus my efforts on nurturing that area.</li>
            <li> Great product....informed my sister to try it.</li>
            <li> I know that that one works great.</li>

            <li> Great customer service, looking forward to see the result.</li>
            <li> Even the makers of EMBELLASH because I know you have a great product.</li>

            <li> Concerning customer support, I am RAVING about how good it is.</li>
            <li> Good customer service and good product.</li>
            <li> It does take a good 4 to 6 weeks to notice results</li>
            <li> if a company cares about animals they sure care more about humans and I am positively impressed with the gel.</li>

            <li> I so happy to find a product like this to work and not cost you a fortion :) I can&#x27;t wait for a month to see the difference .</li>
            <li> Price was great and it&#x27;s a 4 month supply:)</li>
            <li> If you are looking for longer, thicker lashes and/or eyebrows, you&#x27;ll love EmbelLASH from Protege!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I will buy more when this tube runs out!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> it also made my lashes notably longer to boot!  </li>
            <li> Love this product and it works!  </li>
            <li> but they are better!</li>
            <li> Now, 2 months later...her eyebrows somehow look better than they did before she started losing her hair!  </li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> but if it&#x27;s getting thicker I&#x27;m sure it will grow as well!</li>
            <li> This is amazing.</li>
            <li> Been using it for around 4 weeks now and already seen amazing results.</li>
            <li> But for me it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing eye lash serum.</li>
            <li> Amazing results after three weeks.</li>
            <li> As someone that has seen AMAZING results from Careprost/Latisse, you will NOT get that from this product.</li>
            <li> it is really precise and great for applying for lashes</li>
            <li> This product works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> Simply amazing.</li>
            <li> It is amazing.</li>
            <li> I started using this product and the results is it amazing.</li>
            <li> This kind of customer service cannot be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The five stars were given because I honestly felt like I have fuller lashes after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that it was all in one - brush was no separate.  </li>
            <li> Company delivered on time and in nice presentation.</li>
            <li> Best of all, it REALLY DID WORK.</li>
            <li> It says to apply twice a day but it leaves kind of a crust.</li>
            <li> Eyelashes growing faster than before and the lashes are filling in quite nicely.</li>
            <li> product comes with a eyeliner kind of wand to apply so</li>
            <li> have received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased reviews</li>
            <li> I am just so thrilled.</li>
            <li> I have been using for over a week and can honestly tell you I see some growth.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great product!</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased and feel so much more attractive now.</li>
            <li> I replied to Stephanie that in a 2 weeks period there was nothing I could honestly report about my results.</li>
            <li> that was wonderful , and in 3 weeks my eyelashes improved incredible  and last for months,  2 years ago, but they do not sell any more and that is why I change</li>
            <li> All I can do is give an honest opinion on our experience.  </li>
            <li> I am loving the EmbelLASH.</li>
            <li> It was easy and pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Very cool product!</li>
            <li> I can honestly state that I am very happy with its performance thus far</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> but this is the best so far!</li>
            <li> Both lash serums worked okay-ish on their own, but together, they get far more impressive results.    </li>
            <li> So far I am very happy and</li>
            <li> So far great!  </li>
            <li> By far the best customer service EVER.</li>
            <li> So far so good!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of lash enhancement products including Latisse and this is by far the best one yet!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use, and yes it will sting if it gets in your eye, but hey, don&#x27;t put it in your eye and you&#x27;ll be just fine!  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased and a bit relieved that I found something so effective.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;ll ever be the &amp;#34;girl&amp;#34; that gets complimented for her beautiful lashes again but very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat that for great customer service (thanks, Stephanie!).</li>
            <li> Thought it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> I had virtually none and the lashes that were there are very light brown and invisible.</li>
            <li> This says a lot about a good customer service.&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky to receive this product under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
            <li> It worked fine on it&#x27;s own, but combined with an oil-based serum</li>
            <li> Glad it worked for others though</li>
            <li> I love how it makes me feel.</li>
            <li> Time to buy some more.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great product</li>
            <li> I try to put it on every morning and night, but believe me, I forgot many, many times, and even skipped many days consecutively.</li>
            <li> My lashes have always had a sligh curl, but now that my lashes are longer and darker, the curl is much more noticeable.</li>
            <li> Outstanding.</li>
            <li> I should have read more carefully...thought it was mascara.  </li>
            <li> Most of the fullness was gone after using Embellash for three months.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes look so much better.</li>
            <li> I have those thicker, longer and MORE eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Guess I was wishing for more to soon.</li>
            <li> are a magical combination for me.</li>
            <li> Without any serum, I&#x27;d imagine it would be more along the lines of 24 weeks, based on the rate of growth Isaw without a serum.</li>
            <li> I also believe my lashes are stronger and better rooted while using this serum as opposed to when I was using nothing.    </li>
            <li> I have used Latisse and the results were a bit quicker but at more than twice the cost.</li>
            <li> Love the brush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more than satisfied.</li>
            <li> Does seem to keep what you have healthy.</li>
            <li> Rather the top broke off.  </li>
            <li> I can still use it by dipping the brush into the container but the top is cracked off.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product and have seen growth in my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I was looking for another brand that I would get more bang for my buck.</li>
            <li> Really....... if it was so great then why would that happen.</li>
            <li> /&gt;MY EYEBROWS COULD HAVE, IN MY OPINION, USED MORE HAIR.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone looking for longer lashes or just looking to get more fuller lashes.</li>
            <li> but I love that once I reach the results I want, I can quit using it.</li>
            <li> Great seller, shipped fast.</li>
            <li> I used revitalize and it was much better.  </li>
            <li> it takes time, but it really works great product</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s refreshing to know that there are businesses out there that still cater to the people buying their products.</li>
            <li> Rubbing it in with my pinky seems to help, but I feel more like I&#x27;m rubbing it off, not in, and that may be delaying my treatment results.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely LOVE that you can see through the tube so you can tell when you need to order more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> satisfied and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> and I will keep using it to keep a healthy growth of my lashes.</li>
            <li> You can feel safe trying their products.</li>
            <li> I do recommend it for those whom have the patience to work with the product for a month or so as it truly works its&#x27; magic over time.</li>
            <li> Hope continued use will bring better results.</li>
            <li> In my case there was more fullness than lash lengthening</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m incredibly impressed with the companies follow-up and follow through to ensure that you fully understand how to properly use the product and are satisfied with the product and service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> love curling and putting mascara on my lashes now.</li>
            <li> I was concerned, but within a couple of weeks the top ones caught up.</li>
            <li> in fact they seem shorter and more sparse.</li>
            <li> stars is the outstanding company philsophy and customer service.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I notice it more in the brow area.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Maybe even some before and after photos. :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Customer service with Prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute; Beauty is top notch.  </li>
            <li> , I have a lot more serum to use.</li>
            <li> My lower lashes are thicker and the uppers are longer and feel more fluttery.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that Protégé products do not contain any animal products and does not test their products on animals.  </li>
            <li> Three weeks in and already seeing improvements:)</li>
            <li> I love this product...</li>
            <li> I will give it more time and see if I cannot give a better review</li>
            <li> I used this product faithfully for 4-months and the only thing that got longer was th  nose of the liar who said that this product was  the  best thing since sliced-white bread.</li>
            <li> I GLAD</li>
            <li> I guess I am hoping something will magically happen that hasn&#x27;t happened already.</li>
            <li> sure</li>
            <li> and overall the results have been incredible!!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way that anyone could love this product.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying the Eyelash Enhancer by Protégé.</li>
            <li> I had so many more lashes.</li>
            <li> but I believe it will take weeks more of using the product before I can decide if it&#x27;s a 5 star product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m satisfied with this item.</li>
            <li> :) I have not been using this product for the 5 weeks it says it takes</li>
            <li> works as well as the top drugstore brand.</li>
            <li> I WAS MORE THEN PLEASED.  </li>
            <li> Today most of my lashes measure 9mm and</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE  </li>
            <li> Most Sincerely,  Dana</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, and here&#x27;s hoping!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I did purchase this</li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> and it just keeps getting better and better or should I say hairier and hairier.</li>
            <li> I like it better than Olash.</li>
            <li> I used the product once a day until I was sure my eyes and lids were used to the product.</li>
            <li> But mostly thicker.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waited to post this review in hopes that I&#x27;d have better news to report.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad others have seen better results and appreciate that they offer a guarantee.  </li>
            <li> I also see quite a difference in my lashes, both top and bottom.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li> I feel the product needs more time, it does say &#x27;5 weeks&#x27; for results</li>
            <li> When I run out of this bottle I will order another to give it more time.</li>
            <li> The stuff that requires a prescription better</li>
            <li> Need more time, but I&#x27;m hopeful.</li>
            <li> We want to make sure everything is still going well regarding your experience with Protégé</li>
            <li> Try different products or go with the best and spend lots.</li>
            <li> I would like it better if once a day was recommended</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I decided to take a chance on this.</li>
            <li> I have tried many lash serums...</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> They seem to value that you are 100% satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use Embellash, hoping to get greater results over time.</li>
            <li> I love that this product is a family based business.  </li>
            <li> I use it day and night and follow the instructions, I feel confident that is why it is working for me.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I followed the instructions of applying the serum twice a day to both the top and bottom of my lash lines.</li>
            <li> The customer service is also top notch.</li>
            <li> I thought the growth would have been greater than it is</li>
            <li> so I will probably order one more time</li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> far... I loved the packaging!</li>
            <li> I was excited when I found out I was going to get the opportunity to test this product in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> However, my top lash lines are filling nicely - I&#x27;d say about 30% of what a full lash line would be.</li>
            <li> Works great but this particular product burns some what unlike Grandelash</li>
            <li> look pretty good too.</li>
            <li> I have seen significant results!</li>
            <li> The product is easy to apply and I cannot wait to see the results after more use.  </li>
            <li> The brush is tiny and perfect for lining your make up free lash line morning and night.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other brands of eyelash enhancers over the years, but this products has shown the best results.  </li>
            <li> The product itself feels very cool when you apply so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with the results I&#x27;ve seen so far.</li>
            <li> I get it, but I prefer that the bag fit the tube most snugly...</li>
            <li> I am so happy (and frankly surprised) to see that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> I enjoy putting on the mascara now, as I have more ample lashes to coat.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So far a great product.</li>
            <li> This product has been great so far.  </li>
            <li> More over this is cruelty free and made in USA</li>
            <li> Great stuff so far .</li>
            <li> I love that this is Made in the USA and cruelty free.</li>
            <li> This product has not made a noticeable difference on my eyelash length, but I have seen my lashes becoming thicker and softer.</li>
            <li> Although I loved having thicker longer lashes, who wants eyes all red/blue &amp; swollen?  </li>
            <li> The lash results for the prescription serum seem very impressive in reviews I&#x27;ve seen, but one of the side effects of bimatoprost (the active ingredient in the prescription serum) is fat atrophy - meaning, the fat cells under the skin around your eyes begin to degrade, and can cause a permanent, sunken undereye appearance over time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;EmbelLash is extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Applies easily and leaves no residue&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This serum is easy to apply, just use the wand to apply on your lash line and eyebrows twice a day.</li>
            <li> I wrote that they could easily check my Amazon file and see that my product was still in \\&quot;transit.\\</li>
            <li> and it absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> Good product, decent price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be able to swipe the brush in the right area to get it out of the tube!</li>
            <li> So far, an amazing product!</li>
            <li> pretty amazing</li>
            <li> Besides that it works fast and effectively, I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Lashes and brows are much more full and noticeable.</li>
            <li> I am going to keep using this product and will post another review in three more weeks as I understand it takes time to get the full effect.  </li>
            <li> The applicator brush is very easy to use and just the right size.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t irritate even my own sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So relax, close your eyes, fan them a bit to hasten the drying time, and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> Can use brush it comes with or a fine liner brush, I&#x27;ve had no irritation.</li>
            <li> I deliberately waited the full six weeks before giving a review because I wanted it to be accurate and truthful</li>
            <li> but this works fine</li>
            <li> Embellash does help move things along more quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Embellash for over 3 weeks and see a tremendous difference!</li>
            <li> which is a huge thing for</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a about a month now and see a HUGE difference.  </li>
            <li> The smell of the serum is light and organic.</li>
            <li> Protege Beauty is cruelty free and the customer service is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel so comfortable about that on the tip of my eyelids.</li>
            <li> It has lengthen my lashes as well as filled out my lashes.</li>
            <li> I think it is a great product for the price, especially compared to the others out there.</li>
            <li> the area has filled in.  </li>
            <li> Overall, a happy camper.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t complain if they get longer and thicker, but I am happy with the current results.  </li>
            <li> I can actually say that I have longer and fuller eye lashes that look great with a coat of mascara.  </li>
            <li> Within the first week or two I swear my eyelashes, top &amp; bottom, as well as my eyebrows started looking thicker &amp; more full.  </li>
            <li> I have a quite light complexion and need all the color I can get.</li>
            <li> And its important to nourish them.</li>
            <li> and it applies smoothly.</li>
            <li> , if you have already started seeing results, and took before/after pictures, please send them to us and you will be entered into our weekly draw for a free product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had been losing a lot of eyelashes because of a cheap eyelash adhesive.</li>
            <li> I used it night and day and applied no mascara to give it a real chance to work on its own.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> While, I can&#x27;t comment on the results yet, so far, so good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Thanks for such a great product!</li>
            <li> fast delivery , product does not irritate eyes at all..would like to see more response ..will give more time</li>
            <li> Giving the seller 5 stars for amazingly fast shipment!!!</li>
            <li> It REALLY WORKS!!!</li>
            <li> They all work wonders for my skin, so when I was offered the opportunity to evaluate Protege EmbelLASH, I was super excited to write about my experience first hand and give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> They checked on me to be sure that I received my product first and later to see if I was happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> great product very gentle and natural...</li>
            <li> None except the price, and I am so happy to have full brows back, I will not complain&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> My lashes are growing, this super easy to apply product does what it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, dries quickly, and non-stinging.</li>
            <li> Lashes continue to look good; longer, but not in a major way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see my lashes grow</li>
            <li> so when I was given the opportunity to purchase these at a reduced cost to test for quality, I was excited.</li>
            <li> I have used the product on the lower lashes, but that hasn&#x27;t produced significant change, like it has on the uppers.   </li>
            <li> This product has not worked for me but the reason I am giving it 4 stars is because it has worked so well on so many other women and nicely too!</li>
            <li> i choose this product for its ingredients  effectiveness and gentleness - so far i am very pleased.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m excited to see some regrowth ...</li>
            <li> I was getting no results from Obagie, which costs a lot more, and this is really working!</li>
            <li> I have saved the 5 lashes that have fallen from my eyes and can see significant length.  </li>
            <li> Have not noticed any significant change.</li>
            <li> I can say that it performs noticeably better than the other over the counter serums I&#x27;ve tried, and it&#x27;s definitely more effective than no serum at all.</li>
            <li> It has a light orange-brownish color going on, but goes on clear, so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> I apply it at night after my face is clean and again in the morning after showering and cleaning my face.  </li>
            <li> I love that the ingredients are more natural</li>
            <li> I have tried several products and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> They immediately apologized and issued a full refund.</li>
            <li> I have full brow hari to the end on both sides and its getting fuller and darker  each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I approached this product with some trepidation since I wasn&#x27;t sure if a product could really enhance my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased...time for more.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> All opinions stated, whether self-purchased or provided for review, are completely those of my own.</li>
            <li> If you get a bit in your eyes, no stinging, but just a rather warmish sensation in the area (never painful).  </li>
            <li> My eyebrows now are completely full.</li>
            <li> Personally, I thing EmbelLash is a good place to start on your journey of discovering what works for you.</li>
            <li> I wish I could get a full refund of my money including my shipping and handling.</li>
            <li> cause the price is not bad at all.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows have filled in at the 2 thinning spots on my right brow.  </li>
            <li> I am really happy with the results and I haven&#x27;t even used half of my original bottle yet.</li>
            <li> Glad to have found a new productthat does what it says!</li>
            <li> To be honest, I didn&#x27;t really expect much.</li>
            <li> - IT HAS HELPED ME TREMENDOUSLY.</li>
            <li> and I had to quickly put water on it</li>
            <li> &quot;  I think it&#x27;s just starting so it will be interesting to see how they look in a couple more weeks.</li>
            <li> However, it works quick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lovely to have them back:)</li>
            <li> Finally, I thought I&#x27;m going to try the EmbelLash, with the great reviews and extremely reasonable price...</li>
            <li> I purchased this product mainly for my eyebrows to see if they would grow out some more and was hesitant to use it on my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll still give it some more time, but I kinda don&#x27;t have high expectations anymore.</li>
            <li> The company follows up with your satisfaction with the product multiple times which is very refreshing this day and age.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed new growth like how it did to my lashes, but this product was more geared towards eyelash growth</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t respond right away because I knew from experience that lash enhancers can take weeks, and sometimes months to show their full promise.  </li>
            <li> Someone said they experienced a tingling to slight stinging on the lash line.</li>
            <li> More importantly, I am seeing some hair growth on my eyebrows on the bare spots from over-plucking.  </li>
            <li> #34;enhancement serums&amp;#34; on google and found various sources that led me to this wonderful product that I&#x27;m so thankful to stumble</li>
            <li> I always wanted long lovely eyelashes and eyebrows, but never could be able to achieve them.  </li>
            <li> My original plan was to get a prescription for Latisse, but I thought I would see what an over the counter solution would do for me first.</li>
            <li> As a consumer, I appreciate that Protege Beauty is interactive with its customers, and obviously care about their well-being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using EmbeLash for about 7 weeks, and want you to know that I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this product!  </li>
            <li> This product really works!!  </li>
            <li> and I will be back for more!</li>
            <li> I used it exactly as directed, twice a day, for a month, and saw a significant increase in my lash length and volume.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 5 weeks now and have seen significant regrowth of my very over-plucked eyebrows!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sure if this would work and was super worried because I have extremely sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> I also appreciate the fact that Embellash is far more affordable.</li>
            <li> I figured it was worth a shot based on the reviews.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s worth it ladies.</li>
            <li> love the fact that the ingredients are mostly natural.  </li>
            <li> The lenght has taken longer but it&#x27;s from my own personal way of using it once a day and missed days.</li>
            <li> I feel that the product was worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the try for the price.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I think it is worth a try and easier to apply than vitamin E.</li>
            <li> Getting old has so many drawbacks and losing eye lashes is one of them.</li>
            <li> After 5 days use I can&#x27;t give a review since success will be measured by lash growth.</li>
            <li> It has alot of natural ingredients and does not make your eyes burn or sting like most do.  </li>
            <li> I would say with a 95% success rate.  </li>
            <li> My lashes did grow, but there was not a substantial change, and now the product has stopped working, and my lashes (on top of thinning and falling out) are going back to their original size.</li>
            <li> I will keep using which is better than most other eye lash products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> So as you can see,  I only review when I&#x27;m either extremely disappointed...or extremely impressed.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and works exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> applied the product every night before bed and every morning right before work.</li>
            <li> I began using this right after I received it, about 3 weeks ago.</li>
            <li> i apply once in the morning and put my mascara right over it</li>
            <li> The price is also right.</li>
            <li> I think the 14-16 week mark is when I will be able to claim full lash lines with Embellash, after starting from basically nothing.</li>
            <li> Well, after the fifth week, I was surprised and pleased to see that it really does work!  </li>
            <li> First of all, their customer service is stellar!</li>
            <li> Surely, my eye lashes grew a little but no thickness or larger amount of eye lashes occurred which had greatly upset me.</li>
            <li> It seems to be doing OK in keeping my lashes long and full.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using the product for about a week, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> taking mascara off with a soft makeup remover towelette, I noticed lashes so easily on the towel.</li>
            <li> This cerum works how it is intended to do, it made my eyelashes grow on bold spots from long wear of extension lashes and grows more lashes.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I think the price is very reasonable</li>
            <li> I so very much wanted this product to do the trick for me.</li>
            <li> I have had success with other products and thought the price would be a nice savings</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t avidly put it on</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> When I first got this product I thought that it was working</li>
            <li> When I first started using Embellash, I did feel the stinging sensation</li>
            <li> After the first week, I no longer felt that sensation.    </li>
            <li> When I used Embellash alone, which I did for the first 3 weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d experienced all my life - I&#x27;m not sure how much the serums play a part in this.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I made sure to put it into my daily routine.</li>
            <li> Figured why not.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been exactly 4 weeks</li>
            <li> Seems to work; first time I&#x27;ve tried this stuff.</li>
            <li> I really do believe that this product is worth a try.</li>
            <li> However, in the first 3 weeks, there were no changes.</li>
            <li> I used it for 5 weeks and for the first 4 weeks, nothing seemed to be happening.  </li>
            <li> It is my first time buying a product to help with the growth of my lashes</li>
            <li> After about 2 weeks my lashes have grown more healthy-looking and are definitely longer.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> i saw results after the first 2 weeks - I would put another star on this</li>
            <li> At first after 2 weeks of using this I thought I had an imporvement in length (lashes), but I think it was just a placebo effect, cause</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be interested to see if my lashes &#x27;cycle&#x27; in length with EmbelLash as they did with the prescription enhancer.  </li>
            <li> Been using it consistently every morning and before bed for about 2 months.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to just use CONSISTENTLY.</li>
            <li> I have followed the directions exactly as stated and have not noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li> First day i</li>
            <li> There are many products similar to this one, but at a higher cost than Embellash.  </li>
            <li> This is the first product of this type that doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.  </li>
            <li> My gosh, this stuff really works!  </li>
            <li> For some reason I lost many of the eyelashes in the middle of my lids.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this five star because of the customer service communication and also because it nourished and seemed to condition my eyebrows, I can&#x27;t give it a five star on growth because I wasn&#x27;t consistent on application</li>
            <li> I used EmbelLash twice a day foe the first two weeks and started seein results.  </li>
            <li> This is not my first type of product that I have tried for my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case as I follow the directions exactly.</li>
            <li> This is the first product like this that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I like to use it first thing in the morning and at night.</li>
            <li> it would be very greedy of me, is to see them get darker!</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was an illusion, but undeniably, my lashes are longer and fuller.</li>
            <li> I did not see much of a difference in my eyebrows, but my lashes are visibly longer and thicker!</li>
            <li> Maybe they will start to really grow!  </li>
            <li> Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While I am experiencing growth which is wonderful, my lashes are very thin, but after loosing most of my lashes earlier this summer after attempting to remove lash extensions, I am thankful for the growth that I am seeing.  </li>
            <li> AND I can see new hair growth (baby lashes that are on their way to full length).</li>
            <li> If I overdo it and apply too much, it crusts up, but that helps me make sure I am only using as much as needed, so no complaints there!</li>
            <li> I have appreciated and enjoyed the personal touch of the company contacting me to address some concerns I had....</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my lashes that are positive.</li>
            <li> Please for anyone that is looking for positive results, please buy today.</li>
            <li> I have already bought another bottle to have ready when my first one runs out.  </li>
            <li> My lashes have always been long, but I noticed that I probably grew twice as many as I had</li>
            <li> The company itself is very responsive, and helpful for anyone interested in this product.</li>
            <li> I had used Latise in the past and loved the results but it took 3 months to get the results I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> This seems to be working as I said, I apply every am and pm and yes my lashes are longer.. not dramatic and is taking awhile.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after seeing all the fantastic reviews, but now i&#x27;m pretty certain that the owners of this product are simply making all these reviews themselves.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t unbearable, but it was certainly noticeable.</li>
            <li> I took before and after photos without mascara just to show them purely as they are.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using EmbelLash for 5 weeks and my eyelashes are certainly longer and appear fuller.</li>
            <li> VERY easy and accurate to use, with no mess or waste.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with my results so far and can&#x27;t wait to see my results in the next few weeks!</li>
            <li> what did I have to lose, if I can throw $160 in the waste basket, surely I can toss $35!  </li>
            <li> Overall, I think it has been more like a healthy conditioner for my lashes and it has improved their growth , although not super dramatically</li>
            <li> My lashes are SO long and many new lashes grew in as well!</li>
            <li> I did not see a huge difference with this as I did with Careprost (generic of Latisse).</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
            <li> Really WROKING in just 2 wks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so im on  very lo med for it,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Absolutely works for me after about 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li> This stuff dries fast.</li>
            <li> I then gently pat it in using my fingertip.</li>
            <li> AND MY EYEBROWS REALLY HAVE GROWN .</li>
            <li> the coming weeks, I&#x27;ll be looking for how much my lashes fall out and how evenly they grow.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much in the way of results as of yet</li>
            <li> and this seems to be doing the job very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Company is very helpful with advice and product</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are fuller and wearing mascara is now so much</li>
            <li> After 5 weeks I really didn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 14 weeks and am ready to buy one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Length has not yet increased much.  </li>
            <li> I had thought about seeing a doctor to inquire about Latisse, but I really did not want to break the bank</li>
            <li> You really have to be patient with the product.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t see results in 1 week as the makers of this product do say to apply it for a month before you can really see if the product is living up to its name.</li>
            <li> Email hints were greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li> My lashes and eyebrows have really grown and look much fuller and thicker.</li>
            <li> I wish I had taken before and after photos to really help people see the difference, but this stuff really does work.</li>
            <li> I really noticed the change after getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an unusual thing, watching your eyelashes regrow from</li>
            <li> Really worked well on my eyelashes almost immediately.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are really thickening.</li>
            <li> Blank spots have filled in as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really appreciate thr seller sending the email with the tips.</li>
            <li> sooooo much</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t done much for my brows, but I have noticed a growth in my lashes after 5 months of use.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> The applicator is too thing and doesn&#x27;t to absorb the product very well.</li>
            <li> I Believe this product is really going to work</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Ir works but it doesn&#x27;t do all the miracles, my lashes are longer and stronger, but I don&#x27;t see much yet on the volume, been using it for 4 weeks or so</li>
            <li> Growth too fast ...</li>
            <li> I have seen some growth, but not as much as with the Nutralash</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very wnoferful product.</li>
            <li> I may be putting on too much</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone !</li>
            <li> thanks for this product.  </li>
            <li> makes my eyes look fuller and dont need as much mascara</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very think liquid</li>
            <li> Thanks again so much</li>
            <li> Been using it for a couple of months and haven&#x27;t noticed much difference.</li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes and eyebrows are getting much fuller.</li>
            <li> No irritation, fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> I know it will take time to see if it really makes them thicker</li>
            <li> I also really appreciate the fact that the company extended itself to me via email.</li>
            <li> not so much in thickness yet &amp; not a change in eyebrows but</li>
            <li> But waiting to see if it really produces growth.</li>
            <li> We’d really appreciate it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> This eyelash growth serum has to me, really seemed to have been working.</li>
            <li> Not too much as of yet,</li>
            <li> I will absolutely get this again.  </li>
            <li> and it can be very daunting to make a decision on just one.  </li>
            <li> this is a real Scam.</li>
            <li> burns so much</li>
            <li> It really did make my thinned out lashes grow longer</li>
            <li> My lashes were destroyed from lash extensions; after recieving this and using it in the morning before I put my makeup on, and at night when I removed my makeup, after only 2 weeks I could definitely tell that my lashes were longer, fuller, and overall more healthy.</li>
            <li> and if I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
            <li> The good thing about this packaging is that you can visually tell how much product you have left and I&#x27;m sure this would last someone using it two times a day for several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclaimer, I received this product at a heavily discounted price in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> so I was a little worried and cautious when I put it on making sure I did it right</li>
            <li> After reading through multiple reviews of similar products, I was really excited to read the fantastic reviews of &amp;#34;Embel-Lash&amp;#34; and decided to order some for myself.</li>
            <li> My own lashes are not that thin, but I have high hopes for much thicker, more noticeable lashes.....too early to tell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other similar products with good results.  </li>
            <li> the positive side, the Protege product was moisturizing, with no negative side effects.</li>
            <li> brush applicator makes it very easy and simple to apply, especially if you&#x27;ve used liquid eye liners before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it more on my brows due to eye sensitivities.</li>
            <li> within one month they not only had significant growth but as well thickness.  </li>
            <li> I have used two other products and Embellash works and better than advertised.  </li>
            <li> Last week I saw both my very best friend (who lives overseas and I only see 2-3 times a year) and my hairstylist -- both of whom usually notice everything -- and neither one said a word.  </li>
            <li> Other products work much better.</li>
            <li> but they appear thicker as well, which none of the other products were able to achieve.</li>
            <li> As ive gotten older my lashes have really become sparse.  </li>
            <li> One thing that does have me slightly concerned is that I am starting to see a light yellowish line on my top eyelash line since using this product.</li>
            <li> Still too early to see full results, but so far looks encouraging.</li>
            <li> I have looked and tried many other products and this one hands down is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Full brows are back in now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty sensitive)</li>
            <li> It is not strong smelling and goes on very easy.</li>
            <li> but I really believe you have to give the product a little more time than a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing new growth on my eyebrow &amp;#34;wings&amp;#34; that I had over plucked!</li>
            <li> i really do appreciate your customer service, checking in is a new experience for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m even seeing some new growth where I&#x27;ve very sparse or no eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are longer and thicker (took less than 5 weeks, more like 3 -</li>
            <li> The main selling point for me was &#x27;not tested on animals&#x27;</li>
            <li> I mainly wanted it for my brows</li>
            <li> I mainly wanted it for my brows</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes but saw no difference in eyelash thickness.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Highly recommended this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this Growth Serum to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I continue to have high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I got this product because of the high reviews</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I should begin by mentioning that I have used so many different products over the last five years, (too many to list here), that have either done nothing, done very little, lost its effectiveness or caused so much discomfort that I had to discontinue use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it (nearly) twice a day since it arrived 4 weeks ago and was waiting to review until I was 100% certain of the results.</li>
            <li> Have used numerous lash enhancers over the years and this serum definitely keeps lashes strong and long - notice darker hue to my otherwise light lashes, too.  </li>
            <li> So far this product does seem to be working!!</li>
            <li> but i notice that my lashline around my eyes have little bit more definition to it.  </li>
            <li> I think I need a little more time to see how well it works.</li>
            <li> This particular product does not cause redness, itching, stinging or irritation of any kind, (at least, not for me</li>
            <li> However after using LiLash for such a long time and having spectacular results no other products work for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one caveat is that you need to be very careful when applying this, since it&#x27;s all too easy to get it into your eyes and they will sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> concern that I&#x27;d heard about was that enhancements serums cause lashes to grow in straight and wild looking.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much improvement if any with this so far.</li>
            <li> With mascara, my lashes look nearly normal.</li>
            <li> I have used several brands in the past, most recently rapidlash, which costs $50 or more.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a few more lashes have grown in</li>
            <li> I have sparse eyelashes, and I noticed more length and even some thickness within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I always figure you could go the natural route and apply natural oils or mix of vitamins to your lashes, but this is so much easier!</li>
            <li> but after a few days of applying, it got better.  </li>
            <li> , I have noticed new growth in my brows and a little in my eyelashes, but since both are sparse, the most I ask of these products I try, is that it helps me keep what I have</li>
            <li> (Left side is before, right side is after in the photo)</li>
            <li> but luckily doesn&#x27;t for long.</li>
            <li> After about a month of applying in the morning and the evening, I now have seen my brows fill out with the growth of lots of new hairs.</li>
            <li> I started looking for a product that would encourage new growth for THICKER lashes.</li>
            <li> There is a bunch of new growth and the lashes are growing in darker.</li>
            <li> EMbelLASH is easy and literally takes less than a minute.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for such a real product and not just another claim to do product.</li>
            <li> and I have so many little lashes coming in now!  </li>
            <li> That being said, I am also very sensitive to&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable and I noticed a difference within several days.  </li>
            <li> They feel very soft, too.</li>
            <li> My eyes are very sensitive and</li>
            <li> Overall I like this product very much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it consistently for 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I use  Embellash first, applying it to my upper and lower lash lines.</li>
            <li> I just wasn&#x27;t willing to put something that burns so close to my eyes simply for a cosmetic thing.  </li>
            <li> In the past 4 wks my lashes have gotten longer and I don&#x27;t seem to lose as many.</li>
            <li> I purchased this originally for a friend and due to the reviews.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what to rate due to lack of info so mid way seemed appropriate.</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> It does burn when applied at first and actually caused the skin where it was applied to peel</li>
            <li> The first week it left a brown crust on the lids..</li>
            <li> Finally i can have pretty eyes.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try something new I&#x27;ve used others in the past that worked at a minimum.</li>
            <li> My skin is a little on the sensitive side, so I do get some stinging burning when first applying, but that quickly goes away.  </li>
            <li> Okay people, I had really tiny barely visible eyelashes before, but after using this product for only two weeks now, I&#x27;ve seen a  major improvement.</li>
            <li> I guess they&#x27;re a bonus if you need more little string tie bags of this size, which I seem to have a lot of, apparently.</li>
            <li> I have had to buy new glasses because my eyelashes began rubbing against the lenses of my old ones.  </li>
            <li> If you already have full, healthy lashes and aren&#x27;t actually missing any, I imagine the results would be far less visible.</li>
            <li> It is brown with dark tiny granules which might not be a favorite for some, however it has no smell</li>
            <li> considering they were over-plucked when I was pretty young and they&#x27;ve been tiny ever since.</li>
            <li> I use to have gorgeous thick, long lashes.</li>
            <li> The eyelashes that I had left are even longer than before and my new lashes are growing in much faster than I</li>
            <li> Not red as in irritation, but it made all the little veins become very prominent, so much on the bottom lashes that blue veins actually were raised up.  </li>
            <li> Not certain that this product is strong enough to make a difference.  </li>
            <li> Once I combined it with my oil-based serum (which I had previously used on its own for several weeks a while back), the rate of growth sped up noticibly.</li>
            <li> It was usually a tiny spot on one lid that lasted only seconds &amp; was not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, and would recommend it to anyone who has thin, brittle lashes and is looking to make them thick and healthy again!</li>
            <li> When I went back to do a little more research on amazon it is discontinued.</li>
            <li> However, it goes on clear.  </li>
            <li> It took about 4 weeks to see any results, but by week 5 there was a clear difference.  </li>
            <li> This is my least favorite so far for the cost.</li>
            <li> I have trichotillomania, so losing those precious eyebrow hairs is common for me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunatelly I will have to give it one star, since I used up the whole bottle (religiously) but saw no change in my lashes whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> And the results so far: my eyelashes and eye brows look healthier and fuller.</li>
            <li> My advice is to not apply too much product it burns a bit and to apply as close to your lash line as possible, I&#x27;m growing hair on my eyelid, whoops!  </li>
            <li> but overall highly recommend this product and will buy again!</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t seen any real growth with the eyelashes but haven&#x27;t used it regularly because of some eye problems that are being corrected.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 72 year old mother.</li>
            <li> , the evening I received the serum, was the start of my 9 1/2 days so far, of using Embellash.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleasantly surprised at how well this works.  </li>
            <li> they are so straight and short!</li>
            <li> I had very sparce short lashes &amp; now with mascara</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let this scare you if it happens early.  </li>
            <li> It was never a regular thing and happened very rarely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t noticed a change.  </li>
            <li> So far I have used the product 3 times &amp; I&#x27;ve had no burning or any side affects.</li>
            <li> I am noticing thicker and longer lashes, and I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for nearly 3 months and have seen no difference.</li>
            <li> i have no burning or any side effects and ii have sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to so far with this product</li>
            <li> So far seems to b working  </li>
            <li> but I was happily surprised with the volume my lases had after using this.</li>
            <li> I was surprised with the result.</li>
            <li> I used religiously 2x&#x27;s a day and measured them through the whole month.  </li>
            <li> but when I finally reported to them on the 30th of October 2014 ( started October 1st 2014) with my results and questions as to how much longer they might hope to get they were prompt to inform me with the info I requested.  </li>
            <li> but I only did it for 3 weeks straight...</li>
            <li> so patience is vital.</li>
            <li> after I had my radiation therapy my brows and lashes never came back very well,&lt;br /&gt;though</li>
            <li> Over-plucking in my 20&#x27;s left me without much there.</li>
            <li> No results so far, but</li>
            <li> I have tiny lashes that no matter how much mascara I put on I still look as though I have no lashes.</li>
            <li> This has really made a difference in my lashes, they are definitely longer after about 6 weeks of twice a day application.</li>
            <li> think that Latisse is the only lash growth product that really works, but is very&lt;</li>
            <li> Only time will tell, but w their track record w me, I have high hopes!</li>
            <li> Well, my daughter started using the EmbelLash on July 8th, 2014, in about 2 weeks there was a marked improvement in her eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m interested to see how long my lashes get as I continue to use the product.  </li>
            <li> I recently noticed my eyebrows are filling in and not shedding as much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;IT Nourishes, Repairs, Moisturizes and Protects Hair Follicles and Skin Around Eyelashes and Brows with Natural</li>
            <li> The only reason this has four stars instead of five is simply because of the price, but then again, I suppose it is worth it, since it works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Follow up:  A few weeks later.......I am noticing lots more growth, especially in my eyebrows and my eyelashes</li>
            <li> I sincerely wish that I had known about this stuff a few years back.</li>
            <li> but I feel consumers have a right to know the GOOD and BAD.</li>
            <li> Love the fact this bottle lasts 3 months compare to these other brands that only last a month!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ;) I used it primarily for eyebrow growth, since I&#x27;ve always had a hard time growing my eyebrows back in.</li>
            <li> They are still very actively growing, and I expect to have 100% full lashes in another6-8 weeks.</li>
            <li> The bottle was cheaply made and when I untwisted the cap the whole top of the bottle came off:(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have really long lashes but with a little help they are ok.</li>
            <li> Money back guarantee is a plus to try a new product!</li>
            <li> I had worn false lashes daily for a year + and as many of us know, no matter how gentle you are taking them off they take some of your natural ones with it.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> I put it on day and night; if you are going to wear makeup, be sure to let it dry before adding on shadow, liner and mascara (a few minutes should do).  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am very encouraged by the response of my lashes to this product so far and will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> My lashes have really grew long.</li>
            <li> Complete bare spots.</li>
            <li> I normally agonize over perfecting mascara layers and curling, but this morning after I curled my lashes, I actually noticed them BEFORE I even started applying any mascara at all.</li>
            <li> I would say they&#x27;re back to normal again.</li>
            <li> I waited the full 5 weeks plus a few before posting a review because I wanted to see the effects.  </li>
            <li> In the beginning I noticed that It left a crusty residue on my lashes, I emailed customer service and received a quick response back to use less product  because it is very concentrated, I did this and the issue was resolved.</li>
            <li> but I not only saw new growth</li>
            <li> This lash treatment is new for me, and slightly different than the ones I&#x27;ve already tried.  </li>
            <li> A few weeks later my lashes are completely filled in and they are longer than ever.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve put this on my eyebrows as well, but I don&#x27;t notice a major difference.</li>
            <li> I had 1 area that thinned, but nothing major.  </li>
            <li> This tube is also large so it will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Instead of using the stupid eyelash extensions that ripped my lashes out and seemed incredibly unsanitary.</li>
            <li> also like that the tube is clear so I can see where the product is sitting when it gets low.</li>
            <li> I guess because I&#x27;m used to different products being clear.</li>
            <li> I have used the revitalash in the past with quick dramatic results, however... it is loaded with toxic chemicals, so I opted for something more natural.  </li>
            <li> Usually early in the day and again later at night.</li>
            <li> Too early to say if Embellash is working, I have only used it for a week.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are starting to grow but I would like to use the produce up before I give a complete review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I dont&#x27; see big difference with my eye lashes</li>
            <li> I personally would not waste my money on this.</li>
            <li> Yes it does work but there is barely a difference.</li>
            <li> My eye lashes are still barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the liquid is not too thick and glides smoothly every time.</li>
            <li> They are long, thick and healthy.</li>
            <li> I certainly intend to try other products in their skin care line.</li>
            <li> The small brush applicator makes it really easy to get long the lines of the eyelashes.</li>
            <li> The holes are disappearing and there&#x27;s new growth where I haven&#x27;t had any in a long time.  </li>
            <li> It did burn a slight bit when I first started using it but that sensation eventually stopped.</li>
            <li> At first I had a slight reaction on my eyelids when I began using it</li>
            <li> It slightly burned my eyes at first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for three weeks, and can see a definite increase in both length and thickness of my eyelashes - WOW!  </li>
            <li> BUT THEY ALWAYS HAVE BEEN VERY LIGHT AND THIN ESPECIALLY AFTER THE CHEMO.</li>
            <li> i have used other products and noticed a difference much sooner.</li>
            <li> however, it did absolutely NOTHING&amp;#60; It is not that I used it improperly, I have used other lash enhancers that worked...</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the results, my lashes are looking a lot healthier, longer but too dramatic.</li>
            <li> had them professionally arched 15 yrs ago,  keep the shape up my self, as an actress I picked up a few tricks , but this STUFF Really grows the brows BACK&lt;</li>
            <li> This is only my second week using Embellash, I haven&#x27;t notice any change as of yet, but I was asked to give my opinion thus far.</li>
            <li> And I was surprised that this serum actually made my eyebrows grow back in places where I&#x27;ve been wanting it.</li>
            <li> but Im liking it so far :) my lashes seem softer, usually they seem a little coarse.</li>
            <li> When I put it on for the first time my lids swelled a little bit around the lashes.</li>
            <li> it does tingle a little when i first put it on.</li>
            <li> At first it seemed to sting my eyes a bit, but I got used to that after a little while.  </li>
            <li> Barely noticeable results after a couple months of daily use.  </li>
            <li> The directions state the product needs to be used twice a day for at least four weeks to achieve full effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first put it on, the area tingled for a few minutes and then went away.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that if you put it on too heavily you will get flakes that are very unattractive so use a light hand.</li>
            <li> They are not very long</li>
            <li> They came in individual cute little pale blue suede like bags, which are a lot larger than the tube.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 40s and have had long lashes most of my life, but never super thick.  </li>
            <li> and I was already seeing results the first few weeks, but protege told me not possible so soon.</li>
            <li> Do not buy , my first order was dried out and after using for 2 months my (2nd tube) eyebrows fell out!</li>
            <li> After reading  about this product I thought this one would really work for me and that was not true.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this was normal cycling of the hair follicles, but after a while, it didn&#x27;t seem that the other product was working at all.  </li>
            <li> kind of odd in color and smell is not great.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try a different brand than I normally use to see if it worked and it works as well as any of the other eyelash growth products I have bought.  </li>
            <li> If you are a trich sufferer and you are starting with zero or very few lashes, it&#x27;s going to take more than a few weeks to get your lashes back, regardless of what serums you do or don&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> It works a little to increase eyelashes, but not as much as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> They did get a little longer but they are not fuller and it isn&#x27;t really much of a change.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily, and causes a very slight tingling for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> This product has a darker color to it than expected; it will not be clear.  </li>
            <li> At first I had a few longer lashes and some that were not as long</li>
            <li> Oddly, the lower ones came in first and very long and thick, whereas the top ones were thick but not especially long.</li>
            <li> so far my lashes are thicker and a bit longer - I had tried other brands like rapid lash and loreal</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed an absence of the trich \\&quot;itch\\&quot; trigger</li>
            <li> I used a similar product in the past that worked very well.  </li>
            <li> only I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to do so.</li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a long way, so this product is lasting me months using it twice a</li>
            <li> My lashes are long and thick, but not crazy (yet).  </li>
            <li> Also because it&#x27;s that thin you can get it inside the eyes easily during application, so be careful cause it burns quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Not sure it really helps.</li>
            <li> Could not use it long enough to see if it works, started affecting eyes.</li>
            <li> Since this product is for thickening the growth of lashed and brows, and I have not used it long enough for any results to begin to appear, I have based my recommendation solely on ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;Sandra H.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to see if it will improve the growth of my eyebrows and eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve used this long enough to notice length growth</li>
            <li> I apply it once before bed and again in the morning , I havent been using it long enough to get results yet</li>
            <li> I have gotten good at the application before makeup and am no longer disappointed there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it on my lashes a few times, but I can see new lashes coming in and can tell the existing ones are healthier and fall out less frequently when applying mascara or removing my make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I honestly never noticed a difference and that particular bottle was only slightly smaller than this one and it only lasted about a month.</li>
            <li> Crazy how easy it was to become part of my bedtime routine!</li>
            <li> I actually stopped using it in January because my lashes were getting almost too long!</li>
            <li> My outer eyebrows and eyelashes looked thin and I was really self conscious about my experience.</li>
            <li> It has only been a few weeks now, but so far the product is working.</li>
            <li> Initially, my lashes became extremely long, almost absurdly long (my husband told me they were getting &#x27;freaky&#x27;), but after a while they would lose their length and thickness.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have not had much success with this product so far and have been using it for approx 3 weeks now.</li>
            <li> Although I did not use it long, it did not seem to work too well, but I may not have persisted long enough.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first but for the cost it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> It also smells a little funny, but nothing bad, or overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing some results as far as my eyelashes being a little thicker</li>
            <li> I cannot put it on my lower lashes because my eyes are too sensitive and it burns a little.</li>
            <li> (I think plain castor oil would probably work too), results are much more dramatic.    </li>
            <li> made Eyelashes grow TOO LONG...,  </li>
            <li> my lashes now are so long from Biotin,  that they hit the sunglasses when I wear them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so didn&#x27;t use it for long</li>
            <li> but I naturallt have long lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lifelong trichotillomania sufferer that has recently stopped pulling after 29 years.</li>
            <li> Improvements would be minor.    </li>
            <li> If I can see results already, I just know I will have the lashes I&#x27;ve desired for so long in no time.</li>
            <li> Only use a minimal amount on lash line.</li>
            <li> Within weeks as promised they are both fuller &amp; now quite long as well.  </li>
            <li> I received Embellish this week and having used Latisse before I expected it to be similar.  </li>
            <li> i already had curly long lashes but</li>
            <li> I wanted to rave about this product but after using it faithfully for 9 weeks I have seen only minimal results.  </li>
            <li> Several weeks ago I reached out to the customer service person to ask when I could expect to see &amp;#34;optimal results&amp;#34; and she said there is not really an answer to that,</li>
            <li> My lashes have always been long and</li>
            <li> My eyelashes aren&#x27;t long and seem to be falling out.  </li>
            <li> I went back to using my previous product and lashes are starting to grow again.</li>
            <li> I applied the liquid to my eye lashes and left my eyes closed for about one minute so it would dry.</li>
            <li> I did experience slight stinging on 1st to 2nd application but none following.</li>
            <li> I asked this question due to a former review where someone reported they had to trim their lashes as they had gotten so long.  </li>
            <li> It does tingle a very tiny bit when you apply, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any other affects.</li>
            <li> Upon closing my bottle of embellish the other day, some extra serum came out of it.</li>
            <li> I plan to continue using Embellash for a long time!</li>
            <li> Sometimes if I do get a little in my eye by accident it stings just a tiny bit for just a moment but has never caused any redness or eye irritation following that</li>
            <li> Please, try someone other brand, like ReLash by delilah if you&#x27;re looking in the same price range.</li>
            <li> so here is goes: I am amazed at how long my lashes are now!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was sad to see some of my new, long lashes fall out, but I believe that it&#x27;s just the normal eyelash shedding.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a dramatic difference in length, I rarely use mascara anymore.</li>
            <li> You just brush it on the eyelash line and let dry.</li>
            <li> I was scared it would dry my eyelashes out somehow or be sticky</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s brown and leaves a dry crust on your eyelash line.</li>
            <li> because I feel that after a while the particular treatment loses its effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> A slow, but steady progression.</li>
            <li> It shocked me when it shed, because HOLY COW, it&#x27;s SO LONG.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am in love with this product!</li>
            <li> I have now been using this product every single day on both my eye-lashes and my eyebrows for well over a month, and it has not made one bit of difference.</li>
            <li> Eyelids started to turn dark red</li>
            <li> To preface this, spot test on a small patch of your skin before using as your eyes are a sensitive part of your skin</li>
            <li> You really feel you&#x27;re dealing with human beings instead of nameless bureaucrats who are only out to make a profit.</li>
            <li> Not worth my time or thw hassle to try to get my $$ back though.</li>
            <li> loose my money</li>
            <li> I NOW HAVE LONG EYELASHES!!</li>
            <li> I had several issues with my upper lashes also, which is thin and fall off all the time, created loss spaces and uneven lashes which bother me so much.</li>
            <li> It help to make thick eyeborws as well as turn weak eyelashes to strong eyelashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the 2 products together (rather than individually) for the past 3 weeks, and the growth speed increased dramatically.    </li>
            <li> my lashes are noticeably longer and slightly thicker and still noticing sprouting hairs on my upper and lower lids.</li>
            <li> Though I had been on a thyroid hormone replacement prescription supplement for a year and a half, the sparse brow hairs had not grown back in during that time, and so I tried this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs</li>
            <li> My eyelids, closest to the lashes look to be slightly darker; I remember an AD for Latisse, that mentioned that possible effect.  </li>
            <li> I previously had used two tubes of  NutaLuxe Lash MD &amp; although it worked, my eyelids became very red.  </li>
            <li> I have tried MANY types of eyelash growth products only to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the product has a slight scent that I am not very fond of.</li>
            <li> I think this works really well for people who have missing lashes and/or bald spots due to trichotillimania, eyelash curler mishaps, lash extension or eyelash glue \\&quot;incidents,\\&quot; and those who have missing lashes due to chemotherapy.    </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen a difference yet but only using a little over a week.</li>
            <li> Using on my eyebrows too although have only notice a little difference.  </li>
            <li> Occasionally I have felt a little tingly, not a burning.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does tingle a little bit when I apply on my upper and lower lashes.</li>
            <li> I can only tell that my lashes have grown just a &#x27;little&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> But after several months, with no significant growth, I&#x27;m giving up on this product.</li>
            <li> We tried everything, from a product that cost $160...not a very noticeable improvement at all, to castor oil, which seemed to be helping somewhat...but a VERY slow process.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad to say that my bottom lash line looks much the same -</li>
            <li> Ordered two at the low price, but it&#x27;s to late to return the second unopened product.  </li>
            <li> Also I did not like the residue on my lids/ lashes it left when it dried up.  </li>
            <li> I pay careful attention to the roots of my existing lashes.</li>
            <li> (minimal results--</li>
            <li> Just be careful when you are applying it and not to get too eager and put globs on.</li>
            <li> The areas that seemed missing lashes have seemed to grow back.</li>
            <li> With my eyes closed they can reach the lower crease.  </li>
            <li> I am absolutely NOT imagining that my eyelashes are both thicker and longer.  </li>
            <li> It will cause some burning if it gets remotely close to your eyes.</li>
            <li> It makes my eyes water, even when I am careful to not get it in my eye.  </li>
            <li> I am curious to see how it will do after a month or so.</li>
            <li> minimally.</li>
            <li> The outer corners had lashes missing and they are back!  </li>
            <li> I have been using the product for about 4 weeks now, twice a day as directed, missing only two days.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really wanted to start latisse, but honestly am afraid of its side effects, so I went this route due to the all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, before I could tell whether or not it was working, I tried an eye cream (not from this company) and developed an allergic reaction and had to stop using EmbelLash and all other cosmetics near my eyes.</li>
            <li> but it certainly is no miracle product in my experience.</li>
            <li> The outer third of my eyebrows were missing due to my hypothyroidism according to my doctor.</li>
            <li> First No color, second have to apply 2x a day at least, third too difficult to apply, forth can cause irratation.</li>
            <li> Once applied, it takes less than 10 minutes to dry.  </li>
            <li> I have heavy hooded eyes and prior to using this product the skin fell just slightly over the lashes</li>
            <li> EmbelLASH does work for some people, according to the other reviews.</li>
            <li> She says it doesn&#x27;t work as well as other products she&#x27;s tried before.</li>
            <li> Not sure, I&#x27;ve only been using it for a month.</li>
            <li> She used it on her lashes and eyebrows and did not get the results she was reading by these other reviewers.</li>
            <li> It just seemed like one of my eyes had fewer than the other.</li>
            <li> other reviews mentioned on my lashline for a couple of minutes after application.</li>
            <li> I had lost a bunch of eyelashes due to improper removal of lash extensions.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had these problems with other products, so this might be something to consider before purchasing.</li>
            <li> I have achieved with other products were lost during these weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and they said it is the KGF peptide that is making my skin tingle due to it stimulating hair growth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other eyelash enhancements but</li>
            <li> When I looked in the mirror, my wet eyelashes looked like I was wearing mascara!</li>
            <li> I lost all of my eyelashes and eyebrows due to chemo therapy.</li>
            <li> I have been using other eyelash growth products, which have worked, and thought I would try this one, but it didn&#x27;t grow or thicken my lashes at all.  </li>
            <li> Cheaper than the other brands and</li>
            <li> , I lost a lot of my lashes due to an eye disorder</li>
            <li> Eyebrows and eyelashes have thinned markedly due to thyroid problems.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I&#x27;ve had no side effects and no discoloration of my eyelids.</li>
            <li> Normally they are pathetically thin and with after using this for a while they are fuller.</li>
            <li> Unlike other products my lashes have not fallen out.</li>
            <li> I lost my hair and lashes due to chemotherapy, so, that may have something to do with them not growing like some of the other remarks.  </li>
            <li> My daughter started losing her eyebrows due to hormonal issues.  </li>
            <li> EmbelLash is in the &amp;#34;I&#x27;m extremely impressed&amp;#34; catagory.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I don&#x27;t even know if it works like Babe Lash does because it burns the skin on my eyelids too much to use it!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products</li>
            <li> I was unable to use the product for my eyelashes, as I experienced a painful burning sensation.</li>
            <li> It worked a little but not ad much as I expected</li>
            <li> but the aforementioned are negative side effects of some enhancers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sorry -- I really wanted this product to work &amp; it was not inexpensive, but it did nothing except irritate my eyes to the point I had to stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;No results on lashes or brows, either.</li>
            <li> NOT worth it ladies.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is not worth your money or time.</li>
            <li> my dark circles lightened up, must be because of the nutrients in this product.</li>
            <li> In the past couple years I&#x27;ve noticed they aren&#x27;t as long and wanted to try a serum....</li>
            <li> Is it too late to get my money back???</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any irritation with the product, and I contribute that to the natural, organic ingredients used in making this product.</li>
            <li> Since then, I have received a few emails to see if everything was going as expected.</li>
            <li> Fingers crossed that Latisse will come down in cost at some point.</li>
            <li> but it settled down within a week.  </li>
            <li> Not pretty!</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I hoped for!  </li>
            <li> Oddly, one of my eyes has longer lashes than the other!  </li>
            <li> Not wanting to waste it, I applied it to my hair line, where I have a bit of thinning due to psoriasis on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I had noticed my once fairly thick eyelashes seems less thick and less long, especially on the bottom.</li>
            <li> well I noticed less fall out</li>
            <li> joke, I lost half outter eye brows</li>
            <li> delivered quickly, no irritation with use</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s have the size for 2 less than the fill size.</li>
            <li> but for some reason I get the feeling that my lashes are getting ever so slightly</li>
            <li> At times, there is a slight tingle, but it goes away</li>
            <li> My lashes are thicker and fuller, and I haven&#x27;t used half the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Slightly stings upon application.  </li>
            <li> half the lashes I had when I started using it.</li>
            <li> Protege is less costly with no RX needed.</li>
            <li> I was using previously.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a slight improvement in my lashes.</li>
            <li> I notice that my lashes have been stronger and thicker after 3 week, less fall off.</li>
            <li> This was a difficult area to grow hair and believe me I have tried several different products.  </li>
            <li> I tried this product because it was less costly than Babe Lash.  </li>
            <li> I have been faithful in using it and have noticed a slight increase in lash length.  </li>
            <li> My hair grew back, but my lashes and brows are very short and brows are very thin.  </li>
            <li> I began using this product in June of 2014 and as of today (July), I have noticed that the area on my lid that had lost a small patch of lashes has slowly grown back</li>
            <li> I have little to NO bottom lashes, but now I can even put mascara on my bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> And a note on the burning: If you tend to get to close to the corners of the eye you can get a little seepage and that gets the burning sensation.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 5 weeks and am seeing a difference in the fullness and a little bit of length already.  </li>
            <li> I applied morning and night for a little over a week or so, I know it states that it takes 5 weeks for there to be results</li>
            <li> In comparison to other eyelash enhancement serums out in the market today, Embellash has proven to be a reliable product that doesn&#x27;t contain harsh ingredients, and by the power of almighty, it does work!</li>
            <li> I do notice a little bit of irritation around the eye after use.  </li>
            <li> Was a little leary trying it for this reason, but don&#x27;t let that deter</li>
            <li> 5 weeks into it, my lashes are a little longer, but no thicker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using EmbelLash for over two months and can tell little difference in my lashes and brows.  </li>
            <li> In order to give it the benefit of my doubt, I will continue to use it a little longer.  </li>
            <li> Lasehes a little slower, but thicker.  </li>
            <li> I got a little in my eyes.</li>
            <li> then I forgot and got lazy due to the eyes watering.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working a little.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box I was a little thrown off by the color</li>
            <li> It may work, but it did burn a little.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are maybe a little longer but no thicker.  </li>
            <li> The little hairs I do pluck when I shape are growing in faster than without the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this rather than Grande Lash because I thought I would save  little</li>
            <li> Has not added lashes or made them fuller, but definitely a little longer.</li>
            <li> It does burn a little when applied to close</li>
            <li> I have noticed a bit of difference and my eyebrows have grown a little after using the product for about 7 weeks or so now.  </li>
            <li> My cart considerations ranged from very expensive to very reasonably priced items.  </li>
            <li> plus I&#x27;ve noticed is that my eyelids and delicate skin below the eye seems to be lighter and less irritated than when I was using the other</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to matter how careful I am with my application, there are always white clumps and flakes in my lashes which makes applying eyeliner and mascara difficult.</li>
            <li> They sent a few emails to let know how to use the product and to see how it was working.</li>
            <li> I have been using it as recommended without missing a day.  </li>
            <li> After a few times of trying it went away.</li>
            <li> I started with short and thin lashes, now at about five weeks</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now and have noticed a difference in thickness and length already.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not stuck using it everyday of the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> It was waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any changes as promised after few weeks.</li>
            <li> They are pathetically short and thin</li>
            <li> I use this EVERYDAY...</li>
            <li> I thought after a few weeks that would stop, but it hasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> So that I wasn&#x27;t imagining things, I tracked an area on my 10X magnification make-up mirror, where the lashes were thin, on my left eye....</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t even notice it&#x27;s on because it absorbs within a few minutes of applying.</li>
            <li> It took a few weeks, but mine curl as they always have.</li>
            <li> I had been using a prescription lash enhancer for a few years, with variable results.  </li>
            <li> I have thin short eye lashes.</li>
            <li> It does not have a harsh chemical scent.</li>
            <li> But my eyes are burning immediately after application for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now as directed.</li>
            <li> I have not worn mascara except for a few days.</li>
            <li> but so far I am not impressed.  </li>
            <li> few seconds after I applied it IT STARTED TO BURN my eyes.</li>
            <li> I wear makeup everyday.</li>
            <li> ( remember that I did not use twice a day for a few weeks ) and my lashes are</li>
            <li> I have been using EMBELLASH for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for just a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I have always had thin short eyelashes and have seen improvements already!!</li>
            <li> Money wasted</li>
            <li> but after a few weeks they all evened out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and have noticed some improvement.</li>
            <li> I have thin lashes and not only are they longer</li>
            <li> a while I had to start wearing false lashes simply because mine were no longer there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge makeup wearer</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are longer, thicker and fuller in less than a month!</li>
            <li> I have seen eyelash growth serums advertised and really wanted to try them out, but they are so expensive!</li>
            <li> This is my first time ever writing a review, but I am frustrated with buying products based on there fantastic reviews to find out the product is crap, so I feel compelled, and will start with this product.</li>
            <li> I have used at least 6 other products to get my eyelashes to grow like they did while using LiLash</li>
            <li> Will update if I see further dramatic changes.  </li>
            <li> Being a skeptic but desiring longer lashes without having to have them falsely applied I tried this product knowing there was a money back promise if not pleased.  </li>
            <li> I like that Embellash and other OTC serums don&#x27;t carry this side effect, so even though the results may not be quite as dramatic, I appreciate not having to risk a hollow eye area for lash growth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty shocked.</li>
            <li> My lashes were so small and just a few that I would put baby powder on a wand then mascara.</li>
            <li> I typically had thick lashes and -when</li>
            <li> It can be slightly irritating and takes a bit to dry.  </li>
            <li> If there were any changes it been very very little.</li>
            <li> Used faithfully for six weeks and saw very little results.</li>
            <li> Very little results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a lot of progress in the past 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I will have to do an updated review in a few weeks!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll update another few weeks after I&#x27;ve given it some time to work.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hopeful!</li>
            <li> Not sure if they increase length or thickness</li>
            <li> For months, I was troubled, looking for ways to help grow back my lashes.</li>
            <li> Not sure that I have noticed a difference in my eyelashes again,</li>
            <li> People now think I have on fake lashes, and I have to tell them that I only have on mascara.</li>
            <li> We are a small family business and we want your experience with Protégé to exceed your expectations.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t  need it for that, but I had very few hsaris on outter 1/3 brows now after 3 2ks</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical and concerned because I have sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> They also hurt A LOT when they get in your eyes (and hard to wash out;; yes, it was quite a scene).</li>
            <li> I am post-menopausal with low-thyroid, does that make a difference, hard to say?</li>
            <li> it kinda turn hard and chunky on my eyelids.</li>
            <li> Where I applied the serum, my psoriasis seems to have at least temporarily cleared up.</li>
            <li> It took at least 2 weeks before any noticeable results.</li>
            <li> No nice metal tube hiding the product.</li>
            <li> I used fake lashes for several months and it made my lashes thin and torn out.</li>
            <li> This product deserves a negative 10-star review ...</li>
            <li> They have grown at least 2 if not 3 mm.  </li>
            <li> product is working.... slowly.  </li>
            <li> A real waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> and I do have a thick brow</li>
            <li> I mean A LOT) of research on lash growth serums and came across this one.</li>
            <li> but I thought that might mean it wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I was highly skeptical on this product but Latisse is a little out of my price range</li>
            <li> I had about EmbelLash is that when I put it on in the morning and let it dry, it leaves a slight whitish film at the base of my lashes.  </li>
            <li> It might have made my lashes grow, but it stung my eyes too bad to use regularly.</li>
            <li> Used it everyday just a recommended and have seen dramatic improvement!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all sucks!</li>
            <li> and now they are fairly thin with patches of no hair.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that my eyelashes were falling out and my lashes were getting thin again.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> Not happy</li>
            <li> I have never experienced a company like this before</li>
            <li> Too irritating to my eyes</li>
            <li> I have been using it for approximately 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> i used castor oil on my lashes at nite to help them grow and that showed some imporvement but they were still thin - when i added embelilash my lashes increased and they have not fallen out-</li>
            <li> After purchasing this from Protege Beauty, I received an email from Stephanie in Customer Service asking me how my experience with EmbelLash was going, and offering helpful tips, and reassurance that Protege stood behind their 100% customer satisfaction guarantee.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> I saw noticeable thinning that appeared to be getting worse-</li>
            <li> They are thin and you can&#x27;t even notice that I do have lower lashes.</li>
            <li> With age, my lashes have started to thin out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it exclusively on my eyes for my age deficient lashes and, after a month, now have longer fuller lashes.</li>
            <li> I chose this one because I&#x27;m scared of some of the others after hearing that if you discontinue use your lashes fall out and you&#x27;re way worse off</li>
            <li> I noticed it did work, but once I stopped applying it, my lashes continued to thin.</li>
            <li> My friends think I have false eyelashes on..</li>
            <li> False advertisement.</li>
            <li> I have very pale lashes, so the results aren&#x27;t very dramatic until I put on mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I notice a slight stinging sometimes, but nothing too bad, and probably the result of me getting it in my eyes</li>
            <li> was addicted to falsies for a few months and bad technicians had caused a lot of hair loss in my eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> although I have not seen any dramatic results, I have had no adverse side affects either</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m having the dramatic results some have posted</li>
            <li> I will admit, I was skeptical that anything could help these poor lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I hate to wear false eyelashes, as it is too messy for me to do and never get it correct.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a little disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Was infact a little disappointed because it used to burn my eyelids</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the return period expires, otherwise I would return.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use an enhancer, my lashes are just sad.</li>
            <li> Weird, but awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so sorry.</li>
            <li> but i have to say i am not impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with claims of product.</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> The worse thing about this product occurs two to three weeks after discontinuing - when eyelashes fall out like crazy.  </li>
            <li> This product failed to produce any results.</li>
            <li> The unfortunate part about the Careprost/Latisse is it is not permanent.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t wear mascara anymore because I looked silly when I put it on.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference unfortunately</li>
            <li> One thing I don&#x27;t like is that it leaves a sort of crust on the lash line which is difficult to get off with out pulling out lashes.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product did not work for me at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s to expensive for me to always have to use.</li>
            <li> I have an unfortunate habit of pulling my lashes out, but since I started using Embellash</li>
            <li> The application brush is very thin for eyebrows</li>
            <li> Lashes seem to be thicker as I have very thin lashes.</li>
            <li> I have very thin eyelashes.</li>
            <li> But they are very thin.  </li>
            <li> so it makes it easier to mentally accept that you&#x27;re not applying some nasty doo doo on your eyes.</li>
            <li> they look very dramatic.  </li>
            <li> - that&#x27;s my biggest complaint (I&#x27;m bad to forget stuff like this!)</li>
            <li> I have been afraid to try a liquid lash enhancement since I wear contacts.</li>
            <li> never did my lashes because I was afraid.</li>
            <li> Definitely a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I decided to take a break from it, as it was very expensive and required a visit to the doctor&#x27;s office to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> THIS IS  A BAD PRODUCT,I DON&#x27;T RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> was shocked</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sick because my lashes are shorter now than when I started using LiLash.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me.  :-(  </li>
            <li> My husband often asked me if I washed my eyes in the morning :(</li>
            <li> Did not work for me :(</li>
            <li> so I have nothing to compare it to, but I did expect something from the product. :(</li>
            <li> :((</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Used it for a while, but it didn&#x27;t work. :(  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> This product is HORRIBLE AND DOESN&#x27;T WORK!</li>
            <li> But my experience has been a terrible one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is awful!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Could not use it long enough to see if it works, started affecting eyes.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me. (You&#x27;re probably going &amp;#34;4 stars? What?!&amp;#34;) I used it primarily for eyebrow growth, since I&#x27;ve always had a hard time growing my eyebrows back in. I have trichotillomania, so losing those precious eyebrow hairs is common for me. HOWEVER, I contacted the seller and told them that I did not have results with their product. They immediately apologized and issued a full refund. This kind of customer service cannot be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems that EmbelLASH does work for some people, according to the other reviews. If I were you, I&#x27;d give this product a chance.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen a difference yet but only using a little over a week. Will update in a month</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it consistently for 2 weeks and I already see an improvement in my lashes.</li>
            <li> Have to wait for 5 weeks to see if it works.  I just received this this week.</li>
            <li> Did nothing after trying this for over 2-3 months on both eyelashes and brows.  In fact, my eyelashes seem shorter and thinner!    I have had success with other products and thought the price would be a nice savings but, no results.  Glad it worked for others though so I don&#x27;t want to discourage others, it might work for them.    Also, it does sting a bit when put on my eyelash line.</li>
            <li> Pricey. ..but seems to maybe work. ..</li>
            <li> product is working.... slowly.  I have used the revitalash in the past with quick dramatic results, however... it is loaded with toxic chemicals, so I opted for something more natural.  This seems to be working as I said, I apply every am and pm and yes my lashes are longer.. not dramatic and is taking awhile.</li>
            <li> This product is so good. I love how it makes me feel. It came well packaged and works just as described. Time to buy some more. :) Thanks for the great product</li>
            <li> Conditioned my lashes well I noticed less fall out but I have been using this since the end of January with no growth. Its a shame since the customer service was great. They sent a few emails to let know how to use the product and to see how it was working.</li>
            <li> UNFORTUNATELLY NO RESULTS...CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS VERY NICE ..THEY RETURNED THE MONEY.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me.  :-(  Boo!  Fingers crossed that Latisse will come down in cost at some point.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!  I was on a chemo based medication for skin cancer and lost all my eye lashes and eye brows,  I was so happy when I found  EmbelLASH!!!!  It gave me all the results that were promised!!!  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been plucking my eyebrows for years and now they are fairly thin with patches of no hair.  I read the reviews for this product and decided to try it.  I have been using it twice a day for about 2 months and I am, despite all my doubts, seeing results.  The holes are disappearing and there&#x27;s new growth where I haven&#x27;t had any in a long time.  The application brush is very thin for eyebrows but it&#x27;s designed to be used for eyelashes too so it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading so many great reviews on this. To be honest, I didn&#x27;t really expect much. I just thought this product will make your lashes a bit longer and maybe stronger. However, I got great results!! I used this for 4 months now. I try to put it on every morning and night, but believe me, I forgot many, many times, and even skipped many days consecutively. But I can still see results! My lashes are SO long and many new lashes grew in as well! I have little to NO bottom lashes, but now I can even put mascara on my bottom lashes. I&#x27;m amazed!! What I loved the best was that my lashes are actually more CURLED now. My lashes have always had a sligh curl, but now that my lashes are longer and darker, the curl is much more noticeable. I&#x27;m very happy with this.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve put this on my eyebrows as well, but I don&#x27;t notice a major difference. I haven&#x27;t noticed new growth like how it did to my lashes, but this product was more geared towards eyelash growth anyway.&lt;br /&gt;It was sad to see some of my new, long lashes fall out, but I believe that it&#x27;s just the normal eyelash shedding. It shocked me when it shed, because HOLY COW, it&#x27;s SO LONG.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am in love with this product! I will definitely continue using this and see how it goes.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my mom. She says it doesn&#x27;t work as well as other products she&#x27;s tried before. Bummer.</li>
            <li> Not sure, I&#x27;ve only been using it for a month. It said possible results after 5 weeks. Could be longer.</li>
            <li> Unfortunatelly I will have to give it one star, since I used up the whole bottle (religiously) but saw no change in my lashes whatsoever.  Also I did not like the residue on my lids/ lashes it left when it dried up.  My husband often asked me if I washed my eyes in the morning :(</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing. I used as directed for 4 months with no change.</li>
            <li> Working well to thicken lashes.</li>
            <li> The bottle was cheaply made and when I untwisted the cap the whole top of the bottle came off:(</li>
            <li> Gotta give this time to work!</li>
            <li> Really WROKING in just 2 wks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No joke, I lost half outter eye brows , I wont use this on eye lashes I don&#x27;t  need it for that, but I had very few hsaris on outter 1/3 brows now after 3 2ks I have full brow hari to the end on both sides and its getting fuller and darker  each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got my 1st brown compliment by DR asst, yesterday , she said she wished she had my EYEBROWS!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was shocked I said ME?  ( cause I had no brow tails for years!)  She said yeah they look great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have hypo thyroid issue  so im on  very lo med for it,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I use biotin cause of losing hair like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biotin  made Eyelashes grow TOO LONG...,  my lashes now are so long from Biotin,  that they hit the sunglasses when I wear them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By end of JAN my brows will be as they were in my teens!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Full brows are back in now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had them professionally arched 15 yrs ago,  keep the shape up my self, as an actress I picked up a few tricks , but this STUFF Really grows the brows BACK&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying again  when I run out</li>
            <li> Product does not work at all.</li>
            <li> Outstanding. Absolutely works for me after about 4 weeks.  Edit: Took about 8 weeks for the bottom lashes to be noticeably thicker. I had virtually none and the lashes that were there are very light brown and invisible. Now darker and thicker. A touch longer.    And a note on the burning: If you tend to get to close to the corners of the eye you can get a little seepage and that gets the burning sensation. This stuff dries fast. So relax, close your eyes, fan them a bit to hasten the drying time, and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> I should have read more carefully...thought it was mascara.  Eyelids started to turn dark red so didn&#x27;t use it for long</li>
            <li> My wife bought three packs because she wanted to try something cheaper than what she was using. Most of the fullness was gone after using Embellash for three months. She followed directions and had seen substantial fullness with another product but got sidetracked with this product. She used it on her lashes and eyebrows and did not get the results she was reading by these other reviewers.</li>
            <li> I feel like it works sometimes. I don&#x27;t avidly put it on but I naturallt have long lashes. It just seemed like one of my eyes had fewer than the other. I see differences when I put mascara on so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> Been using it for 3 weeks and have yet to see a difference</li>
            <li> This is amazing. I have the thinnest eyelashes known to man. I wish I would have taken a before and after photo so you could see. My lashes were so small and just a few that I would put baby powder on a wand then mascara. Now, all I have to do is just the mascara. This stuff really works! My eyelashes look so much better. I have those thicker, longer and MORE eyelashes. When you put this on, it doesn&#x27;t even feel like you have anything on, and is not colored so for those that don&#x27;t wear the mascara, you have no worries. I highly recommend this product. Thank You!!!</li>
            <li> When I first got this product I thought that it was working and I was already seeing results the first few weeks, but protege told me not possible so soon. Guess I was wishing for more to soon. Since then till today I see no change from that time.  I started in October using daily twice a day morning and night.  If there were any changes it been very very little. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few weeks, and my eyelash really got longer and thicker, I think I would buy another one in future.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t working as promised, I have used others ans felt it is good to change every now and then. Man did this burn when applied!</li>
            <li> I did not like the look of my eye lashes and eyebrows. My outer eyebrows and eyelashes looked thin and I was really self conscious about my experience. I have tried different mascaras and eyebrow liners that promised luscious eyelashes and definition, but it wasn&#x27;t helping the core issue of thinning hair. I have seen eyelash growth serums advertised and really wanted to try them out, but they are so expensive! I was offered to try EmbelLASH for a great price and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out!&lt;br /&gt;Applying EMbelLASH is easy and literally takes less than a minute. I apply it twice a day: once in the morning and once in the evening.The smell of the serum is light and organic. The small brush applicator makes it really easy to get long the lines of the eyelashes. I have not experienced any irritation with the product, and I contribute that to the natural, organic ingredients used in making this product. And the results so far: my eyelashes and eye brows look healthier and fuller. I can definitely see an improvement in the experience and will continue using this product to obtain maximum results.  If you are looking for longer, thicker lashes and/or eyebrows, you&#x27;ll love EmbelLASH from Protege!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lifelong trichotillomania sufferer that has recently stopped pulling after 29 years. My original plan was to get a prescription for Latisse, but I thought I would see what an over the counter solution would do for me first. I&#x27;ve tried almost all of them, but have found that Embellash in combination with an oil-based serum are a magical combination for me. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of progress in the past 6 weeks. I&#x27;ve only been using the 2 products together (rather than individually) for the past 3 weeks, and the growth speed increased dramatically.    APPLICATION:  I use Embellash twice a day in conjunction with my oil-based lash serum. I use  Embellash first, applying it to my upper and lower lash lines. I pay careful attention to the roots of my existing lashes. I then gently pat it in using my fingertip. I wait about 5 minutes and then apply my oil-based lash serum using the same method.    When I first started using Embellash, I did feel the stinging sensation other reviews mentioned on my lashline for a couple of minutes after application. It wasn&#x27;t unbearable, but it was certainly noticeable. After the first week, I no longer felt that sensation.    RESULTS:  When I used Embellash alone, which I did for the first 3 weeks I owned it, I saw growth improvements in fewer than 2 weeks. Once I combined it with my oil-based serum (which I had previously used on its own for several weeks a while back), the rate of growth sped up noticibly. Both lash serums worked okay-ish on their own, but together, they get far more impressive results.    I started with almost no lashes - I could probably count the number of lashes on each eye on one hand. I&#x27;m sad to say that my bottom lash line looks much the same - I think the damage to those follicles is too great for my lower lash line to recover. However, my top lash lines are filling nicely - I&#x27;d say about 30% of what a full lash line would be. They are still very actively growing, and I expect to have 100% full lashes in another6-8 weeks. With mascara, my lashes look nearly normal. Fellow trich sufferers will understand what an accomplishment this is.    Additionally, being diligent about applying both serums and seeing the progress of my lashes is a great incentive to focus my efforts on nurturing that area. I&#x27;ve also noticed an absence of the trich \\&quot;itch\\&quot; trigger I&#x27;d experienced all my life - I&#x27;m not sure how much the serums play a part in this. I&#x27;ve also made some dietary and supplement changes that could be contributing factors.    WHO THIS WORKS FOR:  I think this works really well for people who have missing lashes and/or bald spots due to trichotillimania, eyelash curler mishaps, lash extension or eyelash glue \\&quot;incidents,\\&quot; and those who have missing lashes due to chemotherapy.    WHO THIS MAY NOT WORK FOR:  If you already have full, healthy lashes and aren&#x27;t actually missing any, I imagine the results would be far less visible. Improvements would be minor.    OVERALL:  I haven&#x27;t yet tried the prescription lash serum option, so I can&#x27;t compare Embellash results against it. I can say that it performs noticeably better than the other over the counter serums I&#x27;ve tried, and it&#x27;s definitely more effective than no serum at all. It worked fine on it&#x27;s own, but combined with an oil-based serum (I think plain castor oil would probably work too), results are much more dramatic.    If you are a trich sufferer and you are starting with zero or very few lashes, it&#x27;s going to take more than a few weeks to get your lashes back, regardless of what serums you do or don&#x27;t use. Be patient. Embellash will help your lashes grow in faster, but it&#x27;s not fairy dust - time is still a required part of the regrowth process. Embellash does help move things along more quickly. I think the 14-16 week mark is when I will be able to claim full lash lines with Embellash, after starting from basically nothing. Without any serum, I&#x27;d imagine it would be more along the lines of 24 weeks, based on the rate of growth Isaw without a serum. I also believe my lashes are stronger and better rooted while using this serum as opposed to when I was using nothing.    I&#x27;m still undecided about whether or not to even go the prescription route. The lash results for the prescription serum seem very impressive in reviews I&#x27;ve seen, but one of the side effects of bimatoprost (the active ingredient in the prescription serum) is fat atrophy - meaning, the fat cells under the skin around your eyes begin to degrade, and can cause a permanent, sunken undereye appearance over time. I like that Embellash and other OTC serums don&#x27;t carry this side effect, so even though the results may not be quite as dramatic, I appreciate not having to risk a hollow eye area for lash growth. I also appreciate the fact that Embellash is far more affordable.</li>
            <li> I had lost a bunch of eyelashes due to improper removal of lash extensions. I&#x27;ve been using this product twice a day for 3 weeks now. The eyelashes that I had left are even longer than before and my new lashes are growing in much faster than I expected!&lt;br /&gt;This product definitely met my expectations. I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Worked for me. Saw results in 4  weeks. I have used Latisse and the results were a bit quicker but at more than twice the cost. Love the brush.  I&#x27;m more than satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is excellent.  I got eyelash extensions and when I got them taken off I noticed that my lashes were a lot thinner.  I did some research and found this product.  Excellent! My lashes are longer and thicker (took less than 5 weeks, more like 3 - but every individual is different).  I have been using it as recommended without missing a day.  So far, so good.  I will keep using it.  My lashes look really good.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eyelash growth for about 2 weeks now and i notice a difference. I notice my lashes being a lot fuller . I have been putting this serum on twice a day, once in the day and once a night.</li>
            <li> Great product....informed my sister to try it.</li>
            <li> Product does not seem to encourage eyelash growth. Does seem to keep what you have healthy. I have not noticed any thickening of my eyelashes. I have been using this for 2 months twice a day as requested.</li>
            <li> Since this product is for thickening the growth of lashed and brows, and I have not used it long enough for any results to begin to appear, I have based my recommendation solely on ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;Sandra H.</li>
            <li> Do not buy , my first order was dried out and after using for 2 months my (2nd tube) eyebrows fell out!</li>
            <li> This product has no color to apply and isn&#x27;t supposed to. It seems to be doing OK in keeping my lashes long and full.  HOwever the container broke the second time I nscrewed the cap - which didn&#x27;t unscrew.  Rather the top broke off.  I can still use it by dipping the brush into the container but the top is cracked off.</li>
            <li> I just purchased my 2nd tube of EMBELLASH. I have noticed a dramatic difference in length, I rarely use mascara anymore. I curl my lashes and go! In the beginning I noticed that It left a crusty residue on my lashes, I emailed customer service and received a quick response back to use less product  because it is very concentrated, I did this and the issue was resolved. Protege Beauty is cruelty free and the customer service is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the product has a slight scent that I am not very fond of. That being said, I am also very sensitive to&lt;br /&gt;scents. Great product!! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product and have seen growth in my eyelashes. It does not irritate my skin or cause any adverse side affects. The price is good too!  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> When I put it on for the first time my lids swelled a little bit around the lashes. After a few times of trying it went away. I have been using another product for awhile. I was looking for another brand that I would get more bang for my buck. I thought this was it till about into the 3rd and 4th I noticed that my eyelashes were falling out and my lashes were getting thin again. When I went back to do a little more research on amazon it is discontinued. Really....... if it was so great then why would that happen. Then I noticed that the same company now has it under a different name. Sounds fishy to me. I&#x27;ll just stay with what I used before. I know that that one works great.</li>
            <li> This product works GREAT!  I have seen an improvement in the volume of my eyelashes!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Wanted to try a different brand than I normally use to see if it worked and it works as well as any of the other eyelash growth products I have bought.  My skin is a little on the sensitive side, so I do get some stinging burning when first applying, but that quickly goes away.  I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product nightly since Feb15 but have not seen a bit result. Unfortunately, the return period expires, otherwise I would return. Also, it irritates so much that I had to close my eyes for a few minutes. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> delivered quickly, no irritation with use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used numerous eyelash growth serums, and this didn&#x27;t quite work for me (minimal results--if any). To add onto that, Nor did it for my sister. I bought two, one for each of us;; but neither one of us were seeing results, so we bought different ones immediately (we had a wedding event coming up)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and to mention, I&#x27;ve noticed that it has a tingling sensation when applied. I don&#x27;t feel so comfortable about that on the tip of my eyelids. They also hurt A LOT when they get in your eyes (and hard to wash out;; yes, it was quite a scene). I haven&#x27;t had these problems with other products, so this might be something to consider before purchasing.</li>
            <li> It works a little to increase eyelashes, but not as much as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> I WAS BORN A BABY BLONDE AND WIITHOUT EYEBROWS I OR SHOULD I SAY WITHOUT COLOR ON MY BLONDE EYEBROW OR HAVING THEM DIED IT IS LIKE THEY ARE NOT THER PLUS YOUR EYES ARE FRAMED BY YOUR EYEBROWS. I BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE I HAD CHEMO AND LOST HAIR ON MY HEAD WHICH I FORGOT TO SAY IN MY SHAMPOO REVIEW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY HEAD IS LIKE A HUMAN CHIA PET. THOSE POTTERY THINGS THAT SPROUNT OUT GRASS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY EYEBROWS COULD HAVE, IN MY OPINION, USED MORE HAIR. BUT THEY ALWAYS HAVE BEEN VERY LIGHT AND THIN ESPECIALLY AFTER THE CHEMO. IT WORKS.  I PUT IT ON AT NIGHT WITH ALL THE LAYERS OF FACE CREAMS I HAVE AND MY EYEBROWS REALLY HAVE GROWN . GREAT PROUCT - IT HAS HELPED ME TREMENDOUSLY.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews for anything, but this stuff works! the results for me were not immediate. I started with short and thin lashes, now at about five weeks my lashes are noticeably longer and slightly thicker and still noticing sprouting hairs on my upper and lower lids. I used this stuff religiously twice a day. My advice is to not apply too much product it burns a bit and to apply as close to your lash line as possible, I&#x27;m growing hair on my eyelid, whoops!  but overall highly recommend this product and will buy again!</li>
            <li> Does not work.  Not at all.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Been using it for around 4 weeks now and already seen amazing results. It has lengthen my lashes as well as filled out my lashes. I recommend this product to anyone looking for longer lashes or just looking to get more fuller lashes. This is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I had worn false lashes daily for a year + and as many of us know, no matter how gentle you are taking them off they take some of your natural ones with it.&lt;br /&gt;After a while I had to start wearing false lashes simply because mine were no longer there. It sucked. I couldn&#x27;t even curl them they were so short and sparse.&lt;br /&gt;I did a lot (and I mean A LOT) of research on lash growth serums and came across this one. I figured it was worth a shot based on the reviews. I made sure to put it into my daily routine. Every morning before I did my makeup and at night when I took it off. On days I didn&#x27;t wear makeup I put it on three times. Figured why not.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been exactly 4 weeks and I can&#x27;t believe the changes I see. It might not look like a lot to some. But for me it&#x27;s amazing. I took before and after photos without mascara just to show them purely as they are. You can see they are starting to fill in and grow again. I can&#x27;t wait to see what another 4 weeks does.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth it ladies. Trust me. I thought I was doomed to always having crappy eyelashes. This stuff is impressive and I&#x27;m glad I tried it.  (Left side is before, right side is after in the photo)</li>
            <li> Hoping this does something, though havent seen any difference. Also thought this was a bit like mascara along with serum.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a couple of weeks.  lashes look good!  So far, so good!</li>
            <li> I saw a difference in 5 days!  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> So far this product does seem to be working!! Lashes seem to be thicker as I have very thin lashes. They also seem to be healthier!!!</li>
            <li> This is my first time ever writing a review, but I am frustrated with buying products based on there fantastic reviews to find out the product is crap, so I feel compelled, and will start with this product. I have been using this for about 5-6 months, and my lashes have started thinning and falling out. My lashes did grow, but there was not a substantial change, and now the product has stopped working, and my lashes (on top of thinning and falling out) are going back to their original size.</li>
            <li> I have very thin eyelashes. They are not very long and I try to layer mascara to bring them out but end up with spider like lashes. How embarrasing! A friend of mine suggested an eyelash growth serum so I started looking into it. I couldn&#x27;t figure out which ones were good and which ones weren&#x27;t so when I recieved the opportunity to recieve this eyelash growth enhancer for my review, I jumped on it! I have been using this for a few weeks now and have noticed a difference in thickness and length already. I know it&#x27;s made to use over a period of time but I love that once I reach the results I want, I can quit using it. I&#x27;m not stuck using it everyday of the rest of my life. It&#x27;s very simple to use too. You just brush it on the eyelash line and let dry. I use it at night after cleansing my face and I know I will not be applying makeup for some time. I am very impressed with my results so far and can&#x27;t wait to see my results in the next few weeks! If I can see results already, I just know I will have the lashes I&#x27;ve desired for so long in no time. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I NOW HAVE LONG EYELASHES!!</li>
            <li> This one burns on my eyes compare to GrandeLASH MD Eyelash Enhancer 2ml. It was waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wondered how these eyelash enhancers work so I decided to try this. I&#x27;ve used it for about a week now so I haven&#x27;t seen them starting to grow yet. I know it takes about 5 weeks. I must say it definitely feels moisturizing as it mentions which I like. I was scared it would dry my eyelashes out somehow or be sticky but I like the consistency of it. This tube is also large so it will last me a long time. I know it says 4 months but I think it will last even longer. I think it is a great product for the price, especially compared to the others out there. I&#x27;m excited to see my lashes grow and I&#x27;m considering using it for my brows as well. I will have to do an updated review in a few weeks! Great seller, shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Okay people, I had really tiny barely visible eyelashes before, but after using this product for only two weeks now, I&#x27;ve seen a  major improvement. I&#x27;m extremely happy with the results I&#x27;ve seen so far. I apply the product twice a day. Usually early in the day and again later at night. It has a light orange-brownish color going on, but goes on clear, so that&#x27;s nice. It also smells a little funny, but nothing bad, or overwhelming. The only reason this has four stars instead of five is simply because of the price, but then again, I suppose it is worth it, since it works. Would purchase again if need be.</li>
            <li> Have used this product longer than 5 weeks but am seeing results.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes but saw no difference in eyelash thickness. I did see hair growing above lash line presumably from where I misapplied the serum but saw no noticeable additional eyelashes at the eyelash line itself</li>
            <li> Seems to work; first time I&#x27;ve tried this stuff.</li>
            <li> First No color, second have to apply 2x a day at least, third too difficult to apply, forth can cause irratation. Not happy.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work at all. I used it for about two months before giving up. Leaves a white residue that I just got tire of peeling off my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money! I used this product twice a day till the tube was gone. It did not help my lashes or brows.</li>
            <li> Not what I hoped but I&#x27;m still using it hoping for longer/fuller lashes!</li>
            <li> Non very good.  It hasn&#x27;t done anything.  I used revitalize and it was much better.  Not happy</li>
            <li> No difference in lashes. Thought it was too good to be true. Used  for a month, results are suppose to be in 5 weeks use, but you would think some difference would show by now.</li>
            <li> THIS IS  A BAD PRODUCT,I DON&#x27;T RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t seen any real growth with the eyelashes but haven&#x27;t used it regularly because of some eye problems that are being corrected. I hope it helps my lashes grow and thicken,  they said there was a pricedrop of $2 so i purchased another embellash and it&#x27;s have the size for 2 less than the fill size. that was a bit of a scam.</li>
            <li> i ordered 2 tubes..used them daily. saw no change. kind of odd in color and smell is not great.</li>
            <li> This did not work for me. I have tried several products sequentially. Not until about 3 weeks into the use of this product did I realize that the gains in growth of my eyelashes I have achieved with other products were lost during these weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I returned to a proven product and my lashes are growing again,&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, the Protege product was moisturizing, with no negative side effects.</li>
            <li> no problems with item or shipping</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any changes as promised after few weeks. I&#x27;ll have to return the product.</li>
            <li> I have been cursed with my family&#x27;s weenie eyelashes. They are pathetically short and thin so when I was given the opportunity to purchase these at a reduced cost to test for quality, I was excited. I will admit, I was skeptical that anything could help these poor lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for about a week now and I am starting to see some density growth of my eyelashes. Not a lot yet, but some. The directions state the product needs to be used twice a day for at least four weeks to achieve full effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EmbelLash is extremely easy to use. The brush is tiny and perfect for lining your make up free lash line morning and night. There is no chemical odor to the product and it does not burn or irritate my eyes. I wear contacts as well and they are not affected. That&#x27;s all there is to it. After it dries in the morning, I apply my eyeliner over it. Overall, I am very encouraged by the response of my lashes to this product so far and will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> It might have made my lashes grow, but it stung my eyes too bad to use regularly. Also, there appears to be a blank spot in my eyebrow now...hmmm</li>
            <li> seems to work as directed</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use an enhancer, my lashes are just sad. Short, sparse and uneven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this enhancer 1 week ago. I have used several brands in the past, most recently rapidlash, which costs $50 or more. I got these on promo for $17. I bought 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far... I loved the packaging! They came in individual cute little pale blue suede like bags, which are a lot larger than the tube. I guess they&#x27;re a bonus if you need more little string tie bags of this size, which I seem to have a lot of, apparently. I get it, but I prefer that the bag fit the tube most snugly...just details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that the tube is clear so I can see where the product is sitting when it gets low. I&#x27;ll be able to swipe the brush in the right area to get it out of the tube! Revolutionary! If I overdo it and apply too much, it crusts up, but that helps me make sure I am only using as much as needed, so no complaints there! There is no burning and it disappears under my makeup nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the coming weeks, I&#x27;ll be looking for how much my lashes fall out and how evenly they grow. Of course length and thickness but the aforementioned are negative side effects of some enhancers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update another few weeks after I&#x27;ve given it some time to work.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hopeful!</li>
            <li> The main selling point for me was &#x27;not tested on animals&#x27; if a company cares about animals they sure care more about humans and I am positively impressed with the gel. Very effective and I have fuller lashes in a short time of random use :)</li>
            <li> I just got this product  based on the review  so I expect the best,but never know  i been using Latisse  for a while  my eyelashes  are longer but hopefully this workfor me, and i don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of money  on Latisse</li>
            <li> Used twice a day and have definitely seen the results.  Lashes are both longer and thicker.  I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> I only have been using the product for a week. I have yet to see good results. Hope this product will deliver. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> it takes time, but it really works great product</li>
            <li> Did not work for me :(</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 5 weeks and am seeing a difference in the fullness and a little bit of length already.  I will purchase this product again because I see that it is working.  I apply it at night after my face is clean and again in the morning after showering and cleaning my face.  I do still use mascara over because I can&#x27;t go without it but regardless it working!!</li>
            <li> To preface this, spot test on a small patch of your skin before using as your eyes are a sensitive part of your skin and you do not want to irritate that area. I applied morning and night for a little over a week or so, I know it states that it takes 5 weeks for there to be results but for some reason I get the feeling that my lashes are getting ever so slightly fuller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush applicator makes it very easy and simple to apply, especially if you&#x27;ve used liquid eye liners before. When I first put it on, the area tingled for a few minutes and then went away. I e-mailed their customer support and they said it is the KGF peptide that is making my skin tingle due to it stimulating hair growth. Just be careful when you are applying it and not to get too eager and put globs on. I accidentally got some in my eye and I had to quickly put water on it so it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eye any further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried using a different lash growth serum before but I honestly never noticed a difference and that particular bottle was only slightly smaller than this one and it only lasted about a month. The good thing about this packaging is that you can visually tell how much product you have left and I&#x27;m sure this would last someone using it two times a day for several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The five stars were given because I honestly felt like I have fuller lashes after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer, I received this product at a heavily discounted price in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I use this EVERYDAY...TWICE a day. I haven&#x27;t seen much in the way of results as of yet however I am hoping too. I do not want to have to fill my latesse RX which is $240</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several weeks now. First of all, their customer service is stellar! I have never experienced a company like this before, it&#x27;s refreshing to know that there are businesses out there that still cater to the people buying their products. I should begin by mentioning that I have used so many different products over the last five years, (too many to list here), that have either done nothing, done very little, lost its effectiveness or caused so much discomfort that I had to discontinue use. This particular product does not cause redness, itching, stinging or irritation of any kind, (at least, not for me and I&#x27;m pretty sensitive), I have noticed new growth in my brows and a little in my eyelashes, but since both are sparse, the most I ask of these products I try, is that it helps me keep what I have and this seems to be doing the job very well. The four star review is for personal reasons because of the twice daily application. It doesn&#x27;t seem to matter how careful I am with my application, there are always white clumps and flakes in my lashes which makes applying eyeliner and mascara difficult. I am still fiddling with a solution to that. Rubbing it in with my pinky seems to help, but I feel more like I&#x27;m rubbing it off, not in, and that may be delaying my treatment results. I really do believe that this product is worth a try. I think the price is very reasonable and I absolutely LOVE that you can see through the tube so you can tell when you need to order more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow up:  A few weeks later.......I am noticing lots more growth, especially in my eyebrows and my eyelashes look pretty good too. My review is now a five star review and I have purchased another bottle with the coupon given to me by the company, (bonus!). I am really happy with the results and I haven&#x27;t even used half of my original bottle yet. I have gotten good at the application before makeup and am no longer disappointed there. Glad to have found a new productthat does what it says!</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that it was all in one - brush was no separate.  I started using it daily - mind you, only for 3 weeks, because we headed off for a 2 week vacation and did not apply, as I should have.  However, in the first 3 weeks, there were no changes.</li>
            <li> I approached this product with some trepidation since I wasn&#x27;t sure if a product could really enhance my eyelashes.  I used it for 5 weeks and for the first 4 weeks, nothing seemed to be happening.  Well, after the fifth week, I was surprised and pleased to see that it really does work!  I have very pale lashes, so the results aren&#x27;t very dramatic until I put on mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that the ingredients are mostly natural.  Some of the key ingredients in this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;distilled water&lt;br /&gt;soy isoflavones&lt;br /&gt;saw palmetto&lt;br /&gt;coconut endosperm&lt;br /&gt;horse chestnut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only used it on my eyelashes and didn&#x27;t bother with my eyebrows.  I also only used it at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one caveat is that you need to be very careful when applying this, since it&#x27;s all too easy to get it into your eyes and they will sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may just want to take a chance with this product if you want to see fuller lashes.</li>
            <li> After using several weeks I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my Lashes. It is my first time buying a product to help with the growth of my lashes so I have nothing to compare it to, but I did expect something from the product. :(</li>
            <li> It stings. I thought after a few weeks that would stop, but it hasn&#x27;t.  It also hasn&#x27;t worked. I&#x27;ve used other eyelash enhancements but this it like using vinegar on my eyes. It does nothing but cause pain.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to start latisse, but honestly am afraid of its side effects, so I went this route due to the all natural ingredients.  It feels soothing on my lashes and does not bother my contact lenses, which is awesome.  Not sure if they increase length or thickness but I will see soon.  Company delivered on time and in nice presentation.</li>
            <li> Started seeing immediate results.  Easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Company is very helpful with advice and product information.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I only received this at the beginning of the week, have been applying twice a day, and just noticed a difference already after only 5 days! I normally agonize over perfecting mascara layers and curling, but this morning after I curled my lashes, I actually noticed them BEFORE I even started applying any mascara at all. It does tingle a very tiny bit when you apply, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any other affects. So far, an amazing product!</li>
            <li> I only put it on 2-3 times because it burned my eyes.  I just wasn&#x27;t willing to put something that burns so close to my eyes simply for a cosmetic thing.  Plus you have to keep doing it.  Mascara is easier.</li>
            <li> I received the product in a timely manner. I have only had it a week, so cannot address it&#x27;s effectiveness. It goes on easily, and causes a very slight tingling for a few seconds. No fuss, no muss. I look forward to seeing the results!</li>
            <li> It has been about a month since I started using this product and I have seen great results! My eyelashes are fuller and wearing mascara is now so much fun!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> This cerum works how it is intended to do, it made my eyelashes grow on bold spots from long wear of extension lashes and grows more lashes. The lenght has taken longer but it&#x27;s from my own personal way of using it once a day and missed days. All in all it works perfectly great how it should be and I will keep using it to keep a healthy growth of my lashes. Oh I found that my lashes are stronger too. 👏👏👏</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this would work but after 3 months, I did not see any changes. I was persistent and patient with no results. Every morning, I would wake up with eye crusts and red eyes. It also stung my eyes upon application. I guess it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone.I don&#x27;t see the reason of this item being listed as &amp;#34;on sale&amp;#34; if its the same price every day??</li>
            <li> I thought this was not going to work. After 5 weeks I really didn&#x27;t see a difference. By week 7, I am sold. I have been using it for 14 weeks and am ready to buy one for my daughter. Ladies this does work..I promise. My friends think I have false eyelashes on..Thank you EmbelLASH!</li>
            <li> Too irritating to my eyes I will not rebuy this product. I have noticed a few more lashes have grown in but it certainly is no miracle product in my experience.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the description, guarantee, and great reviews. I tried it for a couple of weeks. It was easy and pleasant to use. Unfortunately, before I could tell whether or not it was working, I tried an eye cream (not from this company) and developed an allergic reaction and had to stop using EmbelLash and all other cosmetics near my eyes. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is that I don&#x27;t have any personal experience of this product achieving thicker, longer lashes. After contacting the company, I received a prompt e-mail response and the promise of a refund, followed by confirmation from Amazon. I don&#x27;t even have to return the product! You can&#x27;t beat that for great customer service (thanks, Stephanie!). You really feel you&#x27;re dealing with human beings instead of nameless bureaucrats who are only out to make a profit. Kudos to Protege Beauty for standing by their guarantee. You can feel safe trying their products.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 72 year old mother. Since using Embellash, her eyelashes are noticably longer and maybe a bit thicker. It has only been a few weeks now, but so far the product is working. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> The outer third of my eyebrows were missing due to my hypothyroidism according to my doctor. Though I had been on a thyroid hormone replacement prescription supplement for a year and a half, the sparse brow hairs had not grown back in during that time, and so I tried this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs&lt;br /&gt;-- Applies easily and leaves no residue&lt;br /&gt;-- No noxious or medicinal smell or any discomfort like tingling or anything&lt;br /&gt;-- Best of all, it REALLY DID WORK. After about a month of applying in the morning and the evening, I now have seen my brows fill out with the growth of lots of new hairs. I am so happy (and frankly surprised) to see that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs&lt;br /&gt;-- None except the price, and I am so happy to have full brows back, I will not complain&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you also have thinning scalp hair like me, I have found that Amazon also carries a great shampoo for that. &amp;#34;VITAMINS Hair Loss Shampoo&amp;#34; with biotin and Procapil by Nourish Beaute, I will post a review of that product there.</li>
            <li> June 21st, the evening I received the serum, was the start of my 9 1/2 days so far, of using Embellash.  It is so easy to use.  So far, I have minimal growth of my eyebrows. I had 1 area that thinned, but nothing major.  My eyelashes.....can&#x27;t quite tell yet. My own lashes are not that thin, but I have high hopes for much thicker, more noticeable lashes.....too early to tell. Will update.  UPDATE 7/16/14:  --------------  My 26th day of twice a day use.....it will be the 4th week on Saturday, 7/19.  My lashes have gotten thicker...rather than just 1 row of lashes, I have 2 rows. Length has not yet increased much.  So that I wasn&#x27;t imagining things, I tracked an area on my 10X magnification make-up mirror, where the lashes were thin, on my left eye....the area has filled in.  My eyebrows have filled in at the 2 thinning spots on my right brow.  I enjoy putting on the mascara now, as I have more ample lashes to coat.  A slow, but steady progression. Overall, a happy camper.  Will update if I see further dramatic changes.  UPDATE 08/01/14  ---------------  August 2nd will be 6 weeks.  Lashes continue to look good; longer, but not in a major way. I think lash thickness is my biggest results.  I have used the product on the lower lashes, but that hasn&#x27;t produced significant change, like it has on the uppers.   My eyelids, closest to the lashes look to be slightly darker; I remember an AD for Latisse, that mentioned that possible effect.  The eyebrows are set....problem solved.  I am almost out of serum....may last another 2-3 weeks.  Very pleased...time for more.</li>
            <li> It burns your skin and crusts over when it dries.  I also did not notice any type of improvement as I kept using it for two weeks through the burning and crusting.</li>
            <li> In comparison to other eyelash enhancement serums out in the market today, Embellash has proven to be a reliable product that doesn&#x27;t contain harsh ingredients, and by the power of almighty, it does work! I began using this product in June of 2014 and as of today (July), I have noticed that the area on my lid that had lost a small patch of lashes has slowly grown back and I could not be happier! For months, I was troubled, looking for ways to help grow back my lashes. I had thought about seeing a doctor to inquire about Latisse, but I really did not want to break the bank so I researched &amp;#34;enhancement serums&amp;#34; on google and found various sources that led me to this wonderful product that I&#x27;m so thankful to stumble upon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the product every night before bed and every morning right before work. Not only do I apply it on the follicle areas of my lids, I also apply it onto my brows over the areas that suffered from over-tweezing throughout the years. You really have to be patient with the product. You can&#x27;t see results in 1 week as the makers of this product do say to apply it for a month before you can really see if the product is living up to its name. Application wise it&#x27;s very easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t irritate even my own sensitive skin. At times, there is a slight tingle, but it goes away and you don&#x27;t even notice it&#x27;s on because it absorbs within a few minutes of applying. The consistency of the liquid is not too thick and glides smoothly every time. It is brown with dark tiny granules which might not be a favorite for some, however it has no smell so it makes it easier to mentally accept that you&#x27;re not applying some nasty doo doo on your eyes. All I have to say is that it worked for me and has not caused any harmful effects. I do recommend it for those whom have the patience to work with the product for a month or so as it truly works its&#x27; magic over time. You won&#x27;t break the bank with Embellash!</li>
            <li> Upon closing my bottle of embellish the other day, some extra serum came out of it. Not wanting to waste it, I applied it to my hair line, where I have a bit of thinning due to psoriasis on my scalp. Where I applied the serum, my psoriasis seems to have at least temporarily cleared up. Weird, but awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the product for maybe 2 weeks now and can already see re-growth in my eyebrows.. pretty amazing considering they were over-plucked when I was pretty young and they&#x27;ve been tiny ever since. I&#x27;ve only used it on my lashes a few times, but I can see new lashes coming in and can tell the existing ones are healthier and fall out less frequently when applying mascara or removing my make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far a great product.</li>
            <li> It took at least 2 weeks before any noticeable results. Email hints were greatly appreciated. Hope continued use will bring better results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Embellash for over 3 weeks and see a tremendous difference! I will continue using this product! It&#x27;s one of the only products I&#x27;ve found that actually does what it says it will do. Great job!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Embellash for about 6 weeks.  I didn&#x27;t want to give it a review until I gave it time to work.  After 6 weeks, my lashes are fuller and longer.  In my case there was more fullness than lash lengthening but I am very thrilled with the results.  I was very skeptical at first but for the cost it was worth a try.  It&#x27;s very easy to use, and yes it will sting if it gets in your eye, but hey, don&#x27;t put it in your eye and you&#x27;ll be just fine!  I have already bought another bottle to have ready when my first one runs out.  I plan to continue using Embellash for a long time!</li>
            <li> I have only been using the product for about a week, but so far so good. It&#x27;s easy to apply and dries quickly. Since i have brown (African American) skin it makes my eyelids look crusty after drying so i don&#x27;t put it on in the morning, I put it on when i get home from work and before going to bed some hours later. I&#x27;m incredibly impressed with the companies follow-up and follow through to ensure that you fully understand how to properly use the product and are satisfied with the product and service. I certainly intend to try other products in their skin care line. Good job Protege Beauty!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/6/14&lt;br /&gt;Update*** This stuff is fantastic!!! My lashes and eyebrows have really grown and look much fuller and thicker. I have no idea what is in this stuff, but it is a miracle. I sincerely wish that I had known about this stuff a few years back. Instead of using the stupid eyelash extensions that ripped my lashes out and seemed incredibly unsanitary. This has restored the lashes that have fallen out and have made my lashes and eyebrows thicker in a way that i didn&#x27;t expect they could ever be repaired. I wish I had taken before and after photos to really help people see the difference, but this stuff really does work. I&#x27;m in love. Can you all make a shampoo and conditioner ???</li>
            <li> Too early to say if Embellash is working, I have only used it for a week.  I do notice a little bit of irritation around the eye after use.  Looking forward to seeing results.</li>
            <li> I was highly skeptical on this product but Latisse is a little out of my price range so I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was addicted to falsies for a few months and bad technicians had caused a lot of hair loss in my eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks fully by applying twice a day (once in the AM, once in the PM), I&#x27;ve definitely seen a change. Lashes are longer AND I can see new hair growth (baby lashes that are on their way to full length). In terms of thickness, the results haven&#x27;t been that noticeable but I think when the baby lashes grow out, it will look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love curling and putting mascara on my lashes now. They look fab!</li>
            <li> This product is working to help grow my eyebrows. However, I had to discontinue use on my eyelashes because it was beginning to make my eyes burn.</li>
            <li> I am very pleasantly surprised at how well this works.  Lashes and brows are much more full and noticeable. Emellash works as advertised. Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about three weeks and I must say that I do see a difference in my eyebrows and eyelashes.  My eyelashes are longer  and thicker and my eyebrows have started to look thicker also.  I am going to keep using this product and will post another review in three more weeks as I understand it takes time to get the full effect.  So far I am very happy and I feel that the product was worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Been using for 3 weeks, no difference whatsoever yet.  Flakes and leaves residue when it dries.  Not certain that this product is strong enough to make a difference.  Will update later if any changes.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and works exactly as promised. After about 2 weeks my lashes have grown more healthy-looking and are definitely longer. I really noticed the change after getting out of the shower. When I looked in the mirror, my wet eyelashes looked like I was wearing mascara! I&#x27;ll definitely order this again!</li>
            <li> Great customer service, looking forward to see the result.</li>
            <li> I lost all of my eyelashes and eyebrows due to chemo therapy. I was eager to help stimulate regrowth however possible and came across this product. It took about 8-10 weeks to regrow them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I posted before and after chemo eyelash pics. My lashes have always been long, but I noticed that I probably grew twice as many as I had before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice that they regrew any faster than they otherwise would have. Oddly, the lower ones came in first and very long and thick, whereas the top ones were thick but not especially long. I was concerned, but within a couple of weeks the top ones caught up. It&#x27;s an unusual thing, watching your eyelashes regrow from nothing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A concern that I&#x27;d heard about was that enhancements serums cause lashes to grow in straight and wild looking. It took a few weeks, but mine curl as they always have. They are long, thick and healthy.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  Seeing results after 3 weeks</li>
            <li> Really worked well on my eyelashes almost immediately.  Using on my eyebrows too although have only notice a little difference.  I have been using it for approximately 2 weeks.  I will wait the 5 weeks it indicates will be the time you see a difference.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Have used numerous lash enhancers over the years and this serum definitely keeps lashes strong and long - notice darker hue to my otherwise light lashes, too.  Recommend it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been about 5 weeks and I&#x27;m told this takes time...I have appreciated and enjoyed the personal touch of the company contacting me to address some concerns I had.... although I have not seen any dramatic results, I have had no adverse side affects either so I will continue to use this product and wait for results.</li>
            <li> Used it everyday just a recommended and have seen dramatic improvement! Crazy how easy it was to become part of my bedtime routine!</li>
            <li> After five weeks, I am seeing some lash growth results.  I have one bald patch in one of my eyes since my teens years, after a nervous habit caused me to pull out my a plug of lashes in one spot roots and all.  However, I can actually see &amp;#34;fuzz&amp;#34; in that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I am experiencing growth which is wonderful, my lashes are very thin, but after loosing most of my lashes earlier this summer after attempting to remove lash extensions, I am thankful for the growth that I am seeing.  I use the product faithfully on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> My lashes are really thickening. I seeing a bit of length too. It&#x27;s only been one month but I am going to continue using twice a day.</li>
            <li> This product has not worked for me but the reason I am giving it 4 stars is because it has worked so well on so many other women and nicely too! That&#x27;s the reason I bought it. However after using LiLash for such a long time and having spectacular results no other products work for me. I have used at least 6 other products to get my eyelashes to grow like they did while using LiLash but to no avail. I am wondering if LiLash did something to my lashes so they won&#x27;t grow anymore. I&#x27;m sick because my lashes are shorter now than when I started using LiLash. I can&#x27;t even curl them anymore they are so straight and short! If anyone has any ideas about this, please post it. Thanks! Even the makers of EMBELLASH because I know you have a great product.</li>
            <li> I have been using EmbelLash twice a day for about 2 months now. I am pleased with the results, my lashes are looking a lot healthier, longer but too dramatic. Overall, I think it has been more like a healthy conditioner for my lashes and it has improved their growth , although not super dramatically</li>
            <li> i have been using this for about 3 -4  weeks-... so far my lashes are thicker and a bit longer - I had tried other brands like rapid lash and loreal and they made my lashes grow and then they fell out and or broke (I totally freaked!) i used castor oil on my lashes at nite to help them grow and that showed some imporvement but they were still thin - when i added embelilash my lashes increased and they have not fallen out- ( and that is a relief!)- i choose this product for its ingredients  effectiveness and gentleness - so far i am very pleased. i saw results after the first 2 weeks - I would put another star on this only I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to do so.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much improvement if any with this so far.</li>
            <li> does not work!  so sorry.</li>
            <li> At first after 2 weeks of using this I thought I had an imporvement in length (lashes), but I think it was just a placebo effect, cause now my lashes are still short and I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5-6 weeks. I&#x27;ll still give it some more time, but I kinda don&#x27;t have high expectations anymore.</li>
            <li> Save your money.  I have been using this for almost 2 months.  It hasn&#x27;t worked.  I used a similar product in the past that worked very well.  I just can&#x27;t seem to find it so I thought I would try this one</li>
            <li> This product burned me eyes so I had to stop using it.  I bought another Brand and did not experience the burning.</li>
            <li> i really do appreciate your customer service, checking in is a new experience for me. but i have to say i am not impressed with this product. i haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my lashes that are positive. in fact they seem shorter and more sparse. i have used other products and noticed a difference much sooner. it has been four weeks, and i read to give it 6, so i will and see what happens.&lt;br /&gt;hard to believe one product can work so differently for different people.</li>
            <li> I see no results yet and have been using for about a month.  I&#x27;m still waiting to see if my eyelashes improve; if not, I will return the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using it and waiting to see results.  My lashes are starting to grow but I would like to use the produce up before I give a complete review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that it burns if you get it in your eyes ;-(</li>
            <li> After purchasing this from Protege Beauty, I received an email from Stephanie in Customer Service asking me how my experience with EmbelLash was going, and offering helpful tips, and reassurance that Protege stood behind their 100% customer satisfaction guarantee.  I didn&#x27;t respond right away because I knew from experience that lash enhancers can take weeks, and sometimes months to show their full promise.  However, I wrote to the company today, and decided to post my response as a review on Amazon.  Here it is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;First, I want to thank you for this very nice email.  As a consumer, I appreciate that Protege Beauty is interactive with its customers, and obviously care about their well-being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using EmbeLash for about 7 weeks, and want you to know that I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this product!  I had been using a prescription lash enhancer for a few years, with variable results.  Initially, my lashes became extremely long, almost absurdly long (my husband told me they were getting &#x27;freaky&#x27;), but after a while they would lose their length and thickness.  I don&#x27;t know if this was normal cycling of the hair follicles, but after a while, it didn&#x27;t seem that the other product was working at all.  I decided to take a break from it, as it was very expensive and required a visit to the doctor&#x27;s office to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After investigating non-prescription lash enhancers, I decided to try EmbelLash, and have had wonderful results.  My lashes are long and thick, but not crazy (yet).  I won&#x27;t complain if they get longer and thicker, but I am happy with the current results.  I&#x27;ll be interested to see if my lashes &#x27;cycle&#x27; in length with EmbelLash as they did with the prescription enhancer.  Another plus I&#x27;ve noticed is that my eyelids and delicate skin below the eye seems to be lighter and less irritated than when I was using the other product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only &#x27;concern&#x27; I had about EmbelLash is that when I put it on in the morning and let it dry, it leaves a slight whitish film at the base of my lashes.  This seems pronounced when I put on my pencil eyeliner, but now I minimize the amount of serum I put on in the morning, and also have experimented with eye makeup so this is no longer an issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Protege has a great product at a very attractive price, and what makes the EmbelLash experience 5+ stars is the outstanding company philsophy and customer service.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase again!!!!  Thank you, Protege Beauty!!!!</li>
            <li> caused eye irritation , though stuck with it for , &#x27;beyond the return period - should have paid attention - product did nothing &#x3D; seems results greatly  embellished .</li>
            <li> This product really works!!  I have tried so many other brands of eyelash enhancers over the years, but this products has shown the best results.  Within a very short period of time, around 2 weeks, I began to see signs of lash growth.  It has now been about 4-5 weeks and I am delighted with the results!  I can actually say that I have longer and fuller eye lashes that look great with a coat of mascara.  I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product.  I have been using other eyelash growth products, which have worked, and thought I would try this one, but it didn&#x27;t grow or thicken my lashes at all.  I would never buy this again and would like my money back!</li>
            <li> I have thin short eye lashes. This product can be used for lash and brow stimulant, but I only need for eye lash. Only use a minimal amount on lash line. Thickens and stimulates hair growth. Applied similarly like  a liquid eyeliner. Can use brush it comes with or a fine liner brush, I&#x27;ve had no irritation. Applied twice a day.  Money back guarantee is a plus to try a new product!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 1 week so no change yet.</li>
            <li> This product actually works!  You have to be patient in waiting for the results but it does work! I will buy more when this tube runs out!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 3 weeks and it seems to be working.  I notice it more in the brow area.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I previously had used two tubes of  NutaLuxe Lash MD &amp; although it worked, my eyelids became very red.  Not red as in irritation, but it made all the little veins become very prominent, so much on the bottom lashes that blue veins actually were raised up.  I stopped using it &amp; all this totally resolved but I would never use this product again or recommend it! Although I loved having thicker longer lashes, who wants eyes all red/blue &amp; swollen?  Not attractive.&lt;br /&gt;Such is not the case with Embellash.  Within the first week or two I swear my eyelashes, top &amp; bottom, as well as my eyebrows started looking thicker &amp; more full.  Within weeks as promised they are both fuller &amp; now quite long as well.  I had very sparce short lashes &amp; now with mascara they look very dramatic.  I can now go without eyebrow makeup too without looking naked although I still define with some powder.  There is no redness, irritation, or any problems to report with this product.  Occasionally I have felt a little tingly, not a burning.  Don&#x27;t let this scare you if it happens early.  It was usually a tiny spot on one lid that lasted only seconds &amp; was not unpleasant. It was never a regular thing and happened very rarely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never be without this product!  Cheaper than the other brands and my lashes and brows look conditioned as well as being dramatically longer &amp; especially thicker.  Blank spots have filled in as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only off putting thing is the packaging.  No nice metal tube hiding the product. Rather a transparent tube with a paper label showing a yucky colored brown product inside. Was a little leary trying it for this reason, but don&#x27;t let that deter you.&lt;br /&gt;Best product of this type that I have used.  Absolutely love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> After about a week of use I can start to see a difference.  The product is easy to apply and I cannot wait to see the results after more use.  I definately recommend this to anyone looking to grow or improve their lashes.</li>
            <li> I tried this because of the low price. It instantly burned my eyes. I will stick to grandelash md which I&#x27;ve had great results with.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product but Im already seeing a difference in my lash growth and thickness, I lost a lot of my lashes due to an eye disorder so I&#x27;m excited to see some regrowth ...</li>
            <li> It actually works. Been using it consistently every morning and before bed for about 2 months. My lashes have really grew long. I&#x27;m pretty shocked. The areas that seemed missing lashes have seemed to grow back. I cant see the void any longer.  I used fake lashes for several months and it made my lashes thin and torn out. This has made them grow back. I would say they&#x27;re back to normal again. I would recommend to just use CONSISTENTLY.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting week 5 of twice a day, no results at all.  Not impressed with claims of product.</li>
            <li> Stings a bit bit can see a.change</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 6 weeks after having eyelash extensions removed.  I have followed the directions exactly as stated and have not noticed a difference.  I have used order growth products and seen a difference after 6 weeks. I do not recommend this product.  Try something else.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eyelash serum for a week. I have used similar products before but didn&#x27;t see any results and stopped using them. This serum is easy to apply, just use the wand to apply on your lash line and eyebrows twice a day. I have noticed that my lashes are longer and fuller and my eyebrows are fuller as well. It does not have a harsh chemical scent. I will definitely continue to use this product for continued results.</li>
            <li> It says to apply twice a day but it leaves kind of a crust. Not pretty! I just do once a day (at night).</li>
            <li> Good! Already seeing results</li>
            <li> Still too early to see full results, but so far looks encouraging.</li>
            <li> Amazing eye lash serum. It takes time to show the result. I really appreciate thr seller sending the email with the tips. Those tips helped me a lot. I love this product. I have noticed my lashes are longer than before. My friends have asked me what I am using for my eye lashes and I proudly told about this serum. Highly recommended this product.</li>
            <li> First day i but it my eyes turn to red this is night mer and it pain sooooo much i cant handel it sorry i dont like it if it is for lash line it should not effect the eyes</li>
            <li> I was getting no results from Obagie, which costs a lot more, and this is really working! I love that the ingredients are more natural but I thought that might mean it wouldn&#x27;t work. In the past 4 wks my lashes have gotten longer and I don&#x27;t seem to lose as many.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working well.  My lashes appear thicker and longer.  I&#x27;ll continue using it and see.  I&#x27;m happy with the results after 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> I received Embellish this week and having used Latisse before I expected it to be similar.  This product has a darker color to it than expected; it will not be clear.  However, it goes on clear.  I wear contacts and did not find that it burned or bothered my eyes whatsoever.  I put it on day and night; if you are going to wear makeup, be sure to let it dry before adding on shadow, liner and mascara (a few minutes should do).  While, I can&#x27;t comment on the results yet, so far, so good.  I&#x27;ll be adding to the review in 8 weeks to let you all know how it works.  Maybe even some before and after photos. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer service with Prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute; Beauty is top notch.  They checked on me to be sure that I received my product first and later to see if I was happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Awesome, responsive customer service, which is so important these days when things don&#x27;t go as planned. Product does actually work and I even forget to use it a lot! I have sparse eyelashes, and I noticed more length and even some thickness within a few weeks. Very cool product!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are definitely longer. But my eyes are burning immediately after application for a few minutes. Though it doesn’t leave them red in the morning.</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t noticed a change.  I have used Latisse, and would like to know if EmbelLash has same ingredients.  If it actually assists in the growing of longer lashes.</li>
            <li> I did not want to spend the money on Latisse, so I decided to try this.  It took about 4 weeks to see any results, but by week 5 there was a clear difference.  My lashes are thicker and fuller, and I haven&#x27;t used half the bottle.  I will continue to be a customer.</li>
            <li> This product did not work as well as I had hoped. Surely, my eye lashes grew a little but no thickness or larger amount of eye lashes occurred which had greatly upset me. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. There are many products similar to this one, but at a higher cost than Embellash.  The price is very reasonable and I noticed a difference within several days.  This is the first product of this type that doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.  Please for anyone that is looking for positive results, please buy today. Please buy from Protege Beauty.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> 5 weeks into it, my lashes are a little longer, but no thicker. I&#x27;m not giving up yet, I have a lot more serum to use.</li>
            <li> Just arrived today.  I saved a lash for comparison&#x27;s sake.  I&#x27;ll be back in two months to share the results...    Update:  Four weeks later and I&#x27;m seeing a noticable difference, both in my lower and upper lashes.  My lower lashes are thicker and the uppers are longer and feel more fluttery.  With my eyes closed they can reach the lower crease.  If they grow longer I&#x27;ll have to curl them.  I asked my husband if my lashes look longer and he said \\&quot;yes, a little.\\&quot;  I think it&#x27;s just starting so it will be interesting to see how they look in a couple more weeks.</li>
            <li> Not a fan.  Slightly stings upon application.  Barely noticeable results after a couple months of daily use.  The worse thing about this product occurs two to three weeks after discontinuing - when eyelashes fall out like crazy.  Wish I knew before I purchased ......</li>
            <li> Giving the seller 5 stars for amazingly fast shipment!!! So far I have used the product 3 times &amp; I&#x27;ve had no burning or any side affects. I will update the product in about 5-6 weeks as that is the length of time the seller indicted a difference should be noticed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two months now.  I love the fact that Protégé products do not contain any animal products and does not test their products on animals.  I have noticed that both my brows and eye lashes are fuller.  I will definitely be ordering from Protégé in the future.</li>
            <li> So far great!  Three weeks in and already seeing improvements:)</li>
            <li> I like it. It hasn&#x27;t done much for my brows, but I have noticed a growth in my lashes after 5 months of use. They are fuller than before. It&#x27;s worth the try for the price.</li>
            <li> Used faithfully twice a day over a month, nothing happened. Eyebrows and eyelashes have thinned markedly due to thyroid problems. This product did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> This product failed to produce any results. I faithfully applied the serum twice a day for 2 months and there were no results. A real waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now as directed. I had noticed my once fairly thick eyelashes seems less thick and less long, especially on the bottom. I am noticing thicker and longer lashes, and I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.  I do think it&#x27;s working and I can&#x27;t wait to see what another couple of weeks of use will do. I notice a slight stinging sometimes, but nothing too bad, and probably the result of me getting it in my eyes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/6 - update:  I changed my review title from \\&quot;Seems to be working\\&quot; to \\&quot;Working!\\&quot; because it is.  I am absolutely NOT imagining that my eyelashes are both thicker and longer.  Give this serum a try!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now and haven&#x27;t notice any difference in my lashes or brows.  I mainly wanted it for my brows and I&#x27;m a little disappointed.  I followed the instructions and use it twice a day, just thought it would be working by now.  It&#x27;s almost gone also, so hopefully it works soon.</li>
            <li> Amazing results after three weeks. A MUST!! Twice a day. Morning and night.</li>
            <li> My gosh, this stuff really works!  I&#x27;ve only been using it for three weeks, and can see a definite increase in both length and thickness of my eyelashes - WOW!  I&#x27;m even seeing some new growth where I&#x27;ve very sparse or no eyebrows.  And it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> By far the best customer service EVER. After just ONE WEEK the product is already starting to thicken my sparse post-cancer eyelashes and brows. Totally delighted with this transaction and I will be back for more! Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this product...Thanks</li>
            <li> I am at the end of week three and I put I on every night and every morning. I have not worn mascara except for a few days. I haven&#x27;t seen any changes. I will give it another month and hopefully something will happen.</li>
            <li> Great product and nice follow up by customer service.</li>
            <li> For some reason I lost many of the eyelashes in the middle of my lids. Complete bare spots. I found this on amazon so I tried it! A few weeks later my lashes are completely filled in and they are longer than ever. Recommend!!</li>
            <li> Didnt notice any difference once using producr</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working already and I&#x27;ve only been using it for two weeks. The applicator is too thing and doesn&#x27;t to absorb the product very well. Also because it&#x27;s that thin you can get it inside the eyes easily during application, so be careful cause it burns quite a bit. Besides that it works fast and effectively, I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> No length or fullness for me. I will give it more time and see if I cannot give a better review but so far I am not impressed.  UPDATE:  At 3 months of use there is neither increased fullness or length. Save your money.</li>
            <li> Sorry -- I really wanted this product to work &amp; it was not inexpensive, but it did nothing except irritate my eyes to the point I had to stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;No results on lashes or brows, either.</li>
            <li> This product is HORRIBLE AND DOESN&#x27;T WORK! It is  total ripoff, and the company doesn&#x27;t care, once they receive your money. I used this product faithfully for 4-months and the only thing that got longer was th  nose of the liar who said that this product was  the  best thing since sliced-white bread. Save your money and buy a  fiber-based mascara that DOES give results .... IMMEDIATE results, too. This product deserves a negative 10-star review ...</li>
            <li> I purchased this originally for a friend and due to the reviews. BOY AM I GLAD I DID NOT GIVE THIS TO HER!&lt;br /&gt;According to the reviews, EVERYONE loves it BUT ME? It burned my eyes. But my experience has been a terrible one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few seconds after I applied it IT STARTED TO BURN my eyes. It cost me a trip to the ER at a hospital. My eyes were red, puffy, and they sting and just I write this review, I have to tell you that  I recommend Latisse for anyone who&#x27;s contemplating taking a chance on this product. Save you&#x27;re $35 and $80 on eye drops to reduce the itchy, red, stinging sensation. NOT worth it ladies.&lt;br /&gt;Oh and by the way, they have &amp;#34;excellent&amp;#34; reviews cause they ask you to contact them with issues as opposed to posting your comments but I feel consumers have a right to know the GOOD and BAD.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for nearly 3 months and have seen no difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other similar products with good results.  This product has been great so far.  Eyelashes growing faster than before and the lashes are filling in quite nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using EmbelLash for over two months and can tell little difference in my lashes and brows.  In order to give it the benefit of my doubt, I will continue to use it a little longer.  If I see improvement, I will post another review.  Although it may be my imagination, my existing lashes may be healthier.</li>
            <li> I used this when I ran out if another eyelash growth product I had been using that was more expensive. One month into using this product I have probably half the lashes I had when I started using it. I went back to using my previous product and lashes are starting to grow again.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff back in November 2014. I used it exactly as directed, twice a day, for a month, and saw a significant increase in my lash length and volume. I actually stopped using it in January because my lashes were getting almost too long! I have since started using it only at night now. Wonderful product and I highly recommend it.  It did burn a slight bit when I first started using it but that sensation eventually stopped. Other than that, I&#x27;ve had no side effects and no discoloration of my eyelids. If you want longer, thicker lashes by next month, this product is for you.</li>
            <li> So far I dont&#x27; see big difference with my eye lashes but i notice that my lashline around my eyes have little bit more definition to it.  So far so good.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for several weeks now and have seen some results , nothing drastic though . Going to keep using it &amp; hopefully I will see the results I am looking for</li>
            <li> Finally I have some eyelashes.  Good product, decent price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about eight weeks I think. The guarantee is impressive as are the price and the customer service. I just ordered another tube to have on hand because I think it&#x27;s working. I wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m having the dramatic results some have posted but I&#x27;m seeing a difference, and that&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work it all!!! :((</li>
            <li> i purchased this serum and it has worked. i already had curly long lashes but they were.thin. upon use of this product i see my lashes darker and thicker and longer. i recommend this product and i give them 5 stars. i have no burning or any side effects and ii have sensitive eyes. I will purchase this serum again, and soon because i do not want to run out.  And the price is affordable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several eyelash enhancers. This is my least favorite so far for the cost.</li>
            <li> I did not see a huge difference with this as I did with Careprost (generic of Latisse). It will cause some burning if it gets remotely close to your eyes. I still have some left and I don&#x27;t know why, but I still put it on every now and then. I guess I am hoping something will magically happen that hasn&#x27;t happened already. I personally would not waste my money on this. As someone that has seen AMAZING results from Careprost/Latisse, you will NOT get that from this product. The unfortunate part about the Careprost/Latisse is it is not permanent.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to see if it will improve the growth of my eyebrows and eyelashes. The product instructions state it takes 4-6 weeks. I&#x27;ll let you know what happens.</li>
            <li> I have not seen the growth or fullness I was hoping to so far with this product, I will continue to use and hope for the best.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working after 3 weeks of use.  Can definite see a change in my lashes.  Price was also good.</li>
            <li> Not even using this as suggested &amp; my eyebrows &amp; lashes are growing! I&#x27;ve used it more on my brows due to eye sensitivities.</li>
            <li> So far seems to b working  lashes appear longer would buy this product again</li>
            <li> I hate to wear false eyelashes, as it is too messy for me to do and never get it correct. I always wanted long lovely eyelashes and eyebrows, but never could be able to achieve them.  However, using the Embellash Eyelash Growth Serum I feel I felt a fast improvement in growth in just few weeks and will continue to use. I always figure you could go the natural route and apply natural oils or mix of vitamins to your lashes, but this is so much easier! All good ingredients in one application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of the wonderful ingredients that also are good for hair growth and building stronger hair is included in this product, like grapeseed extract, KGF peptides. More over this is cruelty free and made in USA which is a huge thing for me.&lt;br /&gt;The product comes with a eyeliner kind of wand to apply so it is really precise and great for applying for lashes and I do have a thick brow so I apply it on brows as well. The product itself feels very cool when you apply so it is soothing. A tiny bit goes a long way, so this product is lasting me months using it twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;Overall. I am super impressed with how great this Embellish Eyelash Growth Serum works and the bang that you get for your buck! I would highly recommend this Growth Serum to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased reviews</li>
            <li> This product works amazingly well. I typically had thick lashes and -when I saw noticeable thinning that appeared to be getting worse- I started looking for a product that would encourage new growth for THICKER lashes. I wasn&#x27;t aiming for longer lashes but I not only saw new growth --so thicker lashes again thankfully- it also made my lashes notably longer to boot!  I&#x27;ve used this product and before that I used Rapid Lash which I also got on Amazon and both seemed to work.  Not 100% sure I know all the reasons my lashes had started thinning but had heard that Latisse could cause your eye color to change so didn&#x27;t want to give that a try.  Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased and a bit relieved that I found something so effective. Sometimes if I do get a little in my eye by accident it stings just a tiny bit for just a moment but has never caused any redness or eye irritation following that and overall the results have been incredible!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this five star because of the customer service communication and also because it nourished and seemed to condition my eyebrows, I can&#x27;t give it a five star on growth because I wasn&#x27;t consistent on application but it feels good and for the price I think it is worth a try and easier to apply than vitamin E.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased I order this product.  My eyebrow is growing back. I also use your product on my eyelash.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  Used it for a while, but it didn&#x27;t work. :(  I think I actually lost lashes... maybe it was a coincidence.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me. Was infact a little disappointed because it used to burn my eyelids</li>
            <li> This product is awful! It&#x27;s brown and leaves a dry crust on your eyelash line. as it flakes off during the day, it looks like your eyelid is peeling. Plus, it didnt even promote growth in my lashes. I bought this product after seeing all the fantastic reviews, but now i&#x27;m pretty certain that the owners of this product are simply making all these reviews themselves. There&#x27;s no way that anyone could love this product. Please, try someone other brand, like ReLash by delilah if you&#x27;re looking in the same price range. This product is not worth your money or time.</li>
            <li> Did not meet my expectations. Eyes look puffy and swollen when using this product</li>
            <li> Yes it does work but there is barely a difference. My eye lashes are still barely noticeable. They did get a little longer but they are not fuller and it isn&#x27;t really much of a change. It worked a little but not ad much as I expected</li>
            <li> I am enjoying the Eyelash Enhancer by Protégé. It is not strong smelling and goes on very easy. I&#x27;m seeing some results as far as my eyelashes being a little thicker but I really believe you have to give the product a little more time than a week. I Believe this product is really going to work and I am going to continue to use as part of my daily and nightly routine. I cant wait to see the results in a month which I truly believe will be amazing!! Thank you so much for such a real product and not just another claim to do product.</li>
            <li> Very Happy! Great results! I&#x27;ve been using EmbelLash for 5 weeks and my eyelashes are certainly longer and appear fuller. I used EmbelLash twice a day foe the first two weeks and started seein results.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Used it religously for months and didn&#x27;t do anything at all for my lashes or brows. Very disappointed. I was drawn in by the money back guarantee but didn&#x27;t do anything for me. Not worth my time or thw hassle to try to get my $$ back though.</li>
            <li> Ir works but it doesn&#x27;t do all the miracles, my lashes are longer and stronger, but I don&#x27;t see much yet on the volume, been using it for 4 weeks or so</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes but also has not helped my eyelashes either.  I have been using it about one month and will continue for a while longer.</li>
            <li> I began using this right after I received it, about 3 weeks ago. Getting old has so many drawbacks and losing eye lashes is one of them. I didn&#x27;t wear mascara anymore because I looked silly when I put it on. I use the product morning and night. 3 days ago I thought it was time to begin using mascara again. Wow! I had so many more lashes. Mascara looks good on me now. I have a quite light complexion and need all the color I can get.</li>
            <li> I have been using Protege for just over a month.  I had used Latise in the past and loved the results but it took 3 months to get the results I was looking for.  Protege is less costly with no RX needed. In my opinion, it is easier to apply because it is packaged like liquid eyeliner.  I am starting to see results because my lashes are beginning to look longer.  I am hoping my lashes continue to get longer but I believe it will take weeks more of using the product before I can decide if it&#x27;s a 5 star product.</li>
            <li> This product did not extend my eyelashes. False advertisement.</li>
            <li> After trying a tube of this stuff I will be returning to my mainstay &amp;#34;Rapid lash&amp;#34; which I actually see results from.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows and eyelashes seem fuller. I will definitely order again. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Been applying every night and morning and haven&#x27;t seen growth yet...been at it for 4 weeks.....</li>
            <li> My lashes and brows both look fuller</li>
            <li> This is not my first type of product that I have tried for my eyelashes. I can honestly state that I am very happy with its performance thus far and I plan to continue with it.</li>
            <li> I had side effects - redness and swelling from using this product.</li>
            <li> Growth too fast ... Excellent product</li>
            <li> This product works.  At first I had a slight reaction on my eyelids when I began using it but it settled down within a week.  I have seen some growth, but not as much as with the Nutralash I was using previously.  I may go back to Nutralash when Embellash runs out.  The company itself is very responsive, and helpful for anyone interested in this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very wnoferful product. It help to make thick eyeborws as well as turn weak eyelashes to strong eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m satisfied with this item. it deserves 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge makeup wearer but I was happily surprised with the volume my lases had after using this. My daughter will want to relieve me of my eyelash grower but the answer is NOPE! Get your own! :) I have not been using this product for the 5 weeks it says it takes but I CAN notice some growth and that is all I ask!</li>
            <li> It REALLY WORKS!!! I was surprised with the result. My eyelashes are longer, thicker and fuller in less than a month! Unbelievable!!!</li>
            <li> i have been using for several days now and i am really happy with the results! my lashes are fuller looking! works as well as the top drugstore brand. i apply once in the morning and put my mascara right over it and it works out beautifully! this was a great purchase!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference unfortunately but I still have hope. One thing I don&#x27;t like is that it leaves a sort of crust on the lash line which is difficult to get off with out pulling out lashes. I may be putting on too much but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case as I follow the directions exactly. I will use what I have left but I will not be purchasing this product again. It may work for others but it hasn&#x27;t worked for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a month and I&#x27;ve seen no results. Hopefully I will soon. Ignore the rating at this point.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Simply amazing. I wasn&#x27;t using the product regularly, twice a day every 2-3 days. Within 2 weeks I could see a difference in the length and just the overall appearance. I ruined my lashes by wearing extensions for a year. I was beyond upset when they all fell out and I noticed I had NO lashes left. This product SAVED them. I am just so thrilled. I highly recommend this product to anyone !</li>
            <li> My lashes are growing, this super easy to apply product does what it is supposed to.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Product burns and hurts my eyes. Redness also noticed on my lids. Had to stop using it. No effect noticed on my lashes.</li>
            <li> It is burned my skin..</li>
            <li> Being a skeptic but desiring longer lashes without having to have them falsely applied I tried this product knowing there was a money back promise if not pleased.  I WAS MORE THEN PLEASED.  within one month they not only had significant growth but as well thickness.  I used religiously 2x&#x27;s a day and measured them through the whole month.  They have grown at least 2 if not 3 mm.  I have saved the 5 lashes that have fallen from my eyes and can see significant length.  Today most of my lashes measure 9mm and some even 10mm.  I have heavy hooded eyes and prior to using this product the skin fell just slightly over the lashes but now the lashes seem to lift the lids.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE  this product and will continue to use it.  I also was very pleased with the customer care portion of this purchase.  They continued to inquire as to my opinion of it throughout the month.  Not knowing my final report I refrained from reporting but when I finally reported to them on the 30th of October 2014 ( started October 1st 2014) with my results and questions as to how much longer they might hope to get they were prompt to inform me with the info I requested.  I asked this question due to a former review where someone reported they had to trim their lashes as they had gotten so long.  I would never trim mine but look forward to the problem if it should happen to me.  In any case my report is GREAT PRODUCT, GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE, AND BEYOND EXPECTATION RESULTS.  Thank you Stephanie, Protégé, &amp; Embellash.  Most Sincerely,  Dana</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product did not work for me at all.</li>
            <li> Not sure it really helps.</li>
            <li> Great stuff so far . I have been using for over a week and can honestly tell you I see some growth. I so happy to find a product like this to work and not cost you a fortion :) I can&#x27;t wait for a month to see the difference .</li>
            <li> I used it twice a day and nothing happened</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are filling in stronger and noticable.  Lasehes a little slower, but thicker.  thanks for this product.  Oh, and it does not sting eyes.  I got a little in my eyes.</li>
            <li> Used faithfully for six weeks and saw very little results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for awhile now and I&#x27;m very impressed! I&#x27;m seeing new growth on my eyebrow &amp;#34;wings&amp;#34; that I had over plucked! Plus my eye lashes are getting thicker and longer! I&#x27;ve followed their instructions and it&#x27;s working! And it&#x27;s also very easy to apply! The customer service is wonderful! Stephanie is the best! Have confidence in knowing that if you have a problem with their line of products, the company stands by their guarantee!</li>
            <li> Love this product and it works!  I have used two other products and Embellash works and better than advertised.  I will purchase this again because it works.</li>
            <li> one great product. makes my eyes look fuller and dont need as much mascara</li>
            <li> Noticeably thicker eyelashes and my dark circles lightened up, must be because of the nutrients in this product. double goodness. Grapes are one of the best foods for eyes and there is grape seed in this. Great productThe ingredients in Embellash are amazing and nutritious so I know the thickness in my eyelash growth is because of this product. I wear makeup everyday. I layer on mascara, I use a healthier brand that has vitamins and quinoa in it , but I still feel like they needed some attention. Hey you get one pair of eyes for life! And its important to nourish them. Now my eyelashes are longer than ever.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a slight improvement in my lashes. Normally they are pathetically thin and with after using this for a while they are fuller. They&#x27;re not movie star quality but they are better! I was very happy to receive this item to review since I have never tried it before. All opinions stated, whether self-purchased or provided for review, are completely those of my own.</li>
            <li> This lash treatment is new for me, and slightly different than the ones I&#x27;ve already tried.  i like to switch out every now and then because I feel that after a while the particular treatment loses its effectiveness.  I have no opinion about how well this works yet, although it is different in that you use it twice a day instead of once like the others I&#x27;ve used.  It goes on smoothly, and here&#x27;s hoping!</li>
            <li> I used to have no lower lashes. They are thin and you can&#x27;t even notice that I do have lower lashes. I had several issues with my upper lashes also, which is thin and fall off all the time, created loss spaces and uneven lashes which bother me so much. I&#x27;m glad that I did purchase this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does tingle a little bit when I apply on my upper and lower lashes. However, it works quick. I notice that my lashes have been stronger and thicker after 3 week, less fall off. After 5 weeks, I HAVE LOWER LASHES. YES I DO. Love the fact this bottle lasts 3 months compare to these other brands that only last a month!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I can get used to all of the compliments others give me on my lashes!!</li>
            <li> I love the product. I have purchase 4 time for myself. I now have my sister using it. I have tried several products and this is by far the best. I have noticed thicker longer lashes. I would definitely recommend to anyone wanting thicker longer lashes.</li>
            <li> I use to have gorgeous thick, long lashes. With age, my lashes have started to thin out. I was excited when I found out I was going to get the opportunity to test this product in exchange for my honest opinion. This is the first product like this that I have tried. I have been afraid to try a liquid lash enhancement since I wear contacts. This product didn&#x27;t get into my eyes like I thought it would. It&#x27;s a very think liquid and it applies smoothly. I applied the liquid to my eye lashes and left my eyes closed for about one minute so it would dry. It&#x27;s simple to use. I started seeing results after 3 weeks of use. I like to use it first thing in the morning and at night. You can also use this for eye brows but I don&#x27;t have any problems there. You will receive a .34oz tube with lash brush. There&#x27;s a lot in the tube. It may last around 4 or 5 months. I love that this is Made in the USA and cruelty free. With a money back guarantee, you have nothing to lose!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with EmbelLASH!  I can actually see hair growing in the front part of my eyebrows.  This was a difficult area to grow hair and believe me I have tried several different products.  EmbelLASH is the only product that has managed to grow hair in that area to where it has made a big difference.  Now, I wished I had taken the time to snap a before/after pic.  But please take my word, that I am very happy with EmbelLASH and it just keeps getting better and better or should I say hairier and hairier.</li>
            <li> I like it better than Olash. I noticed my lashes grew longer faster. Thanks for the great product!</li>
            <li> This embellash didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I applied it religiously to my lashes and saw no changes after 8 weeks. The return process was a pain.</li>
            <li> You have to plan ahead to put this on. It makes my eyes water, even when I am careful to not get it in my eye.  It&#x27;s like &#x27;fumes&#x27; still make your eyes water after you apply it. So if you are going to wear makeup, you probably need 20 minutes for your eyes to stop watering so you can apply eye and face makeup where it might run. Not sure that I have noticed a difference in my eyelashes again, but I only did it for 3 weeks straight...then I forgot and got lazy due to the eyes watering.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product now for about three weeks. I have noticed a difference in the length and the number of lashes. The instructions idicate that it can be applied twice a day, however, for about 2 weeks I used the product once a day until I was sure my eyes and lids were used to the product. Then I began using it twice a day. I am curious to see how it will do after a month or so. I have used lash products before and I know it takes a while to see results so patience is vital. I will definitely do an update. Concerning customer support, I am RAVING about how good it is. I ordered the product once in May and when it had not arrived in 2 weeks I contacted customer support. I wrote that they could easily check my Amazon file and see that my product was still in \\&quot;transit.\\&quot; I promptly recieved an email from \\&quot;Stephanie\\&quot; who apologized for the inconvenience, and wrote that she would have another sent out. The NEXT DAY I received it. WHAT? Since then, I have received a few emails to see if everything was going as expected. Very nice indeed. I continue to have high hopes for this product.Update 7/28.This is now my second&lt;br /&gt;month ( remember that I did not use twice a day for a few weeks ) and my lashes are&lt;br /&gt;much thicker and longer too. But mostly thicker. I am astoundedd at how the fullness&lt;br /&gt;has increased. I used to joke that I had only 13 lashes on either side! Ha. The truth&lt;br /&gt;is, after I had my radiation therapy my brows and lashes never came back very well,&lt;br /&gt;though the hair on my head came back during treatment! I began tattooing my brows,&lt;br /&gt;but never did my lashes because I was afraid. So I wore falsies. I tried just about&lt;br /&gt;every lash conditioning product on the market to see if they would help and some did,&lt;br /&gt;but minimally. Protege lash serum is the only product that has SIGNIFICANLY increased&lt;br /&gt;the volume of my lashes. It is amazing. The only thing I could hope for in addition,&lt;br /&gt;though it would be very greedy of me, is to see them get darker! Iknow, this is looking a gift horse in the mouth. Maybe one day!!! Thanks again so much and I will keep you posted on the progress. LKW</li>
            <li> I have been faithful with the product.It seems to be working a little. It&#x27;s to expensive for me to always have to use.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a couple of months and haven&#x27;t noticed much difference. Don&#x27; t know yet if I will reordet.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. Really works. After two weeks have noticed difference. Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all sucks!</li>
            <li> I had my doubts that anything could bring my eyebrows back. Over-plucking in my 20&#x27;s left me without much there. I&#x27;ve been using EmbelLASH for a month now and I&#x27;ll be darned if the hair isn&#x27;t starting to grow. I have eyebrows again!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical and concerned because I have sensitive eyes. I have been using this for two weeks and have had no problems and my eyelashes are thicket and longer. The outer corners had lashes missing and they are back!  Can&#x27;t wait to see what 4 weeks brings!</li>
            <li> I have been using EMBELLASH for a few weeks now. I am so happy with the result. My eyelashes and eyebrows are getting much fuller. Thanks for such a great product!</li>
            <li> If this would come with a protective seal I would try it again</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT, HAS TAKE MY LASHES OUT!&lt;br /&gt;while taking mascara off with a soft makeup remover towelette, I noticed lashes so easily on the towel.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  As ive gotten older my lashes have really become sparse.  I have been using this for just a few weeks now and I see a noticeable difference in my lashes.  Great product.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I see a big difference in the length of my lashes!  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have not had much success with this product so far and have been using it for approx 3 weeks now.</li>
            <li> I have received EmbelLASH and have been using it for a couple weeks now. I have always had thin short eyelashes and have seen improvements already!! I can&#x27;t wait to see what my lashes will look like when given more time!!  I look forward to the continued growth in the next couple of weeks. This what it has done after 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> Nothing! Money wasted</li>
            <li> No perceivable difference in length or thickness after 6 weeks of nightly use following instructions as written.  No irritation, fast delivery.  Ordered two at the low price, but it&#x27;s to late to return the second unopened product.  I am post-menopausal with low-thyroid, does that make a difference, hard to say?</li>
            <li> This is only my second week using Embellash, I haven&#x27;t notice any change as of yet, but I was asked to give my opinion thus far. When I opened the box I was a little thrown off by the color I guess because I&#x27;m used to different products being clear. This products color reminds me of a Dijon mustard color. I will check back in 2 weeks to let you know my results. I don&#x27;t know what to rate due to lack of info so mid way seemed appropriate.</li>
            <li> I deliberately waited the full six weeks before giving a review because I wanted it to be accurate and truthful so here is goes: I am amazed at how long my lashes are now! At first I thought it was an illusion, but undeniably, my lashes are longer and fuller. People now think I have on fake lashes, and I have to tell them that I only have on mascara. I am extremely pleased and feel so much more attractive now. I did not see much of a difference in my eyebrows, but my lashes are visibly longer and thicker!</li>
            <li> It may work, but it did burn a little.  Although I did not use it long, it did not seem to work too well, but I may not have persisted long enough.</li>
            <li> I started using Emballash a month ago. I had been using Latisse for years and was not looking forward to my eyelashes falling out when I stopped. Emballash kept that to a minimum and my eyelashes feel stronger than before. They feel very soft, too. I know it will take time to see if it really makes them thicker so i will continue to check back!</li>
            <li> I waited the full 5 weeks plus a few before posting a review because I wanted to see the effects.  At first I had a few longer lashes and some that were not as long but after a few weeks they all evened out.  My eyelashes now touch my eyebrows!  I have had to buy new glasses because my eyelashes began rubbing against the lenses of my old ones.  The only negative is that if you put it on too heavily you will get flakes that are very unattractive so use a light hand.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen a difference at all. Went off others reviews. Won&#x27;t buy or recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it (nearly) twice a day since it arrived 4 weeks ago and was waiting to review until I was 100% certain of the results. What can I say that hasn&#x27;t been said before? I&#x27;ve been using it exclusively on my eyes for my age deficient lashes and, after a month, now have longer fuller lashes. Not sure if I&#x27;ll ever be the &amp;#34;girl&amp;#34; that gets complimented for her beautiful lashes again but very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waited to post this review in hopes that I&#x27;d have better news to report. I wanted to rave about this product but after using it faithfully for 9 weeks I have seen only minimal results.  My lashes are maybe a little longer but no thicker.  Not one person has noticed that my lashes look different.  Last week I saw both my very best friend (who lives overseas and I only see 2-3 times a year) and my hairstylist -- both of whom usually notice everything -- and neither one said a word.  I even asked my stylist if she noticed a difference and her comment was, &amp;#34;Well, they don&#x27;t look bad!&amp;#34;  Not exactly what I hoped for!  I&#x27;m in my early 40s and have had long lashes most of my life, but never super thick.  In the past couple years I&#x27;ve noticed they aren&#x27;t as long and wanted to try a serum....I chose this one because I&#x27;m scared of some of the others after hearing that if you discontinue use your lashes fall out and you&#x27;re way worse off than you were when you started.  Several weeks ago I reached out to the customer service person to ask when I could expect to see &amp;#34;optimal results&amp;#34; and she said there is not really an answer to that, but probably around 12-16 weeks.  I will probably finish the tube I have in hopes that maybe something will kick in, but unless it does I will not invest in another tube.  I&#x27;m glad others have seen better results and appreciate that they offer a guarantee.  Given the results that others have seen, I would probably recommend people try it since there is a guarantee for a refund if you aren&#x27;t satisifed....nothing ventured, nothing gained.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 5 weeks now and have seen significant regrowth of my very over-plucked eyebrows! It&#x27;s lovely to have them back:) I also see quite a difference in my lashes, both top and bottom. I have an unfortunate habit of pulling my lashes out, but since I started using Embellash I have been diligent in applying twice a day and letting the product work it&#x27;s magic. So far so good!! I also really appreciate the fact that the company extended itself to me via email. It shows that they care about their product as well as those that choose to use it. Customer service is wonderful! Well done Embellash!</li>
            <li> I think it is an excellent product&lt;br /&gt;/.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for not quite one month.  The applicator wand/brush is like an eyeliner &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; brush.  VERY easy and accurate to use, with no mess or waste. Once applied, it takes less than 10 minutes to dry.  Basically colorless.  If you get a bit in your eyes, no stinging, but just a rather warmish sensation in the area (never painful).  I apply it in the morning, before eye make-up, and again at night.  No results so far, but I&#x27;ll try it another month.  Easy to use, dries quickly, and non-stinging.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for about 4 weeks now, twice a day as directed, missing only two days.&lt;br /&gt;I do find my eyebrowns thicker.  The little hairs I do pluck when I shape are growing in faster than without the product. I feel the product needs more time, it does say &#x27;5 weeks&#x27; for results but I have seen improvement and will continue to use.  When I run out of this bottle I will order another to give it more time.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for almost 2 weeks but haven&#x27;t noticed any growth.  However, they send emails once a week to give pointers and follow up with satisfaction so that is a change of pace.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  I have seen significant results!</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY types of eyelash growth products only to be disappointed. I have tiny lashes that no matter how much mascara I put on I still look as though I have no lashes. I got this product because of the high reviews and I have to say in just 2 weeks of using this I am seeing a big difference. It does not happen over night but I am seeing a difference in thickness and my lashes are growing!! I can apply mascara and not have it all over my eyes and I am starting to see my lashes without having my nose to the mirror lol. Unlike other products my lashes have not fallen out.</li>
            <li> Havent seen a difference yet...</li>
            <li> I have used Latisse for years and this works just as well! I use it morning and evening and it absorbs very quickly. I will continue to buy this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 months, I started July 7th. now and haven&#x27;t notice any difference in my lashes or brows. I mainly wanted it for my brows and I&#x27;m a little disappointed. I followed the instructions and use it twice a day, just thought it would be working by now. It&#x27;s almost gone also.</li>
            <li> I used it faithfully, nothing happened :&amp;#62;(</li>
            <li> I started using the lash serum a  couple of weeks &amp; I could see some difference in the length not so much in thickness yet &amp; not a change in eyebrows but will continue using it.</li>
            <li> It works!&lt;br /&gt;My eyelashes are already noticeably longer only after 1 week.</li>
            <li> It has been about 3 weeks now that I am using this product, night and day.  I can only tell that my lashes have grown just a &#x27;little&#x27;.  I lost my hair and lashes due to chemotherapy, so, that may have something to do with them not growing like some of the other remarks.  My hair grew back, but my lashes and brows are very short and brows are very thin.  I will keep using Embalash until gone.  Maybe they will start to really grow!  JMT</li>
            <li> My lashes are actually thicker since using this enhancer.  My lashes have always been long and when using mascara they look thicker.  The difference in using this product I dont feel I have to use it.  My eyes are very sensitive and using ANYTHING is a risk for me. I put this on every morning after washing my face.  Loving the results!</li>
            <li> Does great use as directed.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that it seems to be working on my eyebrows a bit, but cannot see a difference in my lashes yet.  I have only been using it for 1.5 weeks.  One thing that does have me slightly concerned is that I am starting to see a light yellowish line on my top eyelash line since using this product.</li>
            <li> After 5 days use I can&#x27;t give a review since success will be measured by lash growth. It&#x27;s easy to use. But waiting to see if it really produces growth. Someone said they experienced a tingling to slight stinging on the lash line. I did experience slight stinging on 1st to 2nd application but none following. We will see.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work.  It can be slightly irritating and takes a bit to dry.  I bought this rather than Grande Lash because I thought I would save  little nd it wasn&#x27;t with it.  I just put an order in for another Grande Lash.  My eyelashes aren&#x27;t long and seem to be falling out.  Not flood at all.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;rave reviews&amp;#34; of this product must be written by employees of the actual company, because this product is sub-par. After reading through multiple reviews of similar products, I was really excited to read the fantastic reviews of &amp;#34;Embel-Lash&amp;#34; and decided to order some for myself. I have now been using this product every single day on both my eye-lashes and my eyebrows for well over a month, and it has not made one bit of difference. Perhaps I&#x27;m the outlier and the product works on everyone else, but I doubt it. Definitely a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Lashes have actually lengthened a bit all around.  Has not added lashes or made them fuller, but definitely a little longer.</li>
            <li> I so very much wanted this product to do the trick for me. But after several months, with no significant growth, I&#x27;m giving up on this product. I also was duped by the caption, &amp;#34;TODAY ONLY&amp;#34; for the supposed price break but noticed that this caption is there all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, I going to try the 100% Organic Castor Oil for Hair, Eyelashes, Eyebrow, Skin and Face - Used for Growth and Strength Treatment - 30 Days Money Back Guarantee, whose link I have attached below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OVG34ZC/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. The stuff that requires a prescription better but this works fine enough.&lt;br /&gt;Why does it always read &amp;#34;Today Only?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This has really made a difference in my lashes, they are definitely longer after about 6 weeks of twice a day application. I cannot put it on my lower lashes because my eyes are too sensitive and it burns a little. I have been using on my eye brows as well, but have not noticed any difference there.</li>
            <li> Seems like it is working. Need more time, but I&#x27;m hopeful. My lashes are getting thicker and with a coat of mascara...WOW!  Price was great and it&#x27;s a 4 month supply:)</li>
            <li> works amazing! i have really short asian eyenlashes and now they are longer and thicker. it does tingle a little when i first put it on.</li>
            <li> I will not be purchasing the product again, nor will I suggest it to others. A couple of weeks after I purchased EbemLASH, I was contacted by Stephanie a company representative, via email. She wanted to know how my experience was going with their product and to inform me that if I took before and after photos, I would be eligible to enter their weekly contest drawing (see below email). I replied to Stephanie that in a 2 weeks period there was nothing I could honestly report about my results. Furthermore, they never explained when I initially purchased or received the EmbuLASH serum the importance of taking before and after pictures. Therefore according to Stephanie I was not eligible to be entered into their weekly contact drawing. How deceptive is that marketing tactic for you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Wednesday, November 19, 2014 11:35 AM, Protege Beauty - Amazon Marketplace&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear Tina,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s been a couple weeks since we checked in.

            <li> fast delivery , product does not irritate eyes at all..would like to see more response ..will give more time</li>
            <li> Did not notice any difference even after using almost the entire bottle. Other products work much better.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for four weeks and have not noticed any difference.&lt;br /&gt;I think that Latisse is the only lash growth product that really works, but is very&lt;br /&gt;expensive. Try different products or go with the best and spend lots.</li>
            <li> I am no stranger to Protege skin care. I have their entire line! I use their Vitamin C Rum every morning after I wash my face. I then use their EmFACEize daily defense cream &amp; follow that up with their resurFACE night cream. I also use Protege Vanish cream for stretch marks on my lower back area. They all work wonders for my skin, so when I was offered the opportunity to evaluate Protege EmbelLASH, I was super excited to write about my experience first hand and give my honest opinion. This eyelash growth serum has to me, really seemed to have been working. Not too much as of yet, but I believe I feel some possible growth in my lashes.....Only time will tell, but w their track record w me, I have high hopes!</li>
            <li> It does burn a little when applied to close but luckily doesn&#x27;t for long. The directions say to apply twice a day.  I would like it better if once a day was recommended - that&#x27;s my biggest complaint (I&#x27;m bad to forget stuff like this!)</li>
            <li> I had been losing a lot of eyelashes because of a cheap eyelash adhesive. My lashes just kept on falling out even when I stopped using the adhesive. So, I looked into these eyelash growth serums. I wasn&#x27;t really sure if this would work and was super worried because I have extremely sensitive eyes I apply it on before bedtime, after makeup removal. This product has not made a noticeable difference on my eyelash length, but I have seen my lashes becoming thicker and softer. I also used this on my eyebrows. And I was surprised that this serum actually made my eyebrows grow back in places where I&#x27;ve been wanting it. My eyebrows now are completely full. I was offered the opportunity to receive this product in exchange for my unbiased review.  I&#x27;m so glad that I decided to take a chance on this. Note, my review is based on my experience with the product which may differ from yours.</li>
            <li> I started using this product and the results is it amazing. .. is working with me ...understand we are different but give a trying , take a chance cause the price is not bad at all. .. great product very gentle and natural...</li>
            <li> Good customer service and good product.</li>
            <li> I think I need a little more time to see how well it works. It does burn when applied at first and actually caused the skin where it was applied to peel but, it seems as though I am building up a tolerance. It does take up to 4 months to grow an eyelash so we shall see.</li>
            <li> You have to apply twice a day.  It slightly burned my eyes at first but after a few days of applying, it got better.  I noticed it did work, but once I stopped applying it, my lashes continued to thin.</li>
            <li> I have tried many lash serums...this one is the best. It has alot of natural ingredients and does not make your eyes burn or sting like most do.  It does take a good 4 to 6 weeks to notice results so be patient.  I will absolutely get this again.  THANK YOU PROTEGE BEAUTY!  :)</li>
            <li> I bought two of this product because I thought it was like Revitalash, that was wonderful , and in 3 weeks my eyelashes improved incredible  and last for months,  2 years ago, but they do not sell any more and that is why I change it.&lt;br /&gt;This product did not do nothing to my eyelashes and I have been usisng it since I bought 5 weeks ago....nothing at all....loose my money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and have noticed some improvement. I will keep using which is better than most other eye lash products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> it kinda turn hard and chunky on my eyelids. don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy anymore</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of lash enhancement products including Latisse and this is by far the best one yet! I have thin lashes and not only are they longer but they appear thicker as well, which none of the other products were able to achieve. The price is also right. I will be a repeat buyer.</li>
            <li> My daughter started losing her eyebrows due to hormonal issues.  We tried everything, from a product that cost $160...not a very noticeable improvement at all, to castor oil, which seemed to be helping somewhat...but a VERY slow process. So, I went on another search for answers.  EmbelLASH was one of about 7 products I had in my cart on Amazon to research and make a decision on.  My cart considerations ranged from very expensive to very reasonably priced items.  Finally, I thought I&#x27;m going to try the EmbelLash, with the great reviews and extremely reasonable price...what did I have to lose, if I can throw $160 in the waste basket, surely I can toss $35!  Well, my daughter started using the EmbelLash on July 8th, 2014, in about 2 weeks there was a marked improvement in her eyebrows. Now, 2 months later...her eyebrows somehow look better than they did before she started losing her hair!  I&#x27;ve been purchasing from Amazon since 2007,  I&#x27;ve bought A LOT lol...I would say with a 95% success rate.  I have written I think 2 reviews,  one negative...and this one.  So as you can see,  I only review when I&#x27;m either extremely disappointed...or extremely impressed.  EmbelLash is in the &amp;#34;I&#x27;m extremely impressed&amp;#34; catagory.  Of course all I have to go on is my daughter&#x27;s personal experience, and we all know that everyone&#x27;s body is different and reacts differently to different products.  I&#x27;m not here to tell you to buy it...maybe it won&#x27;t work for you at all. All I can do is give an honest opinion on our experience.  I hope this helps someone make an informed decision, because there are a lot of products out there and it can be very daunting to make a decision on just one.  Personally, I thing EmbelLash is a good place to start on your journey of discovering what works for you.</li>
            <li> Burns my skin!  I tried this product because it was less costly than Babe Lash.  Unfortunately I don&#x27;t even know if it works like Babe Lash does because it burns the skin on my eyelids too much to use it!  Babe Lash doesn&#x27;t burn me at all.</li>
            <li> You do see an increase in length of your eyelashes after 4-5 weeks, you just have to be patient.  The applicator brush is very easy to use and just the right size.  The amount of product you get in the bottle is very good for the value you pay.  I&#x27;m interested to see how long my lashes get as I continue to use the product.  The company follows up with your satisfaction with the product multiple times which is very refreshing this day and age.  They seem to value that you are 100% satisfied with the product.  Overall I like this product very much.</li>
            <li> I am on my second tube of Embellash and have had mixed results. I have been faithful in using it and have noticed a slight increase in lash length.  Oddly, one of my eyes has longer lashes than the other!  More importantly, I am seeing some hair growth on my eyebrows on the bare spots from over-plucking.  I will continue to use Embellash, hoping to get greater results over time.</li>
            <li> does not work for me.  after 3 months of religious application twice daily, my lashes are the same as they were before application. very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works well.</li>
            <li> Should be zero stars. used it for over 2 months..The first week it left a brown crust on the lids..I found that shaking the container before use helped....however, it did absolutely NOTHING&amp;#60; It is not that I used it improperly, I have used other lash enhancers that worked...this is a real Scam.Is it too late to get my money back??? I had to give it time to work. I used it night and day and applied no mascara to give it a real chance to work on its own.</li>
            <li> tried it for 8 weeks did not work</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a about a month now and see a HUGE difference.  I lost my eyelashes and this product brought them back. I would highly recommend it.  I love that this product is a family based business.  They take care in ensuring the products they are using are not animal tested and they are products that work to grow your lashes.  I have looked and tried many other products and this one hands down is my favorite.  I use it day and night and follow the instructions, I feel confident that is why it is working for me.  If I had to give a recommendation, order the product.  IT WORKS.</li>
            <li> Used as directed, didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
            <li> My eyelids are on fire, and i you can return it bc i used it on my eyes, it also wasn&#x27;t sealed...&lt;br /&gt;It burns so much</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  At first it seemed to sting my eyes a bit, but I got used to that after a little while.  It really did make my thinned out lashes grow longer and I have so many little lashes coming in now!  Love it!  My lids have not become darker like I understand happens with more expensive brands of growth enhancer.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have really long lashes but with a little help they are ok. But they are very thin.  With this serum it seems like my eyelashes are getting thicker. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve used this long enough to notice length growth yet but if it&#x27;s getting thicker I&#x27;m sure it will grow as well!</li>
            <li> Works great but this particular product burns some what unlike Grandelash</li>
            <li> Have noticed a difference in growing but not thickness yet but i know will take some time.</li>
            <li> I have been using Protege Embellash 2X a day for about 2 months on my eyebrows. I recently noticed my eyebrows are filling in and not shedding as much. I was unable to use the product for my eyelashes, as I experienced a painful burning sensation. I am using an alternate product for eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Been using it since July 13, 2014. Very little results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 6 weeks now but see no result whatsoever on my lashes. It just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It makes my eyelashes longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been over 5 weeks still waiting for results.</li>
            <li> Been using for 4 months now, no.change at all. Not worth the money. Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Embellash has shown no results yet, and I&#x27;m losing patience with these products.</li>
            <li> I am loving the EmbelLASH. I can actually see my lashes.. There is a bunch of new growth and the lashes are growing in darker.</li>
            <li> I started using this product in mid November and I have not seen any changes at all. I followed the instructions of applying the serum twice a day to both the top and bottom of my lash lines. My eyelashes has not grown at all but I have experienced eye irritation from the serum.  I was very excited to try something new I&#x27;ve used others in the past that worked at a minimum. After reading  about this product I thought this one would really work for me and that was not true.  I wish I could get a full refund of my money including my shipping and handling.</li>
            <li> Have not noticed any significant change.</li>
            <li> If I could give this product 10 stars, I would! I absolutely love this product, and would recommend it to anyone who has thin, brittle lashes and is looking to make them thick and healthy again! My lashes were destroyed from lash extensions; after recieving this and using it in the morning before I put my makeup on, and at night when I removed my makeup, after only 2 weeks I could definitely tell that my lashes were longer, fuller, and overall more healthy. The customer service is also top notch. I haven&#x27;t had a more pleasant Amazon experience than with Protoge, and will be a continued customer from here on out!</li>
            <li> I know individuals will vary but I saw a noticeable difference and my eyelash length and thickness within a week.  I&#x27;ve tried other products but this is the best so far!</li>
            <li> Finally i can have pretty eyes. I always had scanty eye lashes and would use layers of mascara to give my eyes that edge.&lt;br /&gt;But since i have been using this i can feel my eye lashes grow. This product comes in the shape of an eye liner. You just have to apply on your upper eye lid the way you apply a liquid eye liner.&lt;br /&gt;It dries up just like an eye liner would except that it is transparent.&lt;br /&gt;IT Nourishes, Repairs, Moisturizes and Protects Hair Follicles and Skin Around Eyelashes and Brows with Natural Ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;The company follows up with customers about their experience with the product which is a very good gesture and makes me feel as  a customer that the company cares about the well being of their customer. This says a lot about a good customer service.&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky to receive this product under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product mainly for my eyebrows to see if they would grow out some more and was hesitant to use it on my eyes.  I have noticed a bit of difference and my eyebrows have grown a little after using the product for about 7 weeks or so now.  I thought the growth would have been greater than it is so I will probably order one more time and if I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
            <li> Being a big fan of Protege products of course I had to give this a try, I have never used any sort of Eyelash growth serum before so I was a little worried and cautious when I put it on making sure I did it right, It did not burn at all or cause any discomfort. I apply it once before bed and again in the morning , I havent been using it long enough to get results yet (only been about a week) but Im liking it so far :) my lashes seem softer, usually they seem a little coarse.</li>
