    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The body wash is great for the gym as it is a body wash &amp; shampoo combined into 1!</li>
            <li>This set by Nivea is an excellent set of grooming products.</li>
            <li>The after-shave balm is also excellent - I&#x27;ve used it for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I like this best as a gift.</li>
            <li>and I must say that it&#x27;s very good!</li>
            <li>This set is just perfect for him.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The sun balm/aftershave lotion is excellent.  </li>
            <li>This Nivea for Men Energy Gift Set is a wonderful item!</li>
            <li>This is an excellent, general-purpose gift set for any occasion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gauche.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, a great set to give for Christmas, for kids going off to college, or for introducing your son to the wonderful world of grooming.</li>
            <li>What a wonderful gift, packaging was very nice.</li>
            <li>They loved them!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great deal for a stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li>Both guys liked the shaving balm the best - saying their skin felt softer and smoother longer after using.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li>Smells great.</li>
            <li>Made great gifts, great value</li>
            <li>They work well, and represent a great value.  </li>
            <li>Nivea for Men Energy will wake you up with its scent and great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s boxed attractively and the price is right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received this along with another order, but must say this is a great idea to give to any man .</li>
            <li>Very nice products, great scent and leaves skin soft/smooth.</li>
            <li>This was amazing!</li>
            <li>A respectable one, but not the best quality.  </li>
            <li>Very nice, good scent, and just the stuff you need on your face after a close shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not convinced about the energy claim but the items are well packaged, smell pleasant without being overpowering, and</li>
            <li>bottle of the body wash/shampoo, which has a bright, almost herbal scent.  </li>
            <li>The items are of good quality</li>
            <li>good husband loved</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s a good value, though if you are going to buy this as a gift, you might want to remove the sticker on the box exclaiming just what a good value it is.</li>
            <li>Good, but not great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does a good job exfoliating the skin and is not harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>all, this is a good set to introduce a guy to this line of products or for a guy who likes Nivea products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap price but very good quality.</li>
            <li>Energy Series of Nivea products is very interesting.</li>
            <li>This is really a nice package of good things any man would like.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This would be a very nice gift set for a person who enjoys strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>The body wash has a nice mint undertone to it.  </li>
            <li>The lip balm is a nice quality touch.</li>
            <li>He liked the way it made his face tingle and cleared his pores.  </li>
            <li>Husband really liked it, it smells nice</li>
            <li>From my perspective the products made his skin feel softer (which I liked)</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t thrilled by the scent because it reminds me of scents my father wore</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say that I was thrilled by</li>
            <li>The after shave was really nice.  </li>
            <li>he is using it and really loving it.  </li>
            <li>the fragrance is nice and clean and not overpowering!!</li>
            <li>It also fades quite quickly, and does a great job of making skin feel nice after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>is a great way to get people to learn about the value of these German-made products and how important it is for men to keep their faces and bodies in shape and healthy.</li>
            <li>The 3-1 hair and body wash is great, I like the smooth feeling on my skin and hair, but is also the reason I took away 1 star, the scent is overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>It felt good and had a very mild scent (but not no-scent.)  </li>
            <li>very strong</li>
            <li>Perfect gift in perfect price .. later wanted to buy again but price was higher..</li>
            <li>My 65 year old thought it was perfect for travel, so I now ordered one for him.</li>
            <li>He also liked that it didn&#x27;t have a perfume-y scent like many face</li>
            <li>Still, it does smell nice and seems to be a competent soil remover.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It would be a perfect &#x27;starter set&#x27; for a young man off to college or whatever.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great introduction of products for men who might not be that excited about using men&#x27;s products...mild fragrance, nice quality, and a selection that is useful!</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great set and at a great price too.</li>
            <li>My package came pretty damaged but great product otherwise</li>
            <li>i got this for a 14 year old for christmas and he liked it!!</li>
            <li>This is a nice gift set for a  man who doesn&#x27;t mind fairly strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>My son said he liked that the scent goes on strong but isn&#x27;t overpowering.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is great but is very fragrant</li>
            <li>GREAT PRICE AND FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li>Of the set, it turned out to be my favorite product, although the dispenser seems a bit on the flimsy side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>My husband seemed impressed that it actually soothed his skin.  </li>
            <li>I love these products.  </li>
            <li>Still, this set works really well for him and would make a great stocking stuffer for the college bound this season.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it to the fellow who is satisfied with the level of quality.</li>
            <li>It is more like a lotion.</li>
            <li>The face scrub is my favorite product.</li>
            <li>This is a nice gift set for men that enjoy the Nivea lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But that makes it a more interesting gift, because it includes things that a man might not otherwise get for himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love all the products in it</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes his skin feel.</li>
            <li>I feel that all my face needs are covered with the 3-in-1 and the aftershave, but it still gives a refreshing feeling to my face.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, very nice produkt</li>
            <li>As for lip balm, it&#x27;s a welcome addition for the climate where I live, although I think this is not something that everyone will require.  </li>
            <li>(b) doesn&#x27;t like all those strong smells most men&#x27;s products have.</li>
            <li>The scent here is likable, but a bit strong and, once again, not for those with sensitivities.&lt;br</li>
            <li>One of the best elements of the Nivea series is the odor - it&#x27;s subtle and pleasant, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about reeking like a gigolo-wannabe after using it.  </li>
            <li>My dad will love thus gift set m nice and manly but just the right hygiene..</li>
            <li>You smell good like a clean man, not like a cucumber, rose, baby, or high school boy&#x27;s overbearing stench.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fresh and nice with a touch of manly.</li>
            <li>It is a nice scent, it is just exceptionally powerful.  </li>
            <li>All the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;included products are useful and together in this set make a really nice gift.</li>
            <li>This set is a refreshing way to get clean.  </li>
            <li>and I have a strong aversion to the smell of mint.</li>
            <li>this is a gift for someone who likes strong scents then they will probably like this.</li>
            <li>will say that the shaving balm is a pretty amazing product when it comes to making skin/stubble</li>
            <li>/&gt;The lip balm is quite good (compare to [[ASIN:B000GG7XGC ChapStick Classic Skin Protectant/Sunscreen, SPF 4, Original, Value Pack, 3 ct.]]).  </li>
            <li>But they&#x27;re great and this is why such a set has</li>
            <li>so I could enjoy it on him as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great set for a teen.</li>
            <li>This is a premium product and I am thrilled to find it in this set that is so reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light on my face and doesn&#x27;t make me break</li>
            <li>He has extremely sensitive skin and was a good sport in even trying this</li>
            <li>The scent is strong enough to smell good, but does not overpower.  </li>
            <li>Normally he doesn&#x27;t use any sort of product before or after shaving but he really liked this so perhaps he&#x27;ll consider continuing to use it after he has used all in the gift set.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I originally got this for the face scrub</li>
            <li>and I noticed a significant change to my face.</li>
            <li>The energy is the &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; feel normal skin gets after using these, but my husband said it kind of burned, like a chemical.  </li>
            <li>The Nivea Energy Series is a great set because it includes several useful products.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I easily recommend this as a trial set or a cheap gift set if you are interested.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special.  </li>
            <li>The set comes with a full size of body wash, face scrub, after shave and lip balm.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a good starter set with some solid products for anyone.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad product/gift for the price.  </li>
            <li>Luckily the balm didn&#x27;t have a taste or smell</li>
            <li>Dove Men Plus Care Body and Face Wash, Fresh Awake, 13.5 oz.]]) is a good, basic body wash.  </li>
            <li>the fragrance is mild and mellow</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually apply after-shave lotions of any kind, but the lotion included with this kit was actually very refreshing  </li>
            <li>This scent, like most men&#x27;s scents, is mild, slightly musky, fresh, and not too sweet, which makes it perfect not only for guys, but for girls like me.</li>
            <li>3-in-1 Body Wash has a light, slightly minty scent, cleans effectively, and rinses easily.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is a great gift set for any man that isn&#x27;t super sensitive to smell!</li>
            <li>It is really hard to shop for that many men at one time and get good quality stuff.</li>
            <li>lip balm is quite nice and not marketed only for men, meaning we both can use</li>
            <li>Much of the time, these sets only exist to allow suppliers to opportunity to package their junk with more appealing items.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a neat set of Nivea products at a nice price.</li>
            <li>The 3-in-1 body wash is terrific for a guy like me who uses a buzz cut - the body wash serves nicely doubles as shampoo.  </li>
            <li>With all the different items it makes a nice gift.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the Q10 actually does much of anything, but it is a good balm and doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy.  </li>
            <li>The action balm is my favorite -</li>
            <li>The lip balm is handy specially now during the dry winter months.</li>
            <li>The all in one body wash with shampoo and conditioner, moisturizer, chap stick and after shave balm all have the same refreshing mint scent combined with a moisturizing clean.  </li>
            <li>Given that I am far from a metrosexual and look at personal grooming as trying to shore up a teetering farmhouse on its last legs, I perhaps am not the best reviewer for the Nivea for Men Energy Gift Set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is also some after-shave lotion, the smell of which is pleasant, and &amp;#34;goes with&amp;#34; the other things, as well as a tube of chapstick, which is unfortunately named &amp;#34;Kiss of Moisture.&amp;#34;  It seems to work OK, but I can&#x27;t in good concience recommend that any man risk being caught with a &amp;#34;Kiss of Moisure&amp;#34; on his person.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always skeptical about purchasing shampoo/body wash combos, but this one works great!</li>
            <li>so exactly what they are supposed to do - though I have my doubts about the energy claim.</li>
            <li>I have to freely openly admit that I love lotions and potions...</li>
            <li>all are normal full sized products</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also a balm that&#x27;s basically lotion, but since it&#x27;s for after shaving, and of course I shave, this is even better than regular lotion.</li>
            <li>Soothes irritated skin and leaves a soft smooth feeling.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave that sticky greasy feeling most do, and that is the reason I don&#x27;t usually like lip balms, so I might use it more</li>
            <li>This is the first time he has used any of their energy products, but they seem to work as advertised.</li>
            <li>, [[ASIN:B00J4YYOWI St. Ives Apricot Scrub, Fresh Skin, 6 Oz]])has a similar masculine scent, but more mild.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the balm and face scrub before and found them to be fantastic in helping feel refreshed and sharp - especially after a good shave.  </li>
            <li>The other items are pretty neat too and the shave gel delivers a nice feel while moisturizing and cleaning the face well.</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that the flat tops make it easy to park the products upside down, so that the contents come out more easily when the levels are</li>
            <li>The only reason it&#x27;s not a 5 star is because he doesn&#x27;t really need the balm, a deodorant in the kit would be much more practical.</li>
            <li>You are sure to delight any recipient with this set, especially at this reasonable price.</li>
            <li>of the four items is very useful, which is nice for a gift set - these things often come with at least one item that you&#x27;ll never use.  </li>
            <li>My first reaction to this entire set is that the fragrance is way too strong.  </li>
            <li>Well, simply because the scent is pretty strong.</li>
            <li>Received exactly as it appears and fast.</li>
            <li>This would be a very nice gift for a guy who has to shave for work but doesn&#x27;t take primping too seriously.</li>
            <li>The only warning being the strong scent of the 3-1 body and hair wash.</li>
            <li>lip balm is fine - not too greasy - but does not appear to be in the same category as the Bert&#x27;s Bees lip</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t want my lover smelling like my dad...</li>
            <li>and it was very well received.</li>
            <li>/&gt;#1 - He was very unimpressed with the packaging.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>but this looked very tempting</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s practical and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>The #2 ingredient after water is polyethylene, so I assume that the &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; comes from itty bitty pieces of that rather than a more manly material like crushed lava.  </li>
            <li>I got this for my son as a part of a present for his Christmas from Santa Mom, and know he is going to enjoy this gift set as it has everything he could need.</li>
            <li>Overall I really enjoy using these products.  </li>
            <li>It does dissipate after the shower, but the residual aroma on your skin and hair is still very noticeable by the time I get to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do not use the face scrub as much as I want to;  </li>
            <li>This set contains a full-sized container of shampoo which smells nice, doubles as liquid soap, and contains enough mint to smell, but not enough to feel.&lt;br /&gt;There is also some face scrub.  </li>
            <li>The grainy texture feels great, and unlike other face scrubs, it does not leave your face dry afterward!</li>
            <li>Good stuff (except the environmentally disastrous beads) with a nice soft scent and at an affordable price!</li>
            <li>I use it every other day to keep my skin feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>in all, it&#x27;s a nice gift set for a stocking or small gift exchange.  </li>
            <li>The assortment of products is pretty good, and you don&#x27;t usually see lip balms in the mix, but in the winter, it is ESSENTIAL.</li>
            <li>The body gel and the face scrub are items that most college males use, but the aftershave and the lip balm aren&#x27;t really things a student would think to buy on a tight budget.</li>
            <li>The lip balm is new to me, but boy do I like this stuff!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not going to be the main attraction</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair very soft which makes it easier to style once you&#x27;re ready to do so.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>skin is left clean and soft with any residue.  </li>
            <li>It is not a thick, greasy product, but seems to blend into your lips leaving them moisturized and supple.</li>
            <li>He also said he did not like it it as a shampoo and prefered his normal brand.</li>
            <li>It has a moderate masculine scent that fades fairly quickly, as well as mint extracts that give a refreshed, tingly feeling after use.  </li>
            <li>It has a fine abrasive that really cleanses your face, removing the oil and dead skin cells.</li>
            <li>--- For the price, it&#x27;s a decent gift for someone who (a) doesn&#x27;t have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>pretty much only get men&#x27;s stuff for body sprays, deodorants, etc.</li>
            <li>selection is slightly eccentric – a separate shampoo and a deodorant would be more obvious than a facial scrub and lip balm.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The Double Action Balm is promoted as chiefly an after shave but is a good overall facial moisturizer, which is necessary after using the facial scrub.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For those others, steer clear and look for something else.</li>
            <li>Personally, I though my husband smelled a bit to much like the makeup counter in a mall after he used the after shaving balm.</li>
            <li>so if you are sensitive to smell this product might not be for you.</li>
            <li>The after shave is very calming and has the same &amp;#34;energy&amp;#34; scent as the body wash.</li>
            <li>I got this almost a month ago for my 19 year old college man for when he is home from school on weekends.</li>
            <li>Purchased for my step dad that has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The lip balm made his lips soft but did not over moisturize or cause his lips to become dependent on the balm; a fear he has about lip products.</li>
            <li>He was adamant after using it twice that he wouldn&#x27;t try it again.  </li>
            <li>I like it because it&#x27;s soft and doesn&#x27;t have any funky flavors added to it.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this set, or any individual component.  </li>
            <li>The facial scrub dried out my skin and body gel is again too strong for my liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I noticed that I get a closer shave when using this face scrub prior to my normal shaving routine.</li>
            <li>(but I did not compare the actual weight to their normal offerings).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although my son liked the Double Action Balm, he said it was pretty thick and not easily absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That at least spared his hair that &amp;#34;dad&amp;#34; fragrance so I could enjoy his hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, the smell of the mint is barely noticeable, if at all, so if you&#x27;re also someone who doesn&#x27;t like mint, don&#x27;t worry about it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;#3 - Body wash and facial scrub -- NOT for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I was given some Nivea shaving balm for sensitive skin last year, and I like it.</li>
            <li>The balm is thicker than the Sensitive version I mentioned above.</li>
            <li>And finally the lip balm has really helped with the dry weather during winter.</li>
            <li>Not a single item in here will be buried away in the bottom drawer of your bathroom.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Energy Double Action Balm\\&quot; is essentially a face moisturizing lotion to use after shaving.  </li>
            <li>Microbeads do a great job of exfoliating dry skin, and leave the skin looking refreshed--but also make it harder to use for a casual face wash after school or work compared to some brands.  </li>
            <li>That boils down to personal preference really though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think the scent is not very memorable, and it fades fast.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> The body wash is great for the gym as it is a body wash &amp; shampoo combined into 1!</li>
            <li> This set by Nivea is an excellent set of grooming products.</li>
            <li> The after-shave balm is also excellent - I&#x27;ve used it for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I like this best as a gift.</li>
            <li> and I must say that it&#x27;s very good!</li>
            <li> This set is just perfect for him.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The sun balm/aftershave lotion is excellent.  </li>
            <li> This Nivea for Men Energy Gift Set is a wonderful item!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent, general-purpose gift set for any occasion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gauche.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, a great set to give for Christmas, for kids going off to college, or for introducing your son to the wonderful world of grooming.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful gift, packaging was very nice.</li>
            <li> They loved them!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great deal for a stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> Both guys liked the shaving balm the best - saying their skin felt softer and smoother longer after using.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li> Smells great.</li>
            <li> Made great gifts, great value</li>
            <li> They work well, and represent a great value.  </li>
            <li> Nivea for Men Energy will wake you up with its scent and great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s boxed attractively and the price is right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received this along with another order, but must say this is a great idea to give to any man .</li>
            <li> Very nice products, great scent and leaves skin soft/smooth.</li>
            <li> This was amazing!</li>
            <li> A respectable one, but not the best quality.  </li>
            <li> Very nice, good scent, and just the stuff you need on your face after a close shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced about the energy claim but the items are well packaged, smell pleasant without being overpowering, and</li>
            <li> bottle of the body wash/shampoo, which has a bright, almost herbal scent.  </li>
            <li> The items are of good quality</li>
            <li> good husband loved</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s a good value, though if you are going to buy this as a gift, you might want to remove the sticker on the box exclaiming just what a good value it is.</li>
            <li> Good, but not great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does a good job exfoliating the skin and is not harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> all, this is a good set to introduce a guy to this line of products or for a guy who likes Nivea products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap price but very good quality.</li>
            <li> Energy Series of Nivea products is very interesting.</li>
            <li> This is really a nice package of good things any man would like.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This would be a very nice gift set for a person who enjoys strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> The body wash has a nice mint undertone to it.  </li>
            <li> The lip balm is a nice quality touch.</li>
            <li> He liked the way it made his face tingle and cleared his pores.  </li>
            <li> Husband really liked it, it smells nice</li>
            <li> From my perspective the products made his skin feel softer (which I liked)</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t thrilled by the scent because it reminds me of scents my father wore</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say that I was thrilled by</li>
            <li> The after shave was really nice.  </li>
            <li> he is using it and really loving it.  </li>
            <li> the fragrance is nice and clean and not overpowering!!</li>
            <li> It also fades quite quickly, and does a great job of making skin feel nice after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> is a great way to get people to learn about the value of these German-made products and how important it is for men to keep their faces and bodies in shape and healthy.</li>
            <li> The 3-1 hair and body wash is great, I like the smooth feeling on my skin and hair, but is also the reason I took away 1 star, the scent is overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> It felt good and had a very mild scent (but not no-scent.)  </li>
            <li> very strong</li>
            <li> Perfect gift in perfect price .. later wanted to buy again but price was higher..</li>
            <li> My 65 year old thought it was perfect for travel, so I now ordered one for him.</li>
            <li> He also liked that it didn&#x27;t have a perfume-y scent like many face</li>
            <li> Still, it does smell nice and seems to be a competent soil remover.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It would be a perfect &#x27;starter set&#x27; for a young man off to college or whatever.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a great introduction of products for men who might not be that excited about using men&#x27;s products...mild fragrance, nice quality, and a selection that is useful!</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great set and at a great price too.</li>
            <li> My package came pretty damaged but great product otherwise</li>
            <li> i got this for a 14 year old for christmas and he liked it!!</li>
            <li> This is a nice gift set for a  man who doesn&#x27;t mind fairly strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> My son said he liked that the scent goes on strong but isn&#x27;t overpowering.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is great but is very fragrant</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE AND FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li> Of the set, it turned out to be my favorite product, although the dispenser seems a bit on the flimsy side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> My husband seemed impressed that it actually soothed his skin.  </li>
            <li> I love these products.  </li>
            <li> Still, this set works really well for him and would make a great stocking stuffer for the college bound this season.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it to the fellow who is satisfied with the level of quality.</li>
            <li> It is more like a lotion.</li>
            <li> The face scrub is my favorite product.</li>
            <li> This is a nice gift set for men that enjoy the Nivea lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But that makes it a more interesting gift, because it includes things that a man might not otherwise get for himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love all the products in it</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes his skin feel.</li>
            <li> I feel that all my face needs are covered with the 3-in-1 and the aftershave, but it still gives a refreshing feeling to my face.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping, very nice produkt</li>
            <li> As for lip balm, it&#x27;s a welcome addition for the climate where I live, although I think this is not something that everyone will require.  </li>
            <li> (b) doesn&#x27;t like all those strong smells most men&#x27;s products have.</li>
            <li> The scent here is likable, but a bit strong and, once again, not for those with sensitivities.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One of the best elements of the Nivea series is the odor - it&#x27;s subtle and pleasant, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about reeking like a gigolo-wannabe after using it.  </li>
            <li> My dad will love thus gift set m nice and manly but just the right hygiene..</li>
            <li> You smell good like a clean man, not like a cucumber, rose, baby, or high school boy&#x27;s overbearing stench.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fresh and nice with a touch of manly.</li>
            <li> It is a nice scent, it is just exceptionally powerful.  </li>
            <li> All the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;included products are useful and together in this set make a really nice gift.</li>
            <li> This set is a refreshing way to get clean.  </li>
            <li> and I have a strong aversion to the smell of mint.</li>
            <li> this is a gift for someone who likes strong scents then they will probably like this.</li>
            <li> will say that the shaving balm is a pretty amazing product when it comes to making skin/stubble</li>
            <li> /&gt;The lip balm is quite good (compare to [[ASIN:B000GG7XGC ChapStick Classic Skin Protectant/Sunscreen, SPF 4, Original, Value Pack, 3 ct.]]).  </li>
            <li> But they&#x27;re great and this is why such a set has</li>
            <li> so I could enjoy it on him as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a great set for a teen.</li>
            <li> This is a premium product and I am thrilled to find it in this set that is so reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light on my face and doesn&#x27;t make me break</li>
            <li> He has extremely sensitive skin and was a good sport in even trying this</li>
            <li> The scent is strong enough to smell good, but does not overpower.  </li>
            <li> Normally he doesn&#x27;t use any sort of product before or after shaving but he really liked this so perhaps he&#x27;ll consider continuing to use it after he has used all in the gift set.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I originally got this for the face scrub</li>
            <li> and I noticed a significant change to my face.</li>
            <li> The energy is the &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; feel normal skin gets after using these, but my husband said it kind of burned, like a chemical.  </li>
            <li> The Nivea Energy Series is a great set because it includes several useful products.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I easily recommend this as a trial set or a cheap gift set if you are interested.  </li>
            <li> Nothing special.  </li>
            <li> The set comes with a full size of body wash, face scrub, after shave and lip balm.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a good starter set with some solid products for anyone.  </li>
            <li> Not a bad product/gift for the price.  </li>
            <li> Luckily the balm didn&#x27;t have a taste or smell</li>
            <li> Dove Men Plus Care Body and Face Wash, Fresh Awake, 13.5 oz.]]) is a good, basic body wash.  </li>
            <li> the fragrance is mild and mellow</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually apply after-shave lotions of any kind, but the lotion included with this kit was actually very refreshing  </li>
            <li> This scent, like most men&#x27;s scents, is mild, slightly musky, fresh, and not too sweet, which makes it perfect not only for guys, but for girls like me.</li>
            <li> 3-in-1 Body Wash has a light, slightly minty scent, cleans effectively, and rinses easily.  </li>
            <li> Overall this is a great gift set for any man that isn&#x27;t super sensitive to smell!</li>
            <li> It is really hard to shop for that many men at one time and get good quality stuff.</li>
            <li> lip balm is quite nice and not marketed only for men, meaning we both can use</li>
            <li> Much of the time, these sets only exist to allow suppliers to opportunity to package their junk with more appealing items.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a neat set of Nivea products at a nice price.</li>
            <li> The 3-in-1 body wash is terrific for a guy like me who uses a buzz cut - the body wash serves nicely doubles as shampoo.  </li>
            <li> With all the different items it makes a nice gift.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the Q10 actually does much of anything, but it is a good balm and doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy.  </li>
            <li> The action balm is my favorite -</li>
            <li> The lip balm is handy specially now during the dry winter months.</li>
            <li> The all in one body wash with shampoo and conditioner, moisturizer, chap stick and after shave balm all have the same refreshing mint scent combined with a moisturizing clean.  </li>
            <li> Given that I am far from a metrosexual and look at personal grooming as trying to shore up a teetering farmhouse on its last legs, I perhaps am not the best reviewer for the Nivea for Men Energy Gift Set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is also some after-shave lotion, the smell of which is pleasant, and &amp;#34;goes with&amp;#34; the other things, as well as a tube of chapstick, which is unfortunately named &amp;#34;Kiss of Moisture.&amp;#34;  It seems to work OK, but I can&#x27;t in good concience recommend that any man risk being caught with a &amp;#34;Kiss of Moisure&amp;#34; on his person.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical about purchasing shampoo/body wash combos, but this one works great!</li>
            <li> so exactly what they are supposed to do - though I have my doubts about the energy claim.</li>
            <li> I have to freely openly admit that I love lotions and potions...</li>
            <li> all are normal full sized products</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also a balm that&#x27;s basically lotion, but since it&#x27;s for after shaving, and of course I shave, this is even better than regular lotion.</li>
            <li> Soothes irritated skin and leaves a soft smooth feeling.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave that sticky greasy feeling most do, and that is the reason I don&#x27;t usually like lip balms, so I might use it more</li>
            <li> This is the first time he has used any of their energy products, but they seem to work as advertised.</li>
            <li> , [[ASIN:B00J4YYOWI St. Ives Apricot Scrub, Fresh Skin, 6 Oz]])has a similar masculine scent, but more mild.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the balm and face scrub before and found them to be fantastic in helping feel refreshed and sharp - especially after a good shave.  </li>
            <li> The other items are pretty neat too and the shave gel delivers a nice feel while moisturizing and cleaning the face well.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that the flat tops make it easy to park the products upside down, so that the contents come out more easily when the levels are</li>
            <li> The only reason it&#x27;s not a 5 star is because he doesn&#x27;t really need the balm, a deodorant in the kit would be much more practical.</li>
            <li> You are sure to delight any recipient with this set, especially at this reasonable price.</li>
            <li> of the four items is very useful, which is nice for a gift set - these things often come with at least one item that you&#x27;ll never use.  </li>
            <li> My first reaction to this entire set is that the fragrance is way too strong.  </li>
            <li> Well, simply because the scent is pretty strong.</li>
            <li> Received exactly as it appears and fast.</li>
            <li> This would be a very nice gift for a guy who has to shave for work but doesn&#x27;t take primping too seriously.</li>
            <li> The only warning being the strong scent of the 3-1 body and hair wash.</li>
            <li> lip balm is fine - not too greasy - but does not appear to be in the same category as the Bert&#x27;s Bees lip</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t want my lover smelling like my dad...</li>
            <li> and it was very well received.</li>
            <li> /&gt;#1 - He was very unimpressed with the packaging.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> but this looked very tempting</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s practical and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> The #2 ingredient after water is polyethylene, so I assume that the &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; comes from itty bitty pieces of that rather than a more manly material like crushed lava.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my son as a part of a present for his Christmas from Santa Mom, and know he is going to enjoy this gift set as it has everything he could need.</li>
            <li> Overall I really enjoy using these products.  </li>
            <li> It does dissipate after the shower, but the residual aroma on your skin and hair is still very noticeable by the time I get to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not use the face scrub as much as I want to;  </li>
            <li> This set contains a full-sized container of shampoo which smells nice, doubles as liquid soap, and contains enough mint to smell, but not enough to feel.&lt;br /&gt;There is also some face scrub.  </li>
            <li> The grainy texture feels great, and unlike other face scrubs, it does not leave your face dry afterward!</li>
            <li> Good stuff (except the environmentally disastrous beads) with a nice soft scent and at an affordable price!</li>
            <li> I use it every other day to keep my skin feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> in all, it&#x27;s a nice gift set for a stocking or small gift exchange.  </li>
            <li> The assortment of products is pretty good, and you don&#x27;t usually see lip balms in the mix, but in the winter, it is ESSENTIAL.</li>
            <li> The body gel and the face scrub are items that most college males use, but the aftershave and the lip balm aren&#x27;t really things a student would think to buy on a tight budget.</li>
            <li> The lip balm is new to me, but boy do I like this stuff!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to be the main attraction</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair very soft which makes it easier to style once you&#x27;re ready to do so.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> skin is left clean and soft with any residue.  </li>
            <li> It is not a thick, greasy product, but seems to blend into your lips leaving them moisturized and supple.</li>
            <li> He also said he did not like it it as a shampoo and prefered his normal brand.</li>
            <li> It has a moderate masculine scent that fades fairly quickly, as well as mint extracts that give a refreshed, tingly feeling after use.  </li>
            <li> It has a fine abrasive that really cleanses your face, removing the oil and dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> --- For the price, it&#x27;s a decent gift for someone who (a) doesn&#x27;t have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> pretty much only get men&#x27;s stuff for body sprays, deodorants, etc.</li>
            <li> selection is slightly eccentric – a separate shampoo and a deodorant would be more obvious than a facial scrub and lip balm.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The Double Action Balm is promoted as chiefly an after shave but is a good overall facial moisturizer, which is necessary after using the facial scrub.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For those others, steer clear and look for something else.</li>
            <li> Personally, I though my husband smelled a bit to much like the makeup counter in a mall after he used the after shaving balm.</li>
            <li> so if you are sensitive to smell this product might not be for you.</li>
            <li> The after shave is very calming and has the same &amp;#34;energy&amp;#34; scent as the body wash.</li>
            <li> I got this almost a month ago for my 19 year old college man for when he is home from school on weekends.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my step dad that has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The lip balm made his lips soft but did not over moisturize or cause his lips to become dependent on the balm; a fear he has about lip products.</li>
            <li> He was adamant after using it twice that he wouldn&#x27;t try it again.  </li>
            <li> I like it because it&#x27;s soft and doesn&#x27;t have any funky flavors added to it.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this set, or any individual component.  </li>
            <li> The facial scrub dried out my skin and body gel is again too strong for my liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed that I get a closer shave when using this face scrub prior to my normal shaving routine.</li>
            <li> (but I did not compare the actual weight to their normal offerings).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although my son liked the Double Action Balm, he said it was pretty thick and not easily absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That at least spared his hair that &amp;#34;dad&amp;#34; fragrance so I could enjoy his hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, the smell of the mint is barely noticeable, if at all, so if you&#x27;re also someone who doesn&#x27;t like mint, don&#x27;t worry about it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;#3 - Body wash and facial scrub -- NOT for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I was given some Nivea shaving balm for sensitive skin last year, and I like it.</li>
            <li> The balm is thicker than the Sensitive version I mentioned above.</li>
            <li> And finally the lip balm has really helped with the dry weather during winter.</li>
            <li> Not a single item in here will be buried away in the bottom drawer of your bathroom.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Energy Double Action Balm\\&quot; is essentially a face moisturizing lotion to use after shaving.  </li>
            <li> Microbeads do a great job of exfoliating dry skin, and leave the skin looking refreshed--but also make it harder to use for a casual face wash after school or work compared to some brands.  </li>
            <li> That boils down to personal preference really though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think the scent is not very memorable, and it fades fast.</li>
            <li> Said it&#x27;s exactly like plain Chapstick, maybe even harder to apply.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the scent is almost uncomfortable it is so strong.  </li>
            <li> They are not the cheapest men&#x27;s face and body products, but certainly not the most expensive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is masculine – not sweet or overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this set for my eighteen year-old son who is too mature for AXE products, but doesn&#x27;t prefer heavy colognes.  </li>
            <li> The sent is not masculine, but rather I&#x27;d describe it as \\&quot;clean\\&quot; and \\&quot;fresh,\\&quot; almost like a soap scent.  </li>
            <li> I like the extra clean feeling after I use it, especially on days when I get dirty or sweaty working</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually purchase men-care products for myself simply because I&#x27;m not sure exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> only NEGATIVE COMMENT about this set;  A big $9.99 BONUS sticker was affixed to the outside of the box and couldn&#x27;t be removed without ripping the box.  </li>
            <li> I would not normally buy him drugstore brands</li>
            <li> It was for the body and the hair but &amp;#34;energizing&amp;#34; seems like an odd thing to claim as a third use for the product.</li>
            <li> The 3-in-1 shampoo, conditioner, body wash is convenient, especially for travelling when you&#x27;re tight on space and can&#x27;t find room for 3 separate bottles.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the blue gift box</li>
            <li> one item I would not recommend is the balm, at least not to those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It works well, isn&#x27;t irritating, and very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It arrived faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> for people who prefer neutral/no scent items this is certainly not the one to get.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That being said, for what it is, if you get past the silly &amp;#34;Energy&amp;#34; label, this is a fine ensemble</li>
            <li> The product is scented so a little go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeper!</li>
            <li> other chap</li>
            <li> The smell is just right...not too overpowering or nauseating like some other men&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> In comparison to other products of these types that I use these are almost over powering.</li>
            <li> He struggles with shaving because his facial hair is very thick but he does not like facial hair</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t hard to get into, but it&#x27;s all that extra clamshell packaging that is ruining our planet</li>
            <li> *Note -- These products have been handed down to my teenaged son.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s in was slightly battered when it arrived.</li>
            <li> lip balm is of little use to me as I don&#x27;t typically use it, but I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> face scrub is a little hit and miss for me.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Nivea for Men products for a few years.  </li>
            <li> Usually when I use a scrub my face feels ridiculously tight afterwards, and this happens with this face scrub as well.  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not the worst sensation in the world and my skin does look better after using it over a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually like some of the products that Nivea has.  </li>
            <li> Nivea was generous with the sizes, too, as usually gift sets include sample sized portions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing terribly fancy, but for most men that is a plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nivea for Men Energy Gift Set contains a 3-in-1 body wash, a face scrub, an after-shave lotion/balm, and a lip</li>
            <li> I have a separate tub/shower arrangement, and inside the small enclosed shower stall</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally the 3-in-1 body wash was confusing to him...</li>
            <li> /&gt;You should seriously consider this as a gift option.</li>
            <li> low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;Energy&#x27; marketing nonsense is slightly irritating, but that&#x27;s not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I personally like to rate gift sets by the quality of their worst item.</li>
            <li> My husband suffers from that and the balm irritated his skin post-shave.</li>
            <li> I hate girly smells and</li>
            <li> I hate because they wreck the environment</li>
            <li> A bargain-priced and boringly sensible gift, which is often just what you want.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a nice gift set for a  man who doesn&#x27;t mind fairly strong fragrance. Personally, I though my husband smelled a bit to much like the makeup counter in a mall after he used the after shaving balm. The same goes for the shampoo/body wash and facial cleanser -- all three contain very strong fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that the shaving balm is a pretty amazing product when it comes to making skin/stubble soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lip balm is quite nice and not marketed only for men, meaning we both can use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be a very nice gift set for a person who enjoys strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> I personally like to rate gift sets by the quality of their worst item. Much of the time, these sets only exist to allow suppliers to opportunity to package their junk with more appealing items. Thankfully, that wasn&#x27;t the case here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All four items that come in this set are items that have practical purposes that the recipient would actually use. I thought instantly of college students when I saw this. The body gel and the face scrub are items that most college males use, but the aftershave and the lip balm aren&#x27;t really things a student would think to buy on a tight budget. But they&#x27;re great and this is why such a set has value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great deal for a stocking stuffer. Any male will have plenty of ways to use all this stuff. Not a single item in here will be buried away in the bottom drawer of your bathroom. Which tells you all you need to know about this set.</li>
            <li> The set comes with a full size of body wash, face scrub, after shave and lip balm. The body wash is great for the gym as it is a body wash &amp; shampoo combined into 1! The smell is great but is very fragrant so if you are sensitive to smell this product might not be for you. For me, I personally like the smell (it&#x27;s almost a bit citrusy). The face scrub works well as it is recommended to use before you shave. I noticed that I get a closer shave when using this face scrub prior to my normal shaving routine. The after shave is very calming and has the same &amp;#34;energy&amp;#34; scent as the body wash. And finally the lip balm has really helped with the dry weather during winter. Overall this is a great gift set for any man that isn&#x27;t super sensitive to smell!</li>
            <li> This set by Nivea is an excellent set of grooming products. There are a total of four items in all: the energy 3-in-1 body wash, the face scrub, the balm and the lip care. I was a bit worried when I saw the labeling on the body wash as it says it has mint in it and I have a strong aversion to the smell of mint. However, the smell of the mint is barely noticeable, if at all, so if you&#x27;re also someone who doesn&#x27;t like mint, don&#x27;t worry about it. The other items are pretty neat too and the shave gel delivers a nice feel while moisturizing and cleaning the face well. Overall, this is a neat set of Nivea products at a nice price.</li>
            <li> I usually like some of the products that Nivea has.  My first reaction to this entire set is that the fragrance is way too strong.  You could call it Niveaxe.  The facial scrub dried out my skin and body gel is again too strong for my liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come on, not all guys want to smell like walking cologne factory.</li>
            <li> Given that I am far from a metrosexual and look at personal grooming as trying to shore up a teetering farmhouse on its last legs, I perhaps am not the best reviewer for the Nivea for Men Energy Gift Set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, for what it is, if you get past the silly &amp;#34;Energy&amp;#34; label, this is a fine ensemble product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gift set includes four elements - 3-in-1 body wash, after-shave balm, face scrub, and a stick of lip balm.  The 3-in-1 body wash is terrific for a guy like me who uses a buzz cut - the body wash serves nicely doubles as shampoo.  One of the best elements of the Nivea series is the odor - it&#x27;s subtle and pleasant, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about reeking like a gigolo-wannabe after using it.  The body wash has a nice mint undertone to it.  The after-shave balm is also excellent - I&#x27;ve used it for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The face scrub is a little hit and miss for me.  Usually when I use a scrub my face feels ridiculously tight afterwards, and this happens with this face scrub as well.  However, it&#x27;s not the worst sensation in the world and my skin does look better after using it over a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lip balm is fine - not too greasy - but does not appear to be in the same category as the Bert&#x27;s Bees lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each of the four items is very useful, which is nice for a gift set - these things often come with at least one item that you&#x27;ll never use.  This would be a very nice gift for a guy who has to shave for work but doesn&#x27;t take primping too seriously.</li>
            <li> I got this almost a month ago for my 19 year old college man for when he is home from school on weekends. My 65 year old thought it was perfect for travel, so I now ordered one for him. Both guys liked the shaving balm the best - saying their skin felt softer and smoother longer after using. The lip balm is a nice quality touch. The product is scented so a little go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeper!</li>
            <li> What a wonderful gift, packaging was very nice. The items are of good quality but I like this best as a gift. Fresh and nice with a touch of manly.</li>
            <li> I ordered this set for my eighteen year-old son who is too mature for AXE products, but doesn&#x27;t prefer heavy colognes.  The Nivea Energy Series is a great set because it includes several useful products.  Nivea was generous with the sizes, too, as usually gift sets include sample sized portions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3-in-1 Body Wash has a light, slightly minty scent, cleans effectively, and rinses easily.  My son said he liked that the scent goes on strong but isn&#x27;t overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Face Scrub was a big hit with my son.  He liked the way it made his face tingle and cleared his pores.  He also liked that it didn&#x27;t have a perfume-y scent like many face cleaners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ChapStick/Lip Balm worked as well as other chap sticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although my son liked the Double Action Balm, he said it was pretty thick and not easily absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only NEGATIVE COMMENT about this set;  A big $9.99 BONUS sticker was affixed to the outside of the box and couldn&#x27;t be removed without ripping the box.  I don&#x27;t like the idea of giving a gift with the price PLASTERED on the box.  It&#x27;s gauche.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, a great set to give for Christmas, for kids going off to college, or for introducing your son to the wonderful world of grooming.</li>
            <li> Very nice products, great scent and leaves skin soft/smooth.</li>
            <li> Husband really liked it, it smells nice and it&#x27;s a great deal. With all the different items it makes a nice gift. I&#x27;d recommend it as a gift for your husband, boyfriend or a family member.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE AND FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, very nice produkt</li>
            <li> Smells great. Purchased for my step dad that has sensitive skin. He seemed to like it.</li>
            <li> My partner used every one of the four items in this gift set for 20 days.  He says that there is &amp;#34;ample supply&amp;#34; in the gift set and he should have enough of the products for another 20 days to two months. From my perspective the products made his skin feel softer (which I liked) but I wasn&#x27;t thrilled by the scent because it reminds me of scents my father wore and I really don&#x27;t want my lover smelling like my dad... *shudder*.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lip balm made his lips soft but did not over moisturize or cause his lips to become dependent on the balm; a fear he has about lip products. Luckily the balm didn&#x27;t have a taste or smell so I could enjoy it on him as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving balm cooled his face after shaving without any sting. He struggles with shaving because his facial hair is very thick but he does not like facial hair so he must shave. Normally he doesn&#x27;t use any sort of product before or after shaving but he really liked this so perhaps he&#x27;ll consider continuing to use it after he has used all in the gift set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The facial scrub helped with his level of skin blemishes and also helped his skin be softer and smoother.  However this had the strongest of that &amp;#34;dad&amp;#34; scent so I can&#x27;t say that I was thrilled by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally the 3-in-1 body wash was confusing to him... what was the third part? It was for the body and the hair but &amp;#34;energizing&amp;#34; seems like an odd thing to claim as a third use for the product. He also said he did not like it it as a shampoo and prefered his normal brand. That at least spared his hair that &amp;#34;dad&amp;#34; fragrance so I could enjoy his hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above review was written with consultation of my partner to whom I gave this gift set.</li>
            <li> I purchased this gift set for myself. I&#x27;m always skeptical about purchasing shampoo/body wash combos, but this one works great! It leaves your hair very soft which makes it easier to style once you&#x27;re ready to do so. I originally got this for the face scrub and I must say that it&#x27;s very good! I&#x27;ve used it twice now and I noticed a significant change to my face. The grainy texture feels great, and unlike other face scrubs, it does not leave your face dry afterward! I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Made great gifts, great value</li>
            <li> Smells good husband loved</li>
            <li> Perfect gift in perfect price .. later wanted to buy again but price was higher.. I wish I get same deal again.!</li>
            <li> Bottom line: Nivea for Men Energy Gift Set has four solid products for basic hygiene needs.  Nothing terribly fancy, but for most men that is a plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nivea for Men Energy Gift Set contains a 3-in-1 body wash, a face scrub, an after-shave lotion/balm, and a lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3-in-1 body wash (compare to [[ASIN:B008VSYO5A Dove Men Plus Care Body and Face Wash, Fresh Awake, 13.5 oz.]]) is a good, basic body wash.  It has a moderate masculine scent that fades fairly quickly, as well as mint extracts that give a refreshed, tingly feeling after use.  It works well, isn&#x27;t irritating, and very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The face scrub (compare to [[ASIN:B000FGZ31U Shiseido Men Cleansing Foam Cleanser for Men, 125ml/4.6oz]], [[ASIN:B00J4YYOWI St. Ives Apricot Scrub, Fresh Skin, 6 Oz]])has a similar masculine scent, but more mild.  Microbeads do a great job of exfoliating dry skin, and leave the skin looking refreshed--but also make it harder to use for a casual face wash after school or work compared to some brands.  Still, it does the job quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;Energy Double Action Balm\\&quot; is essentially a face moisturizing lotion to use after shaving.  It is not an alcohol based \\&quot;lotion\\&quot;, but face/hand/body type lotion (compare to [[ASIN:B001E96L6S Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion, 8-Ounce Tube (Pack of 3)]]).  The sent is not masculine, but rather I&#x27;d describe it as \\&quot;clean\\&quot; and \\&quot;fresh,\\&quot; almost like a soap scent.  It also fades quite quickly, and does a great job of making skin feel nice after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lip balm is quite good (compare to [[ASIN:B000GG7XGC ChapStick Classic Skin Protectant/Sunscreen, SPF 4, Original, Value Pack, 3 ct.]]).  It is unscented, and works well for hours despite eating and drinking.  Of the set, it turned out to be my favorite product, although the dispenser seems a bit on the flimsy side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good starter set with some solid products for anyone.  They work well, and represent a great value.  Recommended!mmended!</li>
            <li> My package came pretty damaged but great product otherwise</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap price but very good quality. Love it.</li>
            <li> Everything was just like in the picture.I bought it as a gift and it was very well received. It arrived faster than I expected.The only complaint I have is that the blue gift box it&#x27;s in was slightly battered when it arrived.</li>
            <li> My husband and my sons all like the Nivea products in this set. The 3-in-1 shampoo, conditioner, body wash is convenient, especially for travelling when you&#x27;re tight on space and can&#x27;t find room for 3 separate bottles. The smell is just right...not too overpowering or nauseating like some other men&#x27;s products. Also, it&#x27;s a good value, though if you are going to buy this as a gift, you might want to remove the sticker on the box exclaiming just what a good value it is.</li>
            <li> Review is based on  my husbands use of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1 - He was very unimpressed with the packaging.  It wasn&#x27;t hard to get into, but it&#x27;s all that extra clamshell packaging that is ruining our planet and it&#x27;s got to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2 - The after shave was really nice.  It felt good and had a very mild scent (but not no-scent.)  My husband seemed impressed that it actually soothed his skin.  He has extremely sensitive skin and was a good sport in even trying this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#3 - Body wash and facial scrub -- NOT for sensitive skin.  The energy is the &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; feel normal skin gets after using these, but my husband said it kind of burned, like a chemical.  He was adamant after using it twice that he wouldn&#x27;t try it again.  **Note -- These products have been handed down to my teenaged son.  He wasn&#x27;t as keen, but my motherly instincts are telling me he doesn&#x27;t like the low scent.  He likes his uber-stinky Axe...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#4 - Lip balm.  Nothing special.  Said it&#x27;s exactly like plain Chapstick, maybe even harder to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final conclusion --- For the price, it&#x27;s a decent gift for someone who (a) doesn&#x27;t have sensitive skin and (b) doesn&#x27;t like all those strong smells most men&#x27;s products have.</li>
            <li> Received exactly as it appears and fast. Thanks</li>
            <li> Not a bad product/gift for the price.  It has a variety of products that is practical for any man--even one that is not into body sets.</li>
            <li> I love these products.  I&#x27;ve used the balm and face scrub before and found them to be fantastic in helping feel refreshed and sharp - especially after a good shave.  I just used the shower wash and feel the same way.  Overall this is a great set and at a great price too.</li>
            <li> This is a great set for a teen. My nephew is as low maintenance as they get and always on the go. This set is just perfect for him. He loves the convenience of the 3 in 1 shower gel/shampoo/wash and keeps it in his bag for after sport/practice. The face scrub works well with his oily skin and breakouts. The lip balm is handy specially now during the dry winter months. The only reason it&#x27;s not a 5 star is because he doesn&#x27;t really need the balm, a deodorant in the kit would be much more practical. Still, this set works really well for him and would make a great stocking stuffer for the college bound this season.</li>
            <li> This is really a nice package of good things any man would like. I&#x27;m not convinced about the energy claim but the items are well packaged, smell pleasant without being overpowering, and so exactly what they are supposed to do - though I have my doubts about the energy claim.</li>
            <li> This set is a refreshing way to get clean.  The all in one body wash with shampoo and conditioner, moisturizer, chap stick and after shave balm all have the same refreshing mint scent combined with a moisturizing clean.  Nivea for Men Energy will wake you up with its scent and great feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your skin is left clean and soft with any residue.  The scent is strong enough to smell good, but does not overpower.  You do not need cologne after this set.  Each product develops a stronger layer of scent.  You smell good like a clean man, not like a cucumber, rose, baby, or high school boy&#x27;s overbearing stench.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this set, or any individual component.  I would especially recommend this for a Christmas present. You are sure to delight any recipient with this set, especially at this reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have to freely openly admit that I love lotions and potions...and so does my husband.  I would not normally buy him drugstore brands but this looked very tempting so I thought we would try it.  We both use the shower gel...the fragrance is mild and mellow and I don&#x27;t mind it at all.  He loves the face scrub because it&#x27;s gentle...loves the lip balm...and although he was unsure of the balm...he is using it and really loving it.  This is a great introduction of products for men who might not be that excited about using men&#x27;s products...mild fragrance, nice quality, and a selection that is useful!</li>
            <li> This is one of those gift sets that&#x27;s a throw in, stocking stuffer type gift. It&#x27;s not going to be the main attraction but it&#x27;s practical and reasonably priced. Body Wash, face wash, after shave, and lip balm all are normal full sized products (but I did not compare the actual weight to their normal offerings). There&#x27;s a lot of value here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why the three stars then? Well, simply because the scent is pretty strong. for people who prefer neutral/no scent items this is certainly not the one to get. In comparison to other products of these types that I use these are almost over powering. That boils down to personal preference really though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is a gift for someone who likes strong scents then they will probably like this. For those others, steer clear and look for something else.</li>
            <li> Well, heck, who doesn&#x27;t appreciate a bargain on a hygiene kit? This may be yet another box of bath stuff but it is a collection of full-sized products that do their job. It&#x27;s boxed attractively and the price is right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind this is a drug store brand. A respectable one, but not the best quality.  I&#x27;d recommend it to the fellow who is satisfied with the level of quality. Good, but not great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one item I would not recommend is the balm, at least not to those with sensitive skin. My husband suffers from that and the balm irritated his skin post-shave. The scent here is likable, but a bit strong and, once again, not for those with sensitivities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a nice gift set for a stocking or small gift exchange.  Just watch out for skin sensitivities.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nivea products for years. They are not the cheapest men&#x27;s face and body products, but certainly not the most expensive. I was given some Nivea shaving balm for sensitive skin last year, and I like it. I think the scent is not very memorable, and it fades fast. My spouse thinks it has a medicinal smell, but it doesn&#x27;t linger. Still, it is a balm, and after shaving (especially in Winter), you need some pore-closing and moisturizing to get you face in shape for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Energy Series of Nivea products is very interesting. The balm is thicker than the Sensitive version I mentioned above. It is more like a lotion. Very nice, good scent, and just the stuff you need on your face after a close shave. The body wash has another fragrance and lathers well. I like it and it will last me for several months of showers. The face scrub is my favorite product. It has a fine abrasive that really cleanses your face, removing the oil and dead skin cells. I use it every other day to keep my skin feeling very clean. This is a premium product and I am thrilled to find it in this set that is so reasonably priced. The lip balm is new to me, but boy do I like this stuff! It is not a thick, greasy product, but seems to blend into your lips leaving them moisturized and supple. Nivea deserves credit for offering these premium products at an unheard of price. Separately, they would cost about $21.00.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great way to get people to learn about the value of these German-made products and how important it is for men to keep their faces and bodies in shape and healthy. I&#x27;m getting a bunch of these for gifts for my sons and brothers.</li>
            <li> This set contains a full-sized container of shampoo which smells nice, doubles as liquid soap, and contains enough mint to smell, but not enough to feel.&lt;br /&gt;There is also some face scrub.  The #2 ingredient after water is polyethylene, so I assume that the &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; comes from itty bitty pieces of that rather than a more manly material like crushed lava.  Still, it does smell nice and seems to be a competent soil remover.&lt;br /&gt;There is also some after-shave lotion, the smell of which is pleasant, and &amp;#34;goes with&amp;#34; the other things, as well as a tube of chapstick, which is unfortunately named &amp;#34;Kiss of Moisture.&amp;#34;  It seems to work OK, but I can&#x27;t in good concience recommend that any man risk being caught with a &amp;#34;Kiss of Moisure&amp;#34; on his person.</li>
            <li> i got this for a 14 year old for christmas and he liked it!! the fragrance is nice and clean and not overpowering!!</li>
            <li> I received this along with another order, but must say this is a great idea to give to any man . I got this for my son as a part of a present for his Christmas from Santa Mom, and know he is going to enjoy this gift set as it has everything he could need.</li>
            <li> I hate girly smells and pretty much only get men&#x27;s stuff for body sprays, deodorants, etc. This scent, like most men&#x27;s scents, is mild, slightly musky, fresh, and not too sweet, which makes it perfect not only for guys, but for girls like me. The assortment of products is pretty good, and you don&#x27;t usually see lip balms in the mix, but in the winter, it is ESSENTIAL. There&#x27;s also a balm that&#x27;s basically lotion, but since it&#x27;s for after shaving, and of course I shave, this is even better than regular lotion. There&#x27;s a face scrub that has those micro dads I hate because they wreck the environment (it&#x27;s horrible--look it up sometime), and lastly a body wash. Good stuff (except the environmentally disastrous beads) with a nice soft scent and at an affordable price!</li>
            <li> I have been using Nivea for Men products for a few years.  This is a nice gift set for men that enjoy the Nivea lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what you get:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bottle of the body wash/shampoo, which has a bright, almost herbal scent.  I like it because it rinses well.  I don&#x27;t often use it as a shampoo, though, because it makes my hair feel a bit stripped.  But it&#x27;ll do in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tube of the face scrub.  I use it before I shave.  It does a good job exfoliating the skin and is not harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bottle of balm/lotion.  I use this after I shave, and it does help to sooth razor irritation.  I don&#x27;t know if the Q10 actually does much of anything, but it is a good balm and doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy.  It&#x27;s light on my face and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tube of Kiss of Moisture lip balm.  I like it because it&#x27;s soft and doesn&#x27;t have any funky flavors added to it.  I just helps to keep your lips moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, this is a good set to introduce a guy to this line of products or for a guy who likes Nivea products.</li>
            <li> A bargain-priced and boringly sensible gift, which is often just what you want.  It would be a perfect &#x27;starter set&#x27; for a young man off to college or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The selection is slightly eccentric – a separate shampoo and a deodorant would be more obvious than a facial scrub and lip balm.  But that makes it a more interesting gift, because it includes things that a man might not otherwise get for himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Double Action Balm is promoted as chiefly an after shave but is a good overall facial moisturizer, which is necessary after using the facial scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is masculine – not sweet or overpowering.  I also like the fact that the flat tops make it easy to park the products upside down, so that the contents come out more easily when the levels are low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;Energy&#x27; marketing nonsense is slightly irritating, but that&#x27;s not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should seriously consider this as a gift option.</li>
            <li> Overall I really enjoy using these products.  The 3-1 hair and body wash is great, I like the smooth feeling on my skin and hair, but is also the reason I took away 1 star, the scent is overwhelming.  It is a nice scent, it is just exceptionally powerful.  I have a separate tub/shower arrangement, and inside the small enclosed shower stall the scent is almost uncomfortable it is so strong.  It does dissipate after the shower, but the residual aroma on your skin and hair is still very noticeable by the time I get to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sun balm/aftershave lotion is excellent.  Soothes irritated skin and leaves a soft smooth feeling.  Does not feel greasy afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The face scrub works well.  I like the extra clean feeling after I use it, especially on days when I get dirty or sweaty working outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lip balm is of little use to me as I don&#x27;t typically use it, but I gave it a try.  It doesn&#x27;t leave that sticky greasy feeling most do, and that is the reason I don&#x27;t usually like lip balms, so I might use it more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I easily recommend this as a trial set or a cheap gift set if you are interested.  The only warning being the strong scent of the 3-1 body and hair wash.</li>
            <li> This Nivea for Men Energy Gift Set is a wonderful item! You get Body Wash, Face Cleanser, and After Shave Balm; plus Lip Balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Body wash is a multi purpose item. Body Wash, Shampoo, and the Mint Extract is supposed to help energize the user.  All the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;included products are useful and together in this set make a really nice gift.</li>
            <li> Love all the products in it</li>
            <li> My husband has always been a fan of the men&#x27;s Nivea line adn he loves this gift set. This is the first time he has used any of their energy products, but they seem to work as advertised. The action balm is my favorite - I love the way it makes his skin feel.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually purchase men-care products for myself simply because I&#x27;m not sure exactly what I need. This kit answered my questions.  This is  a convenient all-in-one men&#x27;s pampering kit.  Instead of using regular soap, you have the 3-in-1 body wash.  I don&#x27;t usually apply after-shave lotions of any kind, but the lotion included with this kit was actually very refreshing  and I will probably continue using it in the future.  As for lip balm, it&#x27;s a welcome addition for the climate where I live, although I think this is not something that everyone will require.  I do not use the face scrub as much as I want to;  I feel that all my face needs are covered with the 3-in-1 and the aftershave, but it still gives a refreshing feeling to my face.  This is an excellent, general-purpose gift set for any occasion.</li>
            <li> My dad will love thus gift set m nice and manly but just the right hygiene..</li>
            <li> I bought these for all the men on my Christmas list for 2014. This was a total hit! They loved them! It is really hard to shop for that many men at one time and get good quality stuff. This was amazing! I will do it again next year!</li>
