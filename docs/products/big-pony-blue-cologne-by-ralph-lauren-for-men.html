            <li>The citrus blend is a very pleasant smell and all who like (myself included) citrus fragrances, will love this scent.  </li>
            <li>He loved it and so do I.</li>
            <li>It smells clean and every man should own a bottle!!!</li>
            <li>this one and the orange one is soooo amazing on my bf</li>
            <li>It smells delicious and very manly</li>
            <li>Smells great, was able to purchase for a much better price than in the department stores.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, it is not the one I prefer</li>
            <li>In my opinion, Big Pony #1 is the best fragrance in this line.  </li>
            <li>Given the citrus blend of notes, Big Pony #1 is best suited for daytime wear in Spring and Summer.  </li>
            <li>Love the price--will purchase again.</li>
            <li>It was a present for my husband, LOVE IT!!!  </li>
            <li>A very special alluring scent - suitable for strong men :)</li>
            <li>It smells nice and clean</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells pretty good, too.</li>
            <li>It smells great, but lacks the projection/sillage and longevity to be a major player.  </li>
            <li>The order came quickly and the product is authentic very nice fragrance for a young man.</li>
            <li>Mild but lovely.</li>
            <li>I love ,fresh fragrance</li>
            <li>nice masculine scent!</li>
            <li>Not a bad thing, though.  </li>
            <li>It offers great flexibility/versatility in those months as a safe office wear and that it can be worn to any event in excessive heat temperatures.  </li>
            <li>Find the right one for you (and your budget..</li>
            <li>I have many of RL&#x27;s signature scents and all of the Big Pony series.  </li>
            <li>, it last all the day,without being too strong, and my wife loves it.</li>
            <li>As noted yesterday, I am a true fan of all the Ralph Lauren fragrances - and I do like the Big Pony collection -</li>
            <li>A check of current on-line prices indicate that Big Pony #1 is a decent fragrance considering the price/value - you can purchase a large bottle for under $50 USD - not too shabby..</li>
            <li>If you are a novice in the game, pass on BP#1 - there are plenty of citrus based fragrances out there with better performance.  </li>
            <li>After an hour Big Pony #1 sits close to the skin and is barely traceable after four hours of wear.  </li>

            <li> I got this as a gift for my 24 year old son and you can&#x27;t go wrong with Polo Ralph Lauren.</li>
            <li> Just like it smells in the expensive department stores but without having to pay all the overhead of the fancy rent district of the big malls.  </li>
            <li> For the serious collector, or Ralph Lauren fan, add to your collection.  </li>
            <li> - I can hardly wait..!!</li>
            <li> I was greatly disappointed..</li>

            <li> I love this perfume, it is not the one I prefer but, for the price this one is perfect, it last all the day,without being too strong, and my wife loves it. I buy from amazon, it is cheaper then the stores.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd time that I buy this cologne! It smells delicious and very manly I will definitely recomend this product</li>
            <li> Mild but lovely. Like the scent.</li>
            <li> Yesterday I wore and wrote a review of Ralph Lauren&#x27;s Big Pony #4.  Next in my rotation is Big Pony #1 (blue bottle).  As noted yesterday, I am a true fan of all the Ralph Lauren fragrances - and I do like the Big Pony collection - I have many of RL&#x27;s signature scents and all of the Big Pony series.  In my opinion, Big Pony #1 is the best fragrance in this line.  It is a simple fragrance with notes of citrus/fruit and &amp;#34;woods&amp;#34;.  From the onset, the citrus takes center stage and any &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; notes are lost early on.  Not a bad thing, though.  The citrus blend is a very pleasant smell and all who like (myself included) citrus fragrances, will love this scent.  The issue or concern is the projection and longevity of the fragrance.  After an hour Big Pony #1 sits close to the skin and is barely traceable after four hours of wear.  I was greatly disappointed..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do admit, however, that I do like the bottle.  Great design and theme.  Given the citrus blend of notes, Big Pony #1 is best suited for daytime wear in Spring and Summer.  It offers great flexibility/versatility in those months as a safe office wear and that it can be worn to any event in excessive heat temperatures.  Should work well in the South Carolina heat and humidity - I can hardly wait..!! A check of current on-line prices indicate that Big Pony #1 is a decent fragrance considering the price/value - you can purchase a large bottle for under $50 USD - not too shabby..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final tally for Ralph Lauren&#x27;s Big Pony #1 is 4 stars out of 5 stars.  It smells great, but lacks the projection/sillage and longevity to be a major player.  For the serious collector, or Ralph Lauren fan, add to your collection.  If you are a novice in the game, pass on BP#1 - there are plenty of citrus based fragrances out there with better performance.  Find the right one for you (and your budget..).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your day and make it count... Invest your time rather wasting your time...</li>
