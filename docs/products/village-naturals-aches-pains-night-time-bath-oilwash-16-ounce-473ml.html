            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>Glad the rest of the stuff was wrapped in plastic!</li>
            <li>I love my bubble baths - and this is a wonderful natural bubble bath - a good size for a good price</li>
            <li>This is absolutely one of the best foaming bath oils I have tried.  </li>

            <li>It smells nice, not overly chemical-ly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Got this for my wife to relax in a nice bath.</li>
            <li>It smells so awesome, and I really do feel that it helps me to relax.</li>
            <li>I love a good bubble bath</li>
            <li>However, for those of us who really love lavender and want the bath to have a strong floral scent, this isn&#x27;t a good choice.</li>
            <li>Restless Night Foaming Bath Oil has very good value, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It has a nice strong lavendar scent and does allow me to have a restful sleep.</li>

            <li>love all VN products,&lt;br /&gt;had</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the relaxing bubbles and the smell is out of this world..</li>
            <li>So I like the scent of this stuff better than the \\&quot;stress and tention\\</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>After i used more, the lather was there.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t LOVE it</li>
            <li>but it can have 1 more star.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I love the way it makes me smell.  </li>
            <li>This entire line is just wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Of several bottles, one arrived with a cracked lid but is perfectly sized to be able to use a soda bottle top as a replacement.</li>
            <li>Even though it feels like I&#x27;m soaking in magic butter, there is no oily feeling on the skin from the coconut oil when I step out.  </li>
            <li>This product is gentle and smells great.</li>
            <li>I have always been satisfied with the products from Village Naturals.</li>
            <li>Great product very fragrant</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice, relaxing, and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I would&#x27;ve preferred slightly more foaming, but I ended up just pouring more of the bottle into my bath.</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s super exceptional, but I would buy again.</li>
            <li>my mom, who uses it the most loves it.</li>
            <li>I wanted to give this more stars, but when the bottle arrived, the exterior was covered in the bubble bath soap.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t sell it there any more.  </li>
            <li>Love the scent and the gentleness.  </li>
            <li>It is also a very nice scent of lavender and very relaxing to soak in.  </li>
            <li>The scent is pretty good, I love taking bubble baths with it</li>
            <li>This is a very relaxing bubble baths the scent are pleasant and the bubbles are plentiful.  </li>
            <li>really recommend this, smells really good and</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite bubble baths!</li>
            <li>bath oil was easy to clean up.</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend this product for great smell,</li>
            <li>The smell is primarily lavender, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>She bathes almost every day now just to enjoy this stuff in our Jacuzzi tub  </li>
            <li>As for the scent, I actually enjoy it.</li>
            <li>good bubbling action without the oily feel of a bath oil.</li>
            <li>Will be back for more!!</li>
            <li>The 2 pack is a great buy that lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need too much to create strong, long-lasting bubbles (just remember to pour it in under the running water to get the bubbles!).</li>
            <li>so I have tried all different types of bubble bath liquid over the years, but this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clean and relaxing scent that&#x27;s not too over powering.</li>
            <li>This smells amazing and leaves your skin feeling soft, but when i received the item 2/3rds of it were all over the box.  </li>
            <li>Sickly sweet scent.  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product, the Restless Night foaming bath oil is lavendar in color and smells GREAT, only takes a small amount to make a tub full of bubbles, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The tub drains clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>bottle had leaked during  shipment, and was not full when it arrived  ~~~~~~would love a replacement, since it was a gift!!</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>would definitely buy the product again because it is a wonderful product for relaxing in the bath, but i hope next time they make sure the kid is secured properly!</li>
            <li>Love the scent, keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>; just about right and</li>
            <li>It was worth the minor inconvenience, as it provided some amazing, eternal memories that will always be cherished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>great way to sooth the tired achy body ,helps me to rest better use one or more of your products daily</li>
            <li>Smell is not overpowering but is strong enough to enjoy.  </li>
            <li>I loved the fresh fragrance and the feeling after my bath wasn&#x27;t heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The oil has a good level of concentration, so a little oil does go</li>
            <li>When I took my first bath</li>
            <li>The only reason for four stars is that I feel it is more soapy than it is oily.</li>
            <li>Item was exactly what I ordered and shipped quickly...got it on a Sunday delivery.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands and types of foam bath products, but this one is different with the oils added.  </li>
            <li>many florals mixed with fruits or spices.  </li>
            <li>I love products with multiple purposes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through several bottles, and I am ordering more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty upset that there&#x27;s no ingredients listed on the product description, although I can certainly see why they would try and hide that now.</li>
            <li>The bath is pleasantly fragranced, bubbles are long lasting, and no bath tub ring forms.  </li>
            <li>It has a wonderful light scent, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my sensitive skin, and the bubbles last longer than any other liquid I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>this just smelled like generic shampoo or something, with a strong perfume scent.  </li>
            <li>i tried it as a soap for shaving my legs, which i don&#x27;t do very often.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t attest to the aromatherapy aspect of the product, but when I get out of the tub, I AM ready to sleep.</li>
            <li>I have not used this yet, but it looks very creamy and luscious.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recover from a  very stressful day with bath oiI, bath salts, or body wash.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>and I always feel very relaxed after using it.</li>
            <li>Really, what can I say?  </li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Very Good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I enjoy the product and wish my local store carried this scent.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I bought this foaming bath oil &amp; body wash because I had previously enjoyed the other bath oils and bath salts put out by Village Naturals.</li>
            <li>A little more expensive but worth it because of the nice bubbles and fabulous scents.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for the past few months and think it has a wonderful smell.</li>
            <li>It should really be considered a high quality bubble bath.</li>
            <li>I have used the Village Natural products before, but this was the first time I have tried the Foaming Bath Oil.  </li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t smell any lavendar or any florals in particular and couldn&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li>Price is decent for a boutique product.</li>
            <li>but I enjoyable enough and relaxing enough to bring on sleep.</li>
            <li>yes, the product is highly scented.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>the oil part makes your skin soft but not so much that I slip getting out of the bathtub.</li>
            <li>and she has no complaint regarding the product.</li>
            <li>I normally shop.  </li>
            <li>Some of the previous reviewers have mentioned how strong the scent of this product is.</li>
            <li>The bubbles are tiny and last a long time;  many products have large bubbles that dissipate rapidly.  </li>
            <li>of these make a terrific and very appreciated</li>
            <li>The bottle I received did slightly leak a bit but the person who packaged it was kind enough to put it in a big baggie by itself, so it was no biggie.</li>
            <li>Ingredients very much not natural despite the name.  </li>
            <li>A rash started on my neck and legs which didn&#x27;t clear away until two weeks after I discontinued use.</li>
            <li>It left no oily film and rinsed very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like lots of suds complete to the end of my bath..</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so soft</li>
            <li>2) it did seem to help keep skin soft and 3)</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin or a sulfate allergy, you probably won&#x27;t have a problem... but don&#x27;t fall for the &#x27;natural&#x27; label, it&#x27;s loaded with chemicals.</li>
            <li>This product foams well and has a soft scent.</li>
            <li>However, it did not leave an oily after effect, and my skin WAS soft....</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for at least 3 years or more.</li>
            <li>Overall, there wasn&#x27;t much that had leaked out during shipping, so I didn&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li>My elderly father developed skin rashes and itchiness all over.</li>
            <li>Body so soft.  </li>
            <li>Worth the $$ spent.</li>
            <li>oil has a very nice mellow, floral fragrance; it wasn&#x27;t medicinal smelling and didn&#x27;t smell like artificial chemicals.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this body wash is the only one I will buy.  </li>
            <li>but on a regular basis, there are several other village naturals products that smell much more natural, real and subtle.  </li>
            <li>I take long baths to relax, and this product makes my skin feel like new, and smells divine.  </li>

            <li> My absolute favorite bubble baths!</li>
            <li> bath oil was easy to clean up.</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this product for great smell,</li>
            <li> The smell is primarily lavender, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> She bathes almost every day now just to enjoy this stuff in our Jacuzzi tub  </li>
            <li> As for the scent, I actually enjoy it.</li>
            <li> good bubbling action without the oily feel of a bath oil.</li>
            <li> Will be back for more!!</li>
            <li> The 2 pack is a great buy that lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need too much to create strong, long-lasting bubbles (just remember to pour it in under the running water to get the bubbles!).</li>
            <li> so I have tried all different types of bubble bath liquid over the years, but this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clean and relaxing scent that&#x27;s not too over powering.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing and leaves your skin feeling soft, but when i received the item 2/3rds of it were all over the box.  </li>
            <li> Sickly sweet scent.  </li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, the Restless Night foaming bath oil is lavendar in color and smells GREAT, only takes a small amount to make a tub full of bubbles, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The tub drains clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> bottle had leaked during  shipment, and was not full when it arrived  ~~~~~~would love a replacement, since it was a gift!!</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> would definitely buy the product again because it is a wonderful product for relaxing in the bath, but i hope next time they make sure the kid is secured properly!</li>
            <li> Love the scent, keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> ; just about right and</li>
            <li> It was worth the minor inconvenience, as it provided some amazing, eternal memories that will always be cherished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> great way to sooth the tired achy body ,helps me to rest better use one or more of your products daily</li>
            <li> Smell is not overpowering but is strong enough to enjoy.  </li>
            <li> I loved the fresh fragrance and the feeling after my bath wasn&#x27;t heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The oil has a good level of concentration, so a little oil does go</li>
            <li> When I took my first bath</li>
            <li> The only reason for four stars is that I feel it is more soapy than it is oily.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly what I ordered and shipped quickly...got it on a Sunday delivery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands and types of foam bath products, but this one is different with the oils added.  </li>
            <li> many florals mixed with fruits or spices.  </li>
            <li> I love products with multiple purposes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through several bottles, and I am ordering more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty upset that there&#x27;s no ingredients listed on the product description, although I can certainly see why they would try and hide that now.</li>
            <li> The bath is pleasantly fragranced, bubbles are long lasting, and no bath tub ring forms.  </li>
            <li> It has a wonderful light scent, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my sensitive skin, and the bubbles last longer than any other liquid I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> this just smelled like generic shampoo or something, with a strong perfume scent.  </li>
            <li> i tried it as a soap for shaving my legs, which i don&#x27;t do very often.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t attest to the aromatherapy aspect of the product, but when I get out of the tub, I AM ready to sleep.</li>
            <li> I have not used this yet, but it looks very creamy and luscious.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recover from a  very stressful day with bath oiI, bath salts, or body wash.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> and I always feel very relaxed after using it.</li>
            <li> Really, what can I say?  </li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Very Good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I enjoy the product and wish my local store carried this scent.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I bought this foaming bath oil &amp; body wash because I had previously enjoyed the other bath oils and bath salts put out by Village Naturals.</li>
            <li> A little more expensive but worth it because of the nice bubbles and fabulous scents.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for the past few months and think it has a wonderful smell.</li>
            <li> It should really be considered a high quality bubble bath.</li>
            <li> I have used the Village Natural products before, but this was the first time I have tried the Foaming Bath Oil.  </li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t smell any lavendar or any florals in particular and couldn&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> Price is decent for a boutique product.</li>
            <li> but I enjoyable enough and relaxing enough to bring on sleep.</li>
            <li> yes, the product is highly scented.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> the oil part makes your skin soft but not so much that I slip getting out of the bathtub.</li>
            <li> and she has no complaint regarding the product.</li>
            <li> I normally shop.  </li>
            <li> Some of the previous reviewers have mentioned how strong the scent of this product is.</li>
            <li> The bubbles are tiny and last a long time;  many products have large bubbles that dissipate rapidly.  </li>
            <li> of these make a terrific and very appreciated</li>
            <li> The bottle I received did slightly leak a bit but the person who packaged it was kind enough to put it in a big baggie by itself, so it was no biggie.</li>
            <li> Ingredients very much not natural despite the name.  </li>
            <li> A rash started on my neck and legs which didn&#x27;t clear away until two weeks after I discontinued use.</li>
            <li> It left no oily film and rinsed very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like lots of suds complete to the end of my bath..</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so soft</li>
            <li> 2) it did seem to help keep skin soft and 3)</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin or a sulfate allergy, you probably won&#x27;t have a problem... but don&#x27;t fall for the &#x27;natural&#x27; label, it&#x27;s loaded with chemicals.</li>
            <li> This product foams well and has a soft scent.</li>
            <li> However, it did not leave an oily after effect, and my skin WAS soft....</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at least 3 years or more.</li>
            <li> Overall, there wasn&#x27;t much that had leaked out during shipping, so I didn&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li> My elderly father developed skin rashes and itchiness all over.</li>
            <li> Body so soft.  </li>
            <li> Worth the $$ spent.</li>
            <li> oil has a very nice mellow, floral fragrance; it wasn&#x27;t medicinal smelling and didn&#x27;t smell like artificial chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this body wash is the only one I will buy.  </li>
            <li> but on a regular basis, there are several other village naturals products that smell much more natural, real and subtle.  </li>
            <li> I take long baths to relax, and this product makes my skin feel like new, and smells divine.  </li>
            <li> The bubbles last a long time</li>
            <li> If you have had a history of reacting to strong scent or dye in the past--be wary of this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this, stupidly thinking it would be sulfate free, and ultimately have to return it because I can&#x27;t use anything containing a sulfate without having a very severe allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bath fanatic;  I use hot baths for mental and muscular relaxation.  </li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle and cap were durable and leak-</li>
            <li> After using it little longer, I found that I was not putting in enough.  </li>
            <li> Also, this bottle lasts for a long time because a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It does not perform as I expected.  </li>
            <li> price+no Prime, no thanks.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way in the bath.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Longer lasting scent than usual body wash like Dove</li>
            <li> Overall, just not a favorite product for me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try the other scents.</li>
            <li> and I have tried one of the other product</li>
            <li> It was only after buying it that I noticed the slightly negative reviews about the product.</li>
            <li> Well the kids use it cause it calms them down</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the product will help with &amp;#34;restless nights&amp;#34; as it claims, but it definitely will relax parts of your mind and leave you feeling as if you left a spa with secret ingredients for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> The scent was hardly noticable to me (which is contrary to some other reviewers); very little bubbles, and no noticeable relaxation effect related to \\&quot;Restless Nights\\&quot;.....</li>
            <li> The bubble bath came with the lid half broke and some leaked out.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m super disappointed in what I purchased.</li>
            <li> and I have come to see the scent and ingredient although not a strong response to it</li>
            <li> Hardly any leaked out....</li>
            <li> Do not buy here, it costs $13.95 here, $4.97 at Walmart.com (as of late February 2013).  </li>
            <li> the only thing bad I can say is the price,and shipping and handleing on all the things I ordered.</li>
            <li> &quot; one, but I had a horrible first experience while using this.</li>
            <li> The bubbles are really thick and a bit difficult to break apart.</li>
            <li> It arrived in a sealed plastic bag which indicates that the provider knows it leaks through the cap - so I am just confused as to why a seal is not provided in the cap of these bottles?</li>
            <li> a bad day, take a soak in the tub or shower with this&lt;br /&gt;works</li>
            <li> It was the worst bath ive ever had.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells and feels great.</li>
            <li> love all VN products,&lt;br /&gt;had a bad day, take a soak in the tub or shower with this&lt;br /&gt;works great on restless legs too</li>
            <li> The scent is pretty good, I love taking bubble baths with it and I sometimes use it as body wash. Longer lasting scent than usual body wash like Dove</li>
            <li> smells great.....it also does seem to help you sleep, but it&#x27;s probably just the relaxation factor and the aroma. I would purchase again...oh the baby loves a bath in this as well</li>
            <li> Makes a great xmas gift for those bath lovers who love body and bath oil and need relaxing.</li>
            <li> I love my bubble baths - and this is a wonderful natural bubble bath - a good size for a good price</li>
            <li> I have used the Village Natural products before, but this was the first time I have tried the Foaming Bath Oil.  I loved the fresh fragrance and the feeling after my bath wasn&#x27;t heavy or greasy.  Using this bath oil along with some fragrant candles and some music, could almost make you forget all of your problems.</li>
            <li> this is a very good product. I enjoyed the relaxing bubbles and the smell is out of this world.. I would recommend this to anyonw.. the only thing bad I can say is the price,and shipping and handleing on all the things I ordered. I then went to a department store and low and behold there was everything i had ordered on line and it was cheaper, so next bottle will be coming from there...[[ASIN:B00107BB82 Village Naturals Therapy Aches &amp; Pains Mineral Bath Soak 20 oz]][[ASIN:B0024HGT0C Village Naturals Therapy Restless Night Foaming Bath Oil 16 fl oz]]</li>
            <li> This bath oil was carried over 5000 miles in my luggage so it could be utilized during our overseas honeymoon. It was worth the minor inconvenience, as it provided some amazing, eternal memories that will always be cherished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil has a very nice mellow, floral fragrance; it wasn&#x27;t medicinal smelling and didn&#x27;t smell like artificial chemicals. The fragrance proved to have aroma-therapeutic qualities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The massaging sensation of the king size premium jacuzzi, along with the wonderful smelling bubbles that the oil provided, with serene candle light casting shadows, wonderful music filling the air... I guess you could say that all the senses were in ecstasy.(did I forget to mention champagne &amp; strawberries?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bath oil was easy to clean up. It left no oily film and rinsed very easily.&lt;br /&gt;The oil has a good level of concentration, so a little oil does go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle and cap were durable and leak- proof(although I did store them in a zip-freezer bag while in transit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Village Naturals Therapy Restless Night Foaming Bath Oil has very good value, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> this just smelled like generic shampoo or something, with a strong perfume scent.  i didn&#x27;t smell any lavendar or any florals in particular and couldn&#x27;t use it.  i tried it as a soap for shaving my legs, which i don&#x27;t do very often.  but on a regular basis, there are several other village naturals products that smell much more natural, real and subtle.  i did like the consistency -- not too oily -- but that&#x27;s about it.  it will probably get tossed at some point...</li>
            <li> So I like the scent of this stuff better than the \\&quot;stress and tention\\&quot; one, but I had a horrible first experience while using this. The bubbles are really thick and a bit difficult to break apart. When I took my first bath I by a mistake inhaled some bubbles after I put my head in the water! I choked on the menthol/soapy taste and threw up! It was the worst bath ive ever had.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of the Village Naturals bath salts, so I tried this. This is great for a bubble bath. The scent is very relaxing and not cheap smelling. A little goes a long way in the bath. The only reason for four stars is that I feel it is more soapy than it is oily. It is best to rinse it off, where some bath oils are meant to stay on your skin for moisturizing purposes. It should really be considered a high quality bubble bath.</li>
            <li> I like the village naturals bubble baths.  This one smells nice, but not quite as good as their amber and stress/tension ones.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, the Restless Night foaming bath oil is lavendar in color and smells GREAT, only takes a small amount to make a tub full of bubbles, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Ingredients very much not natural despite the name.  Sickly sweet scent.  No option to return.</li>
            <li> I love it.  Great smell, and it does not leave a ring in the tub.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely one of the best foaming bath oils I have tried.  Not too foamy; just about right and the oil part makes your skin soft but not so much that I slip getting out of the bathtub.</li>
            <li> This product is pasaable but I don&#x27;t think I will reorder.  It does not perform as I expected.  I like lots of suds complete to the end of my bath.. These sort of go away.  But I will use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;08/12/13  After using it little longer, I found that I was not putting in enough.  After i used more, the lather was there.  so it&#x27;s okay. don&#x27;t LOVE it but it can have 1 more star.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just the placebo effect or what, but I get so sleepy whenever I use this in my bath.  I&#x27;ll definitely be re-ordering.</li>
            <li> I purchased this thinking I would get foaming bath oil.  It didn&#x27;t even come in this bottle and it was a body wash/bubble bath mentioning nothing about oil.  Wife says it smells good but I&#x27;m super disappointed in what I purchased.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  It makes my skin feel so soft and I love the way it makes me smell.  I use it every night and will purchase it over and over again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for the past few months and think it has a wonderful smell. The foaming part is great and it does not feel oily in the water when I&#x27;ve used it. I can&#x27;t attest to the aromatherapy aspect of the product, but when I get out of the tub, I AM ready to sleep. LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product for great smell, good bubbling action without the oily feel of a bath oil.</li>
            <li> I have not used this yet, but it looks very creamy and luscious. The smell is primarily lavender, but not overpowering. I think it will be a wonderful way to ease into sleep mode!</li>
            <li> Some of the previous reviewers have mentioned how strong the scent of this product is. Taking a chance I would not find it so, I ordered two bottles.  After using the oil three times, (just a capful at a time) I began to notice several things:  1) yes, the product is highly scented. 2) it did seem to help keep skin soft and 3) I believe I experienced an allergic reaction to either the scent or dye!  A rash started on my neck and legs which didn&#x27;t clear away until two weeks after I discontinued use. If you have had a history of reacting to strong scent or dye in the past--be wary of this product.</li>
            <li> Great product. It has a nice strong lavendar scent and does allow me to have a restful sleep. Item was exactly what I ordered and shipped quickly...got it on a Sunday delivery. Will be back for more!!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this body wash is the only one I will buy.  It is wonderful.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have always use this bubble bath (never soap) when bathing in my jacuzzi bathtub.  The bath is pleasantly fragranced, bubbles are long lasting, and no bath tub ring forms.  The tub drains clean and fresh.  This bubble bath allows me to enjoy a lovely bath and never have to scrub the tub!</li>
            <li> I keep reordering for me and my mom both!  This Bath Oil is so relaxing it almost puts you to sleep before you can get to the bed.  I love it!  Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> bottle had leaked during  shipment, and was not full when it arrived  ~~~~~~would love a replacement, since it was a gift!!</li>
            <li> The second ingredient listed on the bottle is a sulfate. I bought this, stupidly thinking it would be sulfate free, and ultimately have to return it because I can&#x27;t use anything containing a sulfate without having a very severe allergic reaction. If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin or a sulfate allergy, you probably won&#x27;t have a problem... but don&#x27;t fall for the &#x27;natural&#x27; label, it&#x27;s loaded with chemicals. I&#x27;m pretty upset that there&#x27;s no ingredients listed on the product description, although I can certainly see why they would try and hide that now.</li>
            <li> This product foams well and has a soft scent. However, for those of us who really love lavender and want the bath to have a strong floral scent, this isn&#x27;t a good choice. I find myself looking for lavender essential oils to add a couple of drops to each bath. Otherwise, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> This entire line is just wonderful.  The restless nights bath is a soothing  mix of lavender , chamomile, and passion flower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recover from a  very stressful day with bath oiI, bath salts, or body wash.  After an aromatherapy bath like this, have a great night&#x27;s sleep-naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any of these make a terrific and very appreciated gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget going to a spa-recline in aromatherapy at home!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this before and plan to order again.  I really like it.  The bubbles last a long time and I always feel very relaxed after using it.</li>
            <li> The 2 pack is a great buy that lasts a long time. Soap is definitely a relaxer before bedtime.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite bubble baths! I purchase several different scents and use them interchangeably. Stress and tension and Restless Nights are my two favorites. A little more expensive but worth it because of the nice bubbles and fabulous scents.</li>
            <li> All their products are good.  The best part is you don&#x27;t have to use as much product to get a lot of pleasure.</li>
            <li> The bubble bath came with the lid half broke and some leaked out. Glad the rest of the stuff was wrapped in plastic!</li>
            <li> Really, what can I say?  My wife reports that it lathers up well and she has no complaint regarding the product. Price is decent for a boutique product.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loves to take bubble baths and this works great</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement for the bath salts(which have increased in price by a factor of 2-3). Excellent smell and very pleasing in baths. Of several bottles, one arrived with a cracked lid but is perfectly sized to be able to use a soda bottle top as a replacement. No harm no foul.</li>
            <li> Got this bath oil/bubble bath for the girlfriend for Christmas.  She absolutely loves it.  She bathes almost every day now just to enjoy this stuff in our Jacuzzi tub  Worth the $$ spent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bath fanatic;  I use hot baths for mental and muscular relaxation.  I&#x27;ve tried many brands and types of foam bath products, but this one is different with the oils added.  I sank into a warm bed of silk with indistinguishable floral scents.  The bubbles are tiny and last a long time;  many products have large bubbles that dissipate rapidly.  Even though it feels like I&#x27;m soaking in magic butter, there is no oily feeling on the skin from the coconut oil when I step out.  The aroma is mysterious-- many florals mixed with fruits or spices.  I&#x27;m not sure if the product will help with &amp;#34;restless nights&amp;#34; as it claims, but it definitely will relax parts of your mind and leave you feeling as if you left a spa with secret ingredients for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Do not buy here, it costs $13.95 here, $4.97 at Walmart.com (as of late February 2013).  Ripoff price+no Prime, no thanks.</li>
            <li> great way to sooth the tired achy body ,helps me to rest better use one or more of your products daily</li>
            <li> Product is acceptable, but would not purchase again. The scent was hardly noticable to me (which is contrary to some other reviewers); very little bubbles, and no noticeable relaxation effect related to \\&quot;Restless Nights\\&quot;.....However, it did not leave an oily after effect, and my skin WAS soft....Overall, just not a favorite product for me.</li>
            <li> This product is gentle and smells great. I just want to know why they stopped mailing it to APO addresses.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing and leaves your skin feeling soft, but when i received the item 2/3rds of it were all over the box.  I contacted Amazon and their awesome customer service refunded the amount, but i hope The Village Company reads this review and encourages better quality control when packing their items.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy the product again because it is a wonderful product for relaxing in the bath, but i hope next time they make sure the kid is secured properly!</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom as a mother&#x27;s day present last year and she loves it.  I have always been satisfied with the products from Village Naturals.</li>
            <li> Great product very fragrant</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, relaxing, and comfortable. I would&#x27;ve preferred slightly more foaming, but I ended up just pouring more of the bottle into my bath. It smells nice, not overly chemical-ly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s super exceptional, but I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I have been ordering it from Amazon as they discontinued carrying it wehere it I normally shop.  I have been using this product for at least 3 years or more.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife to relax in a nice bath. Well the kids use it cause it calms them down and it makes it easier for them to go to bed at night.</li>
            <li> Very Good.&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this, smells really good and my mom, who uses it the most loves it. she uses it every day.</li>
            <li> I take long baths to relax, and this product makes my skin feel like new, and smells divine.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use this in the shower in the morning. Love the scent, keeps my skin soft. Would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I love products with multiple purposes. I&#x27;ve used this as a bath oil and as a body wash. It smells so awesome, and I really do feel that it helps me to relax. I can&#x27;t wait to try the other scents.</li>
            <li> I love a good bubble bath so I have tried all different types of bubble bath liquid over the years, but this is by far the best. It has a wonderful light scent, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my sensitive skin, and the bubbles last longer than any other liquid I&#x27;ve tried. Also, this bottle lasts for a long time because a little bit goes a long way. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried this one yet, but the rest of them do just  what they say they will!</li>
            <li> I order this all the time. If you like a relaxing lavender bath, this is a great way to go. I&#x27;ve been through several bottles, and I am ordering more.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes for a very nice bubble bath and it does seem to have therapeutic effects once you get out. I wanted to give this more stars, but when the bottle arrived, the exterior was covered in the bubble bath soap. It arrived in a sealed plastic bag which indicates that the provider knows it leaks through the cap - so I am just confused as to why a seal is not provided in the cap of these bottles? Overall, there wasn&#x27;t much that had leaked out during shipping, so I didn&#x27;t return it. It&#x27;s still a great product; the bottle/seal just needs to be improved.</li>
            <li> I bought this foaming bath oil &amp; body wash because I had previously enjoyed the other bath oils and bath salts put out by Village Naturals. It was only after buying it that I noticed the slightly negative reviews about the product. The bottle I received did slightly leak a bit but the person who packaged it was kind enough to put it in a big baggie by itself, so it was no biggie. Hardly any leaked out....didn&#x27;t bother me a bit. As for the scent, I actually enjoy it. It&#x27;s a clean and relaxing scent that&#x27;s not too over powering. A little goes a long way with this stuff. It bubbles up a lot! I enjoy the product and wish my local store carried this scent.</li>
            <li> This is a very relaxing bubble baths the scent are pleasant and the bubbles are plentiful.  Between that the matching bath salts I found it to be very enjoyable and I have tried one of the other product and I have come to see the scent and ingredient although not a strong response to it I did find my self relaxed enough to go to sleep.  I recommend this product.  It is not a sleeping pill but I enjoyable enough and relaxing enough to bring on sleep.</li>
            <li> My elderly father developed skin rashes and itchiness all over. This was the only product, including prescription medicines, that helped him.</li>
            <li> She used to buy this at Walgreens.  They don&#x27;t sell it there any more.  So she is happy.  That makes me happy.</li>
            <li> If you need to get away and relax and soak, try some of this.  I think you will like it.  I have had some that seemed to leave a ring around my tub.  But not this.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> awesome!!!  Love the scent and the gentleness.  Body so soft.  Found a sale on these at local grocer store.  They were discontinuing this product so got about 5 for 1/2 price each.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this for bubble bath!  Smell is not overpowering but is strong enough to enjoy.  Don&#x27;t need too much to create strong, long-lasting bubbles (just remember to pour it in under the running water to get the bubbles!).</li>
            <li> i love the bath oil that also bubbles and this is perfect.  It is also a very nice scent of lavender and very relaxing to soak in.  It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
