            <li>the day lotion spreads well, and kind of feels oily at first</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, fragrance free and protects you from the sun.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous.</li>
            <li>Great quality, it is light enough, skin loves it, and my skin is VERY picky.</li>
            <li>This stuff is full of chemicals</li>
            <li>and I love the way my skin looks and feels I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Great for my skin type (oily) and climate where I live (southern humidity).</li>
            <li>in all honestly, the only products in my routine I changed were my day, night and eye creams from this line.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>

            <li>The product arrived very fast.</li>
            <li>As an experiment, I switched back to Meaningful Beauty, with the conviction that if my skin cleared up again Cindy would have a customer for life.</li>
            <li>And then, just like the first time, about 3 days in, my skin went back to looking and feeling better.</li>
            <li>This one is pretty tolerable, also-</li>
            <li>This one is pretty tolerable, also-</li>
            <li>Love this as a daily use and sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I have been using the meaningful beauty products for several years now.  </li>
            <li>First, this product stings and feels sticky.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so soft and it goes on light, not thick and greasy.</li>
            <li>This is definitely my skin&#x27;s favorite so far!</li>
            <li>Very high quality for the price.</li>
            <li>(wrinkles aren&#x27;t so much of a problem for me, thank the lord).</li>
            <li>I also think the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>This the product wasn&#x27;t very good.it seems like an off</li>
            <li>Love it - I am 65 with the facial skin of a 50 year old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 2 years and still absolutely loving it.</li>
            <li>If  you want extra protection from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays, I recomment using a sunblock like Shishido&#x27;s face only on top of this day cream.  </li>
            <li>I use it as a night cream because of this, works fine to moisturize overnight, but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed any other real benefits.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Been using this a few weeks now and love it.</li>
            <li>She has very sensitive skin and cannot use many products she has tried in the past.</li>
            <li>(I LOVE MY AMAZON!!!)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried to substitute other products for MB SPF Facial Lotion, but the jury is out.</li>
            <li>Fine lines are much less noticeable .  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel quite soft.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive but this lotion does not cause problems - keeps my skin young looking.</li>
            <li>so soft on my skin.</li>
            <li>This is the lightest formula I have found which offers some protection and a moisturizer both.  </li>
            <li>Many compliments on my skin lately.</li>
            <li>It  has made my skin feel soft and supple.</li>
            <li>Had to reapply frequently.  </li>
            <li>I would like less fragrance but the scent goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>and I feel like it really helps my dry skin on my face.</li>
            <li>It works like no other poroduct has.</li>
            <li>I had a major allergic reaction to something in these products.  </li>
            <li>If it feels too shiny after a bare face application, wait about 10 minutes and use a blotter paper.  </li>
            <li>If it feels too shiny after a bare face application, wait about 10 minutes and use a blotter paper.  </li>
            <li>Also this whole company is a scam and tries to screw you into getting on a monthly delivery and will not take no for an answer.</li>
            <li>Received the package with the cap broken  hoping I will be able to use the product  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried acne treatments, dry skin treatments, anti aging, high potency serums, the list goes on and on...</li>

            <li> I have tried all the expensive brands and this worked better than anything I have used in a long while.</li>
            <li> Great base for makeup, unlike some other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> but I swear I&#x27;ll never use anything else as long as this</li>
            <li> For some dumb reason, I switched back to my old brand of product to save my miracle in a jar product and, no kidding, about a week later</li>
            <li> skin looks fresher, less tired, less fine line wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Its not like other products where my skin gets dry.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure why I wanted to try this so bad.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using for roughly 6 years.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> my face soft and subtle not greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I seem to need less foundation.</li>
            <li> little relief from any of my symptoms.</li>
            <li> Very average.  </li>
            <li> But literally within a few days of using this in conjunction with the night cream, MY SKIN STARTED CLEARING UP.</li>
            <li> So as a things go, I used it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I still use a few Kiehl&#x27;s products (wash and a serum)</li>
            <li> few notes on this stuff-</li>
            <li> NO ONE is trying to smell your face, so who cares?A few notes on this stuff-</li>
            <li> I need to wear a day cream with some sun protection year round.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now in my early to mid 30&#x27;s, but no matter what name brand or OTC product I tried, I suffered from acne, annoying redness and uneven pigmentation</li>
            <li> Just dab a small dime size and that does the trick for all over the face.  </li>
            <li> I get compliments on my skin all the time, usually people tell me I have a glow.</li>
            <li> small amount for the cost.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the consistency, very thick and greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and it seems to make it worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used MB products as a member for quite some years, but got tired of paying the hefty postage</li>
            <li> and I started to get weird that my supply was diminishing.</li>

            <li> Received the package with the cap broken  hoping I will be able to use the product  haven&#x27;t needed to open it yet</li>
            <li> Have used for years and love it!!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure why I wanted to try this so bad. My friend gave me a couple of products from her supply to try before I committed to buying it myself. Some history on my skin: I have worked in the beauty industry for about 15 years now. I have sold tons of top shelf products. I know how to care for my skin. I&#x27;m now in my early to mid 30&#x27;s, but no matter what name brand or OTC product I tried, I suffered from acne, annoying redness and uneven pigmentation (wrinkles aren&#x27;t so much of a problem for me, thank the lord). I&#x27;ve tried acne treatments, dry skin treatments, anti aging, high potency serums, the list goes on and on... little relief from any of my symptoms. I&#x27;ve been to the dermatologist too for antibiotics and not even those had continued to work. (I refused hormonal treatments.)&lt;br /&gt;So, again, why I wanted to try a TV offer, I don&#x27;t know... But literally within a few days of using this in conjunction with the night cream, MY SKIN STARTED CLEARING UP. THE REDNESS WENT AWAY. My acne started healing and the texture of my skin softened and I COULDN&#x27;T BELIEVE MY EYES. It felt like a miracle. I kept wondering why they don&#x27;t name this Miraculous Beauty. So as a things go, I used it for a few weeks and I started to get weird that my supply was diminishing. For some dumb reason, I switched back to my old brand of product to save my miracle in a jar product and, no kidding, about a week later I started breaking out again. As an experiment, I switched back to Meaningful Beauty, with the conviction that if my skin cleared up again Cindy would have a customer for life. And then, just like the first time, about 3 days in, my skin went back to looking and feeling better. 5 days, pimples were almost gone, pores looked smaller, redness down.&lt;br /&gt;So in all honestly, the only products in my routine I changed were my day, night and eye creams from this line. I still use a few Kiehl&#x27;s products (wash and a serum) but I swear I&#x27;ll never use anything else as long as this works.&lt;br /&gt;A few notes on this stuff- the day lotion spreads well, and kind of feels oily at first but if you let it settle a bit before make up application the skin will absorb it a bit. I have had no issue wearing this under liquid or powder mineral make up. If it feels too shiny after a bare face application, wait about 10 minutes and use a blotter paper.  It does have a weird-ish smell to it but most SPF lotions do. This one is pretty tolerable, also- NO ONE is trying to smell your face, so who cares?A few notes on this stuff- the day lotion spreads well, and kind of feels oily at first but if you let it settle a bit before make up application the skin will absorb it a bit.

            <li> Very nice product. Makes my skin feel quite soft.</li>
            <li> Good product with excellent service from the distributor.</li>
            <li> Absorbs very easy, not oily</li>
            <li> Another great product from Ms. Crawford.  This is a great moisturizer for use of all day.  It does not feel oily or caking like some products after applying.  Just dab a small dime size and that does the trick for all over the face.  I swear by this product</li>
            <li> I just love this lotion. It makes my skin feel so soft and it goes on light, not thick and greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 2 years and still absolutely loving it. This is definitely my skin&#x27;s favorite so far!</li>
            <li> This was OK.  I didn&#x27;t feel like it improved my skin.  Very average.  Don&#x27;t believe the hype on TV!</li>
            <li> Gives skin a nice glow without being too greasy.</li>
            <li> I have been using meaningful beauty for 6 years. Great for my skin type (oily) and climate where I live (southern humidity).</li>
            <li> The packaging on this product does not match picture online which makes me think it&#x27;s a fake. I have used it a few days and really just seems and smells like sunscreen. One days it makes my fave unusually red.</li>
            <li> Talk about comfort!!!  Looks great and fits well.</li>
            <li> Meaningful Beauty Antioxidant Cream &amp; Eye Lift&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using for roughly 6 years.&lt;br /&gt;Love these products.</li>
            <li> Love it - I am 65 with the facial skin of a 50 year old. It works like no other poroduct has. I saw results in days. My skin is sensitive but this lotion does not cause problems - keeps my skin young looking.</li>
            <li> My wife likes this product very much. She has very sensitive skin and cannot use many products she has tried in the past. She has no problems with this product</li>
            <li> great products - it makes my skin so soft</li>
            <li> Love this as a daily use and sunscreen.  Not a miracle cream, but good for my sensitive skin and the SPF is perfect for daily use.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and it seems to make it worse.</li>
            <li> My skin looks great! The Meaningful Beauty products work well for me.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for my over 50 skin!</li>
            <li> Glow Serum gives you a healthy Glow with or without make-up. I&#x27;ll take it to my Grave. lol</li>
            <li> This feels weirdly greasy on my face. I use it as a night cream because of this, works fine to moisturize overnight, but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed any other real benefits.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the consistency, very thick and greasy.</li>
            <li> Great product and the seller is good getting this to me fast, I would buy again!! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. My skin looks and feels great after applying. I seem to need less foundation. I also think the price is reasonable. I would like less fragrance but the scent goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> so soft on my skin. scent is great</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to every women. Not only does it give me a youthful look it protects me from the sun.</li>
            <li> Works good for under foundation not too oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used MB products as a member for quite some years, but got tired of paying the hefty postage so I get the items I want, when I want them, from Amazon. (I LOVE MY AMAZON!!!)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried to substitute other products for MB SPF Facial Lotion, but the jury is out. I guess if you wanna spend lots more, you could get a better moisturizer with SPF...</li>
            <li> I need to wear a day cream with some sun protection year round.  This is the lightest formula I have found which offers some protection and a moisturizer both.  It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Day Cr√®me. It&#x27;s very thick and I feel like it really helps my dry skin on my face. The product arrived very fast. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Amazing.... I love it.</li>
            <li> Ordered twice. I love the product.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Great moisturizing, anti-aging  formula with 30spf. I have actually seen results: skin looks fresher, less tired, less fine line wrinkles. Others have noticed, too. Great base for makeup, unlike some other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> This stuff is full of chemicals&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no way Cindy uses these products.</li>
            <li> D5 LINKED TO UTERINE CANCER. MY SISTER USED THIS AND DIED OF OVARIAN CANCER!!!</li>
            <li> My wife love this product .</li>
            <li> Been using this a few weeks now and love it. I have tried all the expensive brands and this worked better than anything I have used in a long while. Goes on nice and smooth and gives my skin a glow.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Meaningful Beauty products now for 4 years and I love the way my skin looks and feels I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> i use it all the time</li>
            <li> I love this product. I received it in several days from ordering.  I will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> I started using this  cream when I ordered the entire Meaningful Beauty kit a year ago, it&#x27;s very good leaves my face soft and subtle not greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;The price is right also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sylvia</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel and look.  Many compliments on my skin lately.</li>
            <li> I will buy this product again.  Very high quality for the price. It  has made my skin feel soft and supple. Fine lines are much less noticeable .  Love the SPF protection.  I have recommended this product  to  my friends.</li>
            <li> Feels good on skin.  Not greasy.  I do see some improvement in my skin.  More than some of the products I had been using.</li>
            <li> I have been using the meaningful beauty products for several years now.  I love this day cream.  It&#x27;s light, fragrance free and protects you from the sun.  If  you want extra protection from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays, I recomment using a sunblock like Shishido&#x27;s face only on top of this day cream.  I have sun spots and I need to keep my skin protected so I make sure all of my face products including makeup has some form of SPF.  It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> I was shipped two for the price of one by surprise, so I am very happy with this order.</li>
            <li> Great quality, it is light enough, skin loves it, and my skin is VERY picky. Great moisturizer - worth the money!</li>
            <li> I love the Meaningful Beauty products. I get compliments on my skin all the time, usually people tell me I have a glow. The antioxidant day moisturizer nourishes my skin. Its not like other products where my skin gets dry. I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Used this for many years.  Great product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent product and it makes me look years younger. I recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Love it, came early that what I expected cool!!!</li>
            <li> Great way to start your day! I can tell a difference and Amazon offers great pricing ... even better than the pricing for Meaningful Beauty Club members.</li>
            <li> This the product wasn&#x27;t very good.it seems like an off brandI&#x27;ve been using this product for over 5 years.I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m oRder from this company again</li>
            <li> MY OPINION IS IT&#x27;S OVER-RATED.  MAYBE IF YOU ARE BETWEEN 30&#x27;S AND 40&#x27;S IT MAY MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND MAYBE IT SHOULD SAY THAT, HOWEVER BEING IN MY 70&#x27;S THERE&#x27;S A FAT CHANCE OF ANY ASSISTANCE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JOANNE MULARZ</li>
            <li> I just started using this product,, so far I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this, the serum, the eye lift cream and the night cream. After 1 day&#x27;s use, my face was red and I had welts all over my face!  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever get rid of the almost scarlike reddish brown marks on my upper cheeks that are still there.  I had a major allergic reaction to something in these products.  My skin can&#x27;t tolerate retin-A types of products, but this line isn&#x27;t supposed to have that, as I understand it. That&#x27;s why I thought I could use it.  I was WRONG.</li>
            <li> small amount for the cost.  Had to reapply frequently.  Disappointed in product</li>
            <li> Fabulous. Great value</li>
            <li> First, this product stings and feels sticky. Also this whole company is a scam and tries to screw you into getting on a monthly delivery and will not take no for an answer. I tried this on a great deal and wish I never had. Be warned.  Meaningful beauty &#x3D; scam.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this cream.</li>
