            <li> My daughter was asking for this for Christmas and the price was cheaper here than it was on the perfume sellers websites.  Needless to say, she was happy to get it, and I was happy it was at a good price.  Thanks!</li>

            <li> It was my mistake. The person wasn&#x27;t stay in the house when the package was delivered and never contac me.</li>
            <li> Overall, very good experience.</li>
            <li> If you like Light Blue by Dolce &amp; Gabanna, then you&#x27;ll love Sporty Citrus.  It has notes of citrus, patchouli, and something I can&#x27;t quite place.  It&#x27;s light and but not faint or fading.  Really fantastic scent.</li>
            <li> this perfume smells great women perfume.</li>

            <li> Love it!!! Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Love it! Sporty and flirty.</li>
            <li> The first time I smelled I was captivated, it smelled like the first perfume I ever remember. Then the citrus got lost to me in the floral notes and I was sad. I love citrus perfume, DKNY women, I Love Love, D &amp; G Light Blue, etc... This was less citrus then I wanted. I add my DKNY to it and am completely satisfied, but warning if citrus is all you want. This has a floral note that can be stronger than the citrus. When I think sporty, I think airy or clean, not the case here-more musky to me.</li>
            <li> Arrived in perfect condition</li>
            <li> I just received a small sample of this from Macy&#x27;s, it smells so wonderful. Its a refreshing feminine citrus scent, and the parfume is very potent. Don&#x27;t use to much, one small spray will last all day. I would definitely buy this.</li>
