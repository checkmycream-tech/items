            <li>and this is the best color I have ever achieved.  </li>
            <li>However, the color was perfect.  </li>
            <li>One of the best self tanners on the market.</li>
            <li>Great product!  </li>

            <li>Very fair skin.  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin and it does not leave me orange!</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>this stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>Great product, no stains, no orange legs, no orange spots.</li>
            <li>and it works great.  </li>
            <li>The oil spray is also great to apply before you use the lotion</li>
            <li>I was nervous to leave it on all night, not knowing what I&#x27;d look like in the morning, but it gave me a great tan.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great.</li>
            <li>It feels great as well.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>May try one more bottle and hope for the best before going with another brand.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin</li>
            <li>Shave, exfoliate, and moisturice the day before, use the gloves, apply it before going to bed, then you&#x27;ll be good to go.</li>
            <li>It may be a good product, Just not for me.</li>
            <li>I did what the directions said to do to the T.On the plus side the exfoliate smells really good.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I always use it at night and love how I get a bronze look; no orange!</li>
            <li>(like Lancome, I love it!)</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF!  </li>
            <li>When I got it, I tried out the body wash which has a very nice smell to it and feels good, but don&#x27;t see where it is anything special.</li>
            <li>The sunless tanner is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I have a nice even color all over.  </li>
            <li>The exfoliator and spray oil are nice and step up your tanning to spa-like experience.</li>
            <li>The best thing is to sleep in old pijamas, so bed</li>
            <li>This is the best self-tanner I have used so far.</li>
            <li>Once morning comes and you wash it off, the resulting color is very nice, but, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the hassles the night before.</li>
            <li>If you are willing to invest the time and energy into the procedure than this would be a great product.</li>
            <li>I have very light skin and have achived a tan that looks like I&#x27;ve been in the sun or tanning bed.  </li>
            <li>My roomie didn&#x27;t agree, but take it from me, I think Neutrogena gradual tanning is better for the face.    </li>
            <li>My inclination even more so was just to use it on my legs.</li>
            <li>You may look a BIT dark/orange on your legs the very day afterwards but after that it looks great.</li>
            <li>No nasty smell, and it</li>
            <li>If you do use the oil, make sure you rub it off with a towel as directed.</li>
            <li>I have just ordered two more bottles of the sunless tanning lotion</li>
            <li>so I gave it 4 stars, but I really do love this tanner.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think either are worthwhile getting (in my case</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the scrub and the tanner doesn&#x27;t have that overbearing sunless tanner smell.</li>
            <li>Because of this, I tend to use the gradual tanner more often.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>The scrub smells great and really exfoliates, the oil spray seems to help with elbows, knees and feet.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure to wear gloves while applying and apply evenly.</li>
            <li>All in all, I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>This makes wearing cute sundresses out of the question without looking ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m left with a perfect even tan.</li>
            <li>As with most beauty products, smell has a lot to do with if i buy it or not.</li>
            <li>I ordered this item because of all of the great reviews it had and thought that it would be better than the product I normally use.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed and will never use anything else!  </li>
            <li>Really nice for times you quickly want some color for your legs but don&#x27;t want to go the tanning route.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m not too happy with this product, I&#x27;m just glad I got to try it for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li>The self tanner goes on, and rubs into my skin easily.  </li>
            <li>Some product WILL wash off with your first shower after application but nice color remains.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and the results are fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Also, another huge benefit is that you can get away with doing this just once</li>
            <li>SMOOTH NO STREAKS 5</li>
            <li>Leaves smooth, sleek, tan look.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve noticed that even a day or so after I&#x27;ve washed off the tanner that it will still lightly stain shirt collars and the like.  </li>
            <li>The tanning lotion itself is FANTASTIC.  </li>
            <li>This is a great set of products - follow directions and you have nice color for a few days.</li>
            <li>Another good thing is that the tanner is color coded a deep brown, so you can be sure not to miss any areas.  </li>
            <li>Although I am not gonna purchase again, I want something very easy and fast</li>
            <li>but it was SO WORTH IT!</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t buy again, but this is my first time in the non-tanning bed world :)</li>
            <li>They refunded my money....but not my original shipping cost</li>
            <li>The flawless fake bake was much better and it smelled much better as well.</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re new to the tanning lotion process, it&#x27;s really nice to have all you need in one package.  </li>
            <li>Not bad at all, though it did stain my bedsheets, the sheets came clean in the laundry.    </li>
            <li>and I recommend doing it infront of a full length mirror if you have one...</li>
            <li>but I do suggest staying in cool temps</li>
            <li>Better then an airbrush tan and looks real.  </li>
            <li>Sleeping in full body pajamas and socks can be a bit toasty in the summer though.</li>
            <li>It really helps your tan&#x27;s staying power and allows the tanner absorb better into your skin.</li>
            <li>Only buy what you plan on using within 6 months, so don&#x27;t &#x27;stock up&#x27; of you find a good deal.</li>
            <li>Takes a few applications to build up a tan but it smells great and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is easy and actually pretty quick to apply.</li>
            <li>After researching sunless tanning lotions, I decided to try this product due to all the great reviews.</li>
            <li>Seriously the best tanning product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I use the oil for a quick moisturizer out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>Follow the directions and put a little time into applying and you will look beautifully tan.  </li>
            <li>I was horrified the first time I used it because it is so dark, but all of that washes off and leaves a beautiful \\&quot;tan\\&quot; (no orange-y Paris Hilton tan)  </li>
            <li>I bought this and found that applying the tanner was messy, the scrub and spray smell great.</li>
            <li>Buy this product, it is worth the money, and you will NOT be disapointed</li>
            <li>and I got the most natural looking tan from this compared to some that give you an orange look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so worth the price.</li>
            <li>nice but the same effect as a shower scrunchie...</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth it to avoid getting skin cancer.    </li>
            <li>But after I showered the next morning I had a great, natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li>This was worth every penny to me.</li>
            <li>It does give you a nice brown (not yellow!!)</li>
            <li>I love love love love fake bake.  </li>
            <li>the &#x27;stains&#x27; in clothing and sheets comes right out.</li>
            <li>The selftanner works great, and gives great color without orange, but application is hella annoying.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended Fake Bake as the best sunless tanning product available, and I completely agree!  </li>
            <li>It was nice to purchase the trio-pack at a decent price seeing their individual prices.</li>
            <li>Realistic color, never orange, great for pale skin, no skin cancer issues.</li>
            <li>When I put it on the first time I was was sweating because it takes a lot of work-</li>
            <li>The first time I applied it to my knees and elbows...</li>
            <li>Also, my first time with this I ended up with an itchy rash on my arms, but I tried it again and this time made sure to use moisturizer the next morning after washing off the excess tanner, and the rash never reappeared.</li>
            <li>so you can see exactly where you are applying it.</li>
            <li>** while I still LOVE Fake Bake, I love the spray version even better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with Fake Bake.</li>
            <li>Of course apply more later if you want a darker appearance.</li>
            <li>First of all, let me say, I have been doing the tanning bed thing for years and finally decided to take better care of my skin and try to avoid it this year.  </li>
            <li>I purchased one of those 5 inch diameter body talc applicators (the smooth one, not a fluffy one) at the drugstore to use to apply the lotion</li>
            <li>We love this product and will continue to use it in the future!</li>
            <li>Fake Bake is probably one of the best self tanners out there.  </li>
            <li>/week since the tan lasts longer than that of more traditional self tanners, which seem to fade after a couple of days.  </li>
            <li>I love the deep even color it gives me.</li>
            <li>This is an absolute must!  </li>
            <li>It comes on so dark which makes it easy to smooth out the streaks and when you wash it all off, the shade is just about right.</li>
            <li>While it does have an odor, I find it&#x27;s not nearly as bad as that of many other brands.  </li>
            <li>I usually use a body oil after I shower which I think is pretty much as good as their smoothing spray.    </li>
            <li>Nothing I have seen even comes close to looking as natural (it leaves more of the natural brown hues to the tan rather than the dreaded orange ones).  </li>
            <li>And it looks like a real tan not fake orange.</li>
            <li>As long as you apply it properly adn put in the effort to create a good results, that is exactly what you will get.</li>
            <li>just a nice dark tan.  </li>
            <li>I hope they go back to the original as that deep walnut color is much better than the orangey color.</li>
            <li>I love the the smell of the body polish and dry oil.  </li>
            <li>I have never seriously tried to use this stuff and was honestly pretty nervous about it.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t tan green, but won&#x27;t get the same great results.</li>
            <li>and they blended really well.</li>
            <li>I have found that mixing it with Jergen&#x27;s Natuarl Glow Moisturizer Firming Lotion on these problem areas really helps.  </li>
            <li>so I can continue to look very tan.  </li>
            <li>The color of the tan is very brown...not orange at all.  </li>
            <li>It looks real.  </li>
            <li>A final benefit is that it dries pretty quickly.    </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants a realistic looking tan without the sun damage.</li>
            <li>And the bronzer makes it&#x27;s fool proof as long as you take the time to really smooth it out all over your body.  </li>
            <li>Summer is usually the time when I would want to put energy into getting a nice sunless tan with this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Remember to exfoliate (I use pore refining cleanser/scrub and those nylon mittens), and I would recommend the oil, because it really does help the elbows, ankles and knees from becoming too dark.  </li>
            <li>i highly recommend it...</li>
            <li>Applying it can be a little challenging</li>
            <li>She did not have enough time for weeks worth of sunbed tanning and did not want to pay the high prices for air brush tanning.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice because even though it goes on dark, it fades the next morning after applying it so it works for any skin tones.</li>
            <li>You can pretty much use any exfoliating wash or even scruby and get the same results.</li>
            <li>The first time I ever purchased a bottle of the fake bake I LOVED it.  </li>
            <li>Exfoliate, exfoliate, exfoliate, that&#x27;s the secret to a good all over tan.</li>
            <li>You have to put it on before bed, after you shower and ex foliate, wait for it to dry, and then put on full body sleep wear to not get it on your bedding.</li>
            <li>After two applications in one week, my new coworkers thought I had been going to the tanning bed for a month.</li>
            <li>As for getting a smooth even tan, take it from this white as white Irishman, it works.</li>
            <li>Very natural color and even.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly and the next morning, after showering -</li>
            <li>But I was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li>I first tried this line back in early 2000&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>It allowed you to get a realistic instant tan and dried pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>Also, this product doesn&#x27;t have that super stong smell you get from other tanning</li>
            <li>I work in law enforcement and the only part of me that is ever exposed to sun is my forearms and neck, giving me the classic farmer&#x27;s tan!</li>
            <li>It smells good, covers well, some areas go on a little darker but after a few minutes everywhere evens out.</li>
            <li>The next morning I had so much color.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works and you see results the next morning just as the product says you would.  </li>
            <li>The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because it is very time consuming to rub in</li>
            <li>I may continue to experiment, but this is BY FAR the biggest problem.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m about ready to buy my second</li>
            <li>The spray thing for knees sucks:)</li>
            <li>I always loved Fake Bake, never had an issue.  </li>
            <li>It requires a little work but worth it!</li>
            <li>THe next few times you apply this, it is really easy.</li>
            <li>I think you don&#x27;t so much need the scrub if you dry brush</li>
            <li>It really looks like I&#x27;ve been outside working on my tan, if I apply properly.  </li>
            <li>However, when the stain washed off in the shower, there wasn&#x27;t much of the longer lasting tan effect left.  </li>
            <li>First of all, the other two bottles in this tri-pak are a scrub and an oil based spray on lotion.  </li>
            <li>When I ordered my second bottle, it was orangey - not at all realistic especially in sunlight.  </li>
            <li>I do believe exfoliating is the key to getting and maintaining this natural tan.</li>
            <li>I look like I have a natural \\&quot;tan\\&quot; that took lots of work but in reality only took one night, (or six hours of letting the product do its stuff)  </li>
            <li>I am fair skinned to begin with, so I was afraid of turning too brown and looking unnatural.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t use either and neither are necessary to get the most out of the fake bake itself.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, if you follow instructions, and leaves a natural tan color behind.</li>
            <li>It took a while to apply, same as any other self tanner, but, I do believe it is a bit more messy and thank goodness they supply gloves for you cause it stains alot easier too.</li>
            <li>My skin does stay soft and supple all day long and not greasy.</li>
            <li>The body polish does not leave a residue and the dry oil is not greasy at all and left my skin feeling very soft.  </li>
            <li>The scrub is also good at removing the dead skin which you will need to do at least every other day.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> When I got it, I tried out the body wash which has a very nice smell to it and feels good, but don&#x27;t see where it is anything special.</li>
            <li> The sunless tanner is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I have a nice even color all over.  </li>
            <li> The exfoliator and spray oil are nice and step up your tanning to spa-like experience.</li>
            <li> The best thing is to sleep in old pijamas, so bed</li>
            <li> This is the best self-tanner I have used so far.</li>
            <li> Once morning comes and you wash it off, the resulting color is very nice, but, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the hassles the night before.</li>
            <li> If you are willing to invest the time and energy into the procedure than this would be a great product.</li>
            <li> I have very light skin and have achived a tan that looks like I&#x27;ve been in the sun or tanning bed.  </li>
            <li> My roomie didn&#x27;t agree, but take it from me, I think Neutrogena gradual tanning is better for the face.    </li>
            <li> My inclination even more so was just to use it on my legs.</li>
            <li> You may look a BIT dark/orange on your legs the very day afterwards but after that it looks great.</li>
            <li> No nasty smell, and it</li>
            <li> If you do use the oil, make sure you rub it off with a towel as directed.</li>
            <li> I have just ordered two more bottles of the sunless tanning lotion</li>
            <li> so I gave it 4 stars, but I really do love this tanner.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think either are worthwhile getting (in my case</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the scrub and the tanner doesn&#x27;t have that overbearing sunless tanner smell.</li>
            <li> Because of this, I tend to use the gradual tanner more often.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> The scrub smells great and really exfoliates, the oil spray seems to help with elbows, knees and feet.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure to wear gloves while applying and apply evenly.</li>
            <li> All in all, I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This makes wearing cute sundresses out of the question without looking ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m left with a perfect even tan.</li>
            <li> As with most beauty products, smell has a lot to do with if i buy it or not.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item because of all of the great reviews it had and thought that it would be better than the product I normally use.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed and will never use anything else!  </li>
            <li> Really nice for times you quickly want some color for your legs but don&#x27;t want to go the tanning route.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m not too happy with this product, I&#x27;m just glad I got to try it for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> The self tanner goes on, and rubs into my skin easily.  </li>
            <li> Some product WILL wash off with your first shower after application but nice color remains.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use and the results are fabulous.  </li>
            <li> Also, another huge benefit is that you can get away with doing this just once</li>
            <li> SMOOTH NO STREAKS 5</li>
            <li> Leaves smooth, sleek, tan look.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve noticed that even a day or so after I&#x27;ve washed off the tanner that it will still lightly stain shirt collars and the like.  </li>
            <li> The tanning lotion itself is FANTASTIC.  </li>
            <li> This is a great set of products - follow directions and you have nice color for a few days.</li>
            <li> Another good thing is that the tanner is color coded a deep brown, so you can be sure not to miss any areas.  </li>
            <li> Although I am not gonna purchase again, I want something very easy and fast</li>
            <li> but it was SO WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t buy again, but this is my first time in the non-tanning bed world :)</li>
            <li> They refunded my money....but not my original shipping cost</li>
            <li> The flawless fake bake was much better and it smelled much better as well.</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re new to the tanning lotion process, it&#x27;s really nice to have all you need in one package.  </li>
            <li> Not bad at all, though it did stain my bedsheets, the sheets came clean in the laundry.    </li>
            <li> and I recommend doing it infront of a full length mirror if you have one...</li>
            <li> but I do suggest staying in cool temps</li>
            <li> Better then an airbrush tan and looks real.  </li>
            <li> Sleeping in full body pajamas and socks can be a bit toasty in the summer though.</li>
            <li> It really helps your tan&#x27;s staying power and allows the tanner absorb better into your skin.</li>
            <li> Only buy what you plan on using within 6 months, so don&#x27;t &#x27;stock up&#x27; of you find a good deal.</li>
            <li> Takes a few applications to build up a tan but it smells great and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is easy and actually pretty quick to apply.</li>
            <li> After researching sunless tanning lotions, I decided to try this product due to all the great reviews.</li>
            <li> Seriously the best tanning product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I use the oil for a quick moisturizer out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> Follow the directions and put a little time into applying and you will look beautifully tan.  </li>
            <li> I was horrified the first time I used it because it is so dark, but all of that washes off and leaves a beautiful \\&quot;tan\\&quot; (no orange-y Paris Hilton tan)  </li>
            <li> I bought this and found that applying the tanner was messy, the scrub and spray smell great.</li>
            <li> Buy this product, it is worth the money, and you will NOT be disapointed</li>
            <li> and I got the most natural looking tan from this compared to some that give you an orange look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so worth the price.</li>
            <li> nice but the same effect as a shower scrunchie...</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth it to avoid getting skin cancer.    </li>
            <li> But after I showered the next morning I had a great, natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li> This was worth every penny to me.</li>
            <li> It does give you a nice brown (not yellow!!)</li>
            <li> I love love love love fake bake.  </li>
            <li> the &#x27;stains&#x27; in clothing and sheets comes right out.</li>
            <li> The selftanner works great, and gives great color without orange, but application is hella annoying.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended Fake Bake as the best sunless tanning product available, and I completely agree!  </li>
            <li> It was nice to purchase the trio-pack at a decent price seeing their individual prices.</li>
            <li> Realistic color, never orange, great for pale skin, no skin cancer issues.</li>
            <li> When I put it on the first time I was was sweating because it takes a lot of work-</li>
            <li> The first time I applied it to my knees and elbows...</li>
            <li> Also, my first time with this I ended up with an itchy rash on my arms, but I tried it again and this time made sure to use moisturizer the next morning after washing off the excess tanner, and the rash never reappeared.</li>
            <li> so you can see exactly where you are applying it.</li>
            <li> ** while I still LOVE Fake Bake, I love the spray version even better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with Fake Bake.</li>
            <li> Of course apply more later if you want a darker appearance.</li>
            <li> First of all, let me say, I have been doing the tanning bed thing for years and finally decided to take better care of my skin and try to avoid it this year.  </li>
            <li> I purchased one of those 5 inch diameter body talc applicators (the smooth one, not a fluffy one) at the drugstore to use to apply the lotion</li>
            <li> We love this product and will continue to use it in the future!</li>
            <li> Fake Bake is probably one of the best self tanners out there.  </li>
            <li> /week since the tan lasts longer than that of more traditional self tanners, which seem to fade after a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> I love the deep even color it gives me.</li>
            <li> This is an absolute must!  </li>
            <li> It comes on so dark which makes it easy to smooth out the streaks and when you wash it all off, the shade is just about right.</li>
            <li> While it does have an odor, I find it&#x27;s not nearly as bad as that of many other brands.  </li>
            <li> I usually use a body oil after I shower which I think is pretty much as good as their smoothing spray.    </li>
            <li> Nothing I have seen even comes close to looking as natural (it leaves more of the natural brown hues to the tan rather than the dreaded orange ones).  </li>
            <li> And it looks like a real tan not fake orange.</li>
            <li> As long as you apply it properly adn put in the effort to create a good results, that is exactly what you will get.</li>
            <li> just a nice dark tan.  </li>
            <li> I hope they go back to the original as that deep walnut color is much better than the orangey color.</li>
            <li> I love the the smell of the body polish and dry oil.  </li>
            <li> I have never seriously tried to use this stuff and was honestly pretty nervous about it.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t tan green, but won&#x27;t get the same great results.</li>
            <li> and they blended really well.</li>
            <li> I have found that mixing it with Jergen&#x27;s Natuarl Glow Moisturizer Firming Lotion on these problem areas really helps.  </li>
            <li> so I can continue to look very tan.  </li>
            <li> The color of the tan is very brown...not orange at all.  </li>
            <li> It looks real.  </li>
            <li> A final benefit is that it dries pretty quickly.    </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants a realistic looking tan without the sun damage.</li>
            <li> And the bronzer makes it&#x27;s fool proof as long as you take the time to really smooth it out all over your body.  </li>
            <li> Summer is usually the time when I would want to put energy into getting a nice sunless tan with this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Remember to exfoliate (I use pore refining cleanser/scrub and those nylon mittens), and I would recommend the oil, because it really does help the elbows, ankles and knees from becoming too dark.  </li>
            <li> i highly recommend it...</li>
            <li> Applying it can be a little challenging</li>
            <li> She did not have enough time for weeks worth of sunbed tanning and did not want to pay the high prices for air brush tanning.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice because even though it goes on dark, it fades the next morning after applying it so it works for any skin tones.</li>
            <li> You can pretty much use any exfoliating wash or even scruby and get the same results.</li>
            <li> The first time I ever purchased a bottle of the fake bake I LOVED it.  </li>
            <li> Exfoliate, exfoliate, exfoliate, that&#x27;s the secret to a good all over tan.</li>
            <li> You have to put it on before bed, after you shower and ex foliate, wait for it to dry, and then put on full body sleep wear to not get it on your bedding.</li>
            <li> After two applications in one week, my new coworkers thought I had been going to the tanning bed for a month.</li>
            <li> As for getting a smooth even tan, take it from this white as white Irishman, it works.</li>
            <li> Very natural color and even.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly and the next morning, after showering -</li>
            <li> But I was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li> I first tried this line back in early 2000&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> It allowed you to get a realistic instant tan and dried pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> Also, this product doesn&#x27;t have that super stong smell you get from other tanning</li>
            <li> I work in law enforcement and the only part of me that is ever exposed to sun is my forearms and neck, giving me the classic farmer&#x27;s tan!</li>
            <li> It smells good, covers well, some areas go on a little darker but after a few minutes everywhere evens out.</li>
            <li> The next morning I had so much color.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works and you see results the next morning just as the product says you would.  </li>
            <li> The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because it is very time consuming to rub in</li>
            <li> I may continue to experiment, but this is BY FAR the biggest problem.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m about ready to buy my second</li>
            <li> The spray thing for knees sucks:)</li>
            <li> I always loved Fake Bake, never had an issue.  </li>
            <li> It requires a little work but worth it!</li>
            <li> THe next few times you apply this, it is really easy.</li>
            <li> I think you don&#x27;t so much need the scrub if you dry brush</li>
            <li> It really looks like I&#x27;ve been outside working on my tan, if I apply properly.  </li>
            <li> However, when the stain washed off in the shower, there wasn&#x27;t much of the longer lasting tan effect left.  </li>
            <li> First of all, the other two bottles in this tri-pak are a scrub and an oil based spray on lotion.  </li>
            <li> When I ordered my second bottle, it was orangey - not at all realistic especially in sunlight.  </li>
            <li> I do believe exfoliating is the key to getting and maintaining this natural tan.</li>
            <li> I look like I have a natural \\&quot;tan\\&quot; that took lots of work but in reality only took one night, (or six hours of letting the product do its stuff)  </li>
            <li> I am fair skinned to begin with, so I was afraid of turning too brown and looking unnatural.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t use either and neither are necessary to get the most out of the fake bake itself.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply, if you follow instructions, and leaves a natural tan color behind.</li>
            <li> It took a while to apply, same as any other self tanner, but, I do believe it is a bit more messy and thank goodness they supply gloves for you cause it stains alot easier too.</li>
            <li> My skin does stay soft and supple all day long and not greasy.</li>
            <li> The body polish does not leave a residue and the dry oil is not greasy at all and left my skin feeling very soft.  </li>
            <li> The scrub is also good at removing the dead skin which you will need to do at least every other day.  </li>
            <li> I have heard rave reviews about the Fake Bake product and was very excited to try it.</li>
            <li> A little too high maintenance for the goal I was trying to achieve.  </li>
            <li> It does take a while to dry enough to put clothes on</li>
            <li> When I tried to contact the company about returning it they acted like they had done nothing wrong and simply told me \\&quot;Feel free to return the product.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I can understand if it had been missing a little....but not half!</li>
            <li> I use the Body Polish on all areas of my body, concentrating on rough areas such as elbows, knees, ankles and feet.  </li>
            <li> Most of all the fake bake self tanner works wonders!</li>
            <li> For me the fake bake original didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;d chalk the rash up to dry skin.</li>
            <li> After showering, I pat my skin dry with a towel</li>
            <li> It just subtly tans and says on the bottle that its just to give you a glow and not really a tan,  but its great to use everyday in between using the Fake Bake once a week.</li>
            <li> It barely smells weird and works really really well!  </li>
            <li> Fake Bake is easy to use because it is so dark, I can see any spot I miss.  </li>
            <li> The scrub does kinda of smell weird, but not bad.  </li>
            <li> This year, I decided to try Fake Bake because the tanning bed is bad for the skin, especially if you are fair and moley like me!  </li>
            <li> all the other reviews, I take my time in preparation (scrubbing and deep moisturizing the day before), apply at night (which takes only a few minutes once you get the hang of it), go to bed and rinse off in the shower in the morning.</li>
            <li> My little sister was recently in a pagent and needed a dark tan for the white dress that she planned to wear.  </li>
            <li> As other people mention, the tanner will come off even when its dry and go onto your clothes and your sheets.  </li>
            <li> last few days.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t ever get to use the product because I didn&#x27;t not want to pay for a halfway empty bottle.</li>
            <li> I only use Fake Bake tanning products because the color always looks realistic.  </li>
            <li> Using their standard cream was a little too dark</li>
            <li> Fake Bake was highly recommended to me by a former pagent queen, so I thought we would try it.  </li>
            <li> researched long and hard about tanners and used this based on reviews from several sources.</li>
            <li> I thin it down with lotion and rub it in very well.  </li>
            <li> (the other stuff you can do without).  </li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a bit of a pain to apply at night, and it does get all over sheets/clothing, but so do the other tanners as your skin sheds cells.  </li>
            <li> After showering the color guide away it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes like other self tanners will.</li>
            <li> Yes, you still have to be careful when you put it on, you can streak yourself!</li>
            <li> You rub it in like a night-time lotion, let it dry a few minutes, put pjs on, and then go to bed.  </li>
            <li> I am naturally very pale and literally only my face and forearms tan.</li>
            <li> TOO DARK 3</li>
            <li> The dark brown bottled self tanner is what you want</li>
            <li> The tanner is dark, but works.  </li>
            <li> It has no smell like other self-tanners I have used unless you sweat!</li>
            <li> I hear Fake Bake is coming out with a new product in February that may change this</li>
            <li> The first time my feet looked horrible but you have to mix it well and really rub it in.  </li>
            <li> Those fluorescent lights can be a little unforgiving</li>
            <li> This probably is helping maintain the tan a little longer.  </li>
            <li> Never orange and little to no smell.</li>
            <li> I also use Oil of Olay Quench Radiance Reviver everyday.  </li>
            <li> I am not one to use tanning lotions very often, mainly due to bad experiences (looking orange, missing spots, staining my hands), so I was a little nervous to try this.  </li>
            <li> However I am pale and have an upcoming trip to Hawaii, so I swallowed my fear and tried it out.  </li>
            <li> The lotion bottle was missing almost 3 oz (half the product!!).</li>
            <li> I bought this at less than half the price that it is listed at now, which is disappointing to see such a jump in price....</li>
            <li> No more tanning beds or sunburns for me.</li>
            <li> , the tri-pak was the same price as the bottle of fake bake).  </li>
            <li> The rest of me would take the entire summer of outdoor and indoor tanning to achieve the look I get in just a couple of days of using Fake Bake!&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> You cannot tell where my natural forearm tan ends and where the fake bake tan begins!  </li>
            <li> Before using the self tanner, I use the Fake Bake Body Polish in the shower,  which is basically a scrub to get the dry skin off of my body.  </li>
            <li> It used to be the streaks, so that one&#x27;s solved at least.</li>
            <li> The next morning you rinse off (water will look dirty as it rinses off)  </li>
            <li> Another drawback is that you must use this either at night when you go to bed, or if you will be indoors for at least 4 hours without company (the minimum time recommended).  </li>
            <li> No more orange!</li>
            <li> Too bad that with the shower you loose a lot of color, but you will be still tan.</li>
            <li> The exfoliator it&#x60;s not great, but it does its job.</li>
            <li> I use the tanner on my face instead of facial base.  </li>
            <li> If you notice the lotion appears to have a green tinge it has gone &#x27;bad&#x27;.</li>
            <li> WHAT is that weird smell these self tanners leave?</li>
            <li> The Fake Bake itself?  </li>
            <li> Fake Bake Self-Tanning Lotion 6 oz.]</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended Fake Bake as the best sunless tanning product available, and I completely agree!  After two applications in one week, my new coworkers thought I had been going to the tanning bed for a month. I am naturally very fair skinned, so this is quite an accomplishment!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. When I put it on the first time I was was sweating because it takes a lot of work- but it was SO WORTH IT! The next morning I had so much color. Not only was I tan, I was glowing because the tan brought out the color in my eyes, lips, and skin. THe next few times you apply this, it is really easy. It is like you are just putting lotion on. The first time I applied it to my knees and elbows...but the next 2 times I didnt...and they blended really well. I have gotten nothing but compliments from EVERYONE that sees me! It is such a boost of confidence. Buy this product, it is worth the money, and you will NOT be disapointed</li>
            <li> This stuff really works and you see results the next morning just as the product says you would.  The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because it is very time consuming to rub in and if you don&#x27;t wear gloves it will stain your hands.  I love the the smell of the body polish and dry oil.  The body polish does not leave a residue and the dry oil is not greasy at all and left my skin feeling very soft.  I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST self tanner! I have fair skin and I got the most natural looking tan from this compared to some that give you an orange look. If you follow the instructions and take the time to do all the steps, you should have the same results. I do believe exfoliating is the key to getting and maintaining this natural tan. Also, my first time with this I ended up with an itchy rash on my arms, but I tried it again and this time made sure to use moisturizer the next morning after washing off the excess tanner, and the rash never reappeared. I guess I&#x27;d chalk the rash up to dry skin. I bought this at less than half the price that it is listed at now, which is disappointing to see such a jump in price....I suppose demand has gone up - doesn&#x27;t surprise me!</li>
            <li> If they gave me the option I&#x27;d give this 3 1/2.     1. SMOOTH NO STREAKS 5*****    As for getting a smooth even tan, take it from this white as white Irishman, it works. It comes on so dark which makes it easy to smooth out the streaks and when you wash it all off, the shade is just about right. I usually use a body oil after I shower which I think is pretty much as good as their smoothing spray.    2. FACE TOO DARK 3***    Using their standard cream was a little too dark and when I was at the drugstore I happened to pass a mirror. Those fluorescent lights can be a little unforgiving but i felt a bit unnatural looking. My roomie didn&#x27;t agree, but take it from me, I think Neutrogena gradual tanning is better for the face.    3. THE SMELL IS STILL THERE 1*    WHAT is that weird smell these self tanners leave? I hear Fake Bake is coming out with a new product in February that may change this but for now, anyone who knows that odor is going to know from miles away that you&#x27;re using the chemical color. My inclination even more so was just to use it on my legs. I may continue to experiment, but this is BY FAR the biggest problem. It used to be the streaks, so that one&#x27;s solved at least.</li>
            <li> As long as you apply it properly adn put in the effort to create a good results, that is exactly what you will get. Shave, exfoliate, and moisturice the day before, use the gloves, apply it before going to bed, then you&#x27;ll be good to go. You may look a BIT dark/orange on your legs the very day afterwards but after that it looks great.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It is so easy to use and the results are fabulous.  I look like I have a natural \\&quot;tan\\&quot; that took lots of work but in reality only took one night, (or six hours of letting the product do its stuff)  The \\&quot;tan\\&quot; lasts about a week.  Fake Bake is easy to use because it is so dark, I can see any spot I miss.  I was horrified the first time I used it because it is so dark, but all of that washes off and leaves a beautiful \\&quot;tan\\&quot; (no orange-y Paris Hilton tan)  My husband was impressed.  No more tanning beds or sunburns for me.</li>
            <li> I have found TRULY the best self tanner! It&#x27;s dummy-proof to apply, and gives a GREAT tan look after just one application!   It&#x27;s so worth the price. The dark brown bottled self tanner is what you want (the other stuff you can do without).  Head&#x27;s up: The tanner itself looks the color of chocolate syrup but it doesn&#x27;t turn you into that color, it&#x27;s strictly so you can see exactly where you are applying it. You rub it in like a night-time lotion, let it dry a few minutes, put pjs on, and then go to bed.  The next morning you rinse off (water will look dirty as it rinses off)  and you&#x27;re tan! One or 2 applications is all it takes.  It lasts for about 5 days.  I will never use anything else!!</li>
            <li> This is the only self tanner that I have ever used that did not streak!  Just followed the directions and I have an even BROWN tan.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Seriously the best tanning product I&#x27;ve tried. I always use it at night and love how I get a bronze look; no orange! Also, this product doesn&#x27;t have that super stong smell you get from other tanning products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update*** while I still LOVE Fake Bake, I love the spray version even better</li>
            <li> I am a redhead.  Very fair skin.  I usually start going to the tanning bed around March for about 2 months to build a base tan for spring.  This year, I decided to try Fake Bake because the tanning bed is bad for the skin, especially if you are fair and moley like me!  I decided to apply this on a Friday night in case I came out looking like an orange and white zebra I would have the weekend to figure out what to do, but nope...this stuff is great.  I followed the directions exactly and the next morning, after showering - I have a nice even color all over.  I am impressed!  I have used it twice now.  Fakebake.com recommends using it once a week to maintain a tan.  The second time I used it, same results but I am even darker.  It looks like I have been going to the tanning bed.  Very natural color and even.  I also use Oil of Olay Quench Radiance Reviver everyday.  This probably is helping maintain the tan a little longer.  This is regular Oil of Olay Quench lotion with a hint of self tanner in it.  It just subtly tans and says on the bottle that its just to give you a glow and not really a tan,  but its great to use everyday in between using the Fake Bake once a week.</li>
            <li> Exfoliate, exfoliate, exfoliate, that&#x27;s the secret to a good all over tan.Great product, no stains, no orange legs, no orange spots.Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with Fake Bake. It was nice to purchase the trio-pack at a decent price seeing their individual prices. Most of all the fake bake self tanner works wonders! I have fair skin and it does not leave me orange! Applying it can be a little challenging and I recommend doing it infront of a full length mirror if you have one...that way you can look out for any smudges. It&#x27;s nice because even though it goes on dark, it fades the next morning after applying it so it works for any skin tones. Of course apply more later if you want a darker appearance.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!!!! i highly recommend it...i&#x27;m about ready to buy my second bottle!!i got the package in 2 days and everything went perfectly!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this item because of all of the great reviews it had and thought that it would be better than the product I normally use. When I got it, I tried out the body wash which has a very nice smell to it and feels good, but don&#x27;t see where it is anything special. You can pretty much use any exfoliating wash or even scruby and get the same results. Then I tried out the tanning lotion itself. It took a while to apply, same as any other self tanner, but, I do believe it is a bit more messy and thank goodness they supply gloves for you cause it stains alot easier too. It does take a while to dry enough to put clothes on but I do suggest staying in cool temps cause it will \\&quot;remelt\\&quot; and stain. It also does stain the bed sheets. Once morning comes and you wash it off, the resulting color is very nice, but, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the hassles the night before. The stains do come out from the sheets though. Overall, I&#x27;m not too happy with this product, I&#x27;m just glad I got to try it for a cheaper price. Oh well!</li>
            <li> 1st off, the customer service was superb...no complaints.  The exfoliater lotion...nice but the same effect as a shower scrunchie...the oil after tan?   Kinda too greasy.  The Fake Bake itself?  Not bad at all, though it did stain my bedsheets, the sheets came clean in the laundry.    A little too high maintenance for the goal I was trying to achieve.  Won&#x27;t buy again, but this is my first time in the non-tanning bed world :)</li>
            <li> The exfoliator it&#x60;s not great, but it does its job. The spray thing for knees sucks:) The selftanner works great, and gives great color without orange, but application is hella annoying. You have to use gloves, because it stains immediately, and it takes a lot of time. The best thing is to sleep in old pijamas, so bed won&#x60;t be dirty after the night. Too bad that with the shower you loose a lot of color, but you will be still tan. No nasty smell, and it last few days.Although I am not gonna purchase again, I want something very easy and fast (like Lancome, I love it!)</li>
            <li> After researching sunless tanning lotions, I decided to try this product due to all the great reviews. First of all, let me say, I have been doing the tanning bed thing for years and finally decided to take better care of my skin and try to avoid it this year.  I was not looking forward to spending the summer white!! The sunless tanner is amazing.  You do have to follow the instructions and wear gloves and the application does take practice.  I purchased one of those 5 inch diameter body talc applicators (the smooth one, not a fluffy one) at the drugstore to use to apply the lotion and it works great.  Around my feet, ankles, knees, and elbows I thin it down with lotion and rub it in very well.  The first time my feet looked horrible but you have to mix it well and really rub it in.  I have found that mixing it with Jergen&#x27;s Natuarl Glow Moisturizer Firming Lotion on these problem areas really helps.  The oil spray is also great to apply before you use the lotion but you cannot mix the two together as I found then the lotion doesn&#x27;t stick as well then. If you do use the oil, make sure you rub it off with a towel as directed. I use the oil for a quick moisturizer out of the shower.  The scrub is also good at removing the dead skin which you will need to do at least every other day.  I have just ordered two more bottles of the sunless tanning lotion so I can continue to look very tan.  The color of the tan is very brown...not orange at all.  I have very light skin and have achived a tan that looks like I&#x27;ve been in the sun or tanning bed.  Hope this review helps everyone...remember it does take practice.  After three applications every night in a row I was the desired color.  After that, once a week has been enough for me.  It requires a little work but worth it!</li>
            <li> My little sister was recently in a pagent and needed a dark tan for the white dress that she planned to wear.  She did not have enough time for weeks worth of sunbed tanning and did not want to pay the high prices for air brush tanning.  Fake Bake was highly recommended to me by a former pagent queen, so I thought we would try it.  I purchased the tri-pack of tanner, exfoliating cleanser and moisturizing spray and received it 3 days before her pagent.  My sister used it 2 times before the pagent and had the best and darkest tan of anyone there.  (And she won!)  There were no streaks or blotchy spots...just a nice dark tan.  We love this product and will continue to use it in the future!</li>
            <li> This is a great set of products - follow directions and you have nice color for a few days. It is easy and actually pretty quick to apply. Leaves smooth, sleek, tan look. Really nice for times you quickly want some color for your legs but don&#x27;t want to go the tanning route. Over-applying will turn you too orange. Some product WILL wash off with your first shower after application but nice color remains. The exfoliator and spray oil are nice and step up your tanning to spa-like experience.</li>
            <li> I get this tanner from my sister in law at a discounted price.  It is the best self tanner I have ever used (I have used Banana Boat, Neutrogena, Loreal) and this is the best color I have ever achieved.  It really looks like I&#x27;ve been outside working on my tan, if I apply properly.  Remember to exfoliate (I use pore refining cleanser/scrub and those nylon mittens), and I would recommend the oil, because it really does help the elbows, ankles and knees from becoming too dark.  Yes, it&#x27;s a bit of a pain to apply at night, and it does get all over sheets/clothing, but so do the other tanners as your skin sheds cells.  I think it&#x27;s worth it to avoid getting skin cancer.    I&#x27;ve never used the scrub so I gave it 4 stars, but I really do love this tanner.</li>
            <li> I am not one to use tanning lotions very often, mainly due to bad experiences (looking orange, missing spots, staining my hands), so I was a little nervous to try this.  But I was pleasantly surprised!  I was nervous to leave it on all night, not knowing what I&#x27;d look like in the morning, but it gave me a great tan.  I am fair skinned to begin with, so I was afraid of turning too brown and looking unnatural.  But after I showered the next morning I had a great, natural looking tan.  It was even and I didn&#x27;t miss any spots.  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The first time I ever purchased a bottle of the fake bake I LOVED it.  It had an instant skin stain which was similar to a deep walnut color, not orangey at all.  It allowed you to get a realistic instant tan and dried pretty quickly.  However, when the stain washed off in the shower, there wasn&#x27;t much of the longer lasting tan effect left.  However, the color was perfect.  When I ordered my second bottle, it was orangey - not at all realistic especially in sunlight.  Wondering if they changed their formula...  I hope they go back to the original as that deep walnut color is much better than the orangey color. May try one more bottle and hope for the best before going with another brand.</li>
            <li> Better then an airbrush tan and looks real.  I recommend this product for everyone. Follow the directions and put a little time into applying and you will look beautifully tan.  And it looks like a real tan not fake orange.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000B8VBI6 Fake Bake Self-Tanning Lotion 6 oz.]] One of the best self tanners on the market.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake is probably one of the best self tanners out there.  Nothing I have seen even comes close to looking as natural (it leaves more of the natural brown hues to the tan rather than the dreaded orange ones).  No one can even tell I use self-tanner!  Also, another huge benefit is that you can get away with doing this just once/week since the tan lasts longer than that of more traditional self tanners, which seem to fade after a couple of days.  And if you use it twice a week, you will have a very deep tan.  While it does have an odor, I find it&#x27;s not nearly as bad as that of many other brands.  Another good thing is that the tanner is color coded a deep brown, so you can be sure not to miss any areas.  A final benefit is that it dries pretty quickly.    Now for some of the drawbacks.  First of all, the other two bottles in this tri-pak are a scrub and an oil based spray on lotion.  I don&#x27;t think either are worthwhile getting (in my case, the tri-pak was the same price as the bottle of fake bake).  I really don&#x27;t use either and neither are necessary to get the most out of the fake bake itself.  Another drawback is that you must use this either at night when you go to bed, or if you will be indoors for at least 4 hours without company (the minimum time recommended).  Trust me, when you put it on (especially on your neck or face), you will understand why you can not go out in public.  The only exception is if you use it on parts of your body that are covered.  As other people mention, the tanner will come off even when its dry and go onto your clothes and your sheets.  It washes out easily enough though.  However, I&#x27;ve noticed that even a day or so after I&#x27;ve washed off the tanner that it will still lightly stain shirt collars and the like.  So just be cognizant of that issue.  Finally, remember to wear gloves (I use disposable latex ones) because the tanner will definitely discolor your palms!    The four stars is for the tri-pak.  I give the tanner itself 5 stars.  Hope that&#x27;s helpful.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I love the deep even color it gives me. I love the smell of the scrub and the tanner doesn&#x27;t have that overbearing sunless tanner smell. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 is because of the convenience factor. You have to put it on before bed, after you shower and ex foliate, wait for it to dry, and then put on full body sleep wear to not get it on your bedding. Then in the morning you have to shower it off. Because of this, I tend to use the gradual tanner more often. If you are willing to invest the time and energy into the procedure than this would be a great product. Sleeping in full body pajamas and socks can be a bit toasty in the summer though. Summer is usually the time when I would want to put energy into getting a nice sunless tan with this stuff.  Just get the fan out I guess and cancel all your plans for that evening.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s easy to apply, if you follow instructions, and leaves a natural tan color behind. No more orange! After showering the color guide away it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes like other self tanners will.</li>
            <li> I always loved Fake Bake, never had an issue.  Realistic color, never orange, great for pale skin, no skin cancer issues.</li>
            <li> I first tried this line back in early 2000&#x27;s.  The scrub does kinda of smell weird, but not bad.  The tanner is dark, but works.  Makes you look like you have a vacation tan.  Does not give you a fake orange.  It is something you have to do every week if you want it to stay.  The color is instant.  I use the tanner on my face instead of facial base.  Definitely, do as directions say, and put it on night before.  I don&#x27;t sometimes, but I wait a bit to get dressed.  I think you don&#x27;t so much need the scrub if you dry brush you skin/exfoliate skin often.  I think there are some nutrients in the scrub though.</li>
            <li> I am a tanning lotion virgin.  I have never seriously tried to use this stuff and was honestly pretty nervous about it.  However I am pale and have an upcoming trip to Hawaii, so I swallowed my fear and tried it out.  I LOVE THIS STUFF!  I will note that the extras may not be essential to the tanning process.  However, if you&#x27;re new to the tanning lotion process, it&#x27;s really nice to have all you need in one package.  The scrub smells great and really exfoliates, the oil spray seems to help with elbows, knees and feet.  The tanning lotion itself is FANTASTIC.  It barely smells weird and works really really well!  I look tan!  And the bronzer makes it&#x27;s fool proof as long as you take the time to really smooth it out all over your body.  I will be buying this tanning lotion from now on.  This was worth every penny to me.</li>
            <li> I only use Fake Bake tanning products because the color always looks realistic.  I never have problems with streaking or orange color.  Before using the self tanner, I use the Fake Bake Body Polish in the shower,  which is basically a scrub to get the dry skin off of my body.  I use the Body Polish on all areas of my body, concentrating on rough areas such as elbows, knees, ankles and feet.  After showering, I pat my skin dry with a towel and I put rubber gloves on, before applying the self tanner.  The self tanner goes on, and rubs into my skin easily.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a realistic looking tan without the sun damage.</li>
            <li> I have heard rave reviews about the Fake Bake product and was very excited to try it. However, when I received my kit and removed the bottles from the box I could immediately tell that the weight of the lotion bottle was obviously lighter than the body polish (they are both supposed to be 6 oz.) The lotion bottle also appeared to have been squeezed as if someone had emptied some of it.  I have a mailing scale at home and decided to weigh both bottles. The lotion bottle was missing almost 3 oz (half the product!!). When I tried to contact the company about returning it they acted like they had done nothing wrong and simply told me \\&quot;Feel free to return the product.\\&quot; When I asked them to pay the return shipping fee since it was their error they informed me that they had sent me the correct item and made no mistake. It wasn&#x27;t until I threatened to give their company a bad review that they agreed to provide me with a return label. They refunded my money....but not my original shipping cost so I still ended up being out almost $7. I didn&#x27;t ever get to use the product because I didn&#x27;t not want to pay for a halfway empty bottle. I can understand if it had been missing a little....but not half! I would not buy anything from TanforLess again!!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Creates a deep bronze, yet natural-looking tan.  Just make sure to wear gloves while applying and apply evenly.</li>
            <li> I bought this and found that applying the tanner was messy, the scrub and spray smell great. My skin does stay soft and supple all day long and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Takes a few applications to build up a tan but it smells great and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is the best self-tanner I have used so far. It does give you a nice brown (not yellow!!) color. Yes, you still have to be careful when you put it on, you can streak yourself! It has no smell like other self-tanners I have used unless you sweat! All in all, I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I have tried every self tanner I could get my hands on. I work in law enforcement and the only part of me that is ever exposed to sun is my forearms and neck, giving me the classic farmer&#x27;s tan! If you held my forearm to my legs you&#x27;d think it was 2 different people....of 2 different races! This makes wearing cute sundresses out of the question without looking ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;Like all the other reviews, I take my time in preparation (scrubbing and deep moisturizing the day before), apply at night (which takes only a few minutes once you get the hang of it), go to bed and rinse off in the shower in the morning. I&#x27;m left with a perfect even tan. You cannot tell where my natural forearm tan ends and where the fake bake tan begins!  I am naturally very pale and literally only my face and forearms tan. The rest of me would take the entire summer of outdoor and indoor tanning to achieve the look I get in just a couple of days of using Fake Bake!&lt;br /&gt;And the &#x27;stains&#x27; in clothing and sheets comes right out. Remember to keep your skin moisturized between application!  It really helps your tan&#x27;s staying power and allows the tanner absorb better into your skin. Also, keep up with exfoliating. That&#x27;s keeps everything looking even.&lt;br /&gt;I researched long and hard about tanners and used this based on reviews from several sources. I was not disappointed and will never use anything else!  Never orange and little to no smell. Oh!  Also, this tanner has an expiration date!!!!!  Use it within 6 months!  This is an absolute must!  If you notice the lotion appears to have a green tinge it has gone &#x27;bad&#x27;. Don&#x27;t panic. You don&#x27;t tan green, but won&#x27;t get the same great results. Only buy what you plan on using within 6 months, so don&#x27;t &#x27;stock up&#x27; of you find a good deal.</li>
            <li> As with most beauty products, smell has a lot to do with if i buy it or not. After reading reviews i decided to order this. It smells good, covers well, some areas go on a little darker but after a few minutes everywhere evens out.</li>
            <li> when i order it i was told it wont smell or make you feel sticky. well for me it did both. It may be a good product, Just not for me. I bought the kit so i would do it correctly and limit the chance of turning blotchy and orange. I did what the directions said to do to the T.On the plus side the exfoliate smells really good. It feels great as well. For me the fake bake original didn&#x27;t work for me. The flawless fake bake was much better and it smelled much better as well.</li>
            <li> I love love love love fake bake.  It looks real.  I don&#x27;t mind the smell, it&#x27;s not as &amp;#34;cosmetic&amp;#34; smelling as several others are.  I definitely prefer this lotion over the spray, but I guess that&#x27;s just preference!  Great product.</li>
