            <li>I will never switch to another lotion, because I found the best!</li>
            <li>Best moisturizer I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Perfect.</li>
            <li>Best lotion I ever bought!</li>
            <li>Win win!</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied!</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>I did have to pump the pump like 60 times, literally, before it started to work, but after that, it was great.</li>
            <li>Dont let the comments of smell deter you from buying a great product.</li>
            <li>good news is that this fragrance won&#x27;t bother those individuals with allergies.</li>
            <li>I absorbs well without being greasy at all, and without reapplying my hands are still good at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>Great texture- love  </li>
            <li>Love the lotion!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this lotion!  </li>
            <li>I use this product each day after showering and it has been doing a great job of keeping my skin moisturized,  not greasy or too light.  </li>
            <li>It is nice</li>
            <li>, they don&#x27;t add any kind of scent to it, but it&#x27;s botanical</li>
            <li>And really effective.</li>
            <li>Very nice, rich lotion, does not leave a greasy residue...and CRUELTY FREE!  </li>
            <li>I am very happy Amazon offers this product.</li>
            <li>Great rich lotion - and vegan, so no bad chemicals.</li>
            <li>There is very light, and quite pleasant, fragrance at first, but there is nothing objectionable about it at all.</li>
            <li>Perfect for winter, although I do have to reapply once after initial application.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>I love BWC products.</li>
            <li>They are quality products delivering excellent results completely cruelty free.</li>
            <li>I asked her to sniff the lotion to make sure</li>
            <li>okay...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell, but it goes away real quick.</li>
            <li>so I am still pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m vegan, so I also love that it is vegan-friendly.  </li>
            <li>It was okay, but I had to return it after I smelled a glue smell on my skin after applying.</li>
            <li>The pump works fine, the lotion not greasy, soaks in okay, just doesn&#x27;t give me that moisture in my skin</li>
            <li>Better consistency and truly fragrance free.</li>
            <li>It goes away very quickly, but it is there.</li>
            <li>Pleasant calming natural scent-no fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I think there is a difference between unscented and fragrance free</li>
            <li>AND, like all I buy, it must be cruelty free.  </li>
            <li>This is really a great moisturizer, I keep it by my kitchen sink &amp; use it several times a day.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to change to a Cruelty free cream without scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You could always add your own essential oils to it to make it smell nice.</li>
            <li>more than one I&#x27;ve bought has a dispenser top that doesn&#x27;t work - it just never starts putting out lotion as much as I pump.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to pretty much all smells, but this is about as good as it gets for fragrance free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s vegan, cruelty free, quickly absorbed, and very emollient, I love it!</li>
            <li>Rich silky lotion without greasiness.</li>
            <li>product itself is okay, but I just really dislike the smell of cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>The bottle was not cracked and still full</li>
            <li>It super moisturize without leaving you greasy.</li>
            <li>OxKom delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li>This product is one of the best lotions I have ever used, and I live in the high desert where it is exceedingly dry!  </li>
            <li>My favorite natural body lotion.</li>
            <li>The smell fades away pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gluten free, which is important if you have celiac disease since obviously your hands touch your food!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I&#x27;d recommend the BWC Fragrance Free lotion over this (not the Extra Rich).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty reasonably priced for how long it lasts and the excellent quality and other features.  </li>
            <li>My first purchase from this vendor.</li>
            <li>and it is so quickly absorbed that it really isn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
            <li>I first started using BWC products when I was living on Kauai</li>
            <li>When i some of the other popular name brand products i&#x27;d always have to re-apply in the afternoon.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t need the extra thickness, the regular one will go on more smoothly.</li>
            <li>Other people have mentioned that it kind of smells like play dough, but I don&#x27;t mind it too much.  </li>
            <li>What is important, is that it&#x27;s totally vegan, very moisturizing, almost instantly absorbed, and is a very generous size.</li>
            <li>This lotion has a strong scent of cocoa butter that overpowers the scent of my essential oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really like it</li>
            <li>very non-irritating.</li>
            <li>BWC Extra Rich Frag-Free lotion gets the job done and doesn&#x27;t contain petrolatum or mineral oil.</li>
            <li>I have long had a problem with dry, flaky skin in the winter, and this lotion has worked better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion I use it everyday</li>
            <li>this was a gift for my niece who has dry, itchy skin and is a true animal advocate.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve kept one that works and just put it in the new bottle of lotion.  </li>
            <li>This lotion has a smell and it is not a good one- kind of like burnt plastic?</li>
            <li>It is mild enough that I often use it on my face when I run out of my regular face</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of lotions in my day, I&#x27;m 50 years old and put lotion on all over after every shower.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have to reapply every time I wash my hands, somehow it really soaks in and actually moisturizes my skin.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s vegan, cruelty-free, natural, and organic.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s just the natural smell of the lotion.</li>
            <li>It works very well in the winter&#x27;s extra dry months.</li>
            <li>I received just a few days ago, and already the skin on my hands is very much improved.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super thick and truly does soften</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s super thick and truly does soften</li>
            <li> Very thick and rich lotion.</li>
            <li> so it would be pretty tough to make it completely unscented.</li>
            <li> , it does have a strange, think old-fashioned Elmer&#x27;s glue, scent to it.</li>
            <li> Will definitely try other products.</li>
            <li> but I use several kinds due to my hands are like sandpaper</li>
            <li> issue is that there is a slight \\&quot;chocolately\\&quot; scent in there, and that chocolate scent is actually the shea</li>
            <li> so I mixed it with a few drops of almond oil which helps the smell.</li>
            <li> I like BWC lotions - this one is a bit heavy, so I prefer the regular one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a very slight scent from the botanicals used to create it, but not enough to clash with perfume or that other people would notice it.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, I don&#x27;t even need to reapply after washing hands.</li>
            <li> how it sinks into my skin!</li>
            <li> Other reviewers mentioned a smell, I don&#x27;t seem to notice it and it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li> I had higher hopes for this lotion, it smells weird for no fragrance, it moisturizes</li>
            <li> I have to agree with other reviewers though</li>
            <li> People say this lotion has an odd smell, but even things with no smell have to smell like something.  </li>
            <li> Odd scent.. but thick.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how else to explain it.</li>
            <li> Left skin very drying and the scent is just plain horrible</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, but absorbs.</li>
            <li> This cream is thick and smells like nuts.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this lotion I use it everyday</li>
            <li> Very thick and rich lotion. Just what I was looking for. Perfect for winter, although I do have to reapply once after initial application.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. In the winter my skin always dries out - but If i use this product in the morning after a shower i dont need to use it for the rest of the day. When i some of the other popular name brand products i&#x27;d always have to re-apply in the afternoon. I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great texture- love  how it sinks into my skin!</li>
            <li> I love this cream. It super moisturize without leaving you greasy. Now it is the only body cream that I use.</li>
            <li> This lotion has a smell and it is not a good one- kind of like burnt plastic? I&#x27;m not sure how else to explain it. I like its consistency though so I mixed it with a few drops of almond oil which helps the smell.</li>
            <li> I wanted a moisturizer that I could custom scent. This lotion has a strong scent of cocoa butter that overpowers the scent of my essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is okay, but I just really dislike the smell of cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> I love BWC products. They are quality products delivering excellent results completely cruelty free. Win win!</li>
            <li> Rich silky lotion without greasiness. Pleasant calming natural scent-no fragrance.  My first purchase from this vendor. Will definitely try other products.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of lotions in my day, I&#x27;m 50 years old and put lotion on all over after every shower. People say this lotion has an odd smell, but even things with no smell have to smell like something.  I don&#x27;t find it offensive at all and it is so quickly absorbed that it really isn&#x27;t an issue. What is important, is that it&#x27;s totally vegan, very moisturizing, almost instantly absorbed, and is a very generous size. I did have to pump the pump like 60 times, literally, before it started to work, but after that, it was great. I will never switch to another lotion, because I found the best!</li>
            <li> Love the lotion! It&#x27;s thick, but absorbs. It does have a smell, but it&#x27;s a cocoa butter smell not a synthetic one.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer I have ever used.  Not greasy and the moisture last all day.  I never have to reapply.</li>
            <li> BWC Extra Rich Frag-Free lotion gets the job done and doesn&#x27;t contain petrolatum or mineral oil. It&#x27;s super thick and truly does soften hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issue is that there is a slight \\&quot;chocolately\\&quot; scent in there, and that chocolate scent is actually the shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not overpowering, but there is a scent to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that this fragrance won&#x27;t bother those individuals with allergies. A woman who is severely allergic to fragrances sits in front of me at work. I asked her to sniff the lotion to make sure the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; shea butter scent didn&#x27;t bother her. It didn&#x27;t bother her. Kudos to BWC!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;d recommend the BWC Fragrance Free lotion over this (not the Extra Rich). Better consistency and truly fragrance free.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th bottle of this lotion, as I have no need to look further.. It&#x27;s vegan, cruelty free, quickly absorbed, and very emollient, I love it!</li>
            <li> Other reviewers mentioned a smell, I don&#x27;t seem to notice it and it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I use this product each day after showering and it has been doing a great job of keeping my skin moisturized,  not greasy or too light.  I always try to purchase from companies that are vegan/against animal testing and this is now my go-to body lotion.</li>
            <li> It is nice but I use several kinds due to my hands are like sandpaper</li>
            <li> I had higher hopes for this lotion, it smells weird for no fragrance, it moisturizes okay...just not what I&#x27;m used too, im still going back to my chemically laden cetaphil hand lotion because it&#x27;s the only lotion that works for my hands. I didn&#x27;t try adding essential oils...maybe I should, I just don&#x27;t want too. The pump works fine, the lotion not greasy, soaks in okay, just doesn&#x27;t give me that moisture in my skin I&#x27;m looking for. Probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Very nice, rich lotion, does not leave a greasy residue...and CRUELTY FREE!  Perfect.</li>
            <li> My favorite natural body lotion. I first started using BWC products when I was living on Kauai and I&#x27;ve never looked back. !</li>
            <li> this was a gift for my niece who has dry, itchy skin and is a true animal advocate.  I was told that she LOVES this lotion, she would give it 10 stars if she could!</li>
            <li> This cream is thick and smells like nuts. I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell, but it goes away real quick. I&#x27;m allergic to pretty much all smells, but this is about as good as it gets for fragrance free. It works very well in the winter&#x27;s extra dry months. If you don&#x27;t need the extra thickness, the regular one will go on more smoothly.</li>
            <li> Left skin very drying and the scent is just plain horrible</li>
            <li> Item arrived in a timely manner. I have used Palmers cocoa butter for years and the smell to this lotion is very similar. Dont let the comments of smell deter you from buying a great product. The product arrived in a cushioned envelope that made the pump go up and leak lotion. The bottle was not cracked and still full so I am still pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I have long had a problem with dry, flaky skin in the winter, and this lotion has worked better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried!  I even use it on my face. I&#x27;m vegan, so I also love that it is vegan-friendly.  Other people have mentioned that it kind of smells like play dough, but I don&#x27;t mind it too much.  The smell fades away pretty quickly.  You could always add your own essential oils to it to make it smell nice.</li>
            <li> This lotion does the trick...and animals will thank you!  I would order this again.  The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me, either.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion that I have found that doesn&#x27;t leave my hands \\&quot;thirsty\\&quot; for a reapplication. I don&#x27;t even have to reapply every time I wash my hands, somehow it really soaks in and actually moisturizes my skin. It&#x27;s pretty reasonably priced for how long it lasts and the excellent quality and other features.  It&#x27;s gluten free, which is important if you have celiac disease since obviously your hands touch your food!  And it&#x27;s vegan, cruelty-free, natural, and organic. It is mild enough that I often use it on my face when I run out of my regular face lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a very slight scent from the botanicals used to create it, but not enough to clash with perfume or that other people would notice it. I think there is a difference between unscented and fragrance free, they don&#x27;t add any kind of scent to it, but it&#x27;s botanical so it would be pretty tough to make it completely unscented.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion!  I received just a few days ago, and already the skin on my hands is very much improved.  I absorbs well without being greasy at all, and without reapplying my hands are still good at the end of the day.  There is very light, and quite pleasant, fragrance at first, but there is nothing objectionable about it at all.</li>
            <li> I have hunted to look for a hand cream WITHOUT fragrance as my husband and son also use it.  AND, like all I buy, it must be cruelty free.  BWC is a company that has been out for years and can be trusted to be what it says.  I am very happy Amazon offers this product.</li>
            <li> Odd scent.. but thick.  Really like it</li>
            <li> This is really a great moisturizer, I keep it by my kitchen sink &amp; use it several times a day. I have to agree with other reviewers though, it does have a strange, think old-fashioned Elmer&#x27;s glue, scent to it. It goes away very quickly, but it is there. I think it&#x27;s just the natural smell of the lotion. It doesn&#x27;t deter me at all. I will buy this product again!</li>
            <li> This product is one of the best lotions I have ever used, and I live in the high desert where it is exceedingly dry!  OxKom delivered quickly.  I am very satisfied!</li>
            <li> It was okay, but I had to return it after I smelled a glue smell on my skin after applying.</li>
            <li> I used to use Nivea cream for my skin. I&#x27;m a man of 23 and I wanted to change to a Cruelty free cream without scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream it has a smell, it really quiet neutral for my taste so i like it. The only issue that I have is that after putting on my skin, it feels a bit sticky. I think I will get used to it</li>
            <li> I like BWC lotions - this one is a bit heavy, so I prefer the regular one.  But there is a big drawback to these lotions:  more than one I&#x27;ve bought has a dispenser top that doesn&#x27;t work - it just never starts putting out lotion as much as I pump.  So I&#x27;ve kept one that works and just put it in the new bottle of lotion.  Maybe I did something to it when I opened it, or it&#x27;s just me that has had this happen.  But I&#x27;d give this 4 or 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for the dispenser problems.  Great rich lotion - and vegan, so no bad chemicals.</li>
            <li> very non-irritating. And really effective.</li>
            <li> Best lotion I ever bought! A little goes a long way, I don&#x27;t even need to reapply after washing hands. Highly recommend this product.</li>
