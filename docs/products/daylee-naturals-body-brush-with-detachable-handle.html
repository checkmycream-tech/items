            <li>I really really really love this brush.</li>

            <li>I love this brush</li>
            <li>End results softer supple and healthier skin :)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I was hoping and reading reviews on many of these type of brushes to find a sturdy one that didn&#x27;t just fall off.&lt;br /&gt;Nope</li>
            <li>Have never tried dry brushing before, but it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>but if you don’t mind using the brush portion only, then you’re good because it’s a good brush.  </li>
            <li>well made, pleasant to use, highly recommended, it looks more durable then</li>
            <li>I brush my cat with it static free.</li>
            <li>Feels great, I feel more energy and my skin quality has improved over the last month using this brush!</li>
            <li>Love that the handle comes off, but not so easily that it slides off while using it, and the strap is somewhat useful as well.</li>
            <li>Perfect if you love a hard scrub and</li>
            <li>Feels secure in the hand and sturdy.</li>
            <li>Great back brush.  </li>
            <li>this works nicely for back feet sturdy and can use as hand brush, good first time purchase of  this product,</li>
            <li>Since the brush detaches from the handle too easily, I used super glue to affix it to the handle.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and feels wonderful on my back and feet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty in love with my Daylee Naturals brush, but I would imagine any natural bristle body brush would be just as amazing.</li>
            <li>Overall a good value for the price</li>
            <li>We love this and the price is beyond reasonable.  </li>
            <li>The handle will not stay in the brush simply because it slides into a groove and doesn&#x27;t have good fitment in it.</li>
            <li>After a wash and rinse with warm soapy water it was soft and did what it was supposed to do...</li>
            <li>Love the fact that the head is detachable and hand band is very functional for reachable areas.  </li>
            <li>, I use Super Glue or Gorilla Glue liberally to permanently glue the brush to the handle.  </li>
            <li>Great brush to use everyday.  </li>
            <li>Certainly worth the money.</li>
            <li>Great tool for circulation or the occasional back itch</li>
            <li>very easy too, only tinsy problem is that after awhile you have to comb out the bristles, like hair, but is really well made.</li>
            <li>I can feel it really exfoliate and stimulate the lymphatic system!</li>
            <li>I was weary of it after first, I didn&#x27;t realize it was detachable.  </li>
            <li>This brush is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I use this product pretty often and like it.</li>
            <li>it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth after use.</li>
            <li>pretty badly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>just moved to CO, so my skin is pretty</li>
            <li>One reviewer suggested hot glue.</li>
            <li>I rinse with a vinegar and detergent mix to clean brush, but im ready for a new one!</li>
            <li>Durable solid wood with an easily removable and replaceable handle.  </li>
            <li>The top comes off to allow for dry brushing (if you so choose).</li>
            <li>The only huge difference was the size of the loop of rope</li>
            <li>This brush works very well at exfoliating my skin.</li>
            <li>This makes exfoliating my body a very aggravating task.</li>
            <li>My handle slides in nice and tight each time!  </li>
            <li>They really clean your back well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This one may be handy for&lt;br /&gt;those who like to detach the brush part and use it as a long or short handled body brush, but I would prefer just a&lt;br /&gt;long-handled one.  </li>
            <li>Firstly, when i unpackaged it the bristles had some sort of fine dust and felt a bit stiff.</li>
            <li>We only use it for a few month, so far so good.</li>
            <li>/string on the end, the original was large enough to hang from the faucet, this is much smaller in diameter.</li>
            <li>Use it daily love dry brushing</li>
            <li>Just the right stiffness to scrub my back in the shower.</li>
            <li>It is soft and steady.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft but still get the exfoliating done.</li>
            <li>Boar Bristles is just suitable for me not too hard not too soft .</li>
            <li>Spend a little more money on a different one.</li>
            <li>I really like you can take the handle off and use the brush by hand or replace the handle and use to scrub back, etc.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleasantly surprised at the quality of this brush.</li>
            <li>When selecting a body brush I always go with Natural Bristles.  </li>
            <li>Noi problems so far.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hard to get a decent grip to scrub your back, unless you put your hand in the cloth handle on top...</li>
            <li>I take two showers a day every day for the past 6 months and its still going strong.</li>
            <li>Natural times are not so stiff that they scratch the skin, yet, they&#x27;re firm enough to make the skin very clean and refreshed feeling.  </li>

            <li> The head of it is not quite as large as I expected, so the brush is less efficient in the shower.</li>
            <li> I have owned wooden brushes like this for years and they last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> the price seems to be lasting a long time ( no bristles fall out ) ..</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an exfoliating brush with a long handle, I would look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> But if you want a sturdy long handle don&#x27;t buy this one.&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
            <li> Bristle&#x27;s are soft not overly stiff.</li>
            <li> I use it for dry brushing</li>
            <li> for one that says solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want a single, one piece handle.</li>
            <li> The stick comes out too easily, making this a tad dangerous to use.  </li>
            <li> or it&#x27;s too rough on my skin.</li>
            <li> It has finally cracked to the point that the bristles are starting come out, so I&#x27;m forced to toss it and purchase something</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the wood handle is so glossy and polished</li>
            <li> The detachable handle is a really good feature but the way it&#x27;s designed is horrible.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very stiff, so I&#x27;ve had to be careful not to brush too harshly</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> No more problem.</li>
            <li> I wish someone would have told me about this sooner...as they say &amp;#34;better late than never&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Complete piece of crap.</li>
            <li> I bought this for me, but now my kids are obsessed with this.</li>
            <li> too bad they are out.</li>
            <li> I just keep the stick separated because it’s otherwise annoying as it keeps sliding off.</li>

            <li> I really like you can take the handle off and use the brush by hand or replace the handle and use to scrub back, etc.  Bristle&#x27;s are soft not overly stiff.</li>
            <li> Great tool for circulation or the occasional back itch</li>
            <li> Feels great on your skin. I can feel it really exfoliate and stimulate the lymphatic system!</li>
            <li> Complete piece of crap. Hung it up after using it once and it broke just from hanging.</li>
            <li> My handle slides in nice and tight each time!  Got a good one.  I personally like the feel of this brush on my back.  It&#x27;s great!  5 stars all the way!</li>
            <li> keeps falling off of the handle</li>
            <li> Best back brush on the market!</li>
            <li> I was weary of it after first, I didn&#x27;t realize it was detachable.  The brush seems to stay attached to the handle nicely though. Overall a good value for the price I paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 10/23/2014 - 10 months of use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple months ago I noticed the plastic plate that holds the bristles to the wooden detachable head was starting to crack.  It has finally cracked to the point that the bristles are starting come out, so I&#x27;m forced to toss it and purchase something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still think it was a good value, but I would prefer something that lasted more than a year.</li>
            <li> Feels secure in the hand and sturdy. Bought it to replace a similar item that had worn out. The only huge difference was the size of the loop of rope/string on the end, the original was large enough to hang from the faucet, this is much smaller in diameter.</li>
            <li> Amazing. I started to use this before I shower, and I can tell the difference in my skin. Love this.</li>
            <li> Great brush to use everyday.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase. I would recommend to others. Get&#x27;s the job done.</li>
            <li> Durable solid wood with an easily removable and replaceable handle.  We love this and the price is beyond reasonable.  Natural times are not so stiff that they scratch the skin, yet, they&#x27;re firm enough to make the skin very clean and refreshed feeling.  I&#x27;ll defi be getting more of these!</li>
            <li> The stick comes out too easily, making this a tad dangerous to use.  I already came within an inch of accidentally harpooning the clam because of it.  I cannot recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Spend a little more money on a different one. The handle won&#x27;t stay on the brush at all. It falls off. I got two and they are both like that. Just get a different one.</li>
            <li> Prompt Delivery, As Advertised</li>
            <li> The head of it is not quite as large as I expected, so the brush is less efficient in the shower.</li>
            <li> I really really really love this brush. Perfect if you love a hard scrub and the detachable brush is wonderful. very easy too, only tinsy problem is that after awhile you have to comb out the bristles, like hair, but is really well made. I take two showers a day every day for the past 6 months and its still going strong. I rinse with a vinegar and detergent mix to clean brush, but im ready for a new one! too bad they are out. :/</li>
            <li> Since the brush detaches from the handle too easily, I used super glue to affix it to the handle. Otherwise, the handle falls off when I hang it up. The bristles are soft and feels wonderful on my back and feet.</li>
            <li> Love it. The top comes off to allow for dry brushing (if you so choose). I use these things until its last breath. Good price/good quality!</li>
            <li> well made, pleasant to use, highly recommended, it looks more durable then the most expensive ones I see in stores, time will show. We only use it for a few month, so far so good.</li>
            <li> Use it daily love dry brushing</li>
            <li> Great back brush.  The bristles are very stiff, so I&#x27;ve had to be careful not to brush too harshly or it&#x27;s too rough on my skin.</li>
            <li> The brush is nice and it does the job but it separates from the stick while using. If you like the idea of using the handle, don’t get this because it slides off but if you don’t mind using the brush portion only, then you’re good because it’s a good brush.  The handle cannot stay on. It slides off continually, especially if you’re using on your back or on your legs.  I just keep the stick separated because it’s otherwise annoying as it keeps sliding off. There is nothing to hold it in place when using.</li>
            <li> I am very pleasantly surprised at the quality of this brush. I use it for dry brushing and I&#x27;ve used it every day since I got it. Feels great, I feel more energy and my skin quality has improved over the last month using this brush!</li>
            <li> Have never tried dry brushing before, but it&#x27;s great! After using it for a while I can tell a big difference in the smoothness of my skin.</li>
            <li> This back brush is excellent and at a good price!  I have owned wooden brushes like this for years and they last a very long time.  They really clean your back well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not ever take the brush part off of the handle, so to keep it from coming off of the handle while scrubbing my back, I use Super Glue or Gorilla Glue liberally to permanently glue the brush to the handle.  Both are impervious to water.</li>
            <li> Xlnt brush 4 the price seems to be lasting a long time ( no bristles fall out ) ..</li>
            <li> I bought this for me, but now my kids are obsessed with this.</li>
            <li> This brush is exactly what I was looking for.  The only complaint I have is that the wood handle is so glossy and polished it&#x27;s hard to get a decent grip to scrub your back, unless you put your hand in the cloth handle on top...which defeats the purpose of the length!  Maybe some kind of rubber grip would make more sense.</li>
            <li> When selecting a body brush I always go with Natural Bristles.  They feel so good.  So when I stumbled across this model I orderd 2 -- His and Hers.  They are suprisingly supple and feel great in the shower.  I used fingernail polish to letter our initials on the back of them to tell them apart -- as His and Hers.  What a great gift item too!</li>
            <li> I use this product pretty often and like it. It is soft and steady. Noi problems so far.</li>
            <li> Seems no matter how good I put the brush on the handle, it always ends up falling off.</li>
            <li> really happy with the quality of this item</li>
            <li> This brush works very well at exfoliating my skin. The bristles are very soft but still get the exfoliating done. The detachable handle is a really good feature but the way it&#x27;s designed is horrible. The handle will not stay in the brush simply because it slides into a groove and doesn&#x27;t have good fitment in it. The handle is constantly falling off of the brush when I use it. This makes exfoliating my body a very aggravating task. I always just end up using the handheld part. If you&#x27;re looking for a good handheld exfoliating brush, this is great. If you&#x27;re looking for an exfoliating brush with a long handle, I would look elsewhere. This just doesn&#x27;t work for that purpose without constantly reattaching it to the handle.</li>
            <li> Boar Bristles is just suitable for me not too hard not too soft . i will use it tonight when i have bath</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful brush, but I wanted one with a handle that was affixed to the brush.  This one may be handy for&lt;br /&gt;those who like to detach the brush part and use it as a long or short handled body brush, but I would prefer just a&lt;br /&gt;long-handled one.  Then when I tried to hang it up, the head kept detaching from the handle.  So I turned it around&lt;br /&gt;and hang it from the brush itself.  No more problem.</li>
            <li> this works nicely for back feet sturdy and can use as hand brush, good first time purchase of  this product,</li>
            <li> I love this brush it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth after use.</li>
            <li> Certainly worth the money. Stores over-charge for these things pretty badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just moved to CO, so my skin is pretty dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I now know what it feels like to a dog when you scratch his belly and his leg shakes.</li>
            <li> I wish someone would have told me about this sooner...as they say &amp;#34;better late than never&amp;#34;.  Firstly, when i unpackaged it the bristles had some sort of fine dust and felt a bit stiff. After a wash and rinse with warm soapy water it was soft and did what it was supposed to do...ex-foliate and it was great.  Love the fact that the head is detachable and hand band is very functional for reachable areas.  End results softer supple and healthier skin :)</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this brush and once again, the brush slides off of the handle and cannot be put back...hence, I&#x27;m left with only the brush part again.  Now I&#x27;m on the hunt for a 1-piece body brush.  Cannot recommend!</li>
            <li> I brush my cat with it static free.</li>
            <li> This is made out of wood. Very nice looking but broke off in 2 days of use! Would not recommend</li>
            <li> This item will work nicely for anyone with ave or better strength &amp; flexibility. The removable handle &amp; strap are nice features. My personal preference and condition would prefer another 1/4&amp;#34; length of bristle &amp; a 3&amp;#34; longer handle w/adjustable angle.</li>
            <li> So, everyone who doesn&#x27;t should own a body brush. Seriously. I&#x27;m pretty in love with my Daylee Naturals brush, but I would imagine any natural bristle body brush would be just as amazing. Love that the handle comes off, but not so easily that it slides off while using it, and the strap is somewhat useful as well. Can&#x27;t believe I haven&#x27;t had one in my thirty years and won&#x27;t be without one ever again!</li>
            <li> This is awesome! Just the right stiffness to scrub my back in the shower. Love it.</li>
            <li> The handle and the brush do separate. I was hoping and reading reviews on many of these type of brushes to find a sturdy one that didn&#x27;t just fall off.&lt;br /&gt;Nope - this one falls off. One reviewer suggested hot glue. I tried that. It worked for a week. So, Nice concept. But if you want a sturdy long handle don&#x27;t buy this one.&lt;br /&gt;Look for one that says solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want a single, one piece handle. If you find one let me know.</li>
