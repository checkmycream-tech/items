    <ol>
            <li>This is a great buy!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really good, like a 150$ one!!!  </li>
            <li>the product is as described, I&#x27;m very happy with the job it does!  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li>I think that the item is very good</li>
            <li>My hair feels great after I straighten it and it looks shiny too.</li>
            <li>and it did a great job and never damaged my hair.</li>
            <li>i was reading the reviews and how great this product was.  </li>
            <li>Just got another one and it works great.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t think its that great.</li>
            <li>It holds fairly well, but I need to do touch ups.</li>
            <li>I bought the straightener for my daughter, and she was very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>and my hair straightened nicely.  </li>
            <li>I received this product quickly and was extremely happy with it for the time that I owned it.  </li>
            <li>It has straightened my hair better than any I&#x27;ve had before.</li>
            <li>I have tried the CHI and think ISO is better.</li>
            <li>You could get better results with a $10 straightener.</li>
            <li>This iron has gotten my hair much straighter than anything I have experienced.  </li>
            <li>Everything was great with this product until this week when the straightener would turn on, but I would have to turn the cord to get it to work and then on Friday the whole thing just stopped working.  </li>
            <li>The one I bought on this site worked awesome also, but only lasted 4 months.</li>
            <li>Its ok</li>
            <li>but I seen and used a lot better.</li>
            <li>Love the iso hair straighter.</li>
            <li>you for a wonderful flat iron&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend product</li>
            <li>The product is fine.  </li>
            <li>Never thought I would fine something to straighten my hair so well.</li>
            <li>So if your hair is fine, relaxed, chemically treated, damaged or just prone to damage, this iron is not for you BB.  </li>
            <li>like i asked but the color isn&#x27;t important here...</li>
            <li>So as for recommending it&#x27;s hit or miss, absolutely great product just doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>Thanks ISO!!!</li>
            <li>This is a great flat iron, I bought mine at the mall for $80.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s apparent you can&#x27;t get a cheap good one.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s original cost was $320.</li>
            <li>Very nice flat iron, shipped fast, and we love it.&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li>This is by far the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used!!  </li>
            <li>If you want a really good hair straightener, spring the big bucks.</li>
            <li>But not bad for $40.</li>
            <li>so im not trilled about using used hair Products, but the item itself is worth it</li>
            <li>Love these flat irons they get super hot and came packaged really neat.</li>
            <li>the seller was amazingly fast!</li>
            <li>This was exactly what was shown.</li>
            <li>I received the ISO hair straightener exactly on the date that was posted.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s your first clue in weeding out some of these wildly positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>As for me, it took me two years to get my hair in healthy condition and this flat iron almost ruined it after one use - even with heat protection.</li>
            <li>I only owned the product for six months and during that six months the straightener turned on and heated very quickly</li>
            <li>I did notice that since it did get so hot it caused more breakage and damage than my other hair straightener.  </li>
            <li>I would ONLY recommend this for very strong or virgin hair because not all hair will stand up to 450 (!) degrees.  </li>
            <li>Of course, having no heat control also means there are some rare people who will say this iron does not get hot enough them.</li>
            <li>I purchased this hair iron as a supplement to my chi, mainly to leave at my parents&#x27; house so that when I visited, I did not have to pack up my chi.     </li>
            <li>Not as good as i expected to be, considering other people thought it was.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product because of the unbelievable price of 48 dollars, it retails for more than 250 dollars on manufacturers site.</li>
            <li>I got this flat iron at a mall when it first came out in 2008</li>
            <li>Sure it&#x27;s not worth 320$ for a flat iron</li>
            <li>Both of these straighteners quit heating up completely.</li>
            <li>and it still straightens better than the cheap one in the closet. :(</li>
            <li>My hair is left shiney and soft.</li>
            <li>but i must say that it was not new, and the item descriPtion said it was new</li>
            <li>In the future I will only purchase items that come directly from the Amazon store.</li>
            <li>I was going to puchase a Sedu for $150, but decided to give this a try because I&#x27;d spend this much at the beauty store for an average iron.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m really curious as to how a very standard flat iron with NO heat control is getting 5-star reviews.  </li>
            <li> For that matter, I do not have this problem with ANY of my other hair irons bought from Wal-Mart, which are hotter and produce results that last longer.    </li>
            <li> Only problem was it only lasted a little over a year.</li>
            <li> It should just be warned that this product does not live up to its expectations.</li>
            <li> One place talked about wet to dry straightening, but I don&#x27;t think the turbo silk does that.</li>
            <li> So it was a waste of 49 dollars for a product that only worked for four weeks.</li>
            <li> The time spent fixing my hair in the morning</li>
            <li> Not only does it take me at least twice as long to straighten my wavy hair(20 minutes as opposed to 10 or less with the chi), my hair also goes back to wavy within a few hours.</li>
            <li> I have the typical Latina thick wavy hair and this iron tames it like no other!!  </li>
            <li> the other side works well though</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get it wet!</li>
            <li> Plus it has cut down the time it takes for me to do my hair.  </li>
            <li> However, I received a black straightener and NOT the purple one that I ordered.  </li>
            <li> so I guess I will settle for black.  </li>
            <li> is cut in half.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s been hard trying to find a flat iron that can tame this hair.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my littlest sister splashed water on and, I&#x27;m guessing, in one of the heated plates, and since then that one side barely gets warm/hot.</li>
            <li> :/ I have curls and I have to pass it through like 10 times for it to look silky.</li>
            <li> I also felt the instructions were confusing.</li>
            <li> I was going to by another on for her on Amazon, but I have to say I am a little bit skeptical.</li>

            <li> It has straightened my hair better than any I&#x27;ve had before. Unfortunately, my littlest sister splashed water on and, I&#x27;m guessing, in one of the heated plates, and since then that one side barely gets warm/hot. the other side works well though and it still straightens better than the cheap one in the closet. :( Don&#x27;t get it wet!</li>
            <li> The product is fine.  However, I received a black straightener and NOT the purple one that I ordered.  The seller did not return my phone calls so I guess I will settle for black.  In the future I will only purchase items that come directly from the Amazon store.</li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron, I bought mine at the mall for $80. I have tried the CHI and think ISO is better. My hair feels great after I straighten it and it looks shiny too. This is a great buy!</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair iron as a supplement to my chi, mainly to leave at my parents&#x27; house so that when I visited, I did not have to pack up my chi.     I do not know if my hair iron is just defective, but the heat output is not even 1/3 of the heat output of the chi. Not only does it take me at least twice as long to straighten my wavy hair(20 minutes as opposed to 10 or less with the chi), my hair also goes back to wavy within a few hours. I do not have this problem with the chi. For that matter, I do not have this problem with ANY of my other hair irons bought from Wal-Mart, which are hotter and produce results that last longer.    It should just be warned that this product does not live up to its expectations. I doubt that it actually sells for over $200, like it&#x27;s listed. You could get better results with a $10 straightener. If you want a really good hair straightener, spring the big bucks. It&#x27;s apparent you can&#x27;t get a cheap good one.</li>
            <li> I am African American so it&#x27;s been hard trying to find a flat iron that can tame this hair.  I was going to puchase a Sedu for $150, but decided to give this a try because I&#x27;d spend this much at the beauty store for an average iron.  This iron has gotten my hair much straighter than anything I have experienced.  Plus it has cut down the time it takes for me to do my hair.  My hair is left shiney and soft. You can also curl / spiral curl your hair. At $40 this is a steal...I&#x27;m thinking about ordering another one just in case!!!</li>
            <li> Sure it&#x27;s not worth 320$ for a flat iron but it&#x27;s really good, like a 150$ one!!!  i haven&#x27;t got the purple one like i asked but the color isn&#x27;t important here...</li>
            <li> I received this product quickly and was extremely happy with it for the time that I owned it.  I only owned the product for six months and during that six months the straightener turned on and heated very quickly and my hair straightened nicely.  I did notice that since it did get so hot it caused more breakage and damage than my other hair straightener.  Everything was great with this product until this week when the straightener would turn on, but I would have to turn the cord to get it to work and then on Friday the whole thing just stopped working.  If I pay extra money for a product I expect it to last longer than six months.  I would not recommend this product to anyone else.</li>
            <li> I bought the straightener for my daughter, and she was very satisfied with the results. But after about four weeks of using the straightener the one side stopped working. So it was a waste of 49 dollars for a product that only worked for four weeks. I was going to by another on for her on Amazon, but I have to say I am a little bit skeptical.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because of the unbelievable price of 48 dollars, it retails for more than 250 dollars on manufacturers site. I also had one of a different color and used it every day and it did a great job and never damaged my hair. Only problem was it only lasted a little over a year. The one I bought on this site worked awesome also, but only lasted 4 months. Both of these straighteners quit heating up completely. They offer a warranty, but of course this wasn&#x27;t covered. So as for recommending it&#x27;s hit or miss, absolutely great product just doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> the product is as described, I&#x27;m very happy with the job it does!  the seller was amazingly fast!</li>
            <li> i was reading the reviews and how great this product was.  I honestly don&#x27;t think its that great. Its ok but I seen and used a lot better.</li>
            <li> Love the iso hair straighter. I had been using cheaper straighteners and had to replace them often. The time spent fixing my hair in the morning is cut in half.  I gave it 4 stars because the instructions talk about the style holding for 3 days, which I don&#x27;t think it does. It holds fairly well, but I need to do touch ups. I also felt the instructions were confusing. One place talked about wet to dry straightening, but I don&#x27;t think the turbo silk does that.</li>
            <li> Very nice flat iron, shipped fast, and we love it.&lt;br /&gt;thank you for a wonderful flat iron&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend product</li>
            <li> Bought one out of town and had it for 2 years. Just got another one and it works great. Never thought I would fine something to straighten my hair so well.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed. :/ I have curls and I have to pass it through like 10 times for it to look silky. I think it just doesn&#x27;t grip the hair well. There&#x27;s no way it&#x27;s original cost was $320. Hell no.</li>
            <li> Not as good as i expected to be, considering other people thought it was. But not bad for $40.</li>
            <li> I think that the item is very good but i must say that it was not new, and the item descriPtion said it was new so im not trilled about using used hair Products, but the item itself is worth it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really curious as to how a very standard flat iron with NO heat control is getting 5-star reviews.  That&#x27;s your first clue in weeding out some of these wildly positive reviews.  This iron has two settings:  Off and holy $#*%!  So if your hair is fine, relaxed, chemically treated, damaged or just prone to damage, this iron is not for you BB.  You will not keep your hair for long using this on a regular or even semi-regular basis.  I would ONLY recommend this for very strong or virgin hair because not all hair will stand up to 450 (!) degrees.  Of course, having no heat control also means there are some rare people who will say this iron does not get hot enough them. I can&#x27;t imagine that, but it&#x27;s possible.  As for me, it took me two years to get my hair in healthy condition and this flat iron almost ruined it after one use - even with heat protection.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used!!  I got this flat iron at a mall when it first came out in 2008 and it just gave out on me.  I can&#x27;t complain.....I used it ALOT!!  I&#x27;m buying 2 more...just to have in case they ever discontinue!  I have the typical Latina thick wavy hair and this iron tames it like no other!!  Thanks ISO!!!</li>
            <li> Love these flat irons they get super hot and came packaged really neat. Only thing about these is that it doesn&#x27;t have a temp control...I&#x27;m guessing it goes to about 450 degrees.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what was shown. I received the ISO hair straightener exactly on the date that was posted. I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
