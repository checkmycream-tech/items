    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent product.  </li>
            <li>Very happy.</li>
            <li>I would not purchase this product again, and will continue on my never-ending quest to find the perfect product for my face.</li>
            <li>This product control oil great and combats acne.</li>
            <li>It keeps my shine to a minimum and works great as a primer before my powder foundation.  </li>
            <li>Great for clearing up my skin</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>if you suffer from oily skin like I do, this is a great product to have as a finishing touch.</li>
            <li>The real authentic product.</li>
            <li>She looks fantastic but without covering up her skin with foundation- excellent.</li>
            <li>The mattifier leaves a silky feel on the skin which I loved.</li>
            <li>i recommend this because its a good acne fighting product.</li>
            <li>Best is to normalize your skin with a day oil or serum, then skip the moisturizer and go right to the MediBac Clearing followed by your foundation of choice.</li>
            <li>and I love this product!</li>
            <li>This product does an amazing job of keeping that matt look on my skin longer.  </li>
            <li>She said she liked it but has since purchased another acne creme.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice, matte finish to the skin.  </li>
            <li>but they can&#x27;t even begin to address the oil my face produces, you will love this product for giving the shiny-faced among us a nice matte look.  </li>
            <li>But I still love the product for the spot treatment.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I have switched to Neutrogena shine control primer and it works wonders for keeping face from getting oily for many hours.</li>
            <li>use it sparingly and haven&#x27;t had problems with it balling up or flaking (unless I rub around on my skin, it does sit on top of the skin</li>
            <li>love this product as a makeup</li>
            <li>Dermalogica- Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this Mattifier</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I have a very oily face and love this product because it is a great way to prevent a shiny face as I go through the day.  </li>
            <li>The difficulty for me is in the winter I need to use a (non-oil) moisturizer on top because on the drier parts of my face</li>
            <li>I find using it only on my T-Zone works best, and using it before moisturizer (aka as directed) is a must.</li>
            <li>I am good until later afternoon now, which is great for me.</li>
            <li>Creates a good matte finish for the t-zone (very oily).  </li>
            <li>In other words, you have to do a bit of tweaking to figure out how this product will work best for you.  </li>
            <li>I strongly believe its from this product.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin oil free all day without drying it out.</li>
            <li>light weight on the skin.</li>
            <li>I was excited when I received the product because I looked forward to having a smooth matte finish as promised.</li>
            <li>But I have found that going with more natural remedies is more beneficial and easier on the wallet.</li>
            <li>Came right on time and works!  </li>
            <li>Makeup - Full coverage</li>
            <li>But dermalogica is decent and might work better for some skin types.</li>
            <li>Im a huge Dermalogica fan and this product was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>My face is finally looking better!</li>
            <li>Now I have moved onto a Pacifica coconut facial wipes which work amazingly well.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne and this is my favorite dermalogica product.</li>
            <li>but if you use it sparingly it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I noticed that this doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;stay on\\&quot; if I&#x27;m sweaty (right out the shower).</li>
            <li>So If that shedding stuff happens to you, make sure you put it on while your skin is super dry and clean.</li>
            <li>Good product for giving you the Matt look, but don&#x27;t use to much or it can make you look dry and chalky!</li>
            <li>It looks great under make up and this tube last for several months.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it claims to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d put a bit on my forehead and T-zone before work and stay matte the whole day!</li>
            <li>I use it on my T zone and it seems to last throughout most of the day.</li>
            <li>But its only worth it if you have strong acne problems.</li>
            <li>(I have extremely sensitive skin at, at 36 y.o., never have clean skin.</li>
            <li>primer - I feel better about wearing this on my skin rather than a traditional makeup primer because who knows how much you&#x27;re clogging your pores, etc.  </li>
            <li>Definitely ordering the full size of this now!</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re a strident moisturizer user, let the moisturizer dry 15 minutes before applying the MediBac Clearing because otherwise the two will bind together and leave you with residue particles - I&#x27;ve done that more than once, had to rinse my face and start over.  </li>
            <li>Thanks,</li>
            <li>I like it so much.</li>
            <li>It also moisturizes and works very well with the Oil Control Lotion, both were recommended to me at a spa</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin.</li>
            <li>Too good to be true - and expensive.</li>
            <li>I also use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soap which is non-irritating and now my face is pretty clear.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products just like this one - all the promises of mattifying my oily skin and helping to keep down on acne.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love it because I have mixed skin types including oily skin areas; but because it vanishes acne insanely fast without making my skin dry out like a retin-A product does.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Brand new.</li>
            <li>my daughter who has very sensitive skin will react to anything.</li>
            <li>Keeps my face feeling matte all day and helps to clear up blemishes</li>
            <li>I ordered the complete Dermalogica trial kit</li>
            <li>Improved my acne but didn&#x27;t clear it up completely.</li>
            <li>The box was completely smashed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other proucts to control my oil (without success, and thought I had finally found the answer.</li>
            <li>I get small acne breakouts in my tzone area and this item really helps to heal them fast.</li>
            <li>You can even use bare minerals (powders) over this and no cakey buildup.  </li>
            <li>It is a part of their medibac pac for acne but this size is far larger then what comes in the pack.</li>
            <li>apply it after your foundation or just apply it on bare skin.</li>
            <li>This really helps with preventing the break outs, and doesn&#x27;t weigh down your skin at all.</li>
            <li>It really smooths skin and makes pores less noticeable.</li>
            <li>so i have to be careful how much and how often i use this because it does dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the &amp;#34;Medibac Clearing Mattifier Acne Treatment&amp;#34; for a little over 1year now and i really like it.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the &amp;#34;Medibac Clearing Mattifier Acne Treatment&amp;#34; for a little over 1year now and i really like it.</li>
            <li> Found something I like just as much in Target for half the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it for over a week and a half now thinking my skin just needed to get used to a new product, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case.</li>
            <li> In a restaurant in the South with an open kitchen and poor AC (aka SO HOT).</li>
            <li> once it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> For me, I didn&#x27;t see any difference in pore size, however it kills my blemishes within 1-2 days with no flakey dry skin or redness.</li>
            <li> This keeps shine away but sooths dry skin.</li>
            <li> it looks a bit dry.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it lasts me a really long time.</li>
            <li> But if you are a veteran of Corn Silk powder (which is supposed to absorb oil but on dark skin looks like Kabuki makeup) or the little tissues which are supposed to blot oil</li>
            <li> I use this in the AM/PM and any other time for spot treatments.</li>
            <li> Happier with this than other things I&#x27;ve tried like Proactiv, Biore, Neutrogena, Clearasil, Lancome, Olay, etc products.</li>
            <li> In combination with other products it can be extremely overdrying, thus making your skin oily in order to compensate for the dryness.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money!</li>
            <li> I gave it three stars because, while it did not cut back on whiteheads or blackheads, I noticed after using for almost 2 weeks daily, that once I stopped using it, my skin looked worse, as if I were going to break out.  </li>
            <li> The other promises about black heads, reducing pores and oil control didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It works immediately to cut down on oil and matt your skin.</li>
            <li> Also, when I do have a blemish, it smooths out the skin and reduces the redness so that it&#x27;s much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s less noticeable, and reduces redness slightly.</li>
            <li> However, I still have some shine about 4-5 hours later, but nowhere near as bad as before.  </li>
            <li> I have adult acne really bad only in my T zone and nothing helped except this line.  </li>
            <li> The only product in this world that works on my difficult skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed in the way it was shipped.  </li>
            <li> Once applied after a shower, oil is back on my face in less than an hour (and my bad spots are my nose, eyelids, and along my hairline).  </li>
            <li> and I hardly ever break out; not even when I&#x27;m stressed.</li>
            <li> Product is expensive and does not love up to expectations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try it for a little while longer and update this review if anything changes, but overall I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Also, after a while, I still get a shine and feel that the shine is exponentially decreased when paired with \\&quot;oil control.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I ordered the complete Dermalogica trial kit and I love this product! It keeps my skin oil free all day without drying it out. This really helps with preventing the break outs, and doesn&#x27;t weigh down your skin at all. I can&#x27;t feel it on my skin at all once it&#x27;s dry. Definitely ordering the full size of this now!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I have adult acne and this is my favorite dermalogica product. It really smooths skin and makes pores less noticeable. Since I have been using with oil control lotion it seems to help control oil all day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it because I have mixed skin types including oily skin areas; but because it vanishes acne insanely fast without making my skin dry out like a retin-A product does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly, I didn&#x27;t use this product properly and it kept peeling off my face like as if I was shedding silicone skin. I also didnt care for the texture on my fingers and was doubting if i would like it on my face. After I went onto dermalogicas site and read up on the product, I realized I was using it improperly. They recommend putting it on the T-zone as its supposed to reduce pores, ect, etc. For me, I didn&#x27;t see any difference in pore size, however it kills my blemishes within 1-2 days with no flakey dry skin or redness. If I feel something coming on, I immediately put it in that area and it either never surfaces or minimizes the duration. Also, when I do have a blemish, it smooths out the skin and reduces the redness so that it&#x27;s much less noticeable. I don&#x27;t wear concealer or foundation, so for me, this was a bonus. However, if you do wear makeup, I think it would act like a primer does for even application. It&#x27;s not meant for an all over the face type thing. I really only use it in blemish areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: I noticed that this doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;stay on\\&quot; if I&#x27;m sweaty (right out the shower). So If that shedding stuff happens to you, make sure you put it on while your skin is super dry and clean. I use this in the AM/PM and any other time for spot treatments. Also, after a while, I still get a shine and feel that the shine is exponentially decreased when paired with \\&quot;oil control.\\&quot; Again, the strongest points for me with this product is that it gets rid of the blemishes, evens out the skin so it&#x27;s less noticeable, and reduces redness slightly. The other promises about black heads, reducing pores and oil control didn&#x27;t work. But I still love the product for the spot treatment.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it claims to. I don&#x27;t know how or why- my daughter who has very sensitive skin will react to anything. This keeps shine away but sooths dry skin. She looks fantastic but without covering up her skin with foundation- excellent.</li>
            <li> Been using for two weeks now.  Creates a good matte finish for the t-zone (very oily).  After I put it on, I let it absorb into the skin then follow up with a moisturizer.  However, I still have some shine about 4-5 hours later, but nowhere near as bad as before.  Will definitely keep in my cleansing bag.</li>
            <li> The only product in this world that works on my difficult skin.  I have adult acne really bad only in my T zone and nothing helped except this line.  My face is finally looking better!</li>
            <li> Came right on time and works!  (Well)!!!</li>
            <li> light weight on the skin. gets rid of any shine and oily feeling. Absolutely love this product. I use it daily.</li>
            <li> Product is expensive and does not love up to expectations. I have switched to Neutrogena shine control primer and it works wonders for keeping face from getting oily for many hours.</li>
            <li> I was a server. In a restaurant in the South with an open kitchen and poor AC (aka SO HOT). It was embarrassing, serving tables with an oily/sweatay face - forehead especially. I read about this on...xovain, I think? Too good to be true - and expensive. But I couldn&#x27;t work another shift with a greasy face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I splurged on this and don&#x27;t regret it. I&#x27;d put a bit on my forehead and T-zone before work and stay matte the whole day! And, it didn&#x27;t break me out (I have extremely sensitive skin at, at 36 y.o., never have clean skin. Thanks, hormones!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it sparingly and haven&#x27;t had problems with it balling up or flaking (unless I rub around on my skin, it does sit on top of the skin so there is a layer of stuff there. Just don&#x27;t touch it and you&#x27;ll be fine.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If shininess/greasy face is a problem, and like me you eschew make-up/powders, and don&#x27;t want to deal with rice paper blotting: this works.</li>
            <li> Improved my acne but didn&#x27;t clear it up completely. Used this in conjunction with the sebum mask and clearing gel. Happier with this than other things I&#x27;ve tried like Proactiv, Biore, Neutrogena, Clearasil, Lancome, Olay, etc products. But I have found that going with more natural remedies is more beneficial and easier on the wallet. Now I have moved onto a Pacifica coconut facial wipes which work amazingly well. I also use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soap which is non-irritating and now my face is pretty clear. But dermalogica is decent and might work better for some skin types. The mattifier leaves a silky feel on the skin which I loved.</li>
            <li> love this product as a makeup primer - I feel better about wearing this on my skin rather than a traditional makeup primer because who knows how much you&#x27;re clogging your pores, etc.  You can even use bare minerals (powders) over this and no cakey buildup.  if you&#x27;re a strident moisturizer user, let the moisturizer dry 15 minutes before applying the MediBac Clearing because otherwise the two will bind together and leave you with residue particles - I&#x27;ve done that more than once, had to rinse my face and start over.  Best is to normalize your skin with a day oil or serum, then skip the moisturizer and go right to the MediBac Clearing followed by your foundation of choice.</li>
            <li> I love this product, however, unfortunately it came in the mail looking like it had been through a war.  The box was completely smashed.  I&#x27;m pretty disappointed in the way it was shipped.  Dermalogica- Love this product.  I would order it from somewhere else however.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter in law.  She said she liked it but has since purchased another acne creme.</li>
            <li> This product control oil great and combats acne. But its only worth it if you have strong acne problems. Otherwise i&#x27;d suggest just an oil control wash and toner.</li>
            <li> I like it so much. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this Mattifier and I do see a difference in the oiliness of my skin. It also moisturizes and works very well with the Oil Control Lotion, both were recommended to me at a spa and I would agree!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It works immediately to cut down on oil and matt your skin. I use it on my T zone and it seems to last throughout most of the day. A little goes a long way and it lasts me a really long time. My boyfriend loves it too.</li>
            <li> I use this product in the morning before putting anything else on.  It keeps my shine to a minimum and works great as a primer before my powder foundation.  No scent--which I like.</li>
            <li> I have a very oily face and love this product because it is a great way to prevent a shiny face as I go through the day.  It gives a nice, matte finish to the skin.  Essential for me in the summer.  The difficulty for me is in the winter I need to use a (non-oil) moisturizer on top because on the drier parts of my face it looks a bit dry.  In other words, you have to do a bit of tweaking to figure out how this product will work best for you.  But if you are a veteran of Corn Silk powder (which is supposed to absorb oil but on dark skin looks like Kabuki makeup) or the little tissues which are supposed to blot oil but they can&#x27;t even begin to address the oil my face produces, you will love this product for giving the shiny-faced among us a nice matte look.  It&#x27;s expensive but if you use it sparingly it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This product can work wonders but must be used sparingly. In combination with other products it can be extremely overdrying, thus making your skin oily in order to compensate for the dryness. I find using it only on my T-Zone works best, and using it before moisturizer (aka as directed) is a must. When used sparingly on the T-Zone, it can work wonders!!</li>
            <li> Stats:&lt;br /&gt;Female&lt;br /&gt;African American&lt;br /&gt;Oily T-zone&lt;br /&gt;Mineral Makeup - Full coverage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like it. I&#x27;ve tried it for over a week and a half now thinking my skin just needed to get used to a new product, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case. In addition, I&#x27;m starting to break out. I strongly believe its from this product. It&#x27;s the only things that has changed in my skincare routine and I hardly ever break out; not even when I&#x27;m stressed. Isn&#x27;t this supposed to be clearing and mattifying? It&#x27;s not doing either one. I&#x27;ve tried other proucts to control my oil (without success, and thought I had finally found the answer. I&#x27;ll try it for a little while longer and update this review if anything changes, but overall I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Im a huge Dermalogica fan and this product was exactly what I wanted. Brand new. The real authentic product. Very happy.</li>
            <li> I get small acne breakouts in my tzone area and this item really helps to heal them fast. It looks great under make up and this tube last for several months. I would definitely recommend using this item after daily face washing to promote clarity in your skin. It is a part of their medibac pac for acne but this size is far larger then what comes in the pack.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products just like this one - all the promises of mattifying my oily skin and helping to keep down on acne.  Once applied after a shower, oil is back on my face in less than an hour (and my bad spots are my nose, eyelids, and along my hairline).  I gave it three stars because, while it did not cut back on whiteheads or blackheads, I noticed after using for almost 2 weeks daily, that once I stopped using it, my skin looked worse, as if I were going to break out.  I would not purchase this product again, and will continue on my never-ending quest to find the perfect product for my face.</li>
            <li> Great for clearing up my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the &amp;#34;Dermalogica&amp;#34; line, i  have a lot of their products. I&#x27;ve been using the &amp;#34;Medibac Clearing Mattifier Acne Treatment&amp;#34; for a little over 1year now and i really like it. i have combination/dry skin so i have to be careful how much and how often i use this because it does dry out my skin. but i feel that it does minimize the acne that i get. i recommend this because its a good acne fighting product.</li>
            <li> I used to wash my face, put on some lotion and by the time I got to work, I would already have a shine starting to develop.  This product does an amazing job of keeping that matt look on my skin longer.  I am good until later afternoon now, which is great for me.</li>
            <li> Works great. Keeps my face feeling matte all day and helps to clear up blemishes</li>
            <li> if you suffer from oily skin like I do, this is a great product to have as a finishing touch. apply it after your foundation or just apply it on bare skin. it soaks the oil up and leaves a smooth silky skin behind.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin. I was excited when I received the product because I looked forward to having a smooth matte finish as promised. Instead I am still stuck with greasy, shiny, oily skin. I find myself blotting within 20 min of  using it. Total waste of money!</li>
            <li> Good product for giving you the Matt look, but don&#x27;t use to much or it can make you look dry and chalky! Price needs to be cheaper though. Found something I like just as much in Target for half the price!</li>
