            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>, I work 12 hours and it stays on and is even a good primer of sorts for my foundation when i put it over top</li>
            <li>Very happy with the quality but quantity not so much.</li>
            <li>Great value, fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not powder and it is very easy to work with.</li>
            <li>I love this, I mostly use it to contour, it&#x27;s really easy to blend !!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>will monitor my selectin better next time, saving is not always the best.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>This is my second time ordering and receiving this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>Love the coverage..</li>
            <li>and the coverage wasn&#x27;t great, but it didn&#x27;t cost much</li>
            <li>I am sure.</li>
            <li>Now I think after using this palette I will be more drawn to creamy concealers like this.</li>
            <li>Glad I tried it</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li>Definitely not professional (I wouldn&#x27;t even say GOOD) quality concealer!</li>
            <li>I should have opted for the Coastal Scents version instead of being so cheap.</li>
            <li>It was amazing to have it in my hands so early and all in one piece!</li>
            <li>I just think they should have added one more corrector (peach) instead of the really light(pale) color pan.  </li>
            <li>Only 2 of them are good.</li>
            <li>Pretty quick, easy, clean process.</li>
            <li>Good coverage, long lasting, I was sure how well this would work since its not like a huge company</li>
            <li>This camouflage palette is amazing, you can blend the different concealer to match your skintone and the colors that correct imperfections work well.</li>
            <li>It came in perfect condition nothing was melted or broken.</li>
            <li>the blemishes looks prominent and it worsens the natural face.</li>
            <li>but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>This is a fun palette to play around with if you&#x27;re a beginner in makeup (like me).</li>
            <li>I use the darkest shade for contouring if I want that but rarely do.</li>
            <li>well worth the cost of some higher end products</li>
            <li>They are a but small but they work great.</li>
            <li>and it was cheap, but I was pleasantly surprised</li>
            <li>The first column has shiny</li>
            <li>Love it a lot of different colors.</li>
            <li>The colors are ok, some of the lighter colors turn white.</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I payed for.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>The consistency is so very creamy...goes on like BUTTA!</li>
            <li>I highly doubt it will look nice for long.</li>
            <li>small amounts good trial size</li>
            <li>A little cakey, so be sure to blend well!</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned and all but one of the actual skin tone colors are far too dark.</li>
            <li>Very brightening.</li>
            <li>The picture makes the whole palette look lighter</li>
            <li>I cant really complain, learned lesson on where i am ordering from.</li>
            <li>so I assumed as much.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s what you get for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li>it was cheap but it took too long to get it.</li>
            <li>It is so cheap too, obviously it&#x27;s not a professional palette</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It came brand new in its package.</li>
            <li>True to description and very affordable, would recommend to anyone with problems with blemishes , dark circles or any imperfections .</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look bad with a good finishing powder over top, but overall it looks a tad cakey:</li>
            <li>/sparkly clear color-</li>
            <li>It comes out clear</li>
            <li>There is also a shade that I think is just clear with sparkles.</li>
            <li>but personally I like the way it looks in person much easier to work with my skin-</li>
            <li>I think I would have enjoyed mixing and using other deeper shades because I can only use three since I am a brown skinned African American.</li>
            <li>This concealer has about as much coverage as loose powder.</li>
            <li>This stuff isn&#x27;t too bad, but it&#x27;s not too great either.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The only draw back is that the colors have a sort of film over them and at first its hard to &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; them enough to even get color on the brush ...</li>
            <li> The shipping takes long.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> My only complaints are that there&#x27;s not a whole lot of product in each pan</li>
            <li> The green is very MINT GREEN, and the pink is very pink.</li>
            <li> I like the green and yellow, even though they look NEON in the pots.</li>
            <li> which is pale with yellow undertones.</li>
            <li> i thought this consealer would cover my dark spots and give a powder finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was literally the consistency of those cheap hard lip glosses and it was impossible to get any coverage at all</li>
            <li> My other pallet arrived melted! !</li>
            <li> What a waste!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;d use that for.</li>
            <li> used it to cover bruises and a small tattoo for a wedding.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a bit waxy, making it hard to get out of the pots.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin and streaky.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so thin</li>
            <li> The rest are too thin and just aren&#x27;t the quality I need them to be.</li>
            <li> Hate it don&#x27;t waste you&#x27;re money.</li>
            <li> Very sad..</li>
            <li> It will arrive melted and unusable.   :(  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This palette has over 15 different colors and about 3 of the work for my skin. I love this product. It is so easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li> Good coverage, long lasting, I was sure how well this would work since its not like a huge company and it was cheap, but I was pleasantly surprised, I work 12 hours and it stays on and is even a good primer of sorts for my foundation when i put it over top</li>
            <li> This concealer has about as much coverage as loose powder. It&#x27;s thin and streaky. Definitely not professional (I wouldn&#x27;t even say GOOD) quality concealer! What a waste!</li>
            <li> Very brightening. The first column has shiny/sparkly clear color- I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;d use that for. The green is very MINT GREEN, and the pink is very pink. The picture makes the whole palette look lighter but personally I like the way it looks in person much easier to work with my skin- which is pale with yellow undertones. I bought this for practicing contouring so if that&#x27;s your reason for wanting this palette I definitely recommend this to you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product on the June 13. It arrived today June 25. It came in perfect condition nothing was melted or broken. The concealers are creamy. It&#x27;s not powder and it is very easy to work with.</li>
            <li> I recieved item with no damage but was a bit of await. I cant really complain, learned lesson on where i am ordering from. will monitor my selectin better next time, saving is not always the best.</li>
            <li> My estimated time of arrival was between the 26th of September and October 11th however it came in on the 20th of September!!!! It was amazing to have it in my hands so early and all in one piece! I have to say for something to be so inexpensive yet well worth the cost of some higher end products It makes me so happy to know I got an amazing deal! I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Hate it don&#x27;t waste you&#x27;re money. It comes out clear it&#x27;s so thin I don&#x27;t see how they can even pass this off as a concealer!</li>
            <li> Love these! This is my second time buying them! As a make up artist it is easier to have a pallet than lots of tubes. Also it allows me to mix to create that perfect shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also used it to cover bruises and a small tattoo for a wedding.</li>
            <li> The shipping takes long. They are a but small but they work great.</li>
            <li> My Concealer paler was great. I love it i use i alot &amp; it works really good. It came brand new in its package.</li>
            <li> Love it a lot of different colors. Can use for contouring</li>
            <li> True to description and very affordable, would recommend to anyone with problems with blemishes , dark circles or any imperfections .</li>
            <li> My other pallet arrived melted! ! Very disappointed.  DO NOT ORDER THIS IN THE SUMMER MONTHS- It will arrive melted and unusable.   :(  Very sad..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too creamy, and sticky! it was cheap but it took too long to get it. It&#x27;s too oily. I don&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering and receiving this wonderful product. It lasts for months. Pretty quick, easy, clean process. I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> This product  is great! The colors are ok, some of the lighter colors turn white. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Love the coverage.. a great set for a beginner make up artist kit. I would recommend it to everyone. awesome!!</li>
            <li> i saw this product in amazon and by looks it impress me. i thought this consealer would cover my dark spots and give a powder finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but it s so creamy after applying this the blemishes looks prominent and it worsens the natural face.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected and the coverage wasn&#x27;t great, but it didn&#x27;t cost much so I assumed as much.</li>
            <li> This stuff isn&#x27;t too bad, but it&#x27;s not too great either. I like the green and yellow, even though they look NEON in the pots. This stuff is a bit waxy, making it hard to get out of the pots. when you have it on a brush or sponge, they just look white. I am very fair skinned and all but one of the actual skin tone colors are far too dark. There is also a shade that I think is just clear with sparkles. I don&#x27;t understand that. It doesn&#x27;t look bad with a good finishing powder over top, but overall it looks a tad cakey: I highly doubt it will look nice for long. I should have opted for the Coastal Scents version instead of being so cheap. I got exactly what I payed for.</li>

I bought 3 and they will be put to good use I am sure.</li>
            <li> I tried to use this on myself before I used it on my brides. Only 2 of them are good. The rest are too thin and just aren&#x27;t the quality I need them to be. But that&#x27;s what you get for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li> Very good for the price</li>
            <li> Great product and the pigmentation is awesome!</li>
            <li> Good price , great colors</li>
            <li> This camouflage palette is amazing, you can blend the different concealer to match your skintone and the colors that correct imperfections work well. Great value, fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li> I love this, I mostly use it to contour, it&#x27;s really easy to blend !! It is so cheap too, obviously it&#x27;s not a professional palette but it gets the job done</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING! I purchased mine through a seller from China so it took a while to get here but it was worth the wait. This is a fun palette to play around with if you&#x27;re a beginner in makeup (like me). The consistency is so very creamy...goes on like BUTTA! My only complaints are that there&#x27;s not a whole lot of product in each pan and I wish there was a palette like that was meant for lighter to medium shades only and medium to deeper shades only. I think I would have enjoyed mixing and using other deeper shades because I can only use three since I am a brown skinned African American. I use the second to darkest shade to conceal as my &amp;#34;match up&amp;#34; color (I can wear either NC50 or NW45 in MAC Studio Fix Fluid for reference). I use the darkest shade for contouring if I want that but rarely do. Now I think after using this palette I will be more drawn to creamy concealers like this. Glad I tried it and I recommend it. Very happy with the quality but quantity not so much.</li>
