            <li> Just make sure you use a small amount as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is very heavy, very greasy, even on my dry highlighted hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t absorb into the hair, just sits on top of it, making it look dirty.</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit of the oil to massage into your hair and immediately your hair is restored.</li>

            <li> It works miracles on my normally dry, curly, frizzy &amp; damaged hair!!!</li>
            <li> It is not greasy, just be careful not to use too much, Half a dropper works on my shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> not worth the $&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I just mix a few drops in my hair mask.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box something seamed awkward.</li>

I have used wen and only wen for the past 6 years. When I opened the box something seamed awkward. Is it  a knock off the bottle the dropper the label and product is different to me. I will only buy from chazdean or qvc website from now on. I thought it was almond mint not peppermint.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE WEN!!!!!  Is use the Oil every day!</li>
            <li> I love all the products from WEN but this one is great. Turns my dry damaged hair to smooth and soft.</li>

You only need a little bit of the oil to massage into your hair and immediately your hair is restored. Also a great go to before blow drying or flat ironing your hair.  Worth the investment.

            <li> Fast service at an excellent price! I look forward to doing business with this supplier in the future! I absolutely love this product...it&#x27;s one of my favorite of the WEN Product Line!!! It works miracles on my normally dry, curly, frizzy &amp; damaged hair!!! Love love love!</li>
            <li> Everything that Wen makes is great. The oil is especially good for flyaways.  Just make sure you use a small amount as a little goes a long way. I have not used it for an all over treatment but look forward to that. Just remember that it is an oil so make sure to use warm soapy water to remove it. It&#x27;s also great for your nail cuticles.</li>
            <li> Peppermint oil on body for energy or hair for shine; works well with my WEN products; love this stuff; a great price.. ty</li>
            <li> After watching Chaz on QVC I decided to buy the oil. He explain that it is essential for your skin and hair. Using models he shows you how to use it. I did used it last night, before I went to bed I applied the oil to my hair, and this morning I washed my hair using the cleanser. As the cleansed I notice my hair was more silky and manageable. I&#x27;m  going to use it 3 times a week like Chaz recommended and then I&#x27;ll write more so I can tell you how the oil treatment is working.</li>
            <li> Having used several of Wen&#x27;s oils, I was ecstatic to find this one at a great price. However, after receiving the oil and using it, I don&#x27;t find it to be the same as the Sweet Almond Mint oil I received directly from the Chaz Dean website or in QVC packages. I LOVE Wen. The true Wen products are amazing. I question whether this bottle is actually a Wen oil and not a knock off claiming to be Wen.</li>
            <li> I put this on my scalp in four sections the night before I plan on cleansing my hair. My scalp feels very clean and no worries about flaking. Easy to use and smells great.</li>
            <li> I order this oil off of amazon because I couldn&#x27;t believe the price.  When I received this oil I was so excited because I always buy wen oil from QVC for $55 dollars for a 4oz bottle, well when I opened this I soon realized this oil is the the real thing.it was weak compared to the real oil like water or something had been added to it.  I love amazon, but this product I will continue to buy from QVC.</li>
            <li> I love WEN.  The oil was new to me.  I feel like it has done wonders for my hair.  I feel like my hair is growing faster and the ends did not need to be trimmed at my last hair cut.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo and hair treatment oil but the reason i gives one star is becoz they send me 1oz bottle. I ordered 2oz bottle.</li>
            <li> Acts like every other type of oil product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I love all of this product line thanks</li>
