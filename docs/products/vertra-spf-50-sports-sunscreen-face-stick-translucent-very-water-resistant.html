            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>But when surfing in Cali, its always a battle against the crowds when your paddling for the best waves anyways!</li>
            <li>Great stuff.  </li>
            <li>Provides great coverage, blends like make up, stays on all day</li>
            <li>Great sun protection.</li>
            <li>My grandson in water polo needed a great face sunscreen and this was recomended and it worked great ,I will reorder</li>
            <li>It must be great.  </li>
            <li>Works great for me.</li>
            <li>Great sunblock.  </li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>reason I don&#x27;t give 5-Stars is that it does not seem to have great protection or staying power when in/out of the water.</li>
            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>so then my face looks nice and even tan color!</li>
            <li>It washes off easily with soap and water when you are done- and doesn&#x27;t wash off until you are!</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Will be ordering more.  </li>
            <li>general use in strong sun, it&#x27;s excellent.  </li>
            <li>This makes it easy to determine if you need to reapply though.</li>
            <li>best sunscreen..doesn&#x27;t get oily, stays on pretty long and does a pretty good job of blocking sun</li>
            <li>I was deceived by the term &amp;#34;translucent&amp;#34; and feel that Vertra is being deceptive and taking huge leaps and liberties by using that term for this product.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and evenly.  </li>
            <li>But, what I love about this sunscreen is that as advertised, it is VERY waterproof!</li>
            <li>Most amazing facial sunscreen EVER!</li>
            <li>It really works fine!</li>
            <li>A good physical sunblock that doesn&#x27;t sting or burn your eyes.  </li>
            <li>Super protection.</li>
            <li>The container fits in the purse just fine does not take up too much room.</li>
            <li>This stuff really holds up!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely getting more, and I won&#x27;t go boogy-boarding without it now.</li>
            <li>It works very well!</li>
            <li>I love that its a small container and easy to carry along.</li>
            <li>Perfet for surftrips with large amount of time in the water...like Indo, Maldives, etc...</li>
            <li>(stays on almost too well, you really have to wash it off your face at night).  </li>
            <li>Stays on very well when NOT in the water.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>I recommend you avoid this &amp;#34;translucent&amp;#34; one, because it is really just white.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We have used full, physical blocks before that don&#x27;t require re-application as much as this one does.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>Classic zombie look</li>
            <li>We live in Hawaii and time in the sun</li>
            <li>that is is a physical sunscreen without chemical ingredients (better for health), but I would buy a different Vertra product that has a tint in the future.  </li>
            <li>If you are active in the water and want full coverage..this is the item for you.  </li>
            <li>Pros : completely blocks sun, does not come off in the ocean even after a three hour surf session,  very easy to apply and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>I wanted something that could stand up to constant wave-and-face-wiping action and intense UV.</li>
            <li>; this goes on very white and it is greasy so if you are prone to breakouts I would test it before you cover your whole face in it.</li>
            <li>; this goes on very white and it is greasy so if you are prone to breakouts I would test it before you cover your whole face</li>
            <li>This stuff fixed that.</li>
            <li>It goes on white and stays pretty white even when rubbed in.</li>
            <li>It definitely does not go on clear-</li>
            <li>On caucasian medium skin tone, this stick goes on extremely white, and stays pretty white even after you take a long time rubbing it in.  </li>
            <li>Really tiny size and kind of expensive</li>
            <li>Most of the other commercial sunscreens fail to live up to their waterproof claims when it comes to us</li>

            <li> Best stuff for your face. I work out in the sun everyday and keep this close by</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  I use it instead of make up in the summer.  Provides great coverage, blends like make up, stays on all day (stays on almost too well, you really have to wash it off your face at night).  Great sun protection.</li>
            <li> Really tiny size and kind of expensive but it works well</li>
            <li> My grandson in water polo needed a great face sunscreen and this was recomended and it worked great ,I will reorder</li>
            <li> If you are active in the water and want full coverage..this is the item for you.  But I warn you, it&#x27;s not totally invisible.  Can leave your face a little white..but, it&#x27;s an awesome product.  Protects me from black spots. I love that its a small container and easy to carry along.</li>
            <li> Pricy, but it does stay on and block the rays thru a long (4-hour) surf session.  Classic zombie look, so you know it&#x27;s still there.</li>
            <li> best sunscreen..doesn&#x27;t get oily, stays on pretty long and does a pretty good job of blocking sun</li>
            <li> Pros : completely blocks sun, does not come off in the ocean even after a three hour surf session,  very easy to apply and a little goes a long way so it actually last for quite a few applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons; this goes on very white and it is greasy so if you are prone to breakouts I would test it before you cover your whole face in it. I put  and a little goes a long way so it actually last for quite a few applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons; this goes on very white and it is greasy so if you are prone to breakouts I would test it before you cover your whole face and it the 50 translucent stick on then I layer it with the 38spf &amp;#34; Shane Dorian&amp;#34; color Vertra stick so then my face looks nice and even tan color!</li>
            <li> Perfet for surftrips with large amount of time in the water...like Indo, Maldives, etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I basically apply in the morning and at the end of the day - despite of recommendations of re-applying time - I still have it in my face!</li>
            <li> This product works well.  A good physical sunblock that doesn&#x27;t sting or burn your eyes.  But, it&#x27;s $22.  We have used Waterman&#x27;s Face Stick in the past and  you get the same performance for $15.</li>
            <li> Works great! Looks like war paint when applied. But when surfing in Cali, its always a battle against the crowds when your paddling for the best waves anyways!</li>
            <li> Most amazing facial sunscreen EVER!</li>
            <li> Got this for my son.  He asked for it specifically.  It must be great.  We live in Hawaii and time in the sun is our lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Be like Mick. I agree with the previous reviewer that this sunscreen is NOT translucent. It come on white, and stays on white. But, what I love about this sunscreen is that as advertised, it is VERY waterproof! Even through three-hour surf sessions, the sunscreen manages to stay on my face. Most of the other commercial sunscreens fail to live up to their waterproof claims when it comes to us watermen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as long as it&#x27;s protecting my face from harmful UVA/UVB rays, I could care less that my face is as white as a ghost. Zero sunburns or suntans while I&#x27;ve had it applied. Works great for me.</li>
            <li> Although this product is expensive considering how the size of it, it works well. It provides protection and stays on. It is not translucent as state. It goes on white and stays pretty white even when rubbed in. This makes it easy to determine if you need to reapply though.</li>
            <li> Great sunblock.  I used it on the back of my hands to avoid getting those ugly age spots.  Works great.  Love it.  Will be ordering more.  The container fits in the purse just fine does not take up too much room.</li>
            <li> If you want serious face protection, this is it. It definitely does not go on clear- but I bought this to protect me from skin cancer, so I don&#x27;t care. I wanted something that could stand up to constant wave-and-face-wiping action and intense UV. This stuff really holds up! After an hour in big waves and searing southern California sun, I went to re-apply. It was still on. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. My nose and under my eyes would always seem to get burned with regular, go-on-clear, sunscreen. This stuff fixed that. It washes off easily with soap and water when you are done- and doesn&#x27;t wash off until you are! Super protection. I&#x27;m definitely getting more, and I won&#x27;t go boogy-boarding without it now.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and evenly.  Stays on very well when NOT in the water.&lt;br /&gt;Only reason I don&#x27;t give 5-Stars is that it does not seem to have great protection or staying power when in/out of the water. We have used full, physical blocks before that don&#x27;t require re-application as much as this one does.&lt;br /&gt;For general use in strong sun, it&#x27;s excellent.  Let&#x27;s see how long it lasts, though - pricey for a small amount.</li>
            <li> It really works fine! No more sunburns!</li>
            <li> I was deceived by the term &amp;#34;translucent&amp;#34; and feel that Vertra is being deceptive and taking huge leaps and liberties by using that term for this product. On caucasian medium skin tone, this stick goes on extremely white, and stays pretty white even after you take a long time rubbing it in.  I like that is is a physical sunscreen without chemical ingredients (better for health), but I would buy a different Vertra product that has a tint in the future.  I recommend you avoid this &amp;#34;translucent&amp;#34; one, because it is really just white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I do understand the difference between &amp;#34;translucent&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;transparent&amp;#34;, and I think it is unethical for Vertra to describe this product as &amp;#34;translucent&amp;#34;.  Even after rubbing it in, your face stays very white.)</li>
            <li> Returning it. it doesn&#x27;t protect against UVA1 rays, only UVA2.</li>
            <li> great product. my son works as a surf instructor, and is at the beach seven days a week. It works very well!</li>
