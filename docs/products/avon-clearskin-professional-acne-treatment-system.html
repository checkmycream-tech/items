            <li>As time goes on, I will update the review if I feel that the product isn&#x27;t working for the long-term, but for now, I have really enjoyed it and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>My mother language is not English, but I will try to do my best documenting my review.</li>
            <li>This is what does the magic.</li>
            <li>I still was getting breakouts, more controlled though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the wash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad this product seems to work for others, but I will have to keep looking.</li>
            <li>To boot, it&#x27;s way cheaper than most products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t doubt that it works for the majority of people, but if you have tried so many products that worked for everyone else, but not for you this is one of those times you&#x27;ll be part of the minority group it didn&#x27;t work for.</li>
            <li>I like to use it on my nose twice a week because that&#x27;s where most of my blackheads are.</li>
            <li>Im in love with this stuff</li>
            <li>Another thing I love about this product is that it&#x27;s shrunken my pores.</li>
            <li>keeps most of the pimples at bay.  </li>
            <li>I started using omething better</li>
            <li>I love the toner pads but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>This product is great, I just think it may not be for my skin in particular.</li>
            <li>However, this product is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I have dealt with acne now for over 10 years and this is the best product I have found in  a very long time.</li>
            <li>I love the cleanser because it makes your skin nice and tingly, and everything smells really fresh.  </li>
            <li>It leaves the skin with a nice fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>: cleanser is very mild.</li>
            <li>and specifically when I am under a lot of stress, but this is the only system that works best for my without over drying my skin and giving it a fresh sensation.nder a lot of stress, but this is the only system that works best for my without over drying my skin and giving it a fresh sensation.</li>
            <li>cleanser is really and exfoliator, very refreshing.</li>
            <li>I use hot, hot water and this stuff, and those blackheads aren&#x27;t sure what hit them! :)</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li>It really cleared her face up nicely.  </li>
            <li>Most of my breakouts occur right before my monthly period.</li>
            <li>After trying many, many different acne systems, I was still experiencing breakouts more often than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>My face felts so clean and I seen a difference it</li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s an exfoliator results in a really clean skin.</li>
            <li>Avon Clearskin products keeps my face nice and clear.</li>
            <li>This definitely makes your skin feel good and cool as you wash it, and it feels refreshed after washing, but it did nothing for my acne.</li>
            <li>but they go quickly.</li>
            <li>I have ZERO zits right now and that hasn&#x27;t been true for months.</li>
            <li>If I didn&#x27;t use a good moisturizer in the morning before going to work, my skin would be really dry and itchy.</li>
            <li>The products are nice and do not dry out your skin however it did not help with my breakouts.</li>
            <li>I decided to get away from cheap store brand products and try Avon after reading positive reviews on Amazon and Google.</li>
            <li>(and to be honest, I haven&#x27;t even been very religious about using it.  </li>
            <li>I think this was worth the try</li>
            <li>, FEELS WARM, GRITTY- THINK IT&#x27;S WORKING.&lt;br /&gt;USING</li>
            <li>I had some success with the step three</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who, like me, has struggled to find something to treat adult acne effectively.  </li>
            <li>All else I have used sucked the moisture right out of my skin.</li>
            <li>When I bought this product I didn&#x27;t see results right away</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t over dry, smells pretty good, and has absolutely cleared my skin.  </li>
            <li>Not harsh and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Anyone who is thinking about getting it really needs to just buy it!</li>
            <li>When you first start using the treatment it does bring blemishes to the surface</li>
            <li>I just used for spots treatment and most of the time, they were reduced by 50% the next morning.</li>
            <li>I will say within the first 3-4 days I did see the promised improvement in my complexion.  </li>
            <li>This system works very well!  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never used a skin clearing product that didn&#x27;t dry you up, Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this....very good for mature acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I have had moderate acne for most of my life, and this product really helps.</li>
            <li>As a 31 year old with mild acne on chin and forehead, having tried several other systems, I was excited to see this set with so many good reviews at such a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>but I think thats because I had SOOOOO much acne when I first began.</li>
            <li>Okay , so I had this product back in my high school days because my mom ordered from Avon.</li>
            <li>I guess the new break-outs clear up more quickly than if I just left them alone, but I had higher hopes for this product set.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 13 yr old daughter, who has mild acne which comes with here age.</li>
            <li>I really suggest this treatment system.</li>
            <li>Anytime any sort of acne appears on my face , this has handled it very well.</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin</li>
            <li>and this seems to have really taken the redness out and controlls her complection very well.</li>
            <li>but the drying effects were too much for me.</li>
            <li>This Avon &#x27;Pro Acne&#x27; kit really DID seem to work.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li>It brought all the blemishes under my skin to the surface and healed them to reveal the soft, silky smooth and CLEAR skin thats been hiding all along.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen using it for a week and my skin is super soft and clear.</li>
            <li>The pads are handy for when I feel a big breakout coming, but they really dry you out.</li>
            <li>This set not only gave me clear skin, it also made my skin soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>So far I use only dime-size amounts of the step 1 and the step 3, so I think those will last me about a month if not a little more.   </li>
            <li>I noticed that my occasional breakout really never showed up after using this system, and I did notice right away that my skin was smoother and softer, and felt really clean.</li>
            <li>I find that every time I have a new pimple, I cleanse my skin, extract it and use both the pads and the cream</li>
            <li>I have been using the Avon Clearskin Professional for about 11 days now and could not be happier!</li>
            <li>I usually do not write reviews, but I had to for this one.</li>
            <li>For a long time in my life I thought that it was gone for good, but then starting at 28 years old, it struck back again like in my teen years.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cure it completely, but it is the only acne product that I have used that consistently eliminates whiteheads and minimizes acne buildup.</li>
            <li>Gives me very clear, soft skin.</li>
            <li>I continued using it hoping it would clear my face, but it didnt.</li>
            <li>Kept my 50 year old skin clear without drying.</li>
            <li>THE RESULTS I HAVE SEEN SO FAR</li>
            <li>However, when my mom ordered this for me to try, it completely changed my view on acne products.  </li>
            <li>My face hasn&#x27;t been this clear in nearly a decade.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to use a 3 step Loreal &#x27;Adult Acne&#x27; kit</li>
            <li>Skin is not dry at all and skin feels very soft and clear!</li>
            <li>I am almost 40 years old and this product has finally given me clear, smooth skin with no drying out like other products.</li>
            <li>I started using step 2 for the first week twice daily, but reduced it to only once a day as there are only about 40 pads in the container--not enough for a whole month.  </li>
            <li>However, it has not prevented new break-outs, and after 2 weeks of use, my face looks the same as when I started.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive combination acne-prone skin and these products are harsh and pretty drying for my liking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried So many different over the counter products (practically everything out there from home remedies to expensive high end products), but always went back to Proactiv, as it at least made my skin better, but never totally clear.  </li>
            <li>For the first couple of days I had a little bit of stinging</li>
            <li>But if you have sensitive skin do not use it twice a day because it will over dry.</li>
            <li>You need to make sure to use it at least every other day!</li>
            <li>and I have seen a  huge difference compared to other products I have used in the past.</li>

            <li> Bought this for my 13 yr old daughter, who has mild acne which comes with here age.</li>
            <li> I really suggest this treatment system.</li>
            <li> Anytime any sort of acne appears on my face , this has handled it very well.</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin</li>
            <li> and this seems to have really taken the redness out and controlls her complection very well.</li>
            <li> but the drying effects were too much for me.</li>
            <li> This Avon &#x27;Pro Acne&#x27; kit really DID seem to work.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li> It brought all the blemishes under my skin to the surface and healed them to reveal the soft, silky smooth and CLEAR skin thats been hiding all along.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen using it for a week and my skin is super soft and clear.</li>
            <li> The pads are handy for when I feel a big breakout coming, but they really dry you out.</li>
            <li> This set not only gave me clear skin, it also made my skin soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> So far I use only dime-size amounts of the step 1 and the step 3, so I think those will last me about a month if not a little more.   </li>
            <li> I noticed that my occasional breakout really never showed up after using this system, and I did notice right away that my skin was smoother and softer, and felt really clean.</li>
            <li> I find that every time I have a new pimple, I cleanse my skin, extract it and use both the pads and the cream</li>
            <li> I have been using the Avon Clearskin Professional for about 11 days now and could not be happier!</li>
            <li> I usually do not write reviews, but I had to for this one.</li>
            <li> For a long time in my life I thought that it was gone for good, but then starting at 28 years old, it struck back again like in my teen years.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cure it completely, but it is the only acne product that I have used that consistently eliminates whiteheads and minimizes acne buildup.</li>
            <li> Gives me very clear, soft skin.</li>
            <li> I continued using it hoping it would clear my face, but it didnt.</li>
            <li> Kept my 50 year old skin clear without drying.</li>
            <li> THE RESULTS I HAVE SEEN SO FAR</li>
            <li> However, when my mom ordered this for me to try, it completely changed my view on acne products.  </li>
            <li> My face hasn&#x27;t been this clear in nearly a decade.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to use a 3 step Loreal &#x27;Adult Acne&#x27; kit</li>
            <li> Skin is not dry at all and skin feels very soft and clear!</li>
            <li> I am almost 40 years old and this product has finally given me clear, smooth skin with no drying out like other products.</li>
            <li> I started using step 2 for the first week twice daily, but reduced it to only once a day as there are only about 40 pads in the container--not enough for a whole month.  </li>
            <li> However, it has not prevented new break-outs, and after 2 weeks of use, my face looks the same as when I started.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive combination acne-prone skin and these products are harsh and pretty drying for my liking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried So many different over the counter products (practically everything out there from home remedies to expensive high end products), but always went back to Proactiv, as it at least made my skin better, but never totally clear.  </li>
            <li> For the first couple of days I had a little bit of stinging</li>
            <li> But if you have sensitive skin do not use it twice a day because it will over dry.</li>
            <li> You need to make sure to use it at least every other day!</li>
            <li> and I have seen a  huge difference compared to other products I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Then, the third step is the cream treatment which prevents the dry spots.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I would have is the lotion makes my skin very oily however I&#x27;ve always had a problem with that.</li>
            <li> I only say that because the toner (the pads) dry me out, and the &#x27;lotion&#x27; for the acne tends to be a bit too moisturized.</li>
            <li> Within only a few days the acne began to clear up and redness was gone.</li>
            <li> When I was in my teens, I had a few acne problems off and on, but it was really not too much of a problem.</li>
            <li> In my 20s I had a few problems now and again, but now in my 30s, especially since my second child, the acne has been a constant problem.</li>
            <li> HOW LONG HAVE I HAD PRODUCT:</li>
            <li> but it only partially cleared my skin.  </li>
            <li> *Very comparable to PROACTIV but a little less abrasive scrub.</li>
            <li> Nothing I did kept those away, so wanted to try something other than a basic cleanser to see if I could deter the acne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find something when everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but I&#x27;m completely bowled over by this product.</li>
            <li> I wanted help with  my skin but nothing that would dry it out.</li>
            <li> I am 24 years old and I am tired of breaking out like 14 year old.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry the skin, no burning, or itching!</li>
            <li> I was using a couple other acne thee-steps from MaryKay and Peter Thomas Roth before Avon but my skin was flaking, dry, burning, and still had acne.</li>
            <li> Not only is there more of it, but it is itchy and a little painful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent years fighting with my acne</li>
            <li> My skin is softer and \\&quot;trouble spots\\&quot; that I&#x27;ve been trying to kill off for ages are finally disappearing.</li>
            <li> But like other cream based cleaners it dried my skin out and resulted in a massive breakout.</li>
            <li> and I was becoming quite frustrated, being that I&#x27;m 30</li>
            <li> I even tried proactive which did what any other face wash does.</li>
            <li> So far, I have had this product for 3 weeks, and have seen a big decrease in redness, pimples, and painful red bumps.  </li>
            <li> : it dries up the pimples, but then you have dark spots all over your face.</li>
            <li> Then correcting the acne scars and dark spots was another issue I needed to address besides acne per se.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only use it once a day because lately the sides of my nose have been peeling slightly but</li>
            <li> , acne scars are disappearing,I&#x27;ve notice less acne on the firsts weeks I&#x27;ve used this.</li>
            <li> She has been using regulary 2x a day for less than a week and her skin has already started improving.</li>
            <li> the heck is this mess from Avon&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> and although i still have mild breakouts, they are not as bad as they used to be and my skin feels and looks a lot smoother.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a month now</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started out just using the toner pads and corrective lotion just once a day in case it was too drying, but it was not an issue, so I have been using all 3 (the cleanser, which is cooling and has the little scrubby beads - toner pads, and corrective lotion) morning and evening.  </li>
            <li> I had this patch of cystic acne on my jaw line for a few weeks now that would not go away and it was gone in a couple of days of using Avon.</li>
            <li> I have been fighting acne around my jaw line and cheeks for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I had trouble finding something that would help my acne</li>
            <li> I would be the one that would break out after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Waste of money for me that is.</li>
            <li> In the past few yew years I have bought: the Clinique, Murad &amp; Dermatilogica systems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now 20 and never had an acne problem, however recently over the past few months I&#x27;ve developed adult/cystic acne that&#x27;s been really annoying.</li>
            <li> I was very frustrated after nearly 8 years and finding NOTHING that completely worked.  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li> My mom usually likes Avon products, so I guess I give it a try.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t have bad acne, but get the occasional \\&quot;monthly\\&quot; breakouts. Nothing I did kept those away, so wanted to try something other than a basic cleanser to see if I could deter the acne. I noticed that my occasional breakout really never showed up after using this system, and I did notice right away that my skin was smoother and softer, and felt really clean. I love the cleanser because it makes your skin nice and tingly, and everything smells really fresh.  The only downfall is that the cleanser comes in a pretty small tube, and for what the system costs, i think it should be bigger. All in all, I am pretty happy.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Avon Clearskin Professional for about 11 days now and could not be happier! Last week when I got it I had around 17 blemishes....BAD blemishes. Most were cystic acne and it was all over my forehead, chin, and jawline. I have dealt with acne now for over 10 years and this is the best product I have found in  a very long time. I was using a couple other acne thee-steps from MaryKay and Peter Thomas Roth before Avon but my skin was flaking, dry, burning, and still had acne. I had this patch of cystic acne on my jaw line for a few weeks now that would not go away and it was gone in a couple of days of using Avon. Skin is not dry at all and skin feels very soft and clear! I have ZERO zits right now and that hasn&#x27;t been true for months. For the first couple of days I had a little bit of stinging but I think thats because I had SOOOOO much acne when I first began. Even the acne marks are disappearing!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but I just have to for this product. I&#x27;m now 20 and never had an acne problem, however recently over the past few months I&#x27;ve developed adult/cystic acne that&#x27;s been really annoying. I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of face washes and lotions and nothing has helped until I found this. Within only a few days the acne began to clear up and redness was gone. It&#x27;s also keeping acne from developing. I really suggest this treatment system.</li>
            <li> I usually do not write reviews, but I had to for this one. I have used A LOT of products. I bought this because it was on sale and I figured why not try it. I was shocked at how well it cleaned/cleared my face! My face felts so clean and I seen a difference it the amount of blemishes I had. WAY TO GO, Avon. Thank you, for making such an awesome product!</li>
            <li> After trying many, many different acne systems, I was still experiencing breakouts more often than I&#x27;d like. I am almost 40 years old and this product has finally given me clear, smooth skin with no drying out like other products. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with Avon for making this product!</li>
            <li> Kept my 50 year old skin clear without drying. All else I have used sucked the moisture right out of my skin. I will continue to use this. If you&#x27;ve never used a skin clearing product that didn&#x27;t dry you up, Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this....very good for mature acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Works great, i used it once a day and my face cleared in a week.  The face scrub smells great, and feels perfect.   The scrub and the toner leave your face feeling perfect, and  the lotion goes on clean, smooth and not oily.  Does not leave your face hurting or sore at all.  *Very comparable to PROACTIV but a little less abrasive scrub.*  Very happy, would recommend, will buy again.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. Anyone who is thinking about getting it really needs to just buy it! I&#x27;ve seen using it for a week and my skin is super soft and clear. I have never suffered with ache but do suffer with a few stubborn spots and it cleared them straight up. When you first start using the treatment it does bring blemishes to the surface but they go quickly. I love this stuff. Amazing for the price!</li>
            <li> I have moderate acne with oily skin. Most of my breakouts occur right before my monthly period. I decided to get away from cheap store brand products and try Avon after reading positive reviews on Amazon and Google. This product improved the texture of my skin, reduced the amount of oil, and cleared most of my acne within 3 days. I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a month now and although i still have mild breakouts, they are not as bad as they used to be and my skin feels and looks a lot smoother. I would definitly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> My mom usually likes Avon products, so I guess I give it a try. It made my skin more oily than it already was, and made more breakouts occur. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. NEVER BUYING AGAIN!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 30s and going thru adolescence again and concerned about aging.  I wanted help with  my skin but nothing that would dry it out. I tried this on a whim, hoping it wouldnt make things worse.  Im so happy I did! My skin cleared up and is nice and smooth and healthy looking. Thankful I found this  and tried it.</li>
            <li> MY SKIN: I am fair-skinned and in my mid 30s. I have been fighting acne around my jaw line and cheeks for a few years now. When I was in my teens, I had a few acne problems off and on, but it was really not too much of a problem. In my 20s I had a few problems now and again, but now in my 30s, especially since my second child, the acne has been a constant problem. I have tried several types of acne treatments and topical medication, but nothing has seemed to work.   HOW LONG HAVE I HAD PRODUCT: So far, I have had this product for 3 weeks, and have seen a big decrease in redness, pimples, and painful red bumps.  I did start seeing better skin tone after 3 days.  THE RESULTS I HAVE SEEN SO FAR: This product has smoothed the skin in my problem areas, reduced redness, and evened out my skin tone. The bumps have decreased and are slowing down in their reappearance. I still have some of the bumps, but they are not red or painful.  HOW I USE THE PRODUCT: I use the products 2 times daily. I use the scrub (step 1) in the morning and then the cream (step 3).  At night I use all three. I started using step 2 for the first week twice daily, but reduced it to only once a day as there are only about 40 pads in the container--not enough for a whole month.  I replaced the step 2 in the morning with a basic astringent. So far I use only dime-size amounts of the step 1 and the step 3, so I think those will last me about a month if not a little more.   THE FEEL OF THE PRODUCT: The scrub itself feels wonderful and I would use that even if I didn&#x27;t need it as an acne treatment. It leaves the skin with a nice fresh feeling. The cream doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all and seems to absorb nicely. As time goes on, I will update the review if I feel that the product isn&#x27;t working for the long-term, but for now, I have really enjoyed it and would recommend it. Of course like anything, what works for one may not work for all.</li>
            <li> Okay , so I had this product back in my high school days because my mom ordered from Avon. I was thinking &amp;#34;what the heck is this mess from Avon&amp;#34;.  I always assumed Avon products were crap. Well no my friends, this has worked on my skin ever since then . I&#x27;m a guy by the way. Anytime any sort of acne appears on my face , this has handled it very well. I even tried proactive which did what any other face wash does. This product has cleared my skin time after time .</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin &amp; I don&#x27;t use any type of makeup. When I bought this product I didn&#x27;t see results right away but I did soon enough. I only use it once a day because lately the sides of my nose have been peeling slightly but thats only because I was over using the product because its summer &amp; I sweat alot. But I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have suffered of acne since my teens. For a long time in my life I thought that it was gone for good, but then starting at 28 years old, it struck back again like in my teen years. To give you some background, I am 30 now, Latina but with fair complexion. My mother language is not English, but I will try to do my best documenting my review. Below some products that I have tried, for your reference:&lt;br /&gt;  - Proactiv: the only specific product from them that worked for me is their mask. I just used for spots treatment and most of the time, they were reduced by 50% the next morning. I never felt that the cleanser and cream worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - Philosophy Acne Treatment: it dries up the pimples, but then you have dark spots all over your face. If I didn&#x27;t use a good moisturizer in the morning before going to work, my skin would be really dry and itchy. Then correcting the acne scars and dark spots was another issue I needed to address besides acne per se.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - Clinique Acne Treatment: cleanser is very mild. Then the astringent feels wonderfully in the skin, super refreshing. This is what does the magic. Then, the third step is the cream treatment which prevents the dry spots. I find this system to be competitive... however, every time I was going under a lot of stress, I didn&#x27;t find that the pimples were minimized. I still was getting breakouts, more controlled though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - Avon Clearskin Acne Treatment: cleanser is really and exfoliator, very refreshing. It&#x27;s like washing your face with tiny spheres of mint. The fact that it&#x27;s an exfoliator results in a really clean skin. Second step are some astringent pads, which helps remove the deep dirt. Then the third step is the treatment cream which helps reducing the pimples without over drying the skin. I find that every time I have a new pimple, I cleanse my skin, extract it and use both the pads and the cream and it reduces by 50% the next morning. I am still having my breakouts once in a while and specifically when I am under a lot of stress, but this is the only system that works best for my without over drying my skin and giving it a fresh sensation.nder a lot of stress, but this is the only system that works best for my without over drying my skin and giving it a fresh sensation.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 30 days and have not noticed a difference. The products are nice and do not dry out your skin however it did not help with my breakouts.</li>
            <li> I love the wash. It feels nice and it works well, but I STILL break out. I am 24 years old and I am tired of breaking out like 14 year old. The pads are handy for when I feel a big breakout coming, but they really dry you out. The lotion is the worst! After I put it on, I can practically rub and peel it off my face!</li>
            <li> Gives me very clear, soft skin. Got to my house in good time. The product was as described in the ad.</li>
            <li> This set not only gave me clear skin, it also made my skin soft and smooth! I&#x27;ve spent years fighting with my acne but now this treatment is all I need. It brought all the blemishes under my skin to the surface and healed them to reveal the soft, silky smooth and CLEAR skin thats been hiding all along. This product is the best!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this acne treatment for 3 days now and I can already see a difference! My skin is softer and \\&quot;trouble spots\\&quot; that I&#x27;ve been trying to kill off for ages are finally disappearing. The only complaint I would have is the lotion makes my skin very oily however I&#x27;ve always had a problem with that. Overall it&#x27;s a great product and I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I had trouble finding something that would help my acne and I was becoming quite frustrated, being that I&#x27;m 30 and I felt as if I should not even be having this problem.  However, when my mom ordered this for me to try, it completely changed my view on acne products.  I saw improvement in my skin in just a couple of days.</li>
            <li> As a 31 year old with mild acne on chin and forehead, having tried several other systems, I was excited to see this set with so many good reviews at such a reasonable price.  I will say within the first 3-4 days I did see the promised improvement in my complexion.  However, it has not prevented new break-outs, and after 2 weeks of use, my face looks the same as when I started.  I guess the new break-outs clear up more quickly than if I just left them alone, but I had higher hopes for this product set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started out just using the toner pads and corrective lotion just once a day in case it was too drying, but it was not an issue, so I have been using all 3 (the cleanser, which is cooling and has the little scrubby beads - toner pads, and corrective lotion) morning and evening.  I&#x27;m glad this product seems to work for others, but I will have to keep looking.</li>
            <li> My problem skin didn&#x27;t start until I was in my 20s.  And it came with a vengeance.  I was very frustrated after nearly 8 years and finding NOTHING that completely worked.  Proactiv was the best I found but it only partially cleared my skin.  I&#x27;ve tried So many different over the counter products (practically everything out there from home remedies to expensive high end products), but always went back to Proactiv, as it at least made my skin better, but never totally clear.  After almost 2 weeks of use, my face is almost entirely clear and this at the time I usually breakout the worst! (and to be honest, I haven&#x27;t even been very religious about using it.  I&#x27;ve used it 10 out of 14 days once a day because I frankly didn&#x27;t expect it to work)!  My face hasn&#x27;t been this clear in nearly a decade.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t over dry, smells pretty good, and has absolutely cleared my skin.  To boot, it&#x27;s way cheaper than most products I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s also improved my skin tone.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who, like me, has struggled to find something to treat adult acne effectively.  It&#x27;s so hard to find something when everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but I&#x27;m completely bowled over by this product.</li>
            <li> Order this for my wife. It really cleared her face up nicely.  Not harsh and easy to use.  She&#x27;s had some type of Rosasea and this seems to have really taken the redness out and controlls her complection very well.</li>
            <li> This definitely makes your skin feel good and cool as you wash it, and it feels refreshed after washing, but it did nothing for my acne. Eventually I found a good birth control that cleared it. I think this was worth the try and it might work for someone else though. Everyones bodies react differently to different things!</li>
            <li> its the best works very good</li>
            <li> ABOUT A COUPLE WEEKS.&lt;br /&gt;LIKE THE SCRUB, FEELS WARM, GRITTY- THINK IT&#x27;S WORKING.&lt;br /&gt;USING THE STEP 3 AFTER WORDS TOO.&lt;br /&gt;NOT A FAN OF THE WIPES, KINDA LEAVE A FILM ON YOUR FACE. DON&#x27;T LIKE THE FEELING</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a month now, and unfortunately I have seen a change. A very negative change. My acne has gotten worse. Not only is there more of it, but it is itchy and a little painful. I don&#x27;t doubt that it works for the majority of people, but if you have tried so many products that worked for everyone else, but not for you this is one of those times you&#x27;ll be part of the minority group it didn&#x27;t work for.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive combination acne-prone skin and these products are harsh and pretty drying for my liking. I had some success with the step three but the drying effects were too much for me.</li>
            <li> This product is great, I just think it may not be for my skin in particular. I only say that because the toner (the pads) dry me out, and the &#x27;lotion&#x27; for the acne tends to be a bit too moisturized. However, this product is pretty good. Especially the wash. I like to use it on my nose twice a week because that&#x27;s where most of my blackheads are. I use hot, hot water and this stuff, and those blackheads aren&#x27;t sure what hit them! :)</li>
            <li> i started using this 2 months ago and I have seen a  huge difference compared to other products I have used in the past. Im in love with this stuff, acne scars are disappearing,I&#x27;ve notice less acne on the firsts weeks I&#x27;ve used this.This stuff is amazing for my skin</li>
            <li> This is an awesome set to use for clearing acne prone skin. Another thing I love about this product is that it&#x27;s shrunken my pores. It&#x27;s made my skin smoother and tighter and I&#x27;ve only been using it about 2 weeks. It smells great! But if you have sensitive skin do not use it twice a day because it will over dry. Shipping and packaging was great. Would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 13 yr old daughter, who has mild acne which comes with here age. She has been using regulary 2x a day for less than a week and her skin has already started improving. She just loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product thinking it would be great. I would be the one that would break out after a few uses. It mortified me! I continued using it hoping it would clear my face, but it didnt. So I won&#x27;t be buying anymore. Bummer! :/</li>
            <li> My gf loves the Avon skin products and this kit works great. She has asked me to set up repeat orders.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! keeps most of the pimples at bay.  Been using it for over 2 years now! The wash is fantastic!!!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else on my acne prone skin.  I&#x27;m 46 and my face still breakout around that time of the month. Avon Clearskin products keeps my face nice and clear. Heals the blemishes.</li>
            <li> I have had moderate acne for most of my life, and this product really helps. It doesn&#x27;t cure it completely, but it is the only acne product that I have used that consistently eliminates whiteheads and minimizes acne buildup. The cleansing scrub is amazing and makes my skin very smooth. I would use it even if I did not have acne. Best of all, it is really affordable! This is the only topical acne treatment that I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Did nothing but irritate my skin. Waste of money for me that is. I started using omething better It work aveeno</li>
            <li> I am 44, and I have been struggling with breakouts for the last 3 years. I used to use a 3 step Loreal &#x27;Adult Acne&#x27; kit, that is now discont&#x27;d. This Avon &#x27;Pro Acne&#x27; kit really DID seem to work. I kept to the 3 steps, morning &amp; night. (I did some spot treatments here &amp; there w/ the Origins &#x27;spot remover&#x27;) In the past few yew years I have bought: the Clinique, Murad &amp; Dermatilogica systems. This Avon worked the best for me. I would suggest to buy an extra container of the pre-treated pads, that are step #2. (If they sell them separately) I went through those faster than the cleanser &amp; the #3 cream.</li>
            <li> This system works very well!  I have to say that I used Proactive and other products, and this is by far one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 and this helps my hormonal acne alot. Its not perfection, but its the best thing I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this. But like other cream based cleaners it dried my skin out and resulted in a massive breakout. I love the toner pads but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> My blemished and acne started to go away with in a few days! You need to make sure to use it at least every other day! Works great. Doesn&#x27;t dry the skin, no burning, or itching! Great! Recommend!</li>
