            <li>One best brushes I owned.</li>
            <li>The Scalpmaster Ionic Porcupine hair brush is one of the best I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>Thank you it is great</li>
            <li>Happy with my purchase</li>
            <li>Works great if you have hair extensions.  </li>
            <li>It great for those who have hair extensions.</li>
            <li>Another great quality brush from Scalpmaster.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I say it&#x27;s great for at night.  </li>
            <li>I love porcupine hair brushes because they massage and stimulate the scalp so well leave your hair feeling excellent.  </li>
            <li>It feels SOOO good on my scalp.</li>
            <li>So for a $3/$4 brush this is a good deal.</li>
            <li>I like having the dual bristles because it gives her a good scratch while brushing her.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad Amazon carries these because in my experience they are</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this hair brush!  </li>
            <li>love this brush!  </li>
            <li>Tangles seem to separate easily and it feels great on the scalp.</li>
            <li>&quot; this brush does a nice job of sort of loosening it up or relaxing it.</li>
            <li>good weight, doesn&#x27;t produce static.</li>
            <li>my favorite kind.  </li>
            <li>The feel and weight of the brush is ideal - very substantial.  </li>
            <li>So professional looking, great for shine!</li>
            <li>Great product, fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>

            <li>I thought I would use more often</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this brush.</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 of these and when they wear out, and they will, I&#x27;ll buy more.</li>
            <li>I get a lot more fur off of her too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Scalpmaster for many years.</li>
            <li>It was ok....</li>
            <li>Well made all my clients love this brush.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a very good general hair&lt;</li>
            <li>this high quality but reasonably priced brush is the best I&#x27;ve ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s most always a tangle free experience to brush my hair with this brush.</li>
            <li>This is by far their favorite - the handle has a soft finish that gives excellent grip.  </li>
            <li>This brush is very good for brushing out your hair wet without pulling on tangles.</li>
            <li>Once I opened the package and ran my nails on the bristles - she came running (she knows the sound).</li>
            <li>It seems to do a good job of brushing my hair out, I love the porcupine brush with the mixed bristles that give you the detangling and the smoothing in one stroke.</li>
            <li>Great for calming down the wave fly aways, distributes oil to the ends and the brush does a good job of (I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it) relaxing and stimulating my scalp.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this brush at the salon I go to.</li>
            <li>AMAZING for people who have sensitive hair!  </li>
            <li>Her fur is so nice and soft after a brushing.</li>
            <li>I have super fine straight hair and this brush is great for brushing from the scalp down to the ends to stimulate movement of hair oils and keeping the hair healthy.  </li>
            <li>The brush has very pointy bristles but aside from that it is super easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I can still use the brush and it works as designed, however my sensitive scalp child cries (more than usual).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But worth the money.</li>
            <li>Stop using so much shampoo and start really taking care of the health of your hair right now....  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>It is difficult to find brushes WITHOUT balls on the ends of the nylon pins, but this one fits the bill perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Once I first tried this style of brush years ago, it&lt;br /&gt;became</li>
            <li>This is one of the only brushes I&#x27;ve used that seems to magically get through it without ripping the tangles or breaking my hair.</li>
            <li>I have long (mid-back), very fine hair that tangles like a spiderweb -- but lots of it.</li>
            <li>Fits in the hand well, gently reaches the scalp and is just the right size for me.  </li>
            <li>I LOVED this brush so much the first few days that I had it, then it started frizzing my hair all to</li>
            <li>bristly type brushes aren&#x27;t as good for actual styling because they can actually make your hair tangle somewhat at times.  </li>
            <li>Yes, that old adage is true.  </li>
            <li>I really like this brush</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;pet brushes&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t recommend this one at all.  </li>
            <li>really nice boar nylon brush, similar amost the same as one I paid 4 times as much for</li>
            <li>And the bristles are stiff enough to act as sort of an untangler, it does a very nice job.</li>
            <li>I find as long as I brush lightly</li>
            <li>Particularly the ones for cats.</li>
            <li>Well, it didn&#x27;t help with static and the boar bristles were too far down to really effect my hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this brush to others.</li>
            <li>, I can highly recommend this one by&lt;br /&gt;Scalpmaster.</li>
            <li>so the natural bristles will touch my scalp, but I don&#x27;t think there would be much left.&lt;br</li>
            <li>handle is comfortable, it has a brushed plastic feel to it making it feel softer than your standard plastic handle.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see a major ball at the end of them</li>
            <li>If you are careful, it&#x27;s fine, but if you brush with any sort of pressure it scrapes your scalp, skin, and back when you&#x27;re brushing your hair.</li>
            <li>This brush has natural boar&#x27;s hair bristles.</li>
            <li>I used an old bristle brush of mine that I wasn&#x27;t using anymore.</li>
            <li>Soft to the touch</li>
            <li>I have a few Marilyn Monroe brand brushes for me and my girls, and we LOVE those for getting through our hair tangles, and the MM work even well on the girls American Girl dolls</li>
            <li>You are actually raking your scalp with cheap stiff plastic bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wanted a brush that would really dig through all this hair without sort of shredding my hair with rough plastic bristles.</li>
            <li>It also has other bristles that extend up higher (above the boar&#x27;s hair bristles) - which help the brush glide over the extensions without ripping the extensions out.</li>

            <li> I have very long hair, so I need the combination of the boar bristle and the plastic bristle, but I like the brushes that have rounded tips on the plastic bristles.  </li>
            <li> For a smaller (purse-sized) version, try the Denman small porcupine brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to my other brushes and give this one a pass.</li>
            <li> The plastic bristles are sharp and they scratch and gouge the scalp.  </li>
            <li> Not exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> brush doesn&#x27;t feel like it gets through completely through our thick hair, and I&#x27;m not talking Rapunzel-style hair either!</li>
            <li> I wish Amazon carried their smaller brushes as well, they are so hard to find anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Not strong enough for thick hair.</li>
            <li> Sadly the picture doesn&#x27;t show the brush very clearly, so i didn&#x27;t know the plastic pieces that stick up didn&#x27;t have the little rounded parts on them.</li>
            <li> I have short hair, but it&#x27;s very thick and wavy.</li>
            <li> not great because it doesn&#x27;t grasp my short hair firmly when I am brushing and blow drying it.</li>
            <li> Well, I chose to ignore the other reviews about how the white bristles in this brush are extremely rough on the scalp (due to the fact that they stick out way past the boar bristles), and I&#x27;m sorry I did!</li>
            <li> My only real complaint with this brush is that the plastic tips aren&#x27;t rounded</li>
            <li> /&gt;In fact, my old brush needed replacing badly since&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d been unable to locate one locally anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little &#x27;tough&#x27; on the scalp.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;no longer as common in stores as they used to</li>
            <li> but if you do know what a tense scalp feels like you might want to try this brush).</li>
            <li> I am back using my go to plastic hairbrush. :(</li>
            <li> I am thinking of cutting them down to the bristles length.</li>
            <li> My poor cat runs if I use one of those brushes on her.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much no one will be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> and so they have sharp edges that can be painful.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed with this brush.</li>
            <li> I am afraid to use it to style my hair with a blowdryer because the bristles may melt.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed that the boar bristles just....</li>
            <li> It HURTS!  :-(</li>
            <li> Stupid.</li>

            <li> Thank you it is great</li>
            <li> Happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> The brush has very pointy bristles but aside from that it is super easy to clean. I love it.</li>
            <li> Works great if you have hair extensions.  This brush has natural boar&#x27;s hair bristles. It also has other bristles that extend up higher (above the boar&#x27;s hair bristles) - which help the brush glide over the extensions without ripping the extensions out.</li>
            <li> Well, I chose to ignore the other reviews about how the white bristles in this brush are extremely rough on the scalp (due to the fact that they stick out way past the boar bristles), and I&#x27;m sorry I did! After a couple swipes I realized that the white bristles were just too scratchy on my scalp. The reason I bought it was because of the boar bristles combined with the fact that it was &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34;, thus I thought it&#x27;d help with the static. Well, it didn&#x27;t help with static and the boar bristles were too far down to really effect my hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be returning!</li>
            <li> It was listed under wire hair brush when searched for.  It was not.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I am not impressed with this brush. It does the job brushing my hair but it&#x27;s a little &#x27;tough&#x27; on the scalp. I am afraid to use it to style my hair with a blowdryer because the bristles may melt. I thought I would use more often but it&#x27;s kinda fallen by the wayside. I am back using my go to plastic hairbrush. :(</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush. It feels SOOO good on my scalp. And the bristles are stiff enough to act as sort of an untangler, it does a very nice job. But the only problem is that I want to brush my hair all day.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush I have short hair, but it&#x27;s very thick and wavy. Wanted a brush that would really dig through all this hair without sort of shredding my hair with rough plastic bristles. Great for calming down the wave fly aways, distributes oil to the ends and the brush does a good job of (I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it) relaxing and stimulating my scalp. Somehow \\&quot;relaxing and stimulating\\&quot; don&#x27;t seem to make sense but if you know how at the end of day your scalp can feel sort of \\&quot;tense\\&quot; or \\&quot;bloodless\\&quot; this brush does a nice job of sort of loosening it up or relaxing it. (If you don&#x27;t understand what I&#x27;m talking about please don&#x27;t send me a bazillion responses just buy a different brush...but if you do know what a tense scalp feels like you might want to try this brush).</li>
            <li> This brush is very good for brushing out your hair wet without pulling on tangles. Tangles seem to separate easily and it feels great on the scalp. I would highly recommend this brush to others.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of these and when they wear out, and they will, I&#x27;ll buy more. Fits in the hand well, gently reaches the scalp and is just the right size for me.  I have waist length hair and it&#x27;s most always a tangle free experience to brush my hair with this brush.</li>
            <li> I bought three brushes for my wife and daughters from Amazon.  This is by far their favorite - the handle has a soft finish that gives excellent grip.  It is difficult to find brushes WITHOUT balls on the ends of the nylon pins, but this one fits the bill perfectly.  It does not rip/tear hair out like brushes with balls on the ends.  For a smaller (purse-sized) version, try the Denman small porcupine brush.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter and myself to use. Sadly the picture doesn&#x27;t show the brush very clearly, so i didn&#x27;t know the plastic pieces that stick up didn&#x27;t have the little rounded parts on them. If you are careful, it&#x27;s fine, but if you brush with any sort of pressure it scrapes your scalp, skin, and back when you&#x27;re brushing your hair. OUCH. I&#x27;ll stick to my other brushes and give this one a pass.</li>
            <li> One best brushes I owned. I bought another because everyone in my house keeps using mine. I originally purchased this brush at the salon I go to. It great for those who have hair extensions.</li>
            <li> good weight, doesn&#x27;t produce static.</li>
            <li> Once I first tried this style of brush years ago, it&lt;br /&gt;became my favorite kind.  I&#x27;m very glad Amazon carries these because in my experience they are&lt;br /&gt;no longer as common in stores as they used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, my old brush needed replacing badly since&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d been unable to locate one locally anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;And this high quality but reasonably priced brush is the best I&#x27;ve ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a very good general hair&lt;br /&gt;brush, I can highly recommend this one by&lt;br /&gt;Scalpmaster.</li>
            <li> Not strong enough for thick hair. Doesn&#x27;t even reach scalp when brushing. Stupid.</li>
            <li> So for a $3/$4 brush this is a good deal. I actually purchased this brush for my cat. I really don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;pet brushes&amp;#34; that are on the market. Particularly the ones for cats. My poor cat runs if I use one of those brushes on her. Then one day (years ago) I used an old bristle brush of mine that I wasn&#x27;t using anymore. She purred and purred and didn&#x27;t run. So, it gave me the idea to start using bristle brushes on her. I get a lot more fur off of her too. I had to purchase this one because the husband lost her brush. Once I opened the package and ran my nails on the bristles - she came running (she knows the sound). Now - the plastic white porcupine nubs stick out quite a bit. I am thinking of cutting them down to the bristles length. I don&#x27;t really see a major ball at the end of them so I think it will work. I like having the dual bristles because it gives her a good scratch while brushing her. Her fur is so nice and soft after a brushing. So, this is a brush I will definitely purchase again if we lose this one.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed that the boar bristles just....don&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped.  I have a few Marilyn Monroe brand brushes for me and my girls, and we LOVE those for getting through our hair tangles, and the MM work even well on the girls American Girl dolls hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush doesn&#x27;t feel like it gets through completely through our thick hair, and I&#x27;m not talking Rapunzel-style hair either!</li>
            <li> Another great quality brush from Scalpmaster. I wish Amazon carried their smaller brushes as well, they are so hard to find anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I have long (mid-back), very fine hair that tangles like a spiderweb -- but lots of it. This is one of the only brushes I&#x27;ve used that seems to magically get through it without ripping the tangles or breaking my hair. Love it!</li>
            <li> I LOVED this brush so much the first few days that I had it, then it started frizzing my hair all to **** and back so I don&#x27;t even use it anymore; it just lays there on the counter while I use a different brush that doesn&#x27;t frizz my hair.</li>
            <li> The plastic bristles are sharp and they scratch and gouge the scalp.  I have very long hair, so I need the combination of the boar bristle and the plastic bristle, but I like the brushes that have rounded tips on the plastic bristles.  I really don&#x27;t recommend this one at all.  It HURTS!  :-(</li>
            <li> I love this hair brush!  Soft to the touch and it gives my hair body and it does not hurt my head!  AMAZING for people who have sensitive hair!  I recommend this product 100%!</li>
            <li> I love porcupine hair brushes because they massage and stimulate the scalp so well leave your hair feeling excellent.  The Scalpmaster Ionic Porcupine hair brush is one of the best I have ever tried.  The feel and weight of the brush is ideal - very substantial.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> really nice boar nylon brush, similar amost the same as one I paid 4 times as much for</li>
            <li> It seems to do a good job of brushing my hair out, I love the porcupine brush with the mixed bristles that give you the detangling and the smoothing in one stroke. My only real complaint with this brush is that the plastic tips aren&#x27;t rounded and so they have sharp edges that can be painful. I find as long as I brush lightly I can still use the brush and it works as designed, however my sensitive scalp child cries (more than usual).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is comfortable, it has a brushed plastic feel to it making it feel softer than your standard plastic handle.</li>
            <li> You cannot tell by the picture but there are WHITE PLASTIC BRISTLES sticking out I/4th inch in every tuft. The brush looks frosted white. You are actually raking your scalp with cheap stiff plastic bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am trying to figure out how to cut out plastic so the natural bristles will touch my scalp, but I don&#x27;t think there would be much left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Scalpmaster for many years. Not again. CHINA PRINTED ON THE HANDLE.&lt;br /&gt;I WISH I HAD SENT IT BACK.</li>
            <li> It was ok....not great because it doesn&#x27;t grasp my short hair firmly when I am brushing and blow drying it.</li>
            <li> So professional looking, great for shine! Well made all my clients love this brush. Thank you so much no one will be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> love this brush!  I have super fine straight hair and this brush is great for brushing from the scalp down to the ends to stimulate movement of hair oils and keeping the hair healthy.  I do not use this as a styling brush, this is my nightly &amp;#34;100 strokes before bed&amp;#34; brush.  Yes, that old adage is true.  Stop using so much shampoo and start really taking care of the health of your hair right now....  &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristly type brushes aren&#x27;t as good for actual styling because they can actually make your hair tangle somewhat at times.  That&#x27;s why I say it&#x27;s great for at night.  When I&#x27;m not brushing in a hurry, but taking my time, it&#x27;s wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still prefer to use a regular brush with the plastic bristles with ball tips for styling in the daytime.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I was looking for. But worth the money. A keeper for me.</li>
