            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>The most important-the butter is an ivory colored one, just as it is advertised!</li>
            <li>I did alot of research about this product before buying it and everyone was talking about how amazing it is for any and all skin types.</li>
            <li>The butter was nice and creamy.</li>
            <li>Honestly, from my experience &amp; what I&#x27;ve read online about Shea Butter, I don&#x27;t believe that this is unrefined shea butter.</li>
            <li>loving this product and the quality of it.</li>
            <li>The smell was quite nice.</li>
            <li>My favorite is from lotion makers but this is just as good.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful thank you very much&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>The price of $7.99 is nice, the packaging is just two plastic zip bags, but it was done well and with a lot of tape.</li>
            <li>It is very nicely moisturizing and absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>its so smooth and it just melts into your hands!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased Shea Butter from another distributor to make some more lotion &amp; compare with this brand.</li>
            <li>the butter is sooo smooth and my skin&#x27;s texture has improved dramatically!</li>
            <li>i have been top notch kitchen mixtress since receiving this product.  </li>
            <li>This Shea butter is just lovely.</li>
            <li>Its butter, for sure.</li>
            <li>absolutely love using it in mixes with cocoa butter, olive, and coconut oil for a body butter in winter.</li>
            <li>Feels great on on my skin, the real deal,  I use it for stretch mark prevention.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t to overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>This was an excellent deal and I would recommend to anyone who needs extra moisture.</li>
            <li>I love it for twists out an sealing:)</li>
            <li>The product looks even more appealing in reality.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love how earthy this smells and</li>
            <li>but I am not quite satisfied with the combo.  </li>
            <li>This is the real deal, Shea butter at its finest!!!!</li>
            <li>I researched for weeks trying to find a good, pure, inexpensive, source of shea butter.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this and unrefned shea butter and mixed them together using more cocoa butter than shea and its a great concoction</li>
            <li>100% natural, no additives, and good for many beauty</li>
            <li>I would&#x27;ve bought more right away!</li>
            <li>Also, the fair wage practice is important to me due to believing ALL workers deserve their fair penance.</li>
            <li>And fine lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li>Truly fine.</li>
            <li>I was able to melt it and make lotion immediately with it with no unpleasant odor problems.</li>
            <li>Used with coconut oil, the lotion is mostly solid at room temperature but easily melts in your hand to create an oil that is great for massage or as a lotion.  </li>
            <li>It is light in color, just like the photo.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product, but I have had better results with Organic Coconut Oil in place of this.</li>
            <li>I read lots of reviews on different shea butters for sale on amazaon and this one had the most good reviews.</li>
            <li>The shea butter seems to be of good quality and pure, exactly what I read shea butter should be.</li>
            <li>It just didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations and the more I use it, the more fault I find in it.</li>
            <li>The shea butter is rich and creamy.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I was really excited.  </li>
            <li>I was just about ready to give up looking for real shea butter when i came across a video clip on youtube showing women in africa making shea butter and to my surprise coastal scents had decided to help the people of africa by offering fair wages to make the butter.</li>
            <li>true Shea butter</li>
            <li>It has a smooth consistency and smelled fresh.</li>
            <li>I love it because you don&#x27;t have to use much to get</li>
            <li>It was a nice soft beige colour.</li>
            <li>You mix it with other oils and it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>In my book this is a winner, loyal purchaser of shea butter for life.</li>
            <li>The container I have had a very uniform smooth texture that is unrefined but almost whipped smooth</li>
            <li>I bought yellow shea butter and that seemed easier to work with as far as consistency and it works incredibly well as a conditioning lip balm.&lt;br</li>
            <li>shipping was quick as well.</li>
            <li>My shea butter arrived fresh and quickly.</li>
            <li>This butter feels amazing on my skin, I&#x27;ve had a recent flair up with my eczema and all of the itching and cracking stopped within minutes of applying.</li>
            <li>It is not at all gritty like some butters, and has a nice color and smell.</li>
            <li>Thanks Coastal Scents for offering such a good wholesome product.  </li>
            <li>This product from Coastal Scents was fresh and well packaged .  </li>
            <li>The strong scent and gritty feel wouldn&#x27;t bother me if the product worked, but it wasn&#x27;t easy to work with.</li>
            <li>is just as good as all the other brands out there.</li>
            <li>You will notice a difference right away.</li>
            <li>I use it in my sunscreen as a natural spf and it not only works well, but absorbs so nicely!</li>
            <li>Dont miss out on saving a few extra dollars, sign up on the Subscribe and Save to save even more off of Amazon&#x27;s already great price.</li>
            <li>For me it&#x27;s more cost effective to buy it this way every year, especially since I only use shea butter in winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The big advantage is that this shea butter is fair trade and directly supports the women in Ghana who harvest the nuts and process the shea oil.</li>
            <li>For my hair to make it easy i reuse an old jar</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s soft, an ivory to off beige color, with a strong nutty scent.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that i did not buy enough, and since i went around bragging about the butter i had to share it with my friends and family lol.</li>
            <li>This shea butter is a little sweeter smelling than any others that I have bought, but works just a good.</li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing Shea Butter, I&#x27;ve read &amp; researched alot about Shea butter since purchasing.</li>
            <li>It arrived exactly as pictured &amp; arrived on time.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the quality product!</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying this is NOT my first time using Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I ever bought Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li>I use it from head to toe,Leaves your skin soft and smooth</li>
            <li>the first use may feel greasy , but give it a min</li>
            <li>They now sell 10 ounce jars of their shea butter for a higher price than the 1 pound bags were.</li>
            <li>It looked exactly like the picture in the description.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>When I first purchased this it seemed like the real deal.</li>
            <li>This has an off white shade and it does have a strong aroma.</li>
            <li>Will certainly buy shea butter through coastal scents again.</li>
            <li>My children could not stand the smell, nor could I. I was looking for a pure product to mix with scent, this smells toxic.</li>
            <li>it is pure</li>
            <li>This stuff is pure shea.</li>
            <li>and I could smell the aroma of pure shea butter before I even opened the bag</li>
            <li>My shea butter came in a clear sort of zipper bag, it was soft to the touch and smelled strongly of shea butter.</li>
            <li>It smells very nutty and melted in my hands.</li>
            <li>I really like this product except for the scent.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it really has a smell</li>
            <li>I put it on straight out of the shower and until I shower again</li>
            <li>Everyone wants to know what I use on my skin</li>
            <li>So i decided to purchase the butter, because the  butter was  coming straight from africa (as evidenced by the video)</li>
            <li>it has to be the real deal.</li>
            <li>I really like this product because it mixes well with my oils</li>
            <li>would recommend this particular shea butter for anyone who wants real and pure shea with no gimmicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it shea BUTTER it can melt) take the shea an blend it with natural oils(i use coconut an evoo) if you use it any where you will notice a difference right away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that most other suppliers aren&#x27;t really selling unrefine shea butter.</li>
            <li>so i use my body heat to warm it in small pieces in my  palms</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the only person who uses this and buying 5 years worth of shea butter in bulk is not cost effective and is a waste of product.</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad, but the texture is a bit greasy and possibly even grainy?</li>
            <li>Highly moisturizes skin, hair, face.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(it came in a nice package with a Coastal Scents stick on it and was also double bagged in a smaller bag that was taped to fit, but in an ugly way it looked nice).</li>
            <li>When I made my first batch of lotion with it, it was very lumpy, almost gritty.  </li>
            <li>( please store in a cool dry place</li>
            <li>Looking for a new company to purchase from.</li>
            <li>I have family with very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li>I feel this product is geared more toward the end use consumer rather than the lotion maker due to the relatively smaller size and the fact that it is already packaged in a retail container, complete with acrylic scoop to remove the butter from the container in a hygienic way.</li>
            <li>The price may not be cheap but a pound of shea butter will last you a long time.</li>
            <li>This stuff certainly is effective in softening my skin but it is very thick.  </li>
            <li>It melts well and whips into a soft mousse-textured cream</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like this shea butter so far.</li>
            <li>I have tried the yellow shea like most Americans, but I read how it is processed and mixed with unknown chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I break off a chunk and blend it with natural oils, aloe, and glycerin to make a soft whipped shea cream.</li>
            <li>I use it for everything, I use this product for my hair, skin and on my 4 year old son.</li>
            <li>my 3yr old said.</li>
            <li>Keeps you moisturized all day and makes your skin soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>i suppose it could last a normal person up to a year if stored</li>
            <li>After trial and error with different brands, I finally know what pure Shea is.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shea is like no other I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Also my acne scars are slightly  fading with only a nightly application but best of all, are my tired feet that are slightly swollen at the end of my 8-10 hour work shift.</li>
            <li>I complained to Amazon and they gave it to me for free.</li>
            <li>I recently made a batch of lotion w/ just this shea butter &amp; coconut oil and an essential oil &amp; while it&#x27;s nice &amp; thick &amp; feels like it&#x27;s moisturizing after about 10/15 mins my hands feel dry &amp; filmy</li>
            <li>At first, it felt oily to me, but that&#x27;s because the only other time i have bought shea butter, it didn&#x27;t look or have the texture of this one.  </li>
            <li>I agree with the previous positive reviews.</li>
            <li>It may feel greasy at first, but give it a few seconds</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased raw shea butter before, but this was my first time ordering the coastal scents brand.</li>
            <li>I have very, and I mean very, sensitive skin.</li>

            <li> 100% natural, no additives, and good for many beauty</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve bought more right away!</li>
            <li> Also, the fair wage practice is important to me due to believing ALL workers deserve their fair penance.</li>
            <li> And fine lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li> Truly fine.</li>
            <li> I was able to melt it and make lotion immediately with it with no unpleasant odor problems.</li>
            <li> Used with coconut oil, the lotion is mostly solid at room temperature but easily melts in your hand to create an oil that is great for massage or as a lotion.  </li>
            <li> It is light in color, just like the photo.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product, but I have had better results with Organic Coconut Oil in place of this.</li>
            <li> I read lots of reviews on different shea butters for sale on amazaon and this one had the most good reviews.</li>
            <li> The shea butter seems to be of good quality and pure, exactly what I read shea butter should be.</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations and the more I use it, the more fault I find in it.</li>
            <li> The shea butter is rich and creamy.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I was really excited.  </li>
            <li> I was just about ready to give up looking for real shea butter when i came across a video clip on youtube showing women in africa making shea butter and to my surprise coastal scents had decided to help the people of africa by offering fair wages to make the butter.</li>
            <li> true Shea butter</li>
            <li> It has a smooth consistency and smelled fresh.</li>
            <li> I love it because you don&#x27;t have to use much to get</li>
            <li> It was a nice soft beige colour.</li>
            <li> You mix it with other oils and it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> In my book this is a winner, loyal purchaser of shea butter for life.</li>
            <li> The container I have had a very uniform smooth texture that is unrefined but almost whipped smooth</li>
            <li> I bought yellow shea butter and that seemed easier to work with as far as consistency and it works incredibly well as a conditioning lip balm.&lt;br</li>
            <li> shipping was quick as well.</li>
            <li> My shea butter arrived fresh and quickly.</li>
            <li> This butter feels amazing on my skin, I&#x27;ve had a recent flair up with my eczema and all of the itching and cracking stopped within minutes of applying.</li>
            <li> It is not at all gritty like some butters, and has a nice color and smell.</li>
            <li> Thanks Coastal Scents for offering such a good wholesome product.  </li>
            <li> This product from Coastal Scents was fresh and well packaged .  </li>
            <li> The strong scent and gritty feel wouldn&#x27;t bother me if the product worked, but it wasn&#x27;t easy to work with.</li>
            <li> is just as good as all the other brands out there.</li>
            <li> You will notice a difference right away.</li>
            <li> I use it in my sunscreen as a natural spf and it not only works well, but absorbs so nicely!</li>
            <li> Dont miss out on saving a few extra dollars, sign up on the Subscribe and Save to save even more off of Amazon&#x27;s already great price.</li>
            <li> For me it&#x27;s more cost effective to buy it this way every year, especially since I only use shea butter in winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The big advantage is that this shea butter is fair trade and directly supports the women in Ghana who harvest the nuts and process the shea oil.</li>
            <li> For my hair to make it easy i reuse an old jar</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s soft, an ivory to off beige color, with a strong nutty scent.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that i did not buy enough, and since i went around bragging about the butter i had to share it with my friends and family lol.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is a little sweeter smelling than any others that I have bought, but works just a good.</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing Shea Butter, I&#x27;ve read &amp; researched alot about Shea butter since purchasing.</li>
            <li> It arrived exactly as pictured &amp; arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the quality product!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying this is NOT my first time using Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ever bought Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li> I use it from head to toe,Leaves your skin soft and smooth</li>
            <li> the first use may feel greasy , but give it a min</li>
            <li> They now sell 10 ounce jars of their shea butter for a higher price than the 1 pound bags were.</li>
            <li> It looked exactly like the picture in the description.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> When I first purchased this it seemed like the real deal.</li>
            <li> This has an off white shade and it does have a strong aroma.</li>
            <li> Will certainly buy shea butter through coastal scents again.</li>
            <li> My children could not stand the smell, nor could I. I was looking for a pure product to mix with scent, this smells toxic.</li>
            <li> it is pure</li>
            <li> This stuff is pure shea.</li>
            <li> and I could smell the aroma of pure shea butter before I even opened the bag</li>
            <li> My shea butter came in a clear sort of zipper bag, it was soft to the touch and smelled strongly of shea butter.</li>
            <li> It smells very nutty and melted in my hands.</li>
            <li> I really like this product except for the scent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it really has a smell</li>
            <li> I put it on straight out of the shower and until I shower again</li>
            <li> Everyone wants to know what I use on my skin</li>
            <li> So i decided to purchase the butter, because the  butter was  coming straight from africa (as evidenced by the video)</li>
            <li> it has to be the real deal.</li>
            <li> I really like this product because it mixes well with my oils</li>
            <li> would recommend this particular shea butter for anyone who wants real and pure shea with no gimmicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it shea BUTTER it can melt) take the shea an blend it with natural oils(i use coconut an evoo) if you use it any where you will notice a difference right away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that most other suppliers aren&#x27;t really selling unrefine shea butter.</li>
            <li> so i use my body heat to warm it in small pieces in my  palms</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the only person who uses this and buying 5 years worth of shea butter in bulk is not cost effective and is a waste of product.</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad, but the texture is a bit greasy and possibly even grainy?</li>
            <li> Highly moisturizes skin, hair, face.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (it came in a nice package with a Coastal Scents stick on it and was also double bagged in a smaller bag that was taped to fit, but in an ugly way it looked nice).</li>
            <li> When I made my first batch of lotion with it, it was very lumpy, almost gritty.  </li>
            <li> ( please store in a cool dry place</li>
            <li> Looking for a new company to purchase from.</li>
            <li> I have family with very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> I feel this product is geared more toward the end use consumer rather than the lotion maker due to the relatively smaller size and the fact that it is already packaged in a retail container, complete with acrylic scoop to remove the butter from the container in a hygienic way.</li>
            <li> The price may not be cheap but a pound of shea butter will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> This stuff certainly is effective in softening my skin but it is very thick.  </li>
            <li> It melts well and whips into a soft mousse-textured cream</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this shea butter so far.</li>
            <li> I have tried the yellow shea like most Americans, but I read how it is processed and mixed with unknown chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I break off a chunk and blend it with natural oils, aloe, and glycerin to make a soft whipped shea cream.</li>
            <li> I use it for everything, I use this product for my hair, skin and on my 4 year old son.</li>
            <li> my 3yr old said.</li>
            <li> Keeps you moisturized all day and makes your skin soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> i suppose it could last a normal person up to a year if stored</li>
            <li> After trial and error with different brands, I finally know what pure Shea is.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shea is like no other I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Also my acne scars are slightly  fading with only a nightly application but best of all, are my tired feet that are slightly swollen at the end of my 8-10 hour work shift.</li>
            <li> I complained to Amazon and they gave it to me for free.</li>
            <li> I recently made a batch of lotion w/ just this shea butter &amp; coconut oil and an essential oil &amp; while it&#x27;s nice &amp; thick &amp; feels like it&#x27;s moisturizing after about 10/15 mins my hands feel dry &amp; filmy</li>
            <li> At first, it felt oily to me, but that&#x27;s because the only other time i have bought shea butter, it didn&#x27;t look or have the texture of this one.  </li>
            <li> I agree with the previous positive reviews.</li>
            <li> It may feel greasy at first, but give it a few seconds</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased raw shea butter before, but this was my first time ordering the coastal scents brand.</li>
            <li> I have very, and I mean very, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> As long as you give it about45 minutes to an hour to absorb.</li>
            <li> I also apply the shea butter to my lips and other personal body parts (wink wink).</li>
            <li> The product mixed well with other oils.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re a lotion / soap maker perhaps you may want to investigate other options to buy a larger quantity in bulk prices.</li>
            <li> My lips were still cracked and dry.</li>
            <li> After previously purchasing yellow shea butter, I learned it was not unrefined.</li>
            <li> Using this along with African black soap and there is no need for anything else.</li>
            <li> My previous order of shea butter was from the seller Hallal something,., but they sent me an yellow shea butter while I had ordered an ivory one.</li>
            <li> I use it after using the African Black Soap.</li>
            <li> but I bought it because my skin was very dry.  </li>
            <li> I know that in it&#x27;s solid form it takes a little bit of elbow grease to rub in well.</li>
            <li> It left little flecks of something all over me that never melted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also use this same mix as a sealant on hair, but I will discontinue that soon since I already use a heavy leave in cream for hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not strongly scented, so it is a good base to add oils or leave as unscented lotion.  </li>
            <li> No matter how hard I tried I could not get it to break down completely when applying it to my skin.</li>
            <li> , I will never buy any other soap or lotion.</li>
            <li> Do break off a small piece and rub it in the palms of your hands before attempting to put the solid product on your face.</li>
            <li> I have noticed my little dry patches have all but disappeared since I &#x27;ve been using this product.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and this will last me for at least the rest of the year.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s kinda hard &amp; solid on the inside.</li>
            <li> When I went to melt it down to combine w/ oils &amp; etc</li>
            <li> it took a while to melt down.</li>
            <li> I melted it down again thinking maybe that would help, it did not.  </li>
            <li> I use on my stretch marks and scar from a previous surgery.</li>
            <li> and I tell them, Black soap and Shea butter</li>
            <li> Just a little shea butter and a pair of soccer socks do the trick.</li>
            <li> It smells kinda weird, but makes my skin really soft.</li>
            <li> 16oz lasts me a lil over 6 months with everyday use(thick hair an lot of body)</li>
            <li> It did not smell rancid or old or stale.</li>
            <li> After just a few hours of having this shae butter on my face, I noticed my irritation clearing up immediately.</li>
            <li> raw</li>
            <li> The consistency was tough even after using an electric mixer to fluff up the shea butter, it is hard to spread it on my skin.</li>
            <li> Came unsealed &amp; hard as a rock.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had worse shea butters, but once you buy grade A certified shea butter, it&#x27;s hard to use anything else.</li>
            <li> It is VERY thick and is creamy/soft on the outer layer</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, at least to me.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m skeptical about it being UNREFINED SHEA BUTTER.</li>
            <li> ,It doesn&#x27;t smell bad..</li>
            <li> Very disappointed :(.</li>
            <li> I am a bit fearful when products can be sold and you have no idea</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pass this one out because you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> It smelled so disgusting!!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Terrible petroleum smell.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The shea butter seems to be of good quality and pure, exactly what I read shea butter should be. I made some very nice lotion with this.</li>
            <li> This butter feels amazing on my skin, I&#x27;ve had a recent flair up with my eczema and all of the itching and cracking stopped within minutes of applying. It smells very nutty and melted in my hands. I wish the company still sold 1lb bags! I would&#x27;ve bought more right away! D:</li>
            <li> The smell is just horrid. Reminds me of lard. Also did not blend  Very disappointed :(. Will never purchase again EVER</li>
            <li> Best Shea Butter ever! its so smooth and it just melts into your hands! Coastal scents did an awesome job. Don&#x27;t pass this one out because you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is a great shea butter. It is not at all gritty like some butters, and has a nice color and smell. It melts well and whips into a soft mousse-textured cream (I mix it 4:1 with coconut oil). The big advantage is that this shea butter is fair trade and directly supports the women in Ghana who harvest the nuts and process the shea oil.</li>
            <li> I have stretch marks (alot of them and they are darker than my skin tone), bought this as a back up to my &amp;#34;Bettersheabutter&amp;#34;. Looks and smells the same to me. My stretch marks have reduced dramatically over the last 3 months and honestly I only use the shea butter once a day. Also my acne scars are slightly  fading with only a nightly application but best of all, are my tired feet that are slightly swollen at the end of my 8-10 hour work shift. Just a little shea butter and a pair of soccer socks do the trick. I also apply the shea butter to my lips and other personal body parts (wink wink). In my book this is a winner, loyal purchaser of shea butter for life.</li>
            <li> I really like this product except for the scent. It smells kinda weird, but makes my skin really soft.</li>
            <li> Perfect. The butter was nice and creamy. It smelled like shea butter. I will buy again.  The product mixed well with other oils.</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing Shea Butter, I&#x27;ve read &amp; researched alot about Shea butter since purchasing. When I first purchased this it seemed like the real deal. I made a batch of lotion using it &amp; it SEEMED like it was a good lotion but I&#x27;m skeptical about it being UNREFINED SHEA BUTTER. It arrived exactly as pictured &amp; arrived on time. It is VERY thick and is creamy/soft on the outer layer but it&#x27;s kinda hard &amp; solid on the inside. (if that makes sense). When I went to melt it down to combine w/ oils &amp; etc it took a while to melt down. I don&#x27;t think it really has a smell,It doesn&#x27;t smell bad.. but then again it doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34; smell that I was expecting. It just didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations and the more I use it, the more fault I find in it. I recently made a batch of lotion w/ just this shea butter &amp; coconut oil and an essential oil &amp; while it&#x27;s nice &amp; thick &amp; feels like it&#x27;s moisturizing after about 10/15 mins my hands feel dry &amp; filmy (like I need to wash them). I ONLY use UNREFINED,UNPROCESSED coconut oil, so I know that&#x27;s not the issue, I&#x27;ve been using coconut oil for quite some time.  I&#x27;ve purchased Shea Butter from another distributor to make some more lotion &amp; compare with this brand. Honestly, from my experience &amp; what I&#x27;ve read online about Shea Butter, I don&#x27;t believe that this is unrefined shea butter. I would not recommend this brand &amp; i will definitely not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the purchase and for the price it is great. Will certainly buy shea butter through coastal scents again.</li>
            <li> I use on my stretch marks and scar from a previous surgery. And fine lines and wrinkles And it is AWESOME!!!!!!!saw an improvement in 4 weeks...true Shea butter</li>
            <li> After previously purchasing yellow shea butter, I learned it was not unrefined. So taking a chance with this vendor, I must say I am impressed! the butter is sooo smooth and my skin&#x27;s texture has improved dramatically! Using this along with African black soap and there is no need for anything else. Also, the fair wage practice is important to me due to believing ALL workers deserve their fair penance. Ordered again and will reorder once that&#x27;s done!</li>
            <li> loving this product and the quality of it. i have been top notch kitchen mixtress since receiving this product.  will definitely repurchase and recommend to others.  You get a lot of product for the money. Like how it was packaged as a block instead of in the crumbles and chunks you get at beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> When I got the package I opened it instantly. It smells so amazing! I use it in my sunscreen as a natural spf and it not only works well, but absorbs so nicely! Will definitely be buying again!!</li>
            <li> I opened the package and it was spoiled!! It smelled so disgusting!! I was very disappointed! Will definitely be calling</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is just lovely. Truly fine. I feel this product is geared more toward the end use consumer rather than the lotion maker due to the relatively smaller size and the fact that it is already packaged in a retail container, complete with acrylic scoop to remove the butter from the container in a hygienic way. The container I have had a very uniform smooth texture that is unrefined but almost whipped smooth consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a lotion / soap maker perhaps you may want to investigate other options to buy a larger quantity in bulk prices. However for use as a consumer of the product for skin care or the occasional batch of lip balm this product truly is a dream. Excellent sensual healing skin feeding product. Yummy!!!</li>
            <li> Terrible petroleum smell. I tossed it out. My children could not stand the smell, nor could I. I was looking for a pure product to mix with scent, this smells toxic.</li>
            <li> its good shea butter. raw and I mix with it with oils &amp; made a batch for my regime. its good butter</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this shea butter so far. The strong scent and gritty feel wouldn&#x27;t bother me if the product worked, but it wasn&#x27;t easy to work with. The consistency was tough even after using an electric mixer to fluff up the shea butter, it is hard to spread it on my skin. I tried using it as a lip balm but it didn&#x27;t do any good. It also broke me out on my shoulders. My lips were still cracked and dry. I bought yellow shea butter and that seemed easier to work with as far as consistency and it works incredibly well as a conditioning lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue using and will update if I see good results.</li>
            <li> This stuff was great.  I researched for weeks trying to find a good, pure, inexpensive, source of shea butter.  This will be my go to from now on.  It smelled great (not rancid) good texture, good color, just as it should be.  Thanks for the quality product!</li>
            <li> My shea butter arrived fresh and quickly. I love being a Prime member and getting my stuff in two days! The shea butter is rich and creamy. It has a smooth consistency and smelled fresh. I would definitely buy this item again. Also try out their cocoa butter it is also a great value too. Dont miss out on saving a few extra dollars, sign up on the Subscribe and Save to save even more off of Amazon&#x27;s already great price.</li>
            <li> Its butter, for sure. I put it on straight out of the shower and until I shower again I dont need any moisturizer at all.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> This is definitely unrefined she butter. I bought this butter to help reduce the appearance of my stretch marks on my legs. The smell is not bad, but the texture is a bit greasy and possibly even grainy? I really wanted to love this product, but I have had better results with Organic Coconut Oil in place of this. I hope this works out for others.</li>
            <li> Best shea butter I have ever used!  I have tried the yellow shea like most Americans, but I read how it is processed and mixed with unknown chemicals.  I am a bit fearful when products can be sold and you have no idea what&#x27;s in it.  This shea is like no other I have ever used.  It is light in color, just like the photo.  It is creamy and melts into my hands without having to heat it up.  I will only order this one in the future.  Thanks Coastal Scents for offering such a good wholesome product.  I have family with very sensitive skin so I will be giving them some of my product and referring them to you!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying this is NOT my first time using Shea Butter. I know that in it&#x27;s solid form it takes a little bit of elbow grease to rub in well. This Shea Butter however had a VERY gritty texture. No matter how hard I tried I could not get it to break down completely when applying it to my skin. It left little flecks of something all over me that never melted.&lt;br /&gt;So I complained to Amazon and they gave it to me for free. And I STILL haven&#x27;t used the rest. Now that I sit here writing this I wonder why I am even keeping it ? Well, the trash goes out tomorrow so...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had worse shea butters, but once you buy grade A certified shea butter, it&#x27;s hard to use anything else. Buy African Skin Solutions Shea Butter. It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Came unsealed &amp; hard as a rock.</li>
            <li> It comes as it is shown on the pictures and has all the properties Shea butter must have. Highly moisturizes skin, hair, face. 100% natural, no additives, and good for many beauty uses at home!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased raw shea butter before, but this was my first time ordering the coastal scents brand. This is good stuff. I break off a chunk and blend it with natural oils, aloe, and glycerin to make a soft whipped shea cream. I use it on my hair and body. This 16oz will last a loooooong time. I love it!</li>
            <li> Great price and a quality product.  Used to make my own moisturizer and is a great addition.  Will but again.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ever bought Shea Butter.  The fragrance is pleasant.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, at least to me.  You mix it with other oils and it&#x27;s great.  Even by itself on your skin, it blends in.  I mix shea butter with coconut oil, palm oil and an essential oil and I mix up a great butter for my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this Shea Butter about 2 weeks ago. Actually bought it to use in a whipped body butter recipe.  It&#x27;s great.  It comes double bagged and sealed.  It is the color of the picture.  At first, it felt oily to me, but that&#x27;s because the only other time i have bought shea butter, it didn&#x27;t look or have the texture of this one.  Anyways, it worked perfectly in my recipe.</li>
            <li> I use it from head to toe,Leaves your skin soft and smooth it is pure so i use my body heat to warm it in small pieces in my  palms the first use may feel greasy , but give it a min and it just melts into your skin.For my hair to make it easy i reuse an old jar( please store in a cool dry place it shea BUTTER it can melt) take the shea an blend it with natural oils(i use coconut an evoo) if you use it any where you will notice a difference right away. 16oz lasts me a lil over 6 months with everyday use(thick hair an lot of body) i suppose it could last a normal person up to a year if stored properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seller is great on time used along with AMAZON PRIME its cheaper an with  a faster delivery than from Coastal Scents</li>
            <li> In the lotions I have used this in, it sets up well and has a very nice feel on the skin.  Used with coconut oil, the lotion is mostly solid at room temperature but easily melts in your hand to create an oil that is great for massage or as a lotion.  It is not strongly scented, so it is a good base to add oils or leave as unscented lotion.  It is very nicely moisturizing and absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pure shea. After trial and error with different brands, I finally know what pure Shea is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s soft, an ivory to off beige color, with a strong nutty scent. It melts upon contact with skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love using it in mixes with cocoa butter, olive, and coconut oil for a body butter in winter. I also use this same mix as a sealant on hair, but I will discontinue that soon since I already use a heavy leave in cream for hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;16 ounces lasted me one year. I purchase from coastal scents website in November during their 50% off sales, making the butter around $5 for one pound. For me it&#x27;s more cost effective to buy it this way every year, especially since I only use shea butter in winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this particular shea butter for anyone who wants real and pure shea with no gimmicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE from 5 stars to 1 star&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of 3/2014, the company no longer sells 1 pound bags. They now sell 10 ounce jars of their shea butter for a higher price than the 1 pound bags were. Unacceptable to me. And the next size up is 5 pounds for about $40 on their website. I&#x27;m the only person who uses this and buying 5 years worth of shea butter in bulk is not cost effective and is a waste of product. Looking for a new company to purchase from.</li>
            <li> is just as good as all the other brands out there. shipping was quick as well. I purchased this and unrefned shea butter and mixed them together using more cocoa butter than shea and its a great concoction</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used shea butter before but I bought it because my skin was very dry.  I love it because you don&#x27;t have to use much to get results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have added this to my skin care regime.</li>
            <li> I read lots of reviews on different shea butters for sale on amazaon and this one had the most good reviews. I agree with the previous positive reviews. The product came within a very short amount of time. It looked exactly like the picture in the description. It was a nice soft beige colour. The smell was quite nice. It did not smell rancid or old or stale. I made a lotion from it and the consistency was great. I would feel very happy purchasing from here again.</li>
            <li> This is good quality shea butter.  My favorite is from lotion makers but this is just as good.  Will buy again</li>
            <li> I like this one too! This is another one that I mix in with the cocoa butter and it&#x27;s very nice. Will repurchase.</li>
            <li> I only buy shea butter from coastal scents. I&#x27;ve noticed that most other suppliers aren&#x27;t really selling unrefine shea butter. If it&#x27;s yellow it&#x27;s not shea butter. This has an off white shade and it does have a strong aroma. It&#x27;s not the best smelling stuff but you can always add essential oils to it to alter the smell.  The price may not be cheap but a pound of shea butter will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> Wonderful thank you very much&lt;br /&gt;But packaging dislike</li>
            <li> I did alot of research about this product before buying it and everyone was talking about how amazing it is for any and all skin types. So I initially bought some at a flea market and I absolutely loved it. I use it for everything, I use this product for my hair, skin and on my 4 year old son. Everyone wants to know what I use on my skin and I tell them, Black soap and Shea butter, I will never buy any other soap or lotion. This shea butter is a little sweeter smelling than any others that I have bought, but works just a good.</li>
            <li> Smells like candy my 3yr old said. Feels great on on my skin, the real deal,  I use it for stretch mark prevention. Prompt delivery, would give 5 stars if it came in a proper container not the ziplock bag.</li>
            <li> Love it! The smell isn&#x27;t to overwhelming. It has a smokey nutty smell. After just a few hours of having this shae butter on my face, I noticed my irritation clearing up immediately. Great to wear under makeup. As long as you give it about45 minutes to an hour to absorb. A little goes a long way and this will last me for at least the rest of the year. Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update- This has broke me out. However, I still give It 5 stars and It still is a good product. Keeps you moisturized all day and makes your skin soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom. Clears up scars and rashes. But gives me pimples. I have very, and I mean very, sensitive skin. I&#x27;m notsurprised by the results. So well, I&#x27;ve tried everything. Nothing worked. And so now, back to vitamin E.</li>
            <li> I was just about ready to give up looking for real shea butter when i came across a video clip on youtube showing women in africa making shea butter and to my surprise coastal scents had decided to help the people of africa by offering fair wages to make the butter. So i decided to purchase the butter, because the  butter was  coming straight from africa (as evidenced by the video) it has to be the real deal. My shea butter came in a clear sort of zipper bag, it was soft to the touch and smelled strongly of shea butter. I really like this product because it mixes well with my oils and i dont have to heat it to melt it. I simply use a fork and whip my mixture. The only problem is that i did not buy enough, and since i went around bragging about the butter i had to share it with my friends and family lol.</li>
            <li> Love this. Use it all the time. This was an excellent deal and I would recommend to anyone who needs extra moisture.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal, Shea butter at its finest!!!!</li>
            <li> This product from Coastal Scents was fresh and well packaged .  I was able to melt it and make lotion immediately with it with no unpleasant odor problems. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> My package came on time and I could smell the aroma of pure shea butter before I even opened the bag (it came in a nice package with a Coastal Scents stick on it and was also double bagged in a smaller bag that was taped to fit, but in an ugly way it looked nice). I am using it now as we speak an I love it for twists out an sealing:)</li>
            <li> The product looks even more appealing in reality. The price of $7.99 is nice, the packaging is just two plastic zip bags, but it was done well and with a lot of tape. The most important-the butter is an ivory colored one, just as it is advertised! My previous order of shea butter was from the seller Hallal something,., but they sent me an yellow shea butter while I had ordered an ivory one. I will definitely order from Coastal Scents again!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I use it after using the African Black Soap. Leaves your skin soft and smooth. I have noticed my little dry patches have all but disappeared since I &#x27;ve been using this product. Do break off a small piece and rub it in the palms of your hands before attempting to put the solid product on your face. It may feel greasy at first, but give it a few seconds and it just melts into your skin. You will notice a difference right away.</li>
            <li> I love how earthy this smells and 16 ounces is going to last me forever. It makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> I ordered mine thru Coastal Scents website because it was out of stock on Amazon.  I have the cocoa butter and it is great, so when I got the shea butter I was really excited.  When I made my first batch of lotion with it, it was very lumpy, almost gritty.  I melted it down again thinking maybe that would help, it did not.  I emailed the company and told them about it, but got NO response.  I will not be buying from them again.</li>
            <li> This stuff certainly is effective in softening my skin but it is very thick.  I tried thinning some of it with some cocoa cream but I am not quite satisfied with the combo.  I think I will just use it as is but be prepared to have to spread it out quite a bit.</li>
