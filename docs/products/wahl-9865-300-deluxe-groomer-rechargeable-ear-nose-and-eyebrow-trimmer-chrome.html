            <li>Deluxe Groomer Rechargeable Ear, Nose and Eyebrow Trimmer, Chrome]]&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>just what my husband was looking for!thanks for the recharbable deluxe groomer by wahl</li>
            <li>is nice.  </li>
            <li>cuz if you abuse this thing, I have no doubt it&#x27;ll break, otherwise, you got a nice package.</li>
            <li>Nice unit</li>
            <li>and it comes with some nice attachments.  </li>
            <li>This is very easy to use and helps me trim my husband&#x27;s neck and ear hair and eyebrows like nothing else has.</li>
            <li>The heads TWIST off and are very easy to interchange.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>The bag it came with is nice to use to keep it all together and safe.</li>
            <li>So far this Wahl unit is great!  </li>
            <li>does the job, but no stand for it, product would be better if it came with a stand to keep on the counter</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that it recharges.  </li>
            <li>Being rechargeable was an even greater deal.</li>
            <li>works like it should and love the fact it&#x27;s rechargeable, and the charge lasts a good while, also more powerful than battery operated models</li>
            <li>My $6.99 battery operated one works better.</li>
            <li>I would recomment this product to anyone who does not expressly need or want the ear trimmer, and who is okay with just having the nose and eyebrow trimmers.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS</li>
            <li>i SAY MORE?</li>
            <li>It was ok for that time period.  </li>
            <li>Much better than others I have tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This has turned out to be one of my favorite purchases.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Despite purchasing the appropriate UK to Aus power adapter</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It looks well made, but will not hold a charge for more than two minutes.</li>
            <li>All in all, I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Trims amazingly well, with very nice attachments.&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable to hold at nearly any angle.&lt;br /&gt;Trims all kinds of hair (eyebrows, ear hair, nose hair, back of neck hair) perfectly, but it is *not* a razor; use a razor if you want that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought the trimmer mainly for nose hair and it works great.</li>
            <li>Very good product, runs fast, charges quick and cuts close.  </li>
            <li>worked super and many time, buy!</li>
            <li>Mostly I am pleased, but the unit clogs easily and must be cleaned often.</li>
            <li>and it was the most important attachment.</li>
            <li>I love Wahl products in general and was happy to find this company with Amazon.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It does not pull the hair in his nose or ears and is easy to use for him.</li>
            <li>/&gt; Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>It was a bonus for the eyebrow trimmer, I read from the reviews that it breaks easy.</li>
            <li>but he has never complained about it and says it works good.</li>
            <li>This product works just fine for trimming around eyebrows and ears.  </li>
            <li>Since I didn&#x27;t need any of those items, it worked out fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quick and efficient !</li>
            <li>I found that this set was a very good value for the money spent.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, charge, and clean and has not hurt to use.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clip well and the parts are cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>so I was happy finally ...</li>
            <li>but the cheap plastic guard broke after 3 or 4 uses ...</li>
            <li>worth the couple dollars more that it may cost.  </li>
            <li>I was trying to clean it by lightly tapping it on the sink.  </li>
            <li>to clean and maintain</li>
            <li>to clean and maintain</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t operate at full speed when plugged in either.</li>
            <li>I try to finish as quickly as I can to avoid hearing loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They quickly repaired a failedion battery.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>Its does the job right and is super reliable.</li>
            <li>Like the rechargeable feature with a powerful motor.  </li>
            <li>not anymore powerful than one you can get at the drugstore.</li>
            <li>I paid more than I wanted, but expected a better quality product.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Extremely powerful motor&lt;br /&gt;Trims</li>
            <li>but the performance of this little guys is very nice.  </li>
            <li>All the right attachments at the right price....</li>
            <li>It is very strong and trims the hair to a short length.</li>
            <li>When you get it, take off the existing round attachment and put on securely your own.</li>
            <li>I have gone through a number of different brands but this one seems to be more powerful.</li>
            <li>I would say the only downside is not having a power gauge, I can use for a full month and its still going strong.</li>
            <li>The battery is stronger and more resilient than a standard AA battery.  </li>
            <li>Seems to keep its charge pretty well for a number of days.  </li>
            <li>I get the same value or better with the cheep models.</li>
            <li>Deluxe Groomer Rechargeable Ear, Nose and Eyebrow Trimmer, Chrome]]I spent over $26.00 for 3 months use.</li>
            <li>This is a very practical and useful product.  </li>
            <li>Sharp blades are very important, right?</li>
            <li>The first time my husband used it he was amazed how simple and clean of a job it did.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned many battery powered trimmers they work well with a new battery but quickly wear down.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend and he really likes it.  </li>
            <li>so he uses one of the quieter attachments for that (which still works very well).  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>IT IS SO MUCH EASIER TO USE</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pull the hair and cuts very close to the skin (without breaking skin)</li>
            <li>and the whole package compliments my Wahl hair clippers.</li>
            <li>Would return but too much hassle.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is comfortable to hold, the battery seems to last forever</li>
            <li>It costs a few dollars more but its worth it.</li>
            <li>I would pay more if  it was built with other &amp;#34;electronics?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Easier to clean and built to last.</li>
            <li>I wanted to buy a decent groomer.</li>
            <li>The quality of the product is not as high as I would expect from the Wahl name, though; the ear trimmer broke while I was trying to get it out of the plastic moulded tray in which it was packaged.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little persistency for nose and ear hairs, but it works ... and works safely.  </li>
            <li>It does what it says it&#x27;s going to and works really well so far.  </li>
            <li>I can still get a good trim by switching to another tool, but having to do that is irritating.</li>
            <li>Does a very professional job.</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t indicate with a light there charge and the attachments are not worth using.</li>
            <li>have tried many groomers in the past.</li>
            <li>I miss the old (2)C Battery trimmer I had from Sharper Image ...</li>
            <li>Essentially, the product works, i.e., the main unit and two of three attachments - nose and eyebrow trimmers.  </li>
            <li>Following the instructions I left the unit charging all night before its first use, but to no avail.</li>
            <li>for the low cost of purchase I would recommend this trimmer highly</li>
            <li>Whereas the Panasonic unit mentioned above is pure junk, the Wahl trimmer is designed to last and comes with a 5 year warranty.</li>
            <li>I wish there were more attachments for hard to reach places like the back and attachments that would give a tighter shave when required.  </li>
            <li>Put it back together, flip the switch back up, and it is ready to go again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>major selling point is the power cord and rechargeable battery.  </li>
            <li>It has all the necessary attachments for complete grooming.</li>
            <li>This product is junk, apparently without any quality control.</li>
            <li>Good for doing those dirty jobs no one likes to do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little loud when using the ear trimmer attachment (since you have to put it right next to your ear canal)</li>
            <li>When I say lightly, I mean lightly.  </li>
            <li>It is hard to get excited by an electric nose hair remover, but it will keep the bush out of your nose.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several brands that hurt or we&#x27;re hard to charge or cheaply made.</li>
            <li>... if you read this, I&#x27;d be willing to pay an extra $10 for a slightly stronger case</li>
            <li>Keeps charge well, the round ear/nose attachment fell apart after first use.  </li>
            <li>it is a very well design shaver, very sharp cut and the battery</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This product works just fine for trimming around eyebrows and ears.  </li>
            <li> Since I didn&#x27;t need any of those items, it worked out fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quick and efficient !</li>
            <li> I found that this set was a very good value for the money spent.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, charge, and clean and has not hurt to use.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clip well and the parts are cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> so I was happy finally ...</li>
            <li> but the cheap plastic guard broke after 3 or 4 uses ...</li>
            <li> worth the couple dollars more that it may cost.  </li>
            <li> I was trying to clean it by lightly tapping it on the sink.  </li>
            <li> to clean and maintain</li>
            <li> to clean and maintain</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t operate at full speed when plugged in either.</li>
            <li> I try to finish as quickly as I can to avoid hearing loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They quickly repaired a failedion battery.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> Its does the job right and is super reliable.</li>
            <li> Like the rechargeable feature with a powerful motor.  </li>
            <li> not anymore powerful than one you can get at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> I paid more than I wanted, but expected a better quality product.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Extremely powerful motor&lt;br /&gt;Trims</li>
            <li> but the performance of this little guys is very nice.  </li>
            <li> All the right attachments at the right price....</li>
            <li> It is very strong and trims the hair to a short length.</li>
            <li> When you get it, take off the existing round attachment and put on securely your own.</li>
            <li> I have gone through a number of different brands but this one seems to be more powerful.</li>
            <li> I would say the only downside is not having a power gauge, I can use for a full month and its still going strong.</li>
            <li> The battery is stronger and more resilient than a standard AA battery.  </li>
            <li> Seems to keep its charge pretty well for a number of days.  </li>
            <li> I get the same value or better with the cheep models.</li>
            <li> Deluxe Groomer Rechargeable Ear, Nose and Eyebrow Trimmer, Chrome]]I spent over $26.00 for 3 months use.</li>
            <li> This is a very practical and useful product.  </li>
            <li> Sharp blades are very important, right?</li>
            <li> The first time my husband used it he was amazed how simple and clean of a job it did.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned many battery powered trimmers they work well with a new battery but quickly wear down.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he really likes it.  </li>
            <li> so he uses one of the quieter attachments for that (which still works very well).  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> IT IS SO MUCH EASIER TO USE</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull the hair and cuts very close to the skin (without breaking skin)</li>
            <li> and the whole package compliments my Wahl hair clippers.</li>
            <li> Would return but too much hassle.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is comfortable to hold, the battery seems to last forever</li>
            <li> It costs a few dollars more but its worth it.</li>
            <li> I would pay more if  it was built with other &amp;#34;electronics?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Easier to clean and built to last.</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy a decent groomer.</li>
            <li> The quality of the product is not as high as I would expect from the Wahl name, though; the ear trimmer broke while I was trying to get it out of the plastic moulded tray in which it was packaged.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little persistency for nose and ear hairs, but it works ... and works safely.  </li>
            <li> It does what it says it&#x27;s going to and works really well so far.  </li>
            <li> I can still get a good trim by switching to another tool, but having to do that is irritating.</li>
            <li> Does a very professional job.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t indicate with a light there charge and the attachments are not worth using.</li>
            <li> have tried many groomers in the past.</li>
            <li> I miss the old (2)C Battery trimmer I had from Sharper Image ...</li>
            <li> Essentially, the product works, i.e., the main unit and two of three attachments - nose and eyebrow trimmers.  </li>
            <li> Following the instructions I left the unit charging all night before its first use, but to no avail.</li>
            <li> for the low cost of purchase I would recommend this trimmer highly</li>
            <li> Whereas the Panasonic unit mentioned above is pure junk, the Wahl trimmer is designed to last and comes with a 5 year warranty.</li>
            <li> I wish there were more attachments for hard to reach places like the back and attachments that would give a tighter shave when required.  </li>
            <li> Put it back together, flip the switch back up, and it is ready to go again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> major selling point is the power cord and rechargeable battery.  </li>
            <li> It has all the necessary attachments for complete grooming.</li>
            <li> This product is junk, apparently without any quality control.</li>
            <li> Good for doing those dirty jobs no one likes to do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little loud when using the ear trimmer attachment (since you have to put it right next to your ear canal)</li>
            <li> When I say lightly, I mean lightly.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to get excited by an electric nose hair remover, but it will keep the bush out of your nose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several brands that hurt or we&#x27;re hard to charge or cheaply made.</li>
            <li> ... if you read this, I&#x27;d be willing to pay an extra $10 for a slightly stronger case</li>
            <li> Keeps charge well, the round ear/nose attachment fell apart after first use.  </li>
            <li> it is a very well design shaver, very sharp cut and the battery</li>
            <li> It will trim hard right to the last drop of juice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, the blades are far from sharp.</li>
            <li> last a very long time.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s more expensive than other trimmers, the fact that you won&#x27;t need to continually change batteries will make up for the additional cost.</li>
            <li> I can only say that the long, flat trimmer head has a little switch that allows you to open it for proper cleaning.  </li>
            <li> only negative thing I can say (and it&#x27;s not enough to lower my rating) is that when I&#x27;m trimming my ear hair (yuck!), this unit is quite loud.  </li>
            <li> I needed a helpful gift that was reliable and will work for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Sassoon for a long time and kinda figured it about to go Would &amp;#34;not&amp;#34; recommend the Wahl.</li>
            <li> We will see how long the blades cut and don&#x27;t pull out the hair?</li>
            <li> After a few months of infrequent use, one of the attachments completely fell apart in my hands.  </li>
            <li> This product actually worked to groom in the way that I expected.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, the Panasonic was a complete waste of money and I would classify it as a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> but work not complain at all maybe other product next time</li>
            <li> It is difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> The motor is at least twice as powerful as on any other trimmer that I&#x27;ve previously used.</li>
            <li> He has not used another product like this before and we&#x27;ve only owned it for a little while, so I cannot speak to durability as of yet.  </li>
            <li> It is much easier to use than a regular electric razor in these difficult areas.</li>
            <li> because you can still see noticeable hair stubble even after repeated, careful passes.  </li>
            <li> Not very powerful at all.</li>
            <li> The motor is so weak that it requires the use of a new battery every time you use the trimmer.</li>
            <li> The Wahl nose hair trimmer, trims as well as any other circular style trimmer I have</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t belabor the points already raised in other reviews, so I will just say this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I should have listened to one of the other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> AND ALSO IT HOLDS A CHARGE LONGER THAN ANY OTHER</li>
            <li> It is also rechargeable, which cuts down battery usage.</li>
            <li> Used less than 10 times and nose trimmer doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> This product lasted less than 3 months and now it does not do</li>
            <li> THAT i HAVE PREVIOUSLY OWNED.</li>
            <li> Works well with little to difficulty and saves money on the shop trims.</li>
            <li> Instructions leave a little to be desired.</li>
            <li> Grat little gadget.</li>
            <li> After just a few uses, the battery won&#x27;t hold a charge.</li>
            <li> But after a few months of use I havent had a problem.</li>
            <li> As a result, it takes just a few minutes to trim unwanted nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li> With previous trimmers I would go through a pack of batteries every few months, and the trimmer would just slowly die on me.  </li>
            <li> All the nose trimmers that I have tried with a single AA battery are too weak ...</li>
            <li> It seems strange that they would design that attachment so poorly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly not as precise as my old one, but it also means not having to worry about it cutting or jabbing you.</li>
            <li> but because of how small they (the pieces) are, I was unable to put it back together.</li>
            <li> He has never purchased one before so we were not sure what to look for while purchasing</li>
            <li> After researching trimmers online and having used cheaper ones in the past, I decided to try this Wahl trimmer . . .</li>
            <li> but the Blades have become dull.</li>
            <li> This product sucks doesn&#x27;t trim ear or nose hair</li>
            <li> has seriously damaged it&#x27;s reputation with me.</li>
            <li> My disappointment is that it doesn&#x27;t trim as closely as I expected.</li>
            <li> Too mad to try the other attachments.  </li>
            <li> Extremely poor quality.  </li>
            <li> They stand behind their products.  </li>
            <li> works as advertised can&#x27;t go wrong with this</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:  I tried the eyebrow trimmer attachment since the nose trimmer is useless ...</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry you did!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> Bad battery capacity.</li>
            <li> Piece of crap.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The Wahl nose hair trimmer, trims as well as any other circular style trimmer I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major selling point is the power cord and rechargeable battery.  The battery is stronger and more resilient than a standard AA battery.  With previous trimmers I would go through a pack of batteries every few months, and the trimmer would just slowly die on me.  This is a non issue with the Wahl.  It will trim hard right to the last drop of juice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5 this is how ANY electric powered trimmer or shaver should be designed.</li>
            <li> Extremely poor quality.  Used less than 10 times and nose trimmer doesn&#x27;t work.  Internal gear turns but won&#x27;t engage with blade mechanism.  Stay away.</li>
            <li> This is very easy to use and helps me trim my husband&#x27;s neck and ear hair and eyebrows like nothing else has.</li>
            <li> does the job, but no stand for it, product would be better if it came with a stand to keep on the counter</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t belabor the points already raised in other reviews, so I will just say this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trims amazingly well, with very nice attachments.&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable to hold at nearly any angle.&lt;br /&gt;Trims all kinds of hair (eyebrows, ear hair, nose hair, back of neck hair) perfectly, but it is *not* a razor; use a razor if you want that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen some reviews where people say one of the attachments falls apart, and they can&#x27;t get it back together.  I cannot speak to this, as it has not happened to me.  I can only say that the long, flat trimmer head has a little switch that allows you to open it for proper cleaning.  Put it back together, flip the switch back up, and it is ready to go again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing I can say (and it&#x27;s not enough to lower my rating) is that when I&#x27;m trimming my ear hair (yuck!), this unit is quite loud.  I try to finish as quickly as I can to avoid hearing loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, that&#x27;s all I have to say on this trimmer, aside from: buy it!  You won&#x27;t be sorry you did!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he really likes it.  It does what it says it&#x27;s going to and works really well so far.  It&#x27;s a little loud when using the ear trimmer attachment (since you have to put it right next to your ear canal) so he uses one of the quieter attachments for that (which still works very well).  Overall, the product seems to be of the quality you would expect from the Wahl brand.  He has not used another product like this before and we&#x27;ve only owned it for a little while, so I cannot speak to durability as of yet.  I will update this if we have any issues.</li>
            <li> It is a good quality item for the price.  Like the rechargeable feature with a powerful motor.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does not trim hair close enough - so there is always hair that shows even after a trim.  I would not recommend this trimmer to others.</li>
            <li> Nice and sturdy. Great not having to replace batteries. Does a nice the job. I am quite happy with my purchase. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great sturdy item and I love the fact that it recharges.  I wish there were more attachments for hard to reach places like the back and attachments that would give a tighter shave when required.  Still, a great item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several brands that hurt or we&#x27;re hard to charge or cheaply made. They all went into the can.  This is a great product!!!  Easy to use, charge, and clean and has not hurt to use.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, it is THE BEST on the market!!!</li>
            <li> the perfect and portable trimmer and a name you have heard of at a great price they work great... highly recommend</li>
            <li> This product works as advertised. It is hard to get excited by an electric nose hair remover, but it will keep the bush out of your nose. So what else can you ask for............</li>
            <li> This set has everything you need to get those gross hairs outta all those places we do not desire to see. Whether guy or girl... Can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> Seems to keep its charge pretty well for a number of days.  It&#x27;s certainly not as precise as my old one, but it also means not having to worry about it cutting or jabbing you.</li>
            <li> Good product which does what it is supposed to do. It is also rechargeable, which cuts down battery usage. Good job Wahl.</li>
            <li> This product sucks doesn&#x27;t trim ear or nose hair they don&#x27;t indicate with a light there charge and the attachments are not worth using.</li>
            <li> I have been using this item for a while. Mostly I am pleased, but the unit clogs easily and must be cleaned often.</li>
            <li> The eyebrow cutter didn&#x27;t cut. The ear trimmer worked, but not well.  I get the same value or better with the cheep models.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to one of the other reviewers.  The attachment for clipping nose hairs simply does not trim close enough.  It seems strange that they would design that attachment so poorly.  I can still get a good trim by switching to another tool, but having to do that is irritating.</li>
            <li> Not very powerful at all. Doesn&#x27;t clip well and the parts are cheap plastic. Bought it as a gift. How humiliating.</li>
            <li> Works just as advertised. Got it for my husband, he&#x27;s very happy with it. It does not pull the hair in his nose or ears and is easy to use for him.</li>
            <li> weel and funsional but dosent work very  perfect dosent cut very well ass i espected.... but work not complain at all maybe other product next time</li>
            <li> Black/silver]][[ASIN:B003XU8AMY Wahl 9865-300 Deluxe Groomer Rechargeable Ear, Nose and Eyebrow Trimmer, Chrome]]&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many groomers in the past. I found that this set was a very good value for the money spent. It does everything I needed it to. Being rechargeable was an even greater deal.</li>
            <li> This product lasted less than 3 months and now it does not do anything.[[ASIN:B003XU8AMY Wahl 9865-300 Deluxe Groomer Rechargeable Ear, Nose and Eyebrow Trimmer, Chrome]]I spent over $26.00 for 3 months use.</li>
            <li> works like it should and love the fact it&#x27;s rechargeable, and the charge lasts a good while, also more powerful than battery operated models</li>
            <li> works as advertised can&#x27;t go wrong with this I would recommend this to a friend this is the best one I&#x27;ve owned</li>
            <li> Very good product, runs fast, charges quick and cuts close.  It is what I expected when I wanted to replace the old trimmer.</li>
            <li> He keeps it charged up and uses it often.  It&#x27;s a great grooming tool for him and myself for unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> It doesnt remove enough hair with the nose hair tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its not anymore powerful than one you can get at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive but gets the job done - I don&#x27;t regret this purchase at all.  Read all the reviews before buying.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much. I needed a helpful gift that was reliable and will work for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;My husband couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product. Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> Even with the attachments, this trimmer does not get nose or ear hairs. My $6.99 battery operated one works better.</li>
            <li> Its does the job right and is super reliable. for the low cost of purchase I would recommend this trimmer highly</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy a decent groomer. I thought this was it. I paid more than I wanted, but expected a better quality product. I&#x27;m causious not to over charge my devices. After just a few uses, the battery won&#x27;t hold a charge. Won&#x27;t operate at full speed when plugged in either. I should have followed my instincts and bought on with AA bateries.</li>
            <li> This is a very practical and useful product.  It is difficult to clean. It is rechargeable, which is a great advantage.</li>
            <li> Excellent for the price. Comes with a LOT of attachments. When you get it, take off the existing round attachment and put on securely your own.</li>
            <li> Essentially, the product works, i.e., the main unit and two of three attachments - nose and eyebrow trimmers.  The quality of the product is not as high as I would expect from the Wahl name, though; the ear trimmer broke while I was trying to get it out of the plastic moulded tray in which it was packaged.  I would recomment this product to anyone who does not expressly need or want the ear trimmer, and who is okay with just having the nose and eyebrow trimmers.</li>
            <li> The problem with these products, in my experience, is they have a short shelf life - they just aren&#x27;t quality enough to last.&lt;br /&gt;Does it do the job yes. I have ordered 3-4 before in the last 5 years? Yes. I would pay more if  it was built with other &amp;#34;electronics?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Works great!  Worth the money.  Complements the rechargeable Wahl hair, beard and mustache trimmer. They stand behind their products.  They quickly repaired a failedion battery.</li>
            <li> it is a very well design shaver, very sharp cut and the battery last a very long time. I love it.</li>
            <li> It takes a little persistency for nose and ear hairs, but it works ... and works safely.  I like it.</li>
            <li> Battery life doesn&#x27;t last when not in use but I can deal with that. It has good power and attachments. No complaints here.</li>
            <li> All the right attachments at the right price....just what my husband was looking for!thanks for the recharbable deluxe groomer by wahl</li>
            <li> Keeps you in trim without unforseen disasters.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS IT IS SO MUCH EASIER TO USE AND ALSO IT HOLDS A CHARGE LONGER THAN ANY OTHER THAT i HAVE PREVIOUSLY OWNED. bUY IY YOU&#x27;LL LIKE IT. wAHL NEED i SAY MORE?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for just over a year.  It was ok for that time period.  Tonight, it literally fell apart!  I was trying to clean it by lightly tapping it on the sink.  When I say lightly, I mean lightly.  This &amp;#34;groomer&amp;#34; broke literally into five pieces.  I tried to put the pieces back together but because of how small they (the pieces) are, I was unable to put it back together. The return policy only lasts for a month or two.  My &amp;#34;groomer&amp;#34; is trash so do yourself a favor and buy something else.</li>
            <li> I received the item on time and it was exceptionally packed. However, the blades are far from sharp. Sharp blades are very important, right?</li>
            <li> It costs a few dollars more but its worth it. I have gone through a number of different brands but this one seems to be more powerful. Easier to clean and built to last.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my hubby. He has never purchased one before so we were not sure what to look for while purchasing but he has never complained about it and says it works good.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it.  Great product. Works well with little to difficulty and saves money on the shop trims.</li>
            <li> Look guys, this is only $25, don&#x27;t expect chrome or heart-of-pearl handle.  It&#x27;s plastic handle but the performance of this little guys is very nice.  The heads TWIST off and are very easy to interchange.  I&#x27;ve only had for about 2 weeks but trimming ear hair and nose hair is nice.  It doesn&#x27;t pull the hair and cuts very close to the skin (without breaking skin) so I don&#x27;t have to trim as often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wahl ... if you read this, I&#x27;d be willing to pay an extra $10 for a slightly stronger case cuz if you abuse this thing, I have no doubt it&#x27;ll break, otherwise, you got a nice package.</li>
            <li> Good for doing those dirty jobs no one likes to do. Much better than others I have tried.&lt;br /&gt; Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> This product works just fine for trimming around eyebrows and ears.  It is much easier to use than a regular electric razor in these difficult areas.</li>
            <li> I had a Remington for several years before it gave up the ghost. Their replacement version does not hold a candle to the Wahl groomer. I&#x27;ll never have a battery-powered, non-rechargeable again. The tools with this model work well and the whole package compliments my Wahl hair clippers.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect groomer. It has all the necessary attachments for complete grooming.I would recommend this product to anyone with grooming needs.</li>
            <li> Instructions leave a little to be desired. However once you figure it out it works just as advertised, and I am happy.</li>
            <li> This has turned out to be one of my favorite purchases.  Great product.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Bad battery capacity. Flimsy attachments.</li>
            <li> A head that would trim eyebrows or something fell apart while i was taking it out of the packaging. There were electronic parts so i repackaged and shipped back.  Am going to try a Panasonic this time.</li>
            <li> Nice unit but, does not cut well at all! I&#x27;ve had a Sassoon for a long time and kinda figured it about to go Would &amp;#34;not&amp;#34; recommend the Wahl.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use. It does a great job trimming nose and ear hairs. If you want a great trimmer buy this one.</li>
            <li> Despite purchasing the appropriate UK to Aus power adapter this unit simply will not charge. Following the instructions I left the unit charging all night before its first use, but to no avail.</li>
            <li> Keeps charge well, the round ear/nose attachment fell apart after first use.  The Groomer is really good on neck and beard trimming with controlled even cut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned many battery powered trimmers they work well with a new battery but quickly wear down. This trimmer has lots of power and does an excellent job. Quick and efficient !</li>
            <li> The nose trimmer does not get close enough, bottom line.  I miss the old (2)C Battery trimmer I had from Sharper Image ... but they don&#x27;t make it anymore.  All the nose trimmers that I have tried with a single AA battery are too weak ... this one has plenty of power but that doesn&#x27;t matter ... because you can still see noticeable hair stubble even after repeated, careful passes.  Piece of crap.  Too mad to try the other attachments.  Would return but too much hassle.  Ughh !  Anyone know of a GOOD nose trimmer ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I tried the eyebrow trimmer attachment since the nose trimmer is useless ... worked great, so I was happy finally ... but the cheap plastic guard broke after 3 or 4 uses ... so now it is total garbage and I just tossed it out ... DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> I love it. Inexpensive but good.</li>
            <li> I have used Wahl products for years. This product is junk, apparently without any quality control. It looks well made, but will not hold a charge for more than two minutes. Even plugged in two minutes is the max usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wahl has seriously damaged it&#x27;s reputation with me.</li>
            <li> I bought the trimmer mainly for nose hair and it works great. It is very strong and trims the hair to a short length. It was a bonus for the eyebrow trimmer, I read from the reviews that it breaks easy. But after a few months of use I havent had a problem. Everything is still working great. I would say the only downside is not having a power gauge, I can use for a full month and its still going strong. I will plug it in for some charge just in case it was getting low, but like I said you just dont know. All in all, I love it. The bag it came with is nice to use to keep it all together and safe.</li>
            <li> I have a Norelco Trimmer that also has a charger but the Blades have become dull. So far this Wahl unit is great!  We will see how long the blades cut and don&#x27;t pull out the hair?</li>
            <li> After a few months of infrequent use, one of the attachments completely fell apart in my hands.  There are no instructions on how to put it back together and it was the most important attachment.</li>
            <li> This product actually worked to groom in the way that I expected. Grat little gadget. Yes. Yes.Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.</li>
            <li> very good goods, all ok! 5 star and more:-)&lt;br /&gt;please buy everybody this product. worked super and many time, buy!</li>
            <li> Nose trimmer attachment doesn&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li> multifunctional attachments.. nose hair clipper..eyebrow and ear clipper, sideburns trimmer. Rechargeable last months.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the price. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing this trimmer, I bought the Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/Dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer based on the fact that it had the highest rated reviews on Amazon. In my opinion, the Panasonic was a complete waste of money and I would classify it as a piece of junk. The motor is so weak that it requires the use of a new battery every time you use the trimmer. I threw mine in the garbage last week and purchased this one from Wahl. I did an Internet search for the best nose hair trimmer and it directed me to Hammacher Schlemmer&#x27;s website, where I purchased mine. Hammacher Schlemmer doesn&#x27;t tell you what brand you&#x27;re buying, thus the reason why I didn&#x27;t get it on Amazon. The only difference between the one listed here and the one that I got, is that mine came with only one eyebrow guide and did not include a tweezers, nail clippers, scissors and storage pouch. Since I didn&#x27;t need any of those items, it worked out fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is especially impressive about the Wahl trimmer is that it&#x27;s rechargeable. While it&#x27;s more expensive than other trimmers, the fact that you won&#x27;t need to continually change batteries will make up for the additional cost. The motor is at least twice as powerful as on any other trimmer that I&#x27;ve previously used. As a result, it takes just a few minutes to trim unwanted nose and ear hair. It also works flawlessly at trimming eyebrow hair and the included attachable guide ensures that it will do so perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that this trimmer is superior to anything else that I&#x27;ve ever used. It does a great job at removing nose and ear hair, and does so effortlessly. The eyebrow trimmer is an added bonus. Whereas the Panasonic unit mentioned above is pure junk, the Wahl trimmer is designed to last and comes with a 5 year warranty. I would definitely rate this at 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Rechargeable batteries with up to 3 months of use on one charge&lt;br /&gt;Extremely powerful motor&lt;br /&gt;Trims hair effortlessly &amp; precisely&lt;br /&gt;Comes with reciprocating and rotary heads&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean and maintain&lt;br /&gt;5 year warrany&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Noneessly &amp; precisely&lt;br /&gt;Comes with reciprocating and rotary heads&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean and maintain&lt;br /&gt;5 year warrany&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None</li>
            <li> After researching trimmers online and having used cheaper ones in the past, I decided to try this Wahl trimmer . . . a great decision!  The unit feels solid &amp; appears to be well-made . . . worth the couple dollars more that it may cost.  I&#x27;m 64 and this works great on ear &amp; nose hair, as well as on eyebrows.  Does a very professional job.</li>
            <li> Time it holds charge is excellent.  Nose hair trimmer is the best I&#x27;ve ever experienced.  Shape fits my hand well.</li>
            <li> The first time my husband used it he was amazed how simple and clean of a job it did.  It didn&#x27;t even pull any hairs..</li>
            <li> This trimmer is comfortable to hold, the battery seems to last forever and it comes with some nice attachments.  My disappointment is that it doesn&#x27;t trim as closely as I expected.</li>
            <li> great product for sharing for variety of needs. I love Wahl products in general and was happy to find this company with Amazon.</li>
            <li> my experience was very good, everything is perfect with this seller and this product, i recommended it, it is really good</li>
