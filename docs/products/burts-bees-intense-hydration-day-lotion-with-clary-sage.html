            <li>it is good ,i love it</li>
            <li>Gets kind of &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; when I add my foundation.</li>
            <li>The smell is alright; I can see some people loving it and some people hating it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and doesn&#x27;t feel cakey...</li>
            <li>Face lotion is nice.</li>
            <li>which is a nice change</li>
            <li>My new best friend for winter is this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say more great things about this product!</li>
            <li>I find that if I warm it up in my hands before applying it glides on better.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and smooth because of this!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>It absorbs into my skin nicely and feels very nature and is great under makeup.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super moisturizing and in my opinion is good for people with any skin type.    </li>
            <li>It smells great, but that is about all I can say positively about it.</li>
            <li>I noticed a significant difference in my skin, it looks very healthy.</li>
            <li>Great product for dry skin, great seller</li>
            <li>Moisturizes beautifully and smells clean and fresh...</li>
            <li>Very good, natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love how it feels.</li>

            <li>girls in the house love it.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li>Love Burts products and</li>
            <li>Love this cream, it locks moisture for hours.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>

            <li>I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>this is  magical.</li>
            <li>My face sweats a lot and this moisturizer makes me sweat even more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a cream than a lotion, probably at the highest viscosity limit while still being able to work in a pump.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it would be okay in the summer.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try something more on the natural/organic side as well.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>In fact I think my skin even looks better, it feels moisturized.</li>
            <li>Definitely will buy more when I finish this bottle!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s silky and has a lovely scent.</li>
            <li>Fantastic quality!</li>
            <li>Love the feel of Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Day Lotion.</li>
            <li>Really LOVE knowing there are no parabens.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>Will never buy in stores again when Amazon always has the lowest price for sure.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought this cream.</li>
            <li>/&gt;LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>Love Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again usually love their stuff but at $16.00 for 1.8 oz</li>
            <li>Nothing worked better than Burts Bees.</li>
            <li>This is a much cheaper alternative and moisturizes GREAT.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>What more can someone ask for?</li>
            <li>Love love love...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it every day for about a month and so far so good!</li>
            <li>Feels great, makes my skin look smooth, non-greasy, and non-comedogenic means I don&#x27;t break out no matter how much I use!</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin very smooth and soft, it does not get tacky at all and the scent is so fresh and wonderful</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m super pleased!</li>
            <li>I have good skin, but as I get older, I want more hydrating products.  </li>
            <li>Just used it for the first time, and I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>great for my 40 yr old skin</li>
            <li>Burts Bees is a great product for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>And you can forget about wearing any kind of face makeup like foundation or concealer - it slides right off with this product.</li>
            <li>It was too strong for my taste and irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li>Smells strongly of sage; doesn&#x27;t bother me but could be an issue if you don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li>At first, I was cautious because every kind of cream makes me break out.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product, it was one of my first products with Burt Bees</li>
            <li>Makes a great gift for anyone interested in pure products.</li>
            <li>This is light (like a mouse) and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>I finally found a great day cream with no spf for just hanging inside.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy how this works on my face</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks, my skin is smooth and stays hydrated even on the days I don&#x27;t use the lotion.</li>
            <li>and it isnt oil free.</li>
            <li>At $11 and free shipping?</li>
            <li>and you know it is cruelty free.</li>
            <li>I never realized how moisturized skin was so important to its health and preventing acne.</li>
            <li>This is much thicker than most day face creams and it feels lovely on my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin type really need hydration products, but i have net yet found a really impressed one until this....</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t help my skin much, until I decided to buy this product, and it is definitely the best!</li>
            <li>It was good but we&#x27;ll keep with the old ones.</li>
            <li>cream goes on really easily and has a nice, light natural smell.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it smoothes onto my skin but is absorbed quickly to make applying makeup easier.</li>
            <li>Love this line of intense hydration!</li>
            <li>I have been trying to get my face to like coconut oil; but I&#x27;m pretty sure its never going to</li>
            <li>So the $18 is well worth it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to recommend to every one need it, worth buying!</li>
            <li>Its worth a try!</li>
            <li>Works great on dry winter skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great product if you have dry skin and aren&#x27;t prone to breakouts, but if you periodically have breakouts you should stay away from this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to find a moisturizer that feels like it actually gets worked into the skin instead of just being smeared on top.  </li>
            <li>I gave a bottle to my mother because she has really dry skin on her face, and she&#x27;s seen a great deal of improvement.</li>
            <li>This works great on my very dry skin.</li>
            <li>However I really started needing a moisturizer in the winter months, and this really did the trick, and is very light and refreshing.</li>
            <li>It smelled like a sweet section of my spice rack.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion so much, I purchased the night cream and the face wash as well.</li>
            <li>I do not know if any of these &amp;#34;age defying&amp;#34; creams actually do any good.</li>
            <li>light and fresh.</li>
            <li>My favorite face cream - very moisturizing but never greasy.</li>
            <li>I use these 2 products almost every day and my skin has probably never looked this good since middle school.</li>
            <li>It worked well, but it just wasn&#x27;t  the right fit for me.</li>
            <li>Do not e tempted,even if you have very dry skin, to load up as the lotion seems to be more effective used sparingly each day</li>
            <li>fresh and clean</li>
            <li>mild scent.</li>
            <li>Super moisturizing.</li>
            <li>skin needs hydration, but though this IS a good moisturizer, the fragrance is a bit much &amp; might irritate sensitive skin if you get over heated.</li>
            <li>I had mild acne and this lotion has made it all go away.</li>
            <li>absorbs really well, skin feels good after, natural</li>
            <li>Smells great and keeps skin hydrated all day - despite hot air, dry heat in office.  </li>
            <li>Firstly, let me say that I got this product free from BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With amazon&#x27;s fast delivery I am enjoying this lotion very much.</li>
            <li>My new favorite face lotion.</li>
            <li>Bought full size right away to use under foundation.  </li>
            <li>I am happy to get something that works for me for less than $20.</li>
            <li>I did not expect it to feel this good and most importantly no residue!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna have to find another moisturizer for summers in the hot Florida sun!</li>
            <li>It goes on easy with the great little dispenser and really works well.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this has been good for me so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it though.</li>
            <li>and I love how soft my skin is</li>
            <li>The peeling has gone away, my skin is much more clear, and didn&#x27;t have one break out when I was on my trip.</li>
            <li>Love the product It goes on so smoothly and instantly hydrates.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced, nice soft scent, no irritation or breakouts.  </li>
            <li>Fun, right?</li>
            <li>Very satisfied, I have dry skin</li>
            <li>It absorbs pretty quickly too</li>
            <li>but this product calms it and just give the right amount of moisturizer it needs for day time.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s great for dry, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Great for sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li>Great for dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I like a more rich and emollient texture, as my skin has always been dry.</li>
            <li>I decided to use the more expensive serums and a natural more affordable cream over the top of that and I am SO glad I did.</li>
            <li>I am a true fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees products and am becoming especially fond of the &amp;#34;Intense Hydration&amp;#34; line of products</li>
            <li>While I could see some finding it a bit too greasy, I have very dry skin and liked the heft of the product.</li>
            <li>Very soothing on the skin!  </li>
            <li>This is a preferred product for my skin during colder season than summer when it&#x27;s hot.</li>
            <li>I paired this with the face wash of the same brand and my skin has never felt better.</li>
            <li>and this is the first lotion that hasn&#x27;t been too costly that works.</li>
            <li>My first order of this lotion was lost.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the first moisturizers that has not made me break out.</li>
            <li>It goes on velvety smooth and soaks in completely.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s best if I don&#x27;t use it every day, but every other day, otherwise my skin will get a little too shiny.</li>
            <li>And as an additional bonus, after shower, if I run my hand through my hair afterwards instead of washing it, it becomes super soft!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and will continue to use it for a long time.</li>
            <li>Go easy at first, because it&#x27;s really potent and a bit on the thick side.</li>
            <li>This is a nice daily face lotion that holds in moisture and keeps your skin feeling smooth and soft for the entire day.</li>
            <li>I have chronically dry skin on my face, but it&#x27;s been so much better after just two weeks of this.</li>
            <li>and so many of the dry lines around my eyes have improved.  </li>
            <li>I have dealt with dry skin for a couple of years and have struggled to find a product that truly hydrates my skin and not just layer grease on top.</li>
            <li>But this is a minor complaint in an otherwise excellent product.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft for the whole day.  </li>
            <li>Right after purchasing this, I went to New Orleans for work for two weeks, and was well prepared for another skin disaster.</li>
            <li>I switched to a gentle cleanser and used an oil free lotion several times a day</li>
            <li>Light moisturizer, absorbs well, only need one pump for whole face.</li>
            <li>Thanks much.</li>
            <li>i have normal/oily skin and use this daily; it goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t break out my skin;  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to &amp;#34;absorb&amp;#34; very well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very herb-y.</li>
            <li>Really like this lotion.</li>
            <li>So, I tried this Intense Hydration day lotion.</li>
            <li>I really wish burt&#x27;s bees made this with sun protection.</li>
            <li>BURT&#x27;S BEES® INTENSE HYDRATION Day Cream was a letdown because it did not have any SPF.  </li>
            <li>It was light enough for day and had the texture of a lotion.  </li>
            <li>I give BURT&#x27;S BEES® INTENSE HYDRATION Day Cream two stars.</li>
            <li>In fact, it&#x27;s almost too much moisture for summertime.</li>
            <li>My baby lotion did absolutely nothing for my skin anymore</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 24 now and eating junk food and fast food all the time still doesn&#x27;t give me acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i have found that it moisturizes very well</li>
            <li>and it lasted me the whole day.</li>
            <li>and I really do trust the brand.</li>
            <li>My skin ends up flaking if I use it for 2 days straight.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it keeps my face moist and dewey but the only downside is the lack of spf that they old radiance lotion had.  </li>
            <li>I put it on at night after I wash my face and it feels so much better the next day even on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I changed to the Burt&#x27;s Bee product line and whilst I liked it, I did have a few pimples arise</li>
            <li>: Soaks right in and leaves skin soft and vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it also doesn&#x27;t cause my face to get bright red like some other lotions.</li>
            <li>My only complaint about the day cream is not having SPF, but it is easy for me to add one right on top.</li>
            <li>my skin still looks great; even if I take a nap, my skin looks soft and surprisingly not shiny when I wake up.</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty clear but has some T-Zone dryness.</li>
            <li>After a full day of use (morning and night) the flakiness was finally gone!</li>
            <li>I checked the ingredients and they were all pretty natural and harmless</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched high and low to find a moisturizer that wasn&#x27;t full of toxins and crapola</li>
            <li>Unlike most moisturizers, I don&#x27;t have to worry about looking in the mirror half way through the day and seeing flakes or scaling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently finishing a jar of Golden Sun Drop night cream, but planning to try the Intense Hydration night cream after.</li>
            <li>When I wash my face at night my skin is still very soft thanks to this day lotion.</li>
            <li>I am also so sensitive to fragrances and this is very faint but still very clean smelling and pleasant.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this with high expectations</li>
            <li>My skin became soft and stayed hydrated for hours without being sticky, I was not only amazed but extremely happy to have finally found the right product for my skin type, so I would definitely recommend this cream to people who are suffering from dry skin.</li>
            <li>Either they had way to much sunscreen ( I live in New York</li>
            <li>a little too oily for my skin, even more thicker than cream</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several products to help, including clean and clear moisturizer, olay, and aveeno.</li>
            <li>I have super dry skin and need intense hydration.</li>
            <li>I have always had a tough time finding a good moisturizer for my combination dry/oily skin until I received a sample of this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually write reviews due to my schedule, but OMG, I love their Intense Hydration line!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this as my everyday lotion for years and love it.</li>
            <li>and I normally don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I just bought my second bottle, which I rarely do.  </li>
            <li>I wake up with really healthy feeling/looking skin, not a piece of dried skin in sight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read such great reviews on this product, but it was just far too thick and greasy for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one to pay a million dollars for an ounce of some product people swear you need when other stuff will do the job just fine.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees is definitely a heavier formulation but a single application in the morning is keeping my skin looking normal for more than a day</li>
            <li>I had extremely dry and flaky skin for a long time and couldn&#x27;t find anything suitable at the drugstore or high-ends.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had issues with dry spots on my forehead and nose for the last year or more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used skin care products in my life (excluding shaving cream) but a new medication I&#x27;m required to take seems to have turned my face shaving area into sandpaper.</li>
            <li>I am 43 and  live in the northeast.  </li>
            <li>I had the same result using Yes to Cucumbers which was available locally.</li>
            <li>I live in a very hot dry climate &amp; my 50+</li>
            <li>I fell in love after the first application - my skin didn&#x27;t look greasy but also no longer felt tight and dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always steered clear of any and all face lotions because they normally make me break out with a rash or are just way too oily.</li>
            <li>I have incredibly sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I put this lotion on my hands and by morning they feel as soft as a babies bottom!</li>
            <li>Let me just say was I surprised!</li>
            <li>Non greasy, soaks in and ACTUALLY works - takes the little flakes right off, leaves skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>it sinks in fairly quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or tacky.</li>
            <li>oily.&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the clary sage is a bit odd and not really a scent I care for, to be honest.</li>
            <li>I reached a point with my skin where it was super dry and red and pretty raw around my mouth, so I bought this natural super hydrating moisterizer in hopes it would work.</li>
            <li>And I only need to use a little and it can apply to my whole face!!!!</li>
            <li>You need only a pea size amount for your whole face.</li>
            <li>keeps my face soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive and acne prone skin</li>
            <li>I am 38 years old and have never moisturized my face before.  </li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive to begin with</li>
            <li>This cream makes my face so soft.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft but not greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an acne sufferer who is on medication to treat it that leaves me with sensitive, oily, flaky skin.</li>
            <li>A tiny amount will do my whole face.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve started using this before my powder foundation for my work makeup routine and it makes my skin look so natural and soft throughout the day.</li>
            <li>so if you are sensitive to fragrance, you might want to think twice.</li>
            <li>I have mature skin and this product is loaded with hydration without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>I like this, but not as much as the night moisturizer from the same line.</li>
            <li>and I think it is well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>I do wear it at night more so than during day though because it is so thick t</li>
            <li>I had some pretty dry skin for awhile before I started using this lotion.</li>
            <li>Within a week, my skin was already feeling better and I was having less problems with dry skin.</li>
            <li>The cream feels rich but it isn&#x27;t greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li>This is my carefully chosen, although I haven&#x27;t started to use, but I like it very much,</li>
            <li>This is a little too light of a moisturizer personally.</li>
            <li>I contacted Customer Service and they immediately overnighted a new lotion with no extra charge.  </li>
            <li>is keeping the flakes away and really moisturizing the dry areas.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion, found that not much at all is needed, keeps my face soft.</li>
            <li>My smile lines are less noticeable as well.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is super heavy.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin look better, softer and no more dry flaky patches.</li>
            <li>I have problems with my skin flaking, especially when I wear makeup, and I&#x27;m excited to see how it&#x27;s working a few hours after I apply my foundation.  </li>
            <li>I have very dry skin in the winter and this lotion really hydrates my skin.  </li>
            <li>Living in California and having very picky skin, my skin gets very very dry during the winter.</li>
            <li>Goes on light and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>Sometimes I add other skin positive ingredients to it as well.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t generally write product reviews because nothing stood out for me, but I had to write about this one.</li>
            <li>I shower has brought back my soft skin</li>
            <li>and it keeps me soft the entire day.  </li>
            <li>I only use natural products on my skin.</li>
            <li>and if i can get used to the fragrance, i will purchase it again especially since it&#x27;s a natural product.</li>
            <li>It is thick, creamy, and light once you rub it in.</li>
            <li>Applies a little white but absorbs into skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>I tried a sample as a Bzz Agent for a few days and went right out to buy a full-size product.</li>
            <li>long as your skin has been freshly cleansed right before you use this lotion and you use less than a pump (I use half and it&#x27;s plenty), your skin shouldn&#x27;t feel sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For me, this is a deal breaker, no matter how much I like the other aspects of the product.  </li>
            <li>While this is a rich cream I find that even on non dry areas it does not leave my skin feeling heavy</li>
            <li>If there is any left I just rub it into the back of my hands to keep them soft too.</li>
            <li>I top off with a little bit of vitamin e or coconut oil on trouble spots if necessary</li>
            <li>but in general this is enough.</li>
            <li>I have used a ton of different moisturizers (cheap and expensive), none have really cured the problem.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a long time for a product that would not interfere with my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>: Saved me from my dry, sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Good daytime product usually use this on wet skin or it can be thick</li>
            <li>I found this to be a strongly scented product, which is unfortunate for those (like me) who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Very like this little bee, brought beauty to our family.</li>
            <li>One pump is all you need, and even that a little too much...</li>

            <li> My new best friend for winter is this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say more great things about this product!</li>
            <li> I find that if I warm it up in my hands before applying it glides on better.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and smooth because of this!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It absorbs into my skin nicely and feels very nature and is great under makeup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super moisturizing and in my opinion is good for people with any skin type.    </li>
            <li> It smells great, but that is about all I can say positively about it.</li>

            <li> this is  magical.</li>
            <li> My face sweats a lot and this moisturizer makes me sweat even more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a cream than a lotion, probably at the highest viscosity limit while still being able to work in a pump.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it would be okay in the summer.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something more on the natural/organic side as well.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> In fact I think my skin even looks better, it feels moisturized.</li>

            <li> /&gt;LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> Love Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again usually love their stuff but at $16.00 for 1.8 oz</li>
            <li> Nothing worked better than Burts Bees.</li>
            <li> This is a much cheaper alternative and moisturizes GREAT.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> What more can someone ask for?</li>
            <li> Love love love...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every day for about a month and so far so good!</li>
            <li> Feels great, makes my skin look smooth, non-greasy, and non-comedogenic means I don&#x27;t break out no matter how much I use!</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin very smooth and soft, it does not get tacky at all and the scent is so fresh and wonderful</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m super pleased!</li>
            <li> I have good skin, but as I get older, I want more hydrating products.  </li>
            <li> Just used it for the first time, and I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> great for my 40 yr old skin</li>
            <li> Burts Bees is a great product for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> And you can forget about wearing any kind of face makeup like foundation or concealer - it slides right off with this product.</li>
            <li> It was too strong for my taste and irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li> Smells strongly of sage; doesn&#x27;t bother me but could be an issue if you don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> At first, I was cautious because every kind of cream makes me break out.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product, it was one of my first products with Burt Bees</li>
            <li> Makes a great gift for anyone interested in pure products.</li>
            <li> This is light (like a mouse) and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> I finally found a great day cream with no spf for just hanging inside.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy how this works on my face</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks, my skin is smooth and stays hydrated even on the days I don&#x27;t use the lotion.</li>
            <li> and it isnt oil free.</li>
            <li> At $11 and free shipping?</li>
            <li> and you know it is cruelty free.</li>
            <li> I never realized how moisturized skin was so important to its health and preventing acne.</li>
            <li> This is much thicker than most day face creams and it feels lovely on my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin type really need hydration products, but i have net yet found a really impressed one until this....</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t help my skin much, until I decided to buy this product, and it is definitely the best!</li>
            <li> It was good but we&#x27;ll keep with the old ones.</li>
            <li> cream goes on really easily and has a nice, light natural smell.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it smoothes onto my skin but is absorbed quickly to make applying makeup easier.</li>
            <li> Love this line of intense hydration!</li>
            <li> I have been trying to get my face to like coconut oil; but I&#x27;m pretty sure its never going to</li>
            <li> So the $18 is well worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to recommend to every one need it, worth buying!</li>
            <li> Its worth a try!</li>
            <li> Works great on dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great product if you have dry skin and aren&#x27;t prone to breakouts, but if you periodically have breakouts you should stay away from this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to find a moisturizer that feels like it actually gets worked into the skin instead of just being smeared on top.  </li>
            <li> I gave a bottle to my mother because she has really dry skin on her face, and she&#x27;s seen a great deal of improvement.</li>
            <li> This works great on my very dry skin.</li>
            <li> However I really started needing a moisturizer in the winter months, and this really did the trick, and is very light and refreshing.</li>
            <li> It smelled like a sweet section of my spice rack.  </li>
            <li> I love this lotion so much, I purchased the night cream and the face wash as well.</li>
            <li> I do not know if any of these &amp;#34;age defying&amp;#34; creams actually do any good.</li>
            <li> light and fresh.</li>
            <li> My favorite face cream - very moisturizing but never greasy.</li>
            <li> I use these 2 products almost every day and my skin has probably never looked this good since middle school.</li>
            <li> It worked well, but it just wasn&#x27;t  the right fit for me.</li>
            <li> Do not e tempted,even if you have very dry skin, to load up as the lotion seems to be more effective used sparingly each day</li>
            <li> fresh and clean</li>
            <li> mild scent.</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing.</li>
            <li> skin needs hydration, but though this IS a good moisturizer, the fragrance is a bit much &amp; might irritate sensitive skin if you get over heated.</li>
            <li> I had mild acne and this lotion has made it all go away.</li>
            <li> absorbs really well, skin feels good after, natural</li>
            <li> Smells great and keeps skin hydrated all day - despite hot air, dry heat in office.  </li>
            <li> Firstly, let me say that I got this product free from BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With amazon&#x27;s fast delivery I am enjoying this lotion very much.</li>
            <li> My new favorite face lotion.</li>
            <li> Bought full size right away to use under foundation.  </li>
            <li> I am happy to get something that works for me for less than $20.</li>
            <li> I did not expect it to feel this good and most importantly no residue!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna have to find another moisturizer for summers in the hot Florida sun!</li>
            <li> It goes on easy with the great little dispenser and really works well.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this has been good for me so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it though.</li>
            <li> and I love how soft my skin is</li>
            <li> The peeling has gone away, my skin is much more clear, and didn&#x27;t have one break out when I was on my trip.</li>
            <li> Love the product It goes on so smoothly and instantly hydrates.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced, nice soft scent, no irritation or breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Fun, right?</li>
            <li> Very satisfied, I have dry skin</li>
            <li> It absorbs pretty quickly too</li>
            <li> but this product calms it and just give the right amount of moisturizer it needs for day time.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s great for dry, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Great for sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li> Great for dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I like a more rich and emollient texture, as my skin has always been dry.</li>
            <li> I decided to use the more expensive serums and a natural more affordable cream over the top of that and I am SO glad I did.</li>
            <li> I am a true fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees products and am becoming especially fond of the &amp;#34;Intense Hydration&amp;#34; line of products</li>
            <li> While I could see some finding it a bit too greasy, I have very dry skin and liked the heft of the product.</li>
            <li> Very soothing on the skin!  </li>
            <li> This is a preferred product for my skin during colder season than summer when it&#x27;s hot.</li>
            <li> I paired this with the face wash of the same brand and my skin has never felt better.</li>
            <li> and this is the first lotion that hasn&#x27;t been too costly that works.</li>
            <li> My first order of this lotion was lost.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the first moisturizers that has not made me break out.</li>
            <li> It goes on velvety smooth and soaks in completely.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s best if I don&#x27;t use it every day, but every other day, otherwise my skin will get a little too shiny.</li>
            <li> And as an additional bonus, after shower, if I run my hand through my hair afterwards instead of washing it, it becomes super soft!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and will continue to use it for a long time.</li>
            <li> Go easy at first, because it&#x27;s really potent and a bit on the thick side.</li>
            <li> This is a nice daily face lotion that holds in moisture and keeps your skin feeling smooth and soft for the entire day.</li>
            <li> I have chronically dry skin on my face, but it&#x27;s been so much better after just two weeks of this.</li>
            <li> and so many of the dry lines around my eyes have improved.  </li>
            <li> I have dealt with dry skin for a couple of years and have struggled to find a product that truly hydrates my skin and not just layer grease on top.</li>
            <li> But this is a minor complaint in an otherwise excellent product.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft for the whole day.  </li>
            <li> Right after purchasing this, I went to New Orleans for work for two weeks, and was well prepared for another skin disaster.</li>
            <li> I switched to a gentle cleanser and used an oil free lotion several times a day</li>
            <li> Light moisturizer, absorbs well, only need one pump for whole face.</li>
            <li> Thanks much.</li>
            <li> i have normal/oily skin and use this daily; it goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t break out my skin;  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to &amp;#34;absorb&amp;#34; very well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very herb-y.</li>
            <li> Really like this lotion.</li>
            <li> So, I tried this Intense Hydration day lotion.</li>
            <li> I really wish burt&#x27;s bees made this with sun protection.</li>
            <li> BURT&#x27;S BEES® INTENSE HYDRATION Day Cream was a letdown because it did not have any SPF.  </li>
            <li> It was light enough for day and had the texture of a lotion.  </li>
            <li> I give BURT&#x27;S BEES® INTENSE HYDRATION Day Cream two stars.</li>
            <li> In fact, it&#x27;s almost too much moisture for summertime.</li>
            <li> My baby lotion did absolutely nothing for my skin anymore</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 24 now and eating junk food and fast food all the time still doesn&#x27;t give me acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i have found that it moisturizes very well</li>
            <li> and it lasted me the whole day.</li>
            <li> and I really do trust the brand.</li>
            <li> My skin ends up flaking if I use it for 2 days straight.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it keeps my face moist and dewey but the only downside is the lack of spf that they old radiance lotion had.  </li>
            <li> I put it on at night after I wash my face and it feels so much better the next day even on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I changed to the Burt&#x27;s Bee product line and whilst I liked it, I did have a few pimples arise</li>
            <li> : Soaks right in and leaves skin soft and vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it also doesn&#x27;t cause my face to get bright red like some other lotions.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about the day cream is not having SPF, but it is easy for me to add one right on top.</li>
            <li> my skin still looks great; even if I take a nap, my skin looks soft and surprisingly not shiny when I wake up.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty clear but has some T-Zone dryness.</li>
            <li> After a full day of use (morning and night) the flakiness was finally gone!</li>
            <li> I checked the ingredients and they were all pretty natural and harmless</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched high and low to find a moisturizer that wasn&#x27;t full of toxins and crapola</li>
            <li> Unlike most moisturizers, I don&#x27;t have to worry about looking in the mirror half way through the day and seeing flakes or scaling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently finishing a jar of Golden Sun Drop night cream, but planning to try the Intense Hydration night cream after.</li>
            <li> When I wash my face at night my skin is still very soft thanks to this day lotion.</li>
            <li> I am also so sensitive to fragrances and this is very faint but still very clean smelling and pleasant.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this with high expectations</li>
            <li> My skin became soft and stayed hydrated for hours without being sticky, I was not only amazed but extremely happy to have finally found the right product for my skin type, so I would definitely recommend this cream to people who are suffering from dry skin.</li>
            <li> Either they had way to much sunscreen ( I live in New York</li>
            <li> a little too oily for my skin, even more thicker than cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several products to help, including clean and clear moisturizer, olay, and aveeno.</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin and need intense hydration.</li>
            <li> I have always had a tough time finding a good moisturizer for my combination dry/oily skin until I received a sample of this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews due to my schedule, but OMG, I love their Intense Hydration line!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this as my everyday lotion for years and love it.</li>
            <li> and I normally don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I just bought my second bottle, which I rarely do.  </li>
            <li> I wake up with really healthy feeling/looking skin, not a piece of dried skin in sight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read such great reviews on this product, but it was just far too thick and greasy for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to pay a million dollars for an ounce of some product people swear you need when other stuff will do the job just fine.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is definitely a heavier formulation but a single application in the morning is keeping my skin looking normal for more than a day</li>
            <li> I had extremely dry and flaky skin for a long time and couldn&#x27;t find anything suitable at the drugstore or high-ends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with dry spots on my forehead and nose for the last year or more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used skin care products in my life (excluding shaving cream) but a new medication I&#x27;m required to take seems to have turned my face shaving area into sandpaper.</li>
            <li> I am 43 and  live in the northeast.  </li>
            <li> I had the same result using Yes to Cucumbers which was available locally.</li>
            <li> I live in a very hot dry climate &amp; my 50+</li>
            <li> I fell in love after the first application - my skin didn&#x27;t look greasy but also no longer felt tight and dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always steered clear of any and all face lotions because they normally make me break out with a rash or are just way too oily.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I put this lotion on my hands and by morning they feel as soft as a babies bottom!</li>
            <li> Let me just say was I surprised!</li>
            <li> Non greasy, soaks in and ACTUALLY works - takes the little flakes right off, leaves skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> it sinks in fairly quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or tacky.</li>
            <li> oily.&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the clary sage is a bit odd and not really a scent I care for, to be honest.</li>
            <li> I reached a point with my skin where it was super dry and red and pretty raw around my mouth, so I bought this natural super hydrating moisterizer in hopes it would work.</li>
            <li> And I only need to use a little and it can apply to my whole face!!!!</li>
            <li> You need only a pea size amount for your whole face.</li>
            <li> keeps my face soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive and acne prone skin</li>
            <li> I am 38 years old and have never moisturized my face before.  </li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive to begin with</li>
            <li> This cream makes my face so soft.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft but not greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an acne sufferer who is on medication to treat it that leaves me with sensitive, oily, flaky skin.</li>
            <li> A tiny amount will do my whole face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve started using this before my powder foundation for my work makeup routine and it makes my skin look so natural and soft throughout the day.</li>
            <li> so if you are sensitive to fragrance, you might want to think twice.</li>
            <li> I have mature skin and this product is loaded with hydration without being greasy.  </li>
            <li> I like this, but not as much as the night moisturizer from the same line.</li>
            <li> and I think it is well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> I do wear it at night more so than during day though because it is so thick t</li>
            <li> I had some pretty dry skin for awhile before I started using this lotion.</li>
            <li> Within a week, my skin was already feeling better and I was having less problems with dry skin.</li>
            <li> The cream feels rich but it isn&#x27;t greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> This is my carefully chosen, although I haven&#x27;t started to use, but I like it very much,</li>
            <li> This is a little too light of a moisturizer personally.</li>
            <li> I contacted Customer Service and they immediately overnighted a new lotion with no extra charge.  </li>
            <li> is keeping the flakes away and really moisturizing the dry areas.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion, found that not much at all is needed, keeps my face soft.</li>
            <li> My smile lines are less noticeable as well.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is super heavy.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin look better, softer and no more dry flaky patches.</li>
            <li> I have problems with my skin flaking, especially when I wear makeup, and I&#x27;m excited to see how it&#x27;s working a few hours after I apply my foundation.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin in the winter and this lotion really hydrates my skin.  </li>
            <li> Living in California and having very picky skin, my skin gets very very dry during the winter.</li>
            <li> Goes on light and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Sometimes I add other skin positive ingredients to it as well.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t generally write product reviews because nothing stood out for me, but I had to write about this one.</li>
            <li> I shower has brought back my soft skin</li>
            <li> and it keeps me soft the entire day.  </li>
            <li> I only use natural products on my skin.</li>
            <li> and if i can get used to the fragrance, i will purchase it again especially since it&#x27;s a natural product.</li>
            <li> It is thick, creamy, and light once you rub it in.</li>
            <li> Applies a little white but absorbs into skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> I tried a sample as a Bzz Agent for a few days and went right out to buy a full-size product.</li>
            <li> long as your skin has been freshly cleansed right before you use this lotion and you use less than a pump (I use half and it&#x27;s plenty), your skin shouldn&#x27;t feel sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For me, this is a deal breaker, no matter how much I like the other aspects of the product.  </li>
            <li> While this is a rich cream I find that even on non dry areas it does not leave my skin feeling heavy</li>
            <li> If there is any left I just rub it into the back of my hands to keep them soft too.</li>
            <li> I top off with a little bit of vitamin e or coconut oil on trouble spots if necessary</li>
            <li> but in general this is enough.</li>
            <li> I have used a ton of different moisturizers (cheap and expensive), none have really cured the problem.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a long time for a product that would not interfere with my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> : Saved me from my dry, sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Good daytime product usually use this on wet skin or it can be thick</li>
            <li> I found this to be a strongly scented product, which is unfortunate for those (like me) who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Very like this little bee, brought beauty to our family.</li>
            <li> One pump is all you need, and even that a little too much...</li>
            <li> Rich yet not too thick on warmer days!</li>
            <li> On the other hand, After using this lotion my skin was extremely soft and hydrated, no breakouts, doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
            <li> Just one day of using it and the white dry patches on my face disappeared and never came back.</li>
            <li> I use it all year round because it isn&#x27;t heavy and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> This product is what I was looking for, heavier than my usual lotion and really helps keep dryness away during winter in St. Louis.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it on all three of us and it seems like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> At first it goes on a bit thick but it does go in.  </li>
            <li> This product definitely helps my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I find that I need a richer daily moisturiser to keep my face from getting dry patches</li>
            <li> Aveeno made me break out, CeraVe still left my skin dry after an hour.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with dry white, peeling patches on my forehead and on some areas on my face.</li>
            <li> Not only that, it leaves my skin feeling soft and firm.</li>
            <li> I have very dry facial skin</li>
            <li> It takes very little to cover my entire face and is not heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li> so the 1.8 oz will go a long way.</li>
            <li> I switched to CeraVe, but used this for a long time before that.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have head this moisturizer for a few weeks, and I like it so far.  </li>
            <li> Although olay &amp; aveeno worked somewhat, my skin would still feel rough to the touch and if I forgot to put it on one day, then it was almost like I was back to square</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your skin oily, but it does provide long term hydration.  </li>
            <li> For a long time, I&#x27;ve been using the Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Serum under Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance SPF 15 day lotion on my face every day.  </li>
            <li> But the fragrance is strange, don&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li> The product also takes a long time to be soak up, if you&#x27;re in a running out the door</li>
            <li> Also, while the fragrance is a bit strong, it isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as it was a few years ago when I first tried it.</li>
            <li> Like so many other women I have tried a ton of different products over the years, ranging from expensive dept store lines to the drug store brands!  </li>
            <li> Covers my dry spots so I can put makeup on every morning without having to peel away dry skin after my cover up is on.</li>
            <li> This one has not done anything but get rid of the dry skin I&#x27;ve always had around my nose.</li>
            <li> I have dry combination flaky skin and this cream</li>
            <li> and I happen to have severely dry, flaky skin anyway.</li>
            <li> I have terribly dry face</li>
            <li> and my skin in parts felt dry.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really brightens my skin, moisturizes it really well, and protects it against the cold winter air.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and this hydrates without making my skin oily.  </li>
            <li> I have incredibly dry skin, with patches that show even after applying lotion.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> I began using the Burt&#x27;s Bees acne solutions toner followed by this lotion and my skin cleared up within 1-2 weeks and the dry patches were 100% gone within 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> i am 50 with dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> My face didn&#x27;t feel dry at all.</li>
            <li> but it would only last a few hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge lotion fan because I have a mixed skin type, with some patches of oily skin (especially on my face) and some dry skin.</li>
            <li> A little really does go a long way with this product so don&#x27;t be put off by how small the bottle is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty thick, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Again, for the winter dry dry skin it&#x27;s a must!  </li>
            <li> and I only even use it every other day!</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin which peels in summer and winter!</li>
            <li> My skin was so dry it looked wrinkled!</li>
            <li> This will be my go to product any time I have a dry spell!</li>
            <li> I always get very dry skin in the winter with some rough dry patches and some flakiness.  </li>
            <li> Upon initial use, my skin did get a little oily the day after I applied the lotion, but now it no longer gets</li>
            <li> This product however, is a tiny little miracle for thirsty hands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light but keeps my crazy skin well moisturized.</li>
            <li> I found this product several years ago and it&#x27;s been my everyday face lotion.</li>
            <li> I forgot one day and dried out again by the next morning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so heavy that I&#x27;m left feeling like I haven&#x27;t washed my face....</li>
            <li> I keep my face alittle wet from the rinse and apply this&lt;br</li>
            <li> Due to this harsh winter it didn&#x27;t moisturize my skin enough.  </li>
            <li> Fragranced, so if you are allergic to fragrance, this is not a good lotion for you.&lt;br /&gt;Dry, very dry or mature skin needs hydration, this lotion does not deliver that.</li>
            <li> A little of this goes a long way</li>
            <li> /&gt;Application: A little goes a LONG way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li> other reviewers have mentioned, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> and you only need to apply very little of it</li>
            <li> but my skin continued to feel dry, tight, and flaky even after 3 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried some other moisturizers and I prefer something that goes on a bit smoother.</li>
            <li> other lotions I&#x27;ve tried, even the &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; lotions, had scents that bothered me.  </li>
            <li> I use it every other day.</li>
            <li> Not as greasy as some others I have tried, it does not promote acne like other have done.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Extremely hydrating.</li>
            <li> Unlike other cleansers, has not been clogging my pores.</li>
            <li> Olay was extremely greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Aloe Vera moisturizers, Cetaphil, Olay (the one with SPF and the 7 effects), St. Ives with collagen, vitamin c products (the body shop, not really a moisturiser), even applied petroleum jelly all over my face 3 nights a week!</li>
            <li> we have other lotions that seem to work just as well.</li>
            <li> is a small bottle, but after seeing how little it takes for it to work, it should last for a while</li>
            <li> I was a long time user of Olay, but the changed the formula of my usual brand</li>
            <li> The only negative is that it can take a bit of time to fully absorb, but I don&#x27;t mind because it works so well</li>
            <li> only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five is because I feel it should be a night cream rather than day because it goes on so thick.</li>
            <li> hope it won&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li> No more dry skin for me</li>
            <li> It went on very thick, almost difficult to smooth on face and neck.</li>
            <li> It takes me a few dips into the jar to get my whole face covered, and it sort of sticks together which is weird but ends up doing wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li> (Typically I HAVE to have lotion with salisylic acid in it</li>
            <li> Around my eyes is brighter and less baggy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like lotion that after you apply it to your face as a moisturizer that when you try to apply foundation it rubs off in little rolled up lotion pieces.  </li>
            <li> The problem is that it seems to &amp;#34;sit&amp;#34; on the skin, no matter how little I use or how thoroughly I massage it in.</li>
            <li> had little whiteheads from it, since using this&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed about this because I liked the way the product felt and how it moisturized my skin.  </li>
            <li> This product is all natural without the nasty chemicals and it is super moisturizing to the face.  </li>
            <li> Also, my children are African American and their cheeks dry out badly and need moisturizer on them 2 or 3 times per day.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be working, but I would have preferred the &amp;#34;Sensitive Skin&amp;#34; moisturizer that was not available on Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> Also for some reason an hour or two after I put  this on, my skin starts to turn a few shades darker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few years now, and I don&#x27;t see myself using anything else.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy after applying and rubbing it in.</li>
            <li> They will crack and bleed and there are some lotions that help and after a few days my hands are alright.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it has a thick texture, making it difficult to spread evenly or rub into my skin completely.</li>
            <li> moisturize then wait a few minutes before adding anything else like sunblock.</li>
            <li> Recently I had a horrible reaction to a product that cause redness and burning that lasted for 2 days and then after that an intense dry spell kicked in.</li>
            <li> to me it smells like cucumber which isn&#x27;t really all that unpleasant.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little thick and smelly.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t usually use scented products and still no irritation).</li>
            <li> I usually apply it when needed before putting on tinted moisterzier.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure I would recommend it.  </li>
            <li> --it&#x27;s usually 50/50 as to whether my skin will break out.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews for beauty products, nothing has ever stood out to me.</li>
            <li> Usually adore BB products.  </li>
            <li> or I&#x27;m a broken out mess by the end of the day).</li>
            <li> Hard to absorb by skin.</li>
            <li> I have combo skin that just sucks year-round.</li>
            <li> the one complaint i have is the fragrance.</li>
            <li> The consistency is just a bit too thick for me.</li>
            <li> It is a thick moisterizer but wasnt for me</li>
            <li> No more of that now!</li>
            <li> I had finally moved to very expensive department store skincare to try to balance my skin&#x27;s oil and dryness.</li>
            <li> It is subtle and</li>
            <li> It was not too thin and not too thick.</li>
            <li> Winter is so tough on skin anyway</li>
            <li> This face lotion goes on very thick, but after about twenty minutes I don&#x27;t even feel it.</li>
            <li> Its even worse in the winter.</li>
            <li> I suffer from horrible dry skin all yr round.</li>
            <li> It was so bad for a while, 10 minutes after using a moisturizer in the morning, I could see dried skin peeling off of my face.</li>
            <li> However, one day I randomly decided to try this moisturizer and that was when things changed.</li>
            <li> The product has a faint grassy flower smell as well.</li>
            <li> I have even tried my wife&#x27;s expensive name brand lotion.</li>
            <li> on a random impulse</li>
            <li> I ended upbreaking out very badly after a few weeks of use and eventually threw the rest away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have never have had the cold winter create driness</li>
            <li> But for some reason, this fall, my trusted miracle combination wasn&#x27;t cutting it anymore.</li>
            <li> Some ingredient had a smell that was unpleasant for me.</li>
            <li> I ended up throwing this away, it made my face break out really bad.  </li>
            <li> and I got frustrated.</li>
            <li> but I ended up disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Seems to be working, but I would have preferred the &amp;#34;Sensitive Skin&amp;#34; moisturizer that was not available on Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> Rich yet not too thick on warmer days!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about Burts Bees products. I&#x27;ve been using them for 20 or so years on and off. I found this product several years ago and it&#x27;s been my everyday face lotion. I love how it feels. I like a more rich and emollient texture, as my skin has always been dry. This is much thicker than most day face creams and it feels lovely on my skin.</li>
            <li> The consistency is just a bit too thick for me. I&#x27;ve tried some other moisturizers and I prefer something that goes on a bit smoother. Also for some reason an hour or two after I put  this on, my skin starts to turn a few shades darker. It worked well, but it just wasn&#x27;t  the right fit for me.</li>
            <li> This face lotion goes on very thick, but after about twenty minutes I don&#x27;t even feel it. I do wear it at night more so than during day though because it is so thick t first.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is pleasant and not so overpowering. It comes in a pump bottle rather than a squeeze bottle, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five is because I feel it should be a night cream rather than day because it goes on so thick.</li>
            <li> I am sure it will fit perfectly to my needs. I am really very exited to use it, yay and happy</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this has been good for me so far. Smells amazing (I don&#x27;t usually use scented products and still no irritation). And it keep my skin hydrated without causing it to get oily. Love it!</li>
            <li> Fragranced, so if you are allergic to fragrance, this is not a good lotion for you.&lt;br /&gt;Dry, very dry or mature skin needs hydration, this lotion does not deliver that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used skin care products in my life (excluding shaving cream) but a new medication I&#x27;m required to take seems to have turned my face shaving area into sandpaper. I tried my wife&#x27;s Mary Kay face moisterizer but it would only last a few hours. I had the same result using Yes to Cucumbers which was available locally. Burt&#x27;s Bees is definitely a heavier formulation but a single application in the morning is keeping my skin looking normal for more than a day and you only need to apply very little of it so the 1.8 oz will go a long way.</li>
            <li> At first, I was cautious because every kind of cream makes me break out. This is light (like a mouse) and smells fantastic. Goes on light and a little goes a long way so don&#x27;t let the price scare you. You need only a pea size amount for your whole face. Covers my dry spots so I can put makeup on every morning without having to peel away dry skin after my cover up is on. Great for all day smoothness and so light that it doesn&#x27;t make you break out!</li>
            <li> As described. Wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Great product ,fast shipment ,I recommend .</li>
            <li> Very like this little bee, brought beauty to our family.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for the wife... She loves it!! She says it smells good, moisturizes well, and it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
            <li> The only thing that this product needs to make 5 stars is SPF protection.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s great for dry, sensitive skin.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li> a little too oily for my skin, even more thicker than cream</li>
            <li> great stuff. keeps my face soft. girls in the house love it. price is good for the quality. mild scent.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  other lotions I&#x27;ve tried, even the &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; lotions, had scents that bothered me.  This works perfectly and realy does hydrate the skin.</li>
            <li> I have chronically dry skin on my face, but it&#x27;s been so much better after just two weeks of this. I forgot one day and dried out again by the next morning. And it smells AH-MAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you don&#x27;t like perfumes though.</li>
            <li> This is my carefully chosen, although I haven&#x27;t started to use, but I like it very much, hope it won&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li> it is good ,i love it</li>
            <li> when you can get it here for under $5! This was an awesome deal. I will be back! Thanks much.</li>
            <li> Very good, natural moisturizer. I switched to CeraVe, but used this for a long time before that.</li>
            <li> Face shines and is well moisturized! Love it!</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing. I&#x27;ve been using this for like 5 years. I love Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> Love Burts products and this works great!  Very soothing on the skin!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Very good hydrating cream. Even tried it on hands with eczema and brought relief.</li>
            <li> Love this cream, it locks moisture for hours. I don&#x27;t generally write product reviews because nothing stood out for me, but I had to write about this one. I had extremely dry and flaky skin for a long time and couldn&#x27;t find anything suitable at the drugstore or high-ends. I tried numerous products, but nothing worked on my skin and I got frustrated. However, one day I randomly decided to try this moisturizer and that was when things changed. My skin became soft and stayed hydrated for hours without being sticky, I was not only amazed but extremely happy to have finally found the right product for my skin type, so I would definitely recommend this cream to people who are suffering from dry skin. You should try this once.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. The only drawback is the price for the quantity. It&#x27;s worth it though.</li>
            <li> No more dry skin for me and there is no greasy feel. It absorbs into my skin nicely and feels very nature and is great under makeup.</li>
            <li> I ended up throwing this away, it made my face break out really bad.  I normally love burts bees products but this one was the exception.</li>
            <li> Needs spf protection.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion to replace my winter-time lotion that got discontinued (Neutrogena Intensive Day Moisture).  While it was moisturizing (although not very moisturizing), the smell was completely unbearable.  It smelled like a sweet section of my spice rack.  I used it about five times and then threw it away.  Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Love it. Had this product for over a year. It takes very little to cover my entire face and is not heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this as my everyday lotion for years and love it. It&#x27;s light but keeps my crazy skin well moisturized. I top off with a little bit of vitamin e or coconut oil on trouble spots if necessary but in general this is enough. Light smell and great coverage.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive and acne prone skin but this product calms it and just give the right amount of moisturizer it needs for day time. A little of this goes a long way so when used, I only need to use a drop for my entire face. I love this lotion so much, I purchased the night cream and the face wash as well. This is a preferred product for my skin during colder season than summer when it&#x27;s hot.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer! I&#x27;ve always steered clear of any and all face lotions because they normally make me break out with a rash or are just way too oily. This one has not done anything but get rid of the dry skin I&#x27;ve always had around my nose. No more of that now! And no break outs! I usually apply it when needed before putting on tinted moisterzier. I find for me it&#x27;s best if I don&#x27;t use it every day, but every other day, otherwise my skin will get a little too shiny. But that&#x27;s just because of my skin. I could not be happier with this product!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge lotion fan because I have a mixed skin type, with some patches of oily skin (especially on my face) and some dry skin. However I really started needing a moisturizer in the winter months, and this really did the trick, and is very light and refreshing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I was a department store junkie and I would buy day/night creams in the 60-200 range. I decided to use the more expensive serums and a natural more affordable cream over the top of that and I am SO glad I did. This stuff is incredible! It leaves my skin very smooth and soft, it does not get tacky at all and the scent is so fresh and wonderful I just love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*scent- fresh and clean It is subtle and it does not linger.&lt;br /&gt;* moisturization- this stuff is VERY hydrating without being heavy or tacky. I find that if I warm it up in my hands before applying it glides on better. It also does not clog my pores or irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;*results- When I wash my face at night my skin is still very soft thanks to this day lotion. I have dry combination flaky skin and this cream is keeping the flakes away and really moisturizing the dry areas. I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall this is a 5 star product and I am blown away at the results for the price. I love this stuff and will continue to use it for a long time. I will update this review if anything changes.</li>
            <li> I paired this with the face wash of the same brand and my skin has never felt better. A little really does go a long way with this product so don&#x27;t be put off by how small the bottle is. Winter is so tough on skin anyway and I happen to have severely dry, flaky skin anyway. The face wash and lotion used each time I shower has brought back my soft skin and I&#x27;m super pleased! I will continue to purchase this product in the future.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it keeps my face moist and dewey but the only downside is the lack of spf that they old radiance lotion had.  If they could add spf 15 to this lotion I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Love this line of intense hydration! I finally found a great day cream with no spf for just hanging inside.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed.  I don&#x27;t like lotion that after you apply it to your face as a moisturizer that when you try to apply foundation it rubs off in little rolled up lotion pieces.  Not liking it at all.  it&#x27;s a little thick and smelly.</li>
            <li> I have head this moisturizer for a few weeks, and I like it so far.  I am 38 years old and have never moisturized my face before.  I knew I needed to start doing something, and I use the Burt&#x27;s Bees cleanser to take off my makeup so I decided to try this.  Also, my children are African American and their cheeks dry out badly and need moisturizer on them 2 or 3 times per day.  I&#x27;m using it on all three of us and it seems like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This is a simple but substantial moisturizer.  I have good skin, but as I get older, I want more hydrating products.  I add a drop or two of emu oil to this and it keeps me soft the entire day.  Sometimes I add other skin positive ingredients to it as well.  I&#x27;ve used it for a few years now, and I don&#x27;t see myself using anything else.  It might not be right for people with oily skin, but it&#x27;s perfect for me.  I put it all over my face, neck and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li> I have always had a tough time finding a good moisturizer for my combination dry/oily skin until I received a sample of this moisturizer. I fell in love after the first application - my skin didn&#x27;t look greasy but also no longer felt tight and dry.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I have very dry facial skin and this is the first lotion that hasn&#x27;t been too costly that works. I put it on at night after I wash my face and it feels so much better the next day even on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy how this works on my face I have terribly dry face this is  magical.</li>
            <li> This product definitely helps my dry skin. Unlike most moisturizers, I don&#x27;t have to worry about looking in the mirror half way through the day and seeing flakes or scaling. The problem is that it seems to &amp;#34;sit&amp;#34; on the skin, no matter how little I use or how thoroughly I massage it in. My face sweats a lot and this moisturizer makes me sweat even more. I can just feel the beads of sweat and moisturizer sitting on my skin. And you can forget about wearing any kind of face makeup like foundation or concealer - it slides right off with this product. Also, while the fragrance is a bit strong, it isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as it was a few years ago when I first tried it. So that&#x27;s a good thing. Overall, though...I&#x27;m gonna have to find another moisturizer for summers in the hot Florida sun!</li>
            <li> My first order of this lotion was lost.  I contacted Customer Service and they immediately overnighted a new lotion with no extra charge.  Just used it for the first time, and I am very pleased.  It&#x27;s more of a cream than a lotion, probably at the highest viscosity limit while still being able to work in a pump.  It absorbs well and my skin feels great.  I have problems with my skin flaking, especially when I wear makeup, and I&#x27;m excited to see how it&#x27;s working a few hours after I apply my foundation.  We shall see!</li>
            <li> Have always loved this product. Delivers as advertised. Would highly recommend it. Makes a great gift for anyone interested in pure products.</li>
            <li> At first it goes on a bit thick but it does go in.  Due to this harsh winter it didn&#x27;t moisturize my skin enough.  I changed to the Burt&#x27;s Bee product line and whilst I liked it, I did have a few pimples arise and I normally don&#x27;t and my skin in parts felt dry.  So I&#x27;m not sure I would recommend it.  Maybe it would be okay in the summer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews due to my schedule, but OMG, I love their Intense Hydration line!!!! I&#x27;ve only used it for 2 days, and I can actually tell the different.  My skin type really need hydration products, but i have net yet found a really impressed one until this....</li>
            <li> I am 43 and  live in the northeast.  I have never have had the cold winter create driness but this year was different.  I found great reviews regarding this &amp;#34;intense hydration&amp;#34; line and decided to order the cleanser!!  I fell in love with that and ordered the day cream to go along with it!  Like so many other women I have tried a ton of different products over the years, ranging from expensive dept store lines to the drug store brands!  And this is my favorite!  I have been using it for over a month and I love how soft my skin is and so many of the dry lines around my eyes have improved.  I just wished they made a toner to go along with this line.  So for now I will continue to use a  Keihls toner...  I am also so sensitive to fragrances and this is very faint but still very clean smelling and pleasant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with dry spots on my forehead and nose for the last year or more. I&#x27;ve tried several products to help, including clean and clear moisturizer, olay, and aveeno. Although olay &amp; aveeno worked somewhat, my skin would still feel rough to the touch and if I forgot to put it on one day, then it was almost like I was back to square one.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bees for maybe 3 weeks and it has been amazing! I use it every other day. Within a week, my skin was already feeling better and I was having less problems with dry skin. After 3 weeks, my skin is smooth and stays hydrated even on the days I don&#x27;t use the lotion. Upon initial use, my skin did get a little oily the day after I applied the lotion, but now it no longer gets oily.&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the clary sage is a bit odd and not really a scent I care for, to be honest. However, after the lotion drys, the smell disappears. So, if you can stand the smell for 5 minutes, you&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;This is a small bottle, but after seeing how little it takes for it to work, it should last for a while and I think it is well worth the money spent. I really can&#x27;t say more great things about this product!</li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin! I only use natural products on my skin. I have been trying to get my face to like coconut oil; but I&#x27;m pretty sure its never going to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched high and low to find a moisturizer that wasn&#x27;t full of toxins and crapola but also didn&#x27;t have coconut oil in it. And then I hoped and prayed that my face wouldn&#x27;t break out. WINNER! I use this every morning and it&#x27;s wonderful because I don&#x27;t break out! PERFECT product for me.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin in the winter and this lotion really hydrates my skin.  I wear it under makeup as it&#x27;s not to greasy.</li>
            <li> Works great on dry winter skin. I use it all year round because it isn&#x27;t heavy and dries quickly. Been using for over a year now and I love it.</li>
            <li> I reviewed this product in the video below. Check it out! It&#x27;s super moisturizing and in my opinion is good for people with any skin type.    [...]</li>
            <li> i have normal/oily skin and use this daily; it goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t break out my skin;  i wear it under my foundation.  Love Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like...made my face oily</li>
            <li> I suffer from horrible dry skin all yr round. Its even worse in the winter. This has saved my skin this winter. My new best friend for winter is this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My new favorite face lotion. I was a long time user of Olay, but the changed the formula of my usual brand and I didn&#x27;t like the perfumy odor. My skin is sensitive to begin with so I&#x27;m always reluctant to try another brand--it&#x27;s usually 50/50 as to whether my skin will break out. I wanted to try something more on the natural/organic side as well. Having used Burt&#x27;s Bees products before I took a chance. I am so glad I did. It is thick, creamy, and light once you rub it in. I have been using it for almost a month and NO break outs. In fact I think my skin even looks better, it feels moisturized. You also do not need to use a lot. One pump is all you need, and even that a little too much...so I just rub the excess on my hands. I am very impressed by this lotion. I did not expect it to feel this good and most importantly no residue!</li>
            <li> Arrived as advertised, thank you.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re anticipating sweating, this might make you break out, as it does for me.  I live in a very hot dry climate &amp; my 50+ skin needs hydration, but though this IS a good moisturizer, the fragrance is a bit much &amp; might irritate sensitive skin if you get over heated. i did not find it greasy, though it does provide a barrier to keep in  your skin&#x27;s moisture, so yes it does leave a film.</li>
            <li> I found this to be a strongly scented product, which is unfortunate for those (like me) who have sensitive skin. It was too strong for my taste and irritated my eyes. However, I did like the product itself in terms of its coverage. It was not too thin and not too thick. While I could see some finding it a bit too greasy, I have very dry skin and liked the heft of the product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to &amp;#34;absorb&amp;#34; very well.  Gets kind of &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; when I add my foundation.</li>
            <li> I just bought my second bottle, which I rarely do.  I absolutely love this cream!  I always get very dry skin in the winter with some rough dry patches and some flakiness.  This cream gets rid of that and never leaves my face feeling greasy.  Makeup goes on perfectly.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this in my birchbox and I&#x27;m now hooked. This stuff really brightens my skin, moisturizes it really well, and protects it against the cold winter air. The smell is alright; I can see some people loving it and some people hating it. It&#x27;s very herb-y. I also personally wouldn&#x27;t label this as a little-goes-a-long-way type product. It takes me a few dips into the jar to get my whole face covered, and it sort of sticks together which is weird but ends up doing wonders for my skin. For the price, I&#x27;m a convert.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion, found that not much at all is needed, keeps my face soft. Not as greasy as some others I have tried, it does not promote acne like other have done.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Moisturizes beautifully and smells clean and fresh...</li>
            <li> I reached a point with my skin where it was super dry and red and pretty raw around my mouth, so I bought this natural super hydrating moisterizer in hopes it would work. It burned my skin when i put it on and it isnt oil free. It is a thick moisterizer but wasnt for me</li>
            <li> Good daytime product usually use this on wet skin or it can be thick</li>
            <li> I used it for over a week and found that it clogged my pores.</li>
            <li> It is good and I like it but it is not the best.  Probably the best at this price!  I do not know if any of these &amp;#34;age defying&amp;#34; creams actually do any good.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a long time for a product that would not interfere with my sensitive skin.  I wanted a product that would work, but not irritate my skin.  Well, I found this in Burts Bees.  It doesn&#x27;t make your skin oily, but it does provide long term hydration.  Pair it with the night cream.</li>
            <li> for winter it is the one i always use</li>
            <li> Great product for dry skin, great seller</li>
            <li> this stuff is great for senstive skin&lt;br /&gt;was using olay serum and after a while&lt;br /&gt;I had little whiteheads from it, since using this&lt;br /&gt;they have all gone away, like the pump too,</li>
            <li> Really like this lotion. I have dry skin and this hydrates without making my skin oily.  Pleasant smell as well.</li>
            <li> This cream makes my face so soft. And as an additional bonus, after shower, if I run my hand through my hair afterwards instead of washing it, it becomes super soft! It is a stock item now!</li>
            <li> Oh My God this is so good!!!!!!!!! My skin is soft and smooth because of this!!!!!!! And I only need to use a little and it can apply to my whole face!!!! Definitely will buy more when I finish this bottle!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and doesn&#x27;t feel cakey...light and fresh.</li>
            <li> For a long time, I&#x27;ve been using the Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Serum under Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance SPF 15 day lotion on my face every day.  But for some reason, this fall, my trusted miracle combination wasn&#x27;t cutting it anymore. So, I tried this Intense Hydration day lotion. And you know what?  I don&#x27;t even need my serum under it!  I put it on in the morning and it works ALL DAY and my face is still moisturized through the night and into the next morning when I reapply.  It&#x27;s silky and has a lovely scent. A little goes a long way! So the $18 is well worth it! Fantastic quality!</li>
            <li> Love the feel of Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Day Lotion. Really LOVE knowing there are no parabens. I will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> Hard to absorb by skin.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy after applying and rubbing it in. It absorbs pretty quickly too and then you can apply makeup about 5 minutes after applying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bartender and my hands are ALWAYS in water and being washed. They will crack and bleed and there are some lotions that help and after a few days my hands are alright. This lotion, however, one night. I put this lotion on my hands and by morning they feel as soft as a babies bottom! It&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;m not one to pay a million dollars for an ounce of some product people swear you need when other stuff will do the job just fine. This product however, is a tiny little miracle for thirsty hands. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> This product is what I was looking for, heavier than my usual lotion and really helps keep dryness away during winter in St. Louis.</li>
            <li> I tried a sample as a Bzz Agent for a few days and went right out to buy a full-size product. I have dealt with dry skin for a couple of years and have struggled to find a product that truly hydrates my skin and not just layer grease on top. This is fabulous!! I love the smell. I love the way it smoothes onto my skin but is absorbed quickly to make applying makeup easier. My only complaint about the day cream is not having SPF, but it is easy for me to add one right on top.</li>
            <li> Love this! Will never buy in stores again when Amazon always has the lowest price for sure. Makes my skin soft but not greasy. Doesn&#x27;t cause acne!</li>
            <li> This is one of the first moisturizers that has not made me break out. I&#x27;ve been using it every day for about a month and so far so good!</li>
            <li> Extremely hydrating. I use it every morning with the Burt&#x27;s night cream in the evenings. I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts since starting.</li>
            <li> Face lotion is nice. Non greasy. But the fragrance is strange, don&#x27;t like it.  I am not allergic to this creme as I am to some face cremes so that another plus for this lotion.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied, I have dry skin and my skin gets exposed to sun alot being in Dubai. This is perfect, keeps me hydrated.</li>
            <li> This is the best fairly inexpensive lotion in the world. I can&#x27;t get enough of it.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought this cream. It makes my skin look better, softer and no more dry flaky patches. It smells nice and the packaging is great! Highly recommend it. I have oily skin type. The cream feels rich but it isn&#x27;t greasy or heavy. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> This lotion has a pleasant feel to it, moisturizes well, and has not inflamed my acne-prone skin. My only complaint is that it has a thick texture, making it difficult to spread evenly or rub into my skin completely. But this is a minor complaint in an otherwise excellent product.</li>
            <li> I am a true fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees products and am becoming especially fond of the &amp;#34;Intense Hydration&amp;#34; line of products</li>
            <li> Again, for the winter dry dry skin it&#x27;s a must!  Go easy at first, because it&#x27;s really potent and a bit on the thick side.</li>
            <li> This lotion has totally cleared up my skin!  I had mild acne and this lotion has made it all go away. I now use it morning and night and love it!  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews for beauty products, nothing has ever stood out to me. I purchased this day cream and the cream cleanser on a whim, when I needed something to take on a trip. Living in California and having very picky skin, my skin gets very very dry during the winter. Every time I go on a trip, or have a change of environment, my skin freaks out as well. I have used a ton of different moisturizers (cheap and expensive), none have really cured the problem. It was so bad for a while, 10 minutes after using a moisturizer in the morning, I could see dried skin peeling off of my face. Right after purchasing this, I went to New Orleans for work for two weeks, and was well prepared for another skin disaster. Let me just say was I surprised! I used the cleanser at night with my Clarisonic and day cream mixed with a sun block in the morning. My skin has never felt this good. I&#x27;m currently finishing a jar of Golden Sun Drop night cream, but planning to try the Intense Hydration night cream after. The peeling has gone away, my skin is much more clear, and didn&#x27;t have one break out when I was on my trip. I wake up with really healthy feeling/looking skin, not a piece of dried skin in sight. This is such a god send, especially for the price! I have never used Burts Bees products before, but I am a believer now. Go buy this now, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin which peels in summer and winter! I have been on the look out for a good day and night moisturizer. This one is GOOD. With amazon&#x27;s fast delivery I am enjoying this lotion very much. It arrived SO SOON. Love the product It goes on so smoothly and instantly hydrates. The pump design is great too&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> Very good, I like it, is just what I wanted! I&#x27;d like to recommend to every one need it.Very good, I like it, is just what I wanted! I&#x27;d like to recommend to every one need it, worth buying!</li>
            <li> I have incredibly dry skin, with patches that show even after applying lotion. This lotion is hydrating, but not enough (compared to the night cream). The product also takes a long time to be soak up, if you&#x27;re in a running out the door amd dont allow the product to be soaked, it will clog your pores and make you face sweat.The product has a faint grassy flower smell as well. I really wish burt&#x27;s bees made this with sun protection.</li>
            <li> This is a nice daily face lotion that holds in moisture and keeps your skin feeling smooth and soft for the entire day.</li>
            <li> LOVE! Non greasy, soaks in and ACTUALLY works - takes the little flakes right off, leaves skin soft and smooth.  I pair with Burt&#x27;s Cream Cleanser and am very happy with the condition of my skin this winter.  Reasonably priced, nice soft scent, no irritation or breakouts.  Would definitely recommend.  My skin is pretty clear but has some T-Zone dryness.</li>
            <li> My favorite face cream - very moisturizing but never greasy.</li>
            <li> Now we have moved into the fall/winter season I find that I need a richer daily moisturiser to keep my face from getting dry patches but I have struggled to get a cream that does not leave my face feeling greasy or weighted down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream goes on really easily and has a nice, light natural smell.  It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft for the whole day.  While this is a rich cream I find that even on non dry areas it does not leave my skin feeling heavy which is a nice change&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have mentioned, a little goes a long way.  I use one pump, which I put on the back of my hand, and then apply sparingly over my face.  If there is any left I just rub it into the back of my hands to keep them soft too. Do not e tempted,even if you have very dry skin, to load up as the lotion seems to be more effective used sparingly each day</li>
            <li> Best product I ever used on my skin! Period!!!!</li>
            <li> Great for dry, sensitive skin. Unlike other cleansers, has not been clogging my pores. It&#x27;s pretty thick, so a little goes a long way. Smells strongly of sage; doesn&#x27;t bother me but could be an issue if you don&#x27;t like the smell. Does wonders for my winter skin without causing breakouts. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Love Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin and need intense hydration. This works well for me, but only when combined with a hydrating serum. Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Usually adore BB products.  This moisturizer is super heavy.  Goes on like zinc oxide (meaning white) and turns your skin shiny.  It&#x27;s so heavy that I&#x27;m left feeling like I haven&#x27;t washed my face....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May be good as a night time moisturizer...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again usually love their stuff but at $16.00 for 1.8 oz I would pass on this one.</li>
            <li> Before I begin to tell you how amazing this lotion is, my face is sensitive/dry. I want to state I have tried Olay, Neutrogena, L&#x27;Oreal, Aveeno, CeraVe, and St. Ives, Nothing worked better than Burts Bees. Either they had way to much sunscreen ( I live in New York so we don&#x27;t get a lot of sun, So I didn&#x27;t need any extra sunscreen coverage) Olay was extremely greasy. Aveeno made me break out, CeraVe still left my skin dry after an hour. Well you get the jest of what I&#x27;m saying. On the other hand, After using this lotion my skin was extremely soft and hydrated, no breakouts, doesn&#x27;t clog pores. I noticed a significant difference in my skin, it looks very healthy. Recommended this to family and friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an acne sufferer who is on medication to treat it that leaves me with sensitive, oily, flaky skin. Fun, right? This lotion gives mega hydration without leaving my face feeling sticky, greasy, or gross. It goes on velvety smooth and soaks in completely. I do not use this daily as it&#x27;s summer and my skin is still a tad bit oily for that, but it makes a perfect night and winter face cream. This is also the ONLY face lotion without added acne medication that does not break me out at all. (Typically I HAVE to have lotion with salisylic acid in it or I&#x27;m a broken out mess by the end of the day).</li>
            <li> it is too oily in summer, i think it can well use in autumn and winter.ordinary, it is a good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with dry white, peeling patches on my forehead and on some areas on my face. I&#x27;ve tried Aloe Vera moisturizers, Cetaphil, Olay (the one with SPF and the 7 effects), St. Ives with collagen, vitamin c products (the body shop, not really a moisturiser), even applied petroleum jelly all over my face 3 nights a week! I&#x27;ve tried it all but it doesn&#x27;t help my skin much, until I decided to buy this product, and it is definitely the best! Just one day of using it and the white dry patches on my face disappeared and never came back. I just bought this last week and I only even use it every other day! I just loveee this product. At $11 and free shipping? definitely a wise purchase!</li>
            <li> absorbs really well, skin feels good after, natural and you know it is cruelty free. You have to try to know if iti s good for your skin i am happy that i know it is exist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read such great reviews on this product, but it was just far too thick and greasy for me.  I ended upbreaking out very badly after a few weeks of use and eventually threw the rest away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product if you have dry skin and aren&#x27;t prone to breakouts, but if you periodically have breakouts you should stay away from this product.</li>
            <li> Recd as a sample and loved this. Bought full size right away to use under foundation.  Applies a little white but absorbs into skin quickly.  Smells great and keeps skin hydrated all day - despite hot air, dry heat in office.  Recommend - especially for winter,</li>
            <li> Firstly, let me say that I got this product free from BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BURT&#x27;S BEES® INTENSE HYDRATION Day Cream was a letdown because it did not have any SPF.  I prefer to have a product that both moisturizes and protects.  I was very disappointed about this because I liked the way the product felt and how it moisturized my skin.  It was light enough for day and had the texture of a lotion.  It is a shame that BURT&#x27;S BEES, neglectfully, or intentionally, left out the SPF.  For me, this is a deal breaker, no matter how much I like the other aspects of the product.  If BURT&#x27;S BEES decided to give this product an SPF 30, I would buy it.  As it stands, I would not.  I give BURT&#x27;S BEES® INTENSE HYDRATION Day Cream two stars.</li>
            <li> I have combo skin that just sucks year-round. I had finally moved to very expensive department store skincare to try to balance my skin&#x27;s oil and dryness. This is a much cheaper alternative and moisturizes GREAT. In fact, it&#x27;s almost too much moisture for summertime.</li>
            <li> I continue to use harsh acne products on my skin even though I don&#x27;t really have acne anymore. Recently I had a horrible reaction to a product that cause redness and burning that lasted for 2 days and then after that an intense dry spell kicked in. My skin was so dry it looked wrinkled! I switched to a gentle cleanser and used an oil free lotion several times a day but my skin continued to feel dry, tight, and flaky even after 3 days. I bought this lotion and it dramatically improved the dryness over night. After a full day of use (morning and night) the flakiness was finally gone! I have used it for about 3 days now and I have not had any issues with breakouts. This will be my go to product any time I have a dry spell!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and this face lotion is amazing. I use it all throughout the fall/winter months!</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve started using this lotion my skin has improved dramatically!  My face stays moisturized throughout the day without feeling oily, and I use it at night after I wash, too.  A tiny amount will do my whole face.  It&#x27;s nice to find a moisturizer that feels like it actually gets worked into the skin instead of just being smeared on top.  I&#x27;ve been converted!</li>
            <li> I use face cream every day when I wash my face.. This is alittle goes along way cream. I keep my face alittle wet from the rinse and apply this&lt;br /&gt;to moisturize then wait a few minutes before adding anything else like sunblock. I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This is the only face lotion I have found that does not irritate my eyes. I have even tried my wife&#x27;s expensive name brand lotion. Great product just as described.</li>
            <li> I had some pretty dry skin for awhile before I started using this lotion. My baby lotion did absolutely nothing for my skin anymore and I was didn&#x27;t know what to do. I bought this at Target for $18 (I didn&#x27;t know it was cheaper on Amazon!) on a random impulse and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I began using the Burt&#x27;s Bees acne solutions toner followed by this lotion and my skin cleared up within 1-2 weeks and the dry patches were 100% gone within 2-3 weeks. I use these 2 products almost every day and my skin has probably never looked this good since middle school. I&#x27;m 24 now and eating junk food and fast food all the time still doesn&#x27;t give me acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as your skin has been freshly cleansed right before you use this lotion and you use less than a pump (I use half and it&#x27;s plenty), your skin shouldn&#x27;t feel sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve started using this before my powder foundation for my work makeup routine and it makes my skin look so natural and soft throughout the day. From 6am to 7pm my skin still looks great; even if I take a nap, my skin looks soft and surprisingly not shiny when I wake up. Of course, after I wash my face at night I will use a tiny bit again just to keep it moisturized during the night. I never realized how moisturized skin was so important to its health and preventing acne. Man, I&#x27;ve learned my lesson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care what kind of skin you have, go get BB acne solutions toner and this lotion! It&#x27;s life changing, I tell you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an absolutely light and perfect lotion. Definitely recommend others purchase it as well. I gave a bottle to my mother because she has really dry skin on her face, and she&#x27;s seen a great deal of improvement.</li>
            <li> Smells great. I really liked this product, it was one of my first products with Burt Bees and I got hooked. I want the night cream next!</li>
            <li> This works great on my very dry skin. I often have difficulty finding items that offer enough moisture for my skin. The only negative is that it can take a bit of time to fully absorb, but I don&#x27;t mind because it works so well</li>
            <li> great for my 40 yr old skin</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Third time I have purchased it.</li>
            <li> i did not purchase this @ amazon but at my local drug store. i have been using this day lotion for about a week. i am 50 with dry winter skin. i have found that it moisturizes very well both am and pm and i don&#x27;t feel like i need a heavier cream at night. it sinks in fairly quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or tacky. this lotion has not caused blemishes like some others have. it also doesn&#x27;t cause my face to get bright red like some other lotions. the one complaint i have is the fragrance. to me it smells like cucumber which isn&#x27;t really all that unpleasant. the problem is that the smell lingers on my face for a couple of hours and after about 30 minutes it gets rather nauseating. i give it 4 instead of 5 stars for this reason. so if you are sensitive to fragrance, you might want to think twice. all in all i like this day lotion and if i can get used to the fragrance, i will purchase it again especially since it&#x27;s a natural product.</li>
            <li> Some ingredient had a smell that was unpleasant for me. I have used Burts Bees products for years, but this one did not work well for me.</li>
            <li> This is the PERFECT lotion. I wish it came in bigger bottles. My boyfriend and I use it all the time. Face, hands, etc.</li>
            <li> we have other lotions that seem to work just as well. It was good but we&#x27;ll keep with the old ones.</li>
            <li> I purchased this with high expectations but I ended up disappointed. It smells great, but that is about all I can say positively about it. It went on very thick, almost difficult to smooth on face and neck. It also left my face feeling and looking oily all day. I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash it off when I got home. It took two washes to remove it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have mature skin and this product is loaded with hydration without being greasy.  Good price point-.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This product is all natural without the nasty chemicals and it is super moisturizing to the face.  It goes on easy with the great little dispenser and really works well.</li>
            <li> Just a tiny pea sized squirt of this cream is enough to moisturize ones entire damp face and hands. Not only that, it leaves my skin feeling soft and firm. What more can someone ask for?</li>
            <li> Love this facecream! Feels great, makes my skin look smooth, non-greasy, and non-comedogenic means I don&#x27;t break out no matter how much I use! Love love love...</li>
            <li> Moisturizes without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Smell:good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: $5 cheaper than everywhere else&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel: Soaks right in and leaves skin soft and vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application: A little goes a LONG way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Saved me from my dry, sensitive and acne prone skin. Does not break me out. Around my eyes is brighter and less baggy. My smile lines are less noticeable as well. Very good product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for winter in the US and I really only have to apply this once in the AM and it lasted me the whole day. My face didn&#x27;t feel dry at all. I checked the ingredients and they were all pretty natural and harmless and I really do trust the brand. I am happy to get something that works for me for less than $20. Its worth a try!</li>
            <li> Light moisturizer, absorbs well, only need one pump for whole face.</li>
            <li> Burts Bees is a great product for sensitive skin. This hydration helps with preventing wind burns as well.</li>
            <li> I like this, but not as much as the night moisturizer from the same line. This is a little too light of a moisturizer personally. My skin ends up flaking if I use it for 2 days straight. I end up having to use the night moisturizer to save my skin.</li>
