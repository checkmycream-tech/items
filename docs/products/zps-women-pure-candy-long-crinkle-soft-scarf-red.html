            <li>good purchase.</li>
            <li>This scarf was very cute.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the color, size, and price of this scarf!</li>

            <li>Scarf has a nice feel.  </li>
            <li>The scarf itself is nice and as described except for one teensy detail...</li>
            <li>The scarf is very light and quite nice to wear at work.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love my scarfs.</li>

            <li> However, it is a little short.</li>
            <li> If you add white vinegar to the cold water, it locks in the color; and when you hang it to dry, it drys fast!</li>
            <li> I also noticed it is a little scratchy.</li>
            <li> I received this item and the first thing I noticed was a really bad smell.</li>
            <li> Comes twisted and then folded in package.</li>
            <li> Very thin picture is deceiving</li>

            <li> Delivered as promise.</li>
            <li> The color shown is true (at least on my computer). The scarf is very light and quite nice to wear at work.</li>
            <li> misleading product image is not the color that looks and wanted and material</li>
            <li> This scarf was very cute. However, it is a little short. If you are a heavier person, this may not be a scarf for you. I wrap my scarf to give it the appearance of an infinity scarf. That way, the scarf does not have to hang off my fat belly :-)!</li>
            <li> I received this item and the first thing I noticed was a really bad smell. It smelled kind of moldy and stale. I also noticed it is a little scratchy. I have some others that are pretty soft. It looks just like pictured so that is a plus. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love my scarfs. That tells it all. Thank you.</li>
            <li> very nice for the price.. would buy this scarf again</li>

            <li> Love it ! Thank you !</li>
            <li> Took forever to get to my home. Nice scarfs, but next time I will find similar ones for a $1 more locally.</li>
