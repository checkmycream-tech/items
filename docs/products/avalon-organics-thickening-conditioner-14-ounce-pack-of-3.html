            <li>it supposed to be good!</li>
            <li>The smell is great as well.</li>
            <li>Great conditioner without all the harmful checmicals</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>My hair feels great and it&#x27;s good to know that I&#x27;m not dumping a bunch of chemicals on my head every morning.    </li>
            <li>They smell really nice and seem to be a great product.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I got good value for my dollar . .</li>
            <li>I have used both the Avalon Organics Biotin Shampoo and Conditioner and loved both.  </li>
            <li>I was so bummed to find out they changed the product because it was so amazing.</li>
            <li>I would love to give this product 5 stars in that it does leave my hair feeling thicker FOR SURE!  </li>
            <li>If you have fine, oily hair that doesn&#x27;t tangle easily this is a great conditioner to try.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m looking for more body.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>So far so good and the product smells good, too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I have oily hair and use it every day, but sometimes I find I need a more conditioning treatment once a week because I color my hair.</li>
            <li>However it does detangle, and to save money I just use it on the ends, as those tend to be the parts needing conditioned the most.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I am sure it will work well for some who are unfamiliar with what it was like before they changed it, but for my hair it made it uber frizzy and prone to breakage.</li>
            <li>has great work to make hair clear and smooth,So I will buy it again.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine</li>
            <li>But so far good.  </li>
            <li>I first tried this product when I was deployed, it is great for dried/colored hair, can be used daily Without any problem</li>
            <li>He has a full head of hair now.</li>
            <li>Absolutely nothing works better, and it doesn&#x27;t sting the eyes in any way.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I wanted to use a shampoo/conditioner set that wasn&#x27;t full of chemicals.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and works perfectly while strengthening my hair.</li>
            <li>very good,I love the shampoo .It</li>
            <li>I really like this conditioner because it smells fresh (not floral, but more like the outdoors/forest)</li>
            <li>I enjoy this prodict very much.</li>
            <li>You only need a small amount and it works great, and has a nice herbal smell.</li>
            <li>I was mainly looking for a ph balanced shampoo and conditioner, which was cruelty free.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t say enough how healthy my hair looks (and feels) after each wash.  </li>
            <li>This product really does what it says it will, thicken your hair!  </li>
            <li>It might be better in different packaging.</li>
            <li>This shampoo seems more like a clarify product one would use occasionally.</li>
            <li>So unfortunately, I am not going to order the shampoo and conditioner again.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I love this - it really helps to keep my flat hair fuller!!</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s not harmful forthe Earth, and it leaves your hair light, soft, and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Hairs was very &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; after use</li>
            <li>I really like both the shampoo and the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It leaves a nice scent on your hair but without conditioner hair is stiff as a broom.  </li>
            <li>I loved this shampoo before they changed the formula, whatever they changed it to, it just isn&#x27;t the same and doesn&#x27;t work with my hair like the other product.</li>
            <li>Arrived promptly, and the three bottles were a decent size.</li>
            <li>I fortunately received the old formulation of the shampoo (I thought only the conditioner had changed)</li>
            <li>Too bad -- they were very good and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too bad, as the complimenting shampoo is wonderful.</li>
            <li>It is pretty thick in texture and smells okay</li>
            <li>The conditioner does not do a better job making up for the dry, stringy, hair left after shampooing.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s 67 years old and his hair has never been thicker!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s job by stripping all the dirt and oils (good &amp; bad) from the hair leaving it super gangly and unmanageably.</li>
            <li>You need to wet the lashes first and rinse with water, of course!</li>
            <li>It lathers -- which the old conditioner did not and frankly no \\&quot;conditioner\\&quot; should.  </li>
            <li>If any vendors out there have the old formulation of the shampoo and/or conditioner, would you please let me know through a comment to my review.  </li>
            <li>I like it so far, can&#x27;t attest to thickening bc</li>
            <li>Please bring back the old conditioner!!!  </li>
            <li>but I was hoping for more \\&quot;oomph\\&quot; if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li>The shampoo smells kinda funky, it is super runny but does foam a little.</li>
            <li>Love this product has made such a difference in my hair, its bringing its natural oils back and no more breakage</li>
            <li>I have been out looking for a grate organic shampoo &amp; conditioner set for weak fine hair, so when I saw this product get such high reviews</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work as dramatically well as commercial products, but natural hair products never do, since they are not loaded with chemicals.</li>
            <li>My only complaint on the conditioner is that the bottle doesn&#x27;t let the conditioner come out easily.  </li>
            <li>not great for fine hair</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This product was awful, but might be good for your horse&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li> However, it also leaves it feeling dry and &amp;#34;straw like&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I feel that this particular set sucks</li>
            <li> I have normal hair and sensitive skin - I don&#x27;t have limp or thin hair that needs thickening.</li>
            <li> After hair dries, it does look oily, but then again there is really no moisture there at all.</li>
            <li> At first I thought they had mistakenly mixed some of the shampoo in with the conditioner, but I have read that others hate the new formula too.  </li>
            <li> In the past I have also used Matrix for Men, Redken for Men and American Crew.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t weight down your hair.</li>
            <li> Slight decrease of hairfall was observed.</li>
            <li> I was looking for products that are organic and contain little or no chemicals.</li>
            <li> After reading a few reviews here I opted to buy it.  </li>
            <li> I tried an organic Lavender shampoo+conditioner and that dried out my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> in a few months I will add to review</li>
            <li> not sure about this one</li>
            <li> I purchased several of these as a set, and was so disappointed to find that they become rancid just a few days after opening them.</li>
            <li> it was messy and of course also the loss of the product that spilled out was annoying.</li>
            <li> His hair has always been very thin.</li>
            <li> Made hair feel dirty.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I re-ordered these products and received a \\&quot;new\\&quot; formulation of the Conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> My dad and I have been using this shampoo and conditioner for years. His hair has always been very thin. He has a full head of hair now. He&#x27;s 67 years old and his hair has never been thicker! I love that it&#x27;s not harmful forthe Earth, and it leaves your hair light, soft, and fluffy. It lasts forever, too. I also use the conditioner to remove my mascara. Absolutely nothing works better, and it doesn&#x27;t sting the eyes in any way. You need to wet the lashes first and rinse with water, of course!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted to use a shampoo/conditioner set that wasn&#x27;t full of chemicals.  After reading a few reviews here I opted to buy it.  So far my hair feels the same as with the previous organic shampoo.  My hair is fine and I&#x27;m looking for more body.  I&#x27;ll keep using it since I bought it but I was hoping for more \\&quot;oomph\\&quot; if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> Bought them for a my mom. it supposed to be good!</li>
            <li> Bought this based on recommendations here and I can&#x27;t say enough how healthy my hair looks (and feels) after each wash.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> I enjoy this prodict very much. I love the way it makes my hair feel. The smell is great as well.</li>
            <li> I first tried this product when I was deployed, it is great for dried/colored hair, can be used daily Without any problem</li>
            <li> I have normal hair and sensitive skin - I don&#x27;t have limp or thin hair that needs thickening. I was looking for products that are organic and contain little or no chemicals. Avalon Organic fits the bill and I use both the shampoo and conditioner. So far so good and the product smells good, too. My hair feels great and it&#x27;s good to know that I&#x27;m not dumping a bunch of chemicals on my head every morning.    I tried an organic Lavender shampoo+conditioner and that dried out my hair and scalp. In the past I have also used Matrix for Men, Redken for Men and American Crew. They just never did it for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased several of these as a set, and was so disappointed to find that they become rancid just a few days after opening them. It&#x27;s too bad, as the complimenting shampoo is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Hairs was very &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; after use</li>
            <li> not great for fine hair</li>
            <li> Great conditioner without all the harmful checmicals</li>
            <li> This product really does what it says it will, thicken your hair!  You only need a small amount and it works great, and has a nice herbal smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use this product for quite sometime now and I saw that amazon had this product avaiable so I purchase it.  The only problem I have is that the bottles came opened (the cap popped open). So it leaked  even though it was in a plastic bag it was messy and of course also the loss of the product that spilled out was annoying.</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner because it smells fresh (not floral, but more like the outdoors/forest) and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily hair and use it every day, but sometimes I find I need a more conditioning treatment once a week because I color my hair. If you have fine, oily hair that doesn&#x27;t tangle easily this is a great conditioner to try.</li>
            <li> It leaves a nice scent on your hair but without conditioner hair is stiff as a broom.  Slight decrease of hairfall was observed.</li>
            <li> I really like both the shampoo and the conditioner.  They smell really nice and seem to be a great product.  My only complaint on the conditioner is that the bottle doesn&#x27;t let the conditioner come out easily.  It might be better in different packaging. The reason for giving it only 3 stars is the difficulty of getting the conditioner out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Packaging says 70 percent organic ingredients . . .I approve. Arrived promptly, and the three bottles were a decent size. I feel like I got good value for my dollar . . .well, their dollar now. I was mainly looking for a ph balanced shampoo and conditioner, which was cruelty free. It doesn&#x27;t work as dramatically well as commercial products, but natural hair products never do, since they are not loaded with chemicals. However it does detangle, and to save money I just use it on the ends, as those tend to be the parts needing conditioned the most.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. I am sold on it! It&#x27;s thick and works perfectly while strengthening my hair. A def must.</li>
            <li> Love this product has made such a difference in my hair, its bringing its natural oils back and no more breakage</li>
            <li> Did not like this at all. Made hair feel dirty. I returned the product.</li>
            <li> I would love to give this product 5 stars in that it does leave my hair feeling thicker FOR SURE!  However, it also leaves it feeling dry and &amp;#34;straw like&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I love this - it really helps to keep my flat hair fuller!!</li>
            <li> This product was awful, but might be good for your horse&#x27;s hair! I have been out looking for a grate organic shampoo &amp; conditioner set for weak fine hair, so when I saw this product get such high reviews I was convinced that this was it! NOT!! The shampoo smells kinda funky, it is super runny but does foam a little. It feel like the shampoo does it&#x27;s job by stripping all the dirt and oils (good &amp; bad) from the hair leaving it super gangly and unmanageably. This shampoo seems more like a clarify product one would use occasionally. The conditioner does not do a better job making up for the dry, stringy, hair left after shampooing. It is pretty thick in texture and smells okay, it doesn&#x27;t weight down your hair. After hair dries, it does look oily, but then again there is really no moisture there at all. I feel that this particular set sucks, I would never buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I have used both the Avalon Organics Biotin Shampoo and Conditioner and loved both.  I was disappointed when I re-ordered these products and received a \\&quot;new\\&quot; formulation of the Conditioner.  It&#x27;s terrible!  It lathers -- which the old conditioner did not and frankly no \\&quot;conditioner\\&quot; should.  Lather is what shampoos do!  At first I thought they had mistakenly mixed some of the shampoo in with the conditioner, but I have read that others hate the new formula too.  Please bring back the old conditioner!!!  I fortunately received the old formulation of the shampoo (I thought only the conditioner had changed) but now I see \\&quot;new\\&quot; on the shampoo bottle too.  So unfortunately, I am not going to order the shampoo and conditioner again.  Too bad -- they were very good and very reasonably priced. If any vendors out there have the old formulation of the shampoo and/or conditioner, would you please let me know through a comment to my review.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> very good,I love the shampoo .It has great work to make hair clear and smooth,So I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I loved this shampoo before they changed the formula, whatever they changed it to, it just isn&#x27;t the same and doesn&#x27;t work with my hair like the other product. I was so bummed to find out they changed the product because it was so amazing. I am sure it will work well for some who are unfamiliar with what it was like before they changed it, but for my hair it made it uber frizzy and prone to breakage.</li>
            <li> not sure about this one yet I have not seen any difference so in a few months I will add to review</li>
            <li> I like it so far, can&#x27;t attest to thickening bc i just started.  But so far good.  Will use for a while.</li>
