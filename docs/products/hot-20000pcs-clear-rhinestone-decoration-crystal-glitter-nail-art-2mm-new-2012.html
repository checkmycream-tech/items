            <li>great price love them</li>
            <li>I liked it cuz of the price</li>
            <li>not as bright or glittery as i would have liked, but they are nice and tiny perfect for  a intricate design on the nails.</li>
            <li>After a &amp;#34;light bulb&amp;#34; moment I checked on Amazon and found the perfect selection, at terrific prices!</li>
            <li>I love them thank you</li>
            <li>Ok, i&#x27;ll order</li>
            <li>Okay, shipping was phenomenal, packaging as well.  </li>
            <li>i really love them,i will purchase them again,i just wish there was more colors and more sizes in this package size, please recommend something if there is</li>
            <li>There are so many.</li>
            <li>They work ok (</li>
            <li>they look like really good quality and arrived right on schedule.</li>
            <li>but it really is about 20,000pcs!!!!</li>
            <li>my daughters nails are super tiny and they are the most perfect size....</li>
            <li>Love it i am going to do my nails of just this sweet...</li>
            <li>The amount was accurate , i havent even used them they look so unapealing.</li>
            <li>They are very shiny and nicely faceted.</li>
            <li>Cheap rhinestone</li>
            <li>They are perfect for those small spots on DIY projects.</li>
            <li>Originally ordered these for nail art.  </li>
            <li>Actually, they&#x27;re better than most plastic rhinestones out there,</li>
            <li>Quick delivery as described</li>
            <li>The stones are shiny and very pretty.</li>
            <li>it came early, kids love getting jeweled fingers and toes for winter..... and doing my sis for wedding day on her wedding party toes</li>
            <li>When I ordered these I thought, that&#x27;s got to be a misprint right, 20,000?</li>
            <li>Look real cheap too long to come</li>
            <li>First, I thought it was a typo on the quantity</li>
            <li>You will want to be sure you have a container or multiple containers to put them in because they come in a bag that can not be resealed.</li>
            <li>You can never have too much sparkle on your nails!</li>
            <li>They are much taller than most stones and will probably end up on the back of my phone case.</li>
            <li>Decent quality, not quite sure if it&#x27;s actually the quantity advertised.</li>
            <li>Since I got so much, I&#x27;m using it on shirts and hats too.</li>
            <li>I really like Rhinestones (hahhah diamond look a likes..).</li>
            <li>It was packaged well and shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>will probably use these as &amp;#34;freebies&amp;#34; and mainly use on craft projects..</li>
            <li>Like many other reviewers, my bag was open inside the package, so I had a package full of loose rhinestones.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Once you open the bag get a sandwich bag ready, to put the rhinestones.</li>
            <li>I was surprised.</li>
            <li>These rhinestones are not shiny at all my bag came with most of them crushed in half.</li>
            <li>All in all, a decent buy, especially if you&#x27;re just starting out.</li>

            <li> All in all, a decent buy, especially if you&#x27;re just starting out.</li>
            <li> Came in several smaller bags and were as expected.</li>
            <li> Took almost 3 weeks to receive, but was still 2 days earlier than the earliest expected date.</li>
            <li> they look beautifull but i have to tell you the truth, they dont shine after you glue them, buy theyre ok not that bad</li>
            <li> Came as expected.  </li>
            <li> but when I received them it wasnt wat I expected.</li>
            <li> well at least not for a long, long, long time..</li>
            <li> I transferred mine to a small ziploc bag because once you open these, there&#x27;s no closing them again.</li>
            <li> Quite a mess.</li>
            <li> I used a few of those 7 day medication containers (has 7 compartments) that I had laying around the house.</li>
            <li> Waste Of $$$$$$$$$$$$ it took ages to reach,and wen</li>
            <li> I thought it would just give me a few hundred.</li>
            <li> so they,re not top quality.</li>
            <li> They came packaged in a small plastic bag that is not resealable.  </li>
            <li> They are small, as described.</li>
            <li> Tons of nail decor in one small bag.  </li>
            <li> they mean 20,000.</li>
            <li> it did arrived, i was veryyy disappointed, the stones are poor quality, and are very dul</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;ll add sparkle to nails for a very small price.  </li>
            <li> They are hard to find in a small size, and are expensive.</li>
            <li> I had to look closely but saw that they are indeed faceted; not great quality</li>
            <li> Well, I can tell you it wasn&#x27;t wrong</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> But...they aren&#x27;t the worst</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Arrived on time.  Good quality.  It&#x27;s A LOT!!!! First, I thought it was a typo on the quantity but it really is about 20,000pcs!!!! I use it to do nails art.  Since I got so much, I&#x27;m using it on shirts and hats too.</li>
            <li> These are so tiny! They are perfect for those small spots on DIY projects.</li>
            <li> Not shiny at all. They are much taller than most stones and will probably end up on the back of my phone case. I purchased these with intent on using them on nails.</li>
            <li> Shopping for rhinestones for summertime mani-pedis is an ordeal. They are hard to find in a small size, and are expensive. After a &amp;#34;light bulb&amp;#34; moment I checked on Amazon and found the perfect selection, at terrific prices! Very happy!</li>
            <li> I love them thank you</li>
            <li> When I ordered these I thought, that&#x27;s got to be a misprint right, 20,000? Ok, i&#x27;ll order but I know I&#x27;ll only receive like 2,000. Well, I can tell you it wasn&#x27;t wrong, I received a nice size ziplock bag with lots of rhinestones! Now, these are plastic, not crystal so they,re not top quality. But...they aren&#x27;t the worst and I didn&#x27;t pay the price for crystal either. Actually, they&#x27;re better than most plastic rhinestones out there, which always look domed and by the time I get a top coat on, aren&#x27;t very brilliant. These do have somefacets (cuts) on them. All in all, a decent buy, especially if you&#x27;re just starting out.</li>
            <li> These rhinestones are not shiny at all my bag came with most of them crushed in half. The amount was accurate , i havent even used them they look so unapealing. I would not repurchase</li>
            <li> Very nice bag. Would have preferred a zip lock baggie to keep my stones in.</li>
            <li> Definitely a lot in the bag.  Came as expected.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery as described</li>
            <li> Perfect no complaints</li>
            <li> Love it i am going to do my nails of just this sweet...I will do it for this summer Wow!</li>
            <li> I use a lot of these gems in my nail art designs..they look like really good quality and arrived right on schedule. I will definatly never run out.. well at least not for a long, long, long time..</li>
            <li> took forever to arrive but i got a ton like i paid for.  not as bright or glittery as i would have liked, but they are nice and tiny perfect for  a intricate design on the nails.</li>
            <li> I liked it cuz of the price but when I received them it wasnt wat I expected. And you can&#x27;t even use them to do anything with them.</li>
            <li> These are just as described. I will order again</li>
            <li> these rhinestones are amazing, all sizing, and so many!! great buy!!</li>
            <li> Look real cheap too long to come</li>
            <li> Just received these in the mail yesterday and let me tell you, when they say 20,000...they mean 20,000. I will have enough rhinestones to do manicures for years to come even if I do an entire nail in just rhinestones. They are very shiny and nicely faceted. Will make a great addition to my nail art. I also received them 2 weeks BEFORE the estimated delivery date. Excellent purchase. You will want to be sure you have a container or multiple containers to put them in because they come in a bag that can not be resealed. I used a few of those 7 day medication containers (has 7 compartments) that I had laying around the house. It took 2 of them to hold all of the rhinestones I received. You can also buy the containers here on Amazon for them. Great investment, and even better pricing!!</li>
            <li> Decent quality, not quite sure if it&#x27;s actually the quantity advertised. Like many other reviewers, my bag was open inside the package, so I had a package full of loose rhinestones. Quite a mess.</li>
            <li> they look beautifull but i have to tell you the truth, they dont shine after you glue them, buy theyre ok not that bad</li>
            <li> great price love them</li>
            <li> Okay, shipping was phenomenal, packaging as well.  However the actual rhinestones aren&#x27;t as shiny as I thought.  But hey, for the price.. I&#x27;ll be creating disco nails for a while.</li>
            <li> Took almost 3 weeks to receive, but was still 2 days earlier than the earliest expected date. They came packaged in a small plastic bag that is not resealable.  The stones are shiny and very pretty.</li>
            <li> Stones are great looks of good quality...</li>
            <li> GREAT VALUE, NICE DECORATION..</li>
            <li> I really like Rhinestones (hahhah diamond look a likes..). It is what I ordered. It was packaged well and shipped fast. I would buy from again and recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> Waste Of $$$$$$$$$$$$ it took ages to reach,and wen it did arrived, i was veryyy disappointed, the stones are poor quality, and are very dul</li>
            <li> You can never have too much sparkle on your nails!</li>
            <li> i really love them,i will purchase them again,i just wish there was more colors and more sizes in this package size, please recommend something if there is</li>
            <li> it came early, kids love getting jeweled fingers and toes for winter..... and doing my sis for wedding day on her wedding party toes</li>
            <li> oh my goodness...how wonderful this buy is....the stones are the perfect size for any nails....my daughters nails are super tiny and they are the most perfect size....great price for what you get.  you should definitely try these...you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Came in several smaller bags and were as expected. They are small, as described. Will work perfectly for the purpose that they were purchased for.</li>
            <li> Cheap rhinestone i don&#x27;t recommand it</li>
            <li> There are so many. My only side note is, it didn&#x27;t come in a reusable bag. Once you open the bag get a sandwich bag ready, to put the rhinestones.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Tons of stones.</li>
            <li> Originally ordered these for nail art.  They work ok (seemed to lose shine) will probably use these as &amp;#34;freebies&amp;#34; and mainly use on craft projects..</li>
            <li> Tons of nail decor in one small bag.  Good plastic gems, some deformed but who cares with 20K of them.  I had to look closely but saw that they are indeed faceted; not great quality but they&#x27;ll add sparkle to nails for a very small price.  I transferred mine to a small ziploc bag because once you open these, there&#x27;s no closing them again.</li>
            <li> It was a BIIIIG bag of stones! I was surprised. I thought it would just give me a few hundred.</li>
