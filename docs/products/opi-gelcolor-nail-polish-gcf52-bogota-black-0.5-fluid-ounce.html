            <li>I&#x27;m not in love with this color</li>
            <li>Love this color.  </li>
            <li>It is a prefect fall/winter shade that has a hint of purple to make it more rich.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fine for the fall.  </li>
            <li>It looks amazing on fair skin and is a colour I would wear on my toes all year round.</li>
            <li>I applied the polish about a week and a half ago and it is still beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Great color, a little bit more fun than malaga wine staying elegant and sober</li>
            <li>Very pretty color.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful color, just wish it wasn&#x27;t so messy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just started doing my own gel nails at home and have been buying different polishes through Amazon.</li>
            <li>One thing I do have to say about this polish is that it remains super glossy like that wet nails look which I love!</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable &amp; shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>it goes on easily, cures quickly, lasts well, and comes off in ten minutes with acetone on cotton wool and wrapped in foil.</li>
            <li>I threw this in the trash after the first use.  </li>
            <li>I love different colors!</li>

            <li>Exactly what she was looking for.</li>
            <li>I loved the color so much I bought it again within a few weeks.</li>
            <li>Normal polish doesnt last more then 2 or 3 days on my nails.</li>
            <li>Looks good on long and short nails.  </li>
            <li>Also I was suprised this color was very pigmented</li>
            <li>Bogota Blackberry is a great colour - a deep red, not totally opaque but close.</li>
            <li>I would rather have a matte finish, however I do own the same color in regular nail polish</li>
            <li>However, this particular bottle was unusable.</li>
            <li>It looks sophisticated and expensive, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I also love that this is both LED and UV light curable and that you can you this with any soak off gel base and top coat/sealer.</li>
            <li>getting refund or new bottle</li>
            <li>I am new to the OPI&lt;br /&gt;Soak</li>
            <li>So far I have had it on for 8 days and no chipping!</li>
            <li>it is rich but not too dark.</li>
            <li>The polish I was sent must have been old or defective.  </li>
            <li>Bogota black is a deep dark red with a light shimmer.  </li>

            <li> A little bit deeper red with sparkles.  </li>
            <li> it is a  dark red with slight shimmer in it</li>
            <li> It had sand-like particles in it that made it impossible to go on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Even with the work \\&quot;Black\\&quot; in the name, it&#x27;s not too dark.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this color nail polish for years and it never lets me down.  </li>
            <li> I think the formula is a little thick which makes it hard to do thin coats like you are supposed to with gel polishes, this caused some shrink back at the tips of the nails but nothing that was really noticable.  </li>
            <li> This polish seems to chip &amp; peel less than the cheaper polish she has tried in the past.</li>
            <li> No whites, creams or pale color will do.</li>
            <li> Terrible....brush is &#x27;bent&#x27; and wonky ...</li>
            <li> The product is way too thick.</li>
            <li> The unfortunate thing is that I didn&#x27;t read anywhere in the description whether or not the color was matte or a pearl finish.</li>
            <li> On my fingers too, except that I get bored faster there!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed for an OPI product. :0</li>

            <li> I have been wearing this color nail polish for years and it never lets me down.  I get lots of compliments on my nails because of the color.  I cannot see changing my color unless the mfg stops making it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color but polish runs off the nail before you can cure it.  Very disappointed for an OPI product. :0(</li>
            <li> I purchased this item from NailPolishandMore (great seller btw). I have to say while I love the color I think the formula is a little thick which makes it hard to do thin coats like you are supposed to with gel polishes, this caused some shrink back at the tips of the nails but nothing that was really noticable.  Also I was suprised this color was very pigmented and I maybe could have gotten away with one coat. I also love that this is both LED and UV light curable and that you can you this with any soak off gel base and top coat/sealer.So far I have had it on for 8 days and no chipping! Normal polish doesnt last more then 2 or 3 days on my nails. I definitly recommend this color it is a  dark red with slight shimmer in it but nothing over powering. One thing I do have to say about this polish is that it remains super glossy like that wet nails look which I love!</li>
            <li> Great color, a little bit more fun than malaga wine staying elegant and sober</li>
            <li> My wife was very happy with this polish &amp; has purchased several colors since. The price was reasonable &amp; shipping was quick. This polish seems to chip &amp; peel less than the cheaper polish she has tried in the past.</li>

            <li> The polish I was sent must have been old or defective.  It had sand-like particles in it that made it impossible to go on smoothly.  The brush was splayed, also.  I contacted the seller about this, but got not reply.  I would think twice before buying from this seller!!</li>
            <li> Very pretty color.  Only a tiny chip after ten days</li>
            <li> Terrible....brush is &#x27;bent&#x27; and wonky ... polish has bubbles or something in it....getting refund or new bottle</li>
            <li> I have used Gel soak off polish now polish for a couple of years now. I am new to the OPI&lt;br /&gt;Soak off polishes. I have been very pleased with all of the colors I have tried. Bogota black is a deep dark red with a light shimmer.  I applied the polish about a week and a half ago and it is still beautiful.  (I used Belisha foundation and top coat). I would recommend this polish.</li>
            <li> I threw this in the trash after the first use.  Tooooo runny! Beautiful color, just wish it wasn&#x27;t so messy.</li>
            <li> Love this color it is rich but not too dark. Shimmery maroon but not glittery. Great fall and winter color.</li>
            <li> I love different colors! No whites, creams or pale color will do. Bogota will surprise you it is a luscious color</li>
            <li> I love OPI gel polish. However, this particular bottle was unusable. The product is way too thick. Will the seller resolve this issue for me?</li>
            <li> I love Gelcolor - it goes on easily, cures quickly, lasts well, and comes off in ten minutes with acetone on cotton wool and wrapped in foil. Bogota Blackberry is a great colour - a deep red, not totally opaque but close. It looks amazing on fair skin and is a colour I would wear on my toes all year round. On my fingers too, except that I get bored faster there!</li>
            <li> The unfortunate thing is that I didn&#x27;t read anywhere in the description whether or not the color was matte or a pearl finish. That&#x27;s very important for me. I would rather have a matte finish, however I do own the same color in regular nail polish so I kept this one.</li>
            <li> Immediately after I bought and used Bogota Blackberry for the first time, the bottle broke at the neck in my polish box. I loved the color so much I bought it again within a few weeks. It is a prefect fall/winter shade that has a hint of purple to make it more rich. It looks sophisticated and expensive, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not in love with this color but it&#x27;s fine for the fall.  I will wear it because I paid for it but I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this color.  A little bit deeper red with sparkles.  I wore it all summer and will continue to into the fall.  Versatile and beautiful.  Can&#x27;t beat OPI</li>
            <li> Exactly what she was looking for.</li>
            <li> Great Color, love OPI gel Polish</li>
            <li> This color is beautiful and very rich looking.  Looks good on long and short nails.  Even with the work \\&quot;Black\\&quot; in the name, it&#x27;s not too dark.</li>
