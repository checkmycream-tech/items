            <li>We have used this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>An oldie but a goody :)</li>
            <li>Vitapointe has been around for more than 40 years.  </li>
            <li>Vitapointe is 100% oil just whipped up with air, compared to many hairdress cremes that are a mixture of oil and water.  </li>
            <li>yes, although the company has changed hands (no longer Clairol), it&#x27;s still works better than any of the many hair products on the market.</li>
            <li>THIS IS A DISCONTINUED PRODUCT THAT I HAVE USED FOR MANY MANY YEARS.  </li>
            <li>This change is not for the better although the product is still  acceptable.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair look fantastic!</li>
            <li>Often times the tried and true is better than experimentation!</li>
            <li>We need more if it is available.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very effective at providing a nice sheen and eliminating the dry, fly-away aspect to her hair.</li>
            <li>This hair creme is the only thing that makes my hair look beautiful every day.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, I was able to purchase this item on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Super stuff!</li>
            <li>Light, not too oily.</li>
            <li>I love the convenient large size because it is cheaper in the end and don&#x27;t have to order as often.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again, but it&#x27;s not a bad product in any way.</li>
            <li>Love love loved it, used it back in the day, rediscovered it last month,</li>
            <li>Have used this product for many years , but company was sold and new owner has changed formula without obvious  reason or explanation to many loyal users.  </li>
            <li>I would never recommend this for people with oily hair, or people with European very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>This was just what my hair needed to get back to those natural curls I once loved.</li>
            <li>Very light and nongreasy, and gives my hair a terrific shine.</li>
            <li>and I am on my first.</li>
            <li>Yes, this product has changed in appearance and seems oilier, but it still revitalizes my hair like no other product available in stores.  </li>
            <li>I always get positive remarks about the sheen in my hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it!!</li>
            <li>Vita point is a light cream hairdress that also provides a little volume to those with fine hair.  </li>
            <li>And I can fine it only at amazon.i</li>
            <li>I was looking for a product with more of a moisturizer finish as i have very dry</li>
            <li>Several years ago I used this - it was a light creamy hair dressing.  </li>
            <li>Works very well for my husband</li>
            <li>Bring back the original formula.</li>
            <li>have been using it for years, much better thank any other product.</li>
            <li>New formula seems to be more like a hair wax then a grease less cream.  </li>
            <li>look and don&#x27;t feel I need to add any other product to achieve a satisfying finish to my daily</li>
            <li>Started with this product when a teenager with naturally blond hair.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be like the original, although it is a little mushy.</li>
            <li>this was hard to fine beenusing</li>
            <li>If you have hair that &amp;#34;reverts&amp;#34; back to its original state when it encounters humid conditions, like my African-American hair, a little bit of this will help.</li>
            <li>Not up to old standard.  </li>

            <li> Use sooooo little and it does so much!</li>
            <li> So after years I went back to use it when I went all natural with my multi-racial hair (Black included).</li>
            <li> I purchased three jars of this product that will last me a long time.  </li>
            <li> Since using it again my hair is no longer dry and flat, but has a sheen and is fuller than before.</li>
            <li> You get what you want and in the long run it is cheaper.</li>
            <li> Have used it for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I used this product when I was younger, but as I got older the oil seemed to not agree with my skin, nothing serious.</li>
            <li> I have used Vitapointe for years for my dry, stubborn grey hair.  </li>
            <li> With age the hair starts to become dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> I am not sure when this product changed, but it is not the same as when it was Clairol Vitapointe.  </li>
            <li> Vitapointe should be consider a specialty hair creme, helpful to only those with thick hair.  </li>
            <li> This is thick hand lotion which will gum up your hair if you try to use it as a daily hairdress.  </li>

            <li> I was led to believe that this was the same product but was annoyingly disappointed to open the jar and find this similar looking paste.</li>
            <li> Use just a touch because it is really heavy.  </li>
            <li> I used vita point 20 years ago and somehow got detoured by other products that were not nearly as good as vita point.  </li>
            <li> Now, it is heavy, thick</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and recently was unable to find it anywhere.  </li>

            <li> My only hair product for years. Light, not too oily. Only takes a dab before blow drying to prevent breakage from the heat.</li>
            <li> Several years ago I used this - it was a light creamy hair dressing.  Not so anymore.  Now, it is heavy, thick and I swear just like Crisco cooking fat.  Bring back the original formula.</li>
            <li> great service and great product</li>
            <li> Great stuff, had gone to many drugstores looking for it wasting gas and time. Ordered on Amazon. Got it in a couple of days. You get what you want and in the long run it is cheaper.</li>
            <li> We have used this product for many years.  My husband uses it faithfully.  We need more if it is available.</li>
            <li> I used this product when I was younger, but as I got older the oil seemed to not agree with my skin, nothing serious. So after years I went back to use it when I went all natural with my multi-racial hair (Black included). This was just what my hair needed to get back to those natural curls I once loved. An oldie but a goody :)</li>
            <li> Have used it for a long time.  Started with this product when a teenager with naturally blond hair.  It gives a luster to the hair without a greasy shine look.  Now it does as well with my &amp;#34;graying&amp;#34; look and don&#x27;t feel I need to add any other product to achieve a satisfying finish to my daily shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Am grateful this product has remained on the market for so many years - have never found a substitute for it!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product with more of a moisturizer finish as i have very dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;I bought 3 bottles and I am on my first.Daily i am learning to appreciate it.&lt;br /&gt;Prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> Seems to be like the original, although it is a little mushy.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and recently was unable to find it anywhere.  Luckily, I was able to purchase this item on Amazon.

            <li> Super stuff! My husband loves it!</li>
            <li> bought it for my MOM and if she loves it thats all that matters, so get it for your MOM....</li>
            <li> this was hard to fine beenusing since I was a little girl ilove the way feels on my hair me greasy feeling</li>
            <li> Love love loved it, used it back in the day, rediscovered it last month, great conditioner</li>
            <li> been using this for over 1p years. love it!</li>
            <li> The scent takes getting used to. I jokingly call it &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; fragrance. But it&#x27;s nice in the hair and does a great job of moisturizing and conditioning. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again, but it&#x27;s not a bad product in any way.</li>
            <li> I have always liked - used it for many years.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT MET ALL MY EXPECTATIONS</li>
            <li> have been using it for years, much better thank any other product.</li>
            <li> Works very well for my husband</li>
            <li> I am not sure when this product changed, but it is not the same as when it was Clairol Vitapointe.  Just doesn&#x27;t seem or work the same.  I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Vita point is a light cream hairdress that also provides a little volume to those with fine hair.  I used vita point 20 years ago and somehow got detoured by other products that were not nearly as good as vita point.  Since using it again my hair is no longer dry and flat, but has a sheen and is fuller than before. Often times the tried and true is better than experimentation! Please try it!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and meet all my needs for my hair, The shipping was excellent received it ahead of time.</li>
            <li> It was exactually what i wanted. A good product. I can always find what i need thru Amazon.</li>
            <li> Not up to old standard.  Different formula than clairol.  Whats up!!! Greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  It works for me.</li>
            <li> Yes, this product has changed in appearance and seems oilier, but it still revitalizes my hair like no other product available in stores.  I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This product  seemed way past its &#x27;Due date&#x27; when compared to a retail purchase.</li>
            <li> Vitapointe has been around for more than 40 years.  I used it as a teenager and it has not changed.  Vitapointe is 100% oil just whipped up with air, compared to many hairdress cremes that are a mixture of oil and water.  If you have hair that &amp;#34;reverts&amp;#34; back to its original state when it encounters humid conditions, like my African-American hair, a little bit of this will help. Use just a touch because it is really heavy.  I use lighter hairdress cremes (those mixed with water) just before I set my hair when a little moisture helps. I would never recommend this for people with oily hair, or people with European very fine hair.  Vitapointe should be consider a specialty hair creme, helpful to only those with thick hair.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> This was used on my hair when I was younger and I now use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair. Love this product!</li>
            <li> i think the company was sold.  formula was changed.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the past 20 years and yes, although the company has changed hands (no longer Clairol), it&#x27;s still works better than any of the many hair products on the market.</li>
            <li> With age the hair starts to become dry and brittle.

So, I was happy to see that I could order it in Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as the original Vitapointe, but acceptable.</li>
            <li> This works perfectly with my natural curly hair</li>
            <li> Moisturizes  your hair well.</li>
            <li> If you are used to using the Vitapointe daily hairdress \\&quot;Salon Formula\\&quot;...this is not it.  This is thick hand lotion which will gum up your hair if you try to use it as a daily hairdress.  The \\&quot;Salon Formula\\&quot; is a much lighter product which will not gum up your hair and is intended for daily application after you have washed your hair and towel dried.  I was led to believe that this was the same product but was annoyingly disappointed to open the jar and find this similar looking paste.</li>
            <li> I always get positive remarks about the sheen in my hair. Use sooooo little and it does so much! Best buy of 2014!</li>
            <li> I luv vita pointe. And I can fine it only at amazon.i give it a 5 rating</li>
            <li> I love the convenient large size because it is cheaper in the end and don&#x27;t have to order as often.</li>
            <li> My wife,is very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I have used Vitapointe for years for my dry, stubborn grey hair.  It leaves the hair manageable and with a pleasant shine.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A DISCONTINUED PRODUCT THAT I HAVE USED FOR MANY MANY YEARS.  I MIGHT HAVE TO SWITCH AFTER THIS ONE IS GONE.</li>
            <li> Hair Nice, I have used this hair product for 25-30 years on my hair, keeps your hair glowing &amp; flawless and its nice not greasy at all, love it !</li>
            <li> Have used this product for many years , but company was sold and new owner has changed formula without obvious  reason or explanation to many loyal users.  New formula seems to be more like a hair wax then a grease less cream.  This change is not for the better although the product is still  acceptable.  Have to wonder if this version is cheaper to manufacturer !</li>
            <li> Very light and nongreasy, and gives my hair a terrific shine. Makes my hair look fantastic! I started using it over 25 years ago and I still keep coming back to it.</li>
            <li> good product, good price,  I would recommend this product to anyone that would like to add some control to their hair.</li>
            <li> This version leaves your hair greasy.</li>
            <li> Works great, just a dab is all you need.</li>
