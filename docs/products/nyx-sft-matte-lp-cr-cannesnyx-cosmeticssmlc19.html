            <li>I like to put lip balm before using any kind of lipstick</li>
            <li>I was enthusiastic about this product from the reviews I read.</li>
            <li>still nice though</li>
            <li>Love love love this product!!</li>
            <li>But it does have a nice velvety texture and is perfect for more natural days.</li>
            <li>perfect natural color</li>
            <li>A beautiful, warm, mid-toned peachy-pink that works very well with my NC-20 complexion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s a lovely warm shade that goes with so many of my clothes and accessories.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE BUY ASAP</li>
            <li>so I was expecting somewhat more of a liquid lipstick.</li>
            <li>This is more of a pigmented lipgloss.</li>
            <li>but I love it anyways.</li>
            <li>A bluer spectrum would&#x27;ve been a better choice I guess.</li>
            <li>You will be satisfied with your purchase.</li>
            <li>Love to top with a lighter gloss</li>
            <li>Love this color and product.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite color of the NYX line.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you moisturize your lips though.</li>
            <li>Love nyx matte lip cream in ever shade.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I DO love NYX matte, and I love the &amp;#34;Cannes&amp;#34; color.</li>
            <li>I love that it is sort of a &amp;#34;neutral&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Beverly Hills- Veronica&amp;#34;, but not too sure since I have not tried it just yet.</li>
            <li>Omg I&#x27;m truly In Love.</li>
            <li>About To Purchase My Second Tube Of This Wonderful Product.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly and the applicator makes it easy to apply with precision.  </li>
            <li>Great color, and NYX makes such beautiful products for reasonable prices...</li>
            <li>eventually the entire NYX lip cream collection when I have some more money to spare because I love these more than any lip gloss or lipsticks that I own love it!</li>
            <li>Creamy dries matte easy to remove</li>
            <li>the color sticks to the lips and does not transfer easily.</li>
            <li>The color is beautiful (especially when combined with a darkbrown lipliner) and it does not smudge.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a great color and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Medium in fit me 210</li>
            <li>It has a great finish and I would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li>My skin tone is a light to medium olive tone, and this color looks like a pinky nude on me.  </li>
            <li>And I have light skin</li>
            <li>It is really easy to apply, and the colour is incredibly natural and amazing.</li>
            <li>Also love the smell, to me it smells something like butterscotch or marshmallows when you first apply it.</li>
            <li>far as the matte part, I have seen other types of lip stains more matte than this but for being a &amp;#34;lip gloss&amp;#34; style it is perfect anyways.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend actually commented on it and said it is nice to be able to kiss me without worrying about getting the lipstick on his lips.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect lip color, that is bold enough for glam... but still looks like a natural lip color.</li>
            <li>love that it really is creamy.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t worn it for a full day</li>
            <li>It is more of a rose pink</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>did some research before ordering it because I am brown skin and was not sure if the shade would be ideal to my skin color.</li>
            <li>Extremely satisfied with this product overall; not brown, but a nice, warm mauvey pink color.</li>
            <li>but it was a pastel pink and way too bright on me</li>
            <li>Love nyx soft matte lip creams.</li>
            <li>but totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Love this natural nude-pink color.</li>
            <li>I own more then a few!</li>
            <li>I love that this is a true &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; and goes on so nicely, lasting all day.</li>
            <li>, it was more rose pink (think old roses)</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS COLOR SIMILAR TO NYX MAUVE AND KYLIE</li>
            <li>(think the gloss-less and frost-less eras-- real Diva stuff!)</li>

            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Pretty color.  </li>
            <li>Shipped and delivered EXTREMELY fast!</li>
            <li>so you either use it over a lipliner or keep it in your bag all day ;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty fair skinned and this color doesn&#x27;t make me too pale.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a nice &amp;#34;vintage&amp;#34; style to wear and looks very much like Hollywood of old!</li>
            <li>The color is slightly pinker than I expected but still very beautiful.</li>
            <li>It looks a little more red than brown to be honest</li>
            <li>It lasts pretty much all day.</li>
            <li>Pretty color with a very matte finish.</li>
            <li>Although make sure you exfoliate and moisturize your lips because it can become dry</li>
            <li>What I misjudged was the orange spectrum and how this color really brings out the &amp;#34;coffee&amp;#34; in my teeth.</li>
            <li>I stop buy absolutely adore this color.</li>
            <li>I expected this color to be a more rust color.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this</li>
            <li>Free shipping is an extra plus as well!</li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented.</li>
            <li>Slightly darker than I expected, but still a very nice tone.</li>
            <li>and the feel is velvety smooth on the lips, it does dry to matte</li>
            <li>Applies so smoothly and doesn&#x27;t make my lips feel dry at all.</li>
            <li>The NYX soft matte lip cream came 3 days!!</li>
            <li>Definitely a new fave.</li>
            <li>I am in love with Nyx soft matte lipsticks and this color is SOO pretty and natural looking, also it doesn&#x27;t dry your lips to the extreme</li>
            <li>i love this lip cream its a wet to dry it</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and is a little drying.  </li>
            <li>I got a tube of this in Giant Eagle, I expected a light brown</li>
            <li>I had never used a NYX Soft Matte Lip Cream before</li>
            <li>I recommend the Soft Matte Lip cream to everyone.</li>
            <li>Natural color</li>
            <li>Those of you that have lovely sparkling white, bleached teeth can carry this off without any trouble.</li>
            <li>;) - the only con I&#x27;ve noticed is it fades away in a short time</li>
            <li>A little pricy for something worth $5.99.</li>
            <li>It looks completely natural especially that it&#x27;s matte!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It will mute freckles if they&#x27;re already a little pale and adds a few years to my age, appearance wise because of that.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry completely matte either.</li>

            <li> I got a tube of this in Giant Eagle, I expected a light brown</li>
            <li> I had never used a NYX Soft Matte Lip Cream before</li>
            <li> I recommend the Soft Matte Lip cream to everyone.</li>
            <li> Natural color</li>
            <li> Those of you that have lovely sparkling white, bleached teeth can carry this off without any trouble.</li>
            <li> ;) - the only con I&#x27;ve noticed is it fades away in a short time</li>
            <li> A little pricy for something worth $5.99.</li>
            <li> It looks completely natural especially that it&#x27;s matte!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It will mute freckles if they&#x27;re already a little pale and adds a few years to my age, appearance wise because of that.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry completely matte either.</li>
            <li> Stays put for a long time and doesn&#x27;t transfer.</li>
            <li> 5 days earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t find this to dry out my lips at all.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure if it needs to frequently be re applied, but I wore it for an evening</li>
            <li> so a little balm prior to applying it should prevent creases on the lip.</li>
            <li> Its pink.</li>
            <li> A DARK PINK 😩😠</li>
            <li> slightly orangier toned than expected</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s what I expected!!!</li>
            <li> I bought Istanbul a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> It seems dried out as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an everyday wear.</li>
            <li> My lips feel so dried out after wearing it.</li>
            <li> this Is My Everyday Lippie.</li>
            <li> Not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li> so I bought it even thought I felt bad spending $10 on this</li>
            <li> so I thought it would look bad..</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed the color wasn&#x27;t</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it! Great neutral color</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS COLOR SIMILAR TO NYX MAUVE AND KYLIE JENNER LIP LOVE LOVE LOVE BUY ASAP&lt;br /&gt;Hispanic&lt;br /&gt;Brown eyes&lt;br /&gt;Medium in fit me 210</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect peachy color. It dries matte &amp; stays on if you apply a lip primer and lip liner. But I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s for every lipstick.</li>
            <li> Great with lip liner if you&#x27;re darker tone. It lasts pretty much all day.</li>
            <li> doesnt STAY ON as desired</li>
            <li> Wonderful! Although make sure you exfoliate and moisturize your lips because it can become dry</li>
            <li> amaizing!!!!  I love it!!</li>
            <li> I had never used a NYX Soft Matte Lip Cream before so I was expecting somewhat more of a liquid lipstick. This is more of a pigmented lipgloss. It doesn&#x27;t dry completely matte either. But it does have a nice velvety texture and is perfect for more natural days. If you want longer wear I&#x27;d suggest pairing this with a lipliner.</li>
            <li> Love nyx soft matte lip creams. I own more then a few! Creamy dries matte easy to remove</li>
            <li> The color is slightly pinker than I expected but still very beautiful. The product smells like cupcakes!! and the feel is velvety smooth on the lips, it does dry to matte so a little balm prior to applying it should prevent creases on the lip.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Just the one I wanted. 😍😍😍</li>
            <li> A little pricy for something worth $5.99. The NYX soft matte lip cream came 3 days!! 5 days earlier than expected! Over all great deal.. I love the matte lip cream in the color cannes perfect dupe for Kat Von D lolita!</li>
            <li> Love love love this product!! The color is beautiful (especially when combined with a darkbrown lipliner) and it does not smudge. My boyfriend actually commented on it and said it is nice to be able to kiss me without worrying about getting the lipstick on his lips. This is a must have girls!</li>
            <li> Loved the color! Loved this way it looks on my lips!</li>
            <li> slightly orangier toned than expected</li>
            <li> It is more of a rose pink rather brown but I love it anyways. I&#x27;m pretty fair skinned and this color doesn&#x27;t make me too pale. I like to put lip balm before using any kind of lipstick so I don&#x27;t find this to dry out my lips at all. It has a great finish and I would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> I love that this is a true &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; and goes on so nicely, lasting all day. What I misjudged was the orange spectrum and how this color really brings out the &amp;#34;coffee&amp;#34; in my teeth. A bluer spectrum would&#x27;ve been a better choice I guess. Still, it&#x27;s a lovely warm shade that goes with so many of my clothes and accessories. Those of you that have lovely sparkling white, bleached teeth can carry this off without any trouble. It&#x27;s such a nice &amp;#34;vintage&amp;#34; style to wear and looks very much like Hollywood of old! (think the gloss-less and frost-less eras-- real Diva stuff!)</li>
            <li> Beautiful color. I bought Istanbul a few weeks ago but it was a pastel pink and way too bright on me but this color is absolutely perfect. I will probably buy 2 or 3 more at Ulta next time I stop buy absolutely adore this color. One of my friends uses this product and it looks amazing on her so I bought it even thought I felt bad spending $10 on this but totally worth it. It&#x27;s $5.99 at Ulta so I&#x27;ll probably buy multiples there and eventually the entire NYX lip cream collection when I have some more money to spare because I love these more than any lip gloss or lipsticks that I own love it!</li>
            <li> lighter than picture shows but it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li> A great matte lip color. Applies so smoothly and doesn&#x27;t make my lips feel dry at all. Also love the smell, to me it smells something like butterscotch or marshmallows when you first apply it. Stays put for a long time and doesn&#x27;t transfer.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. You will be satisfied with your purchase. Arrives on time. Beautiful color!</li>
            <li> i love this lip cream its a wet to dry it lasts me all day and you cant beat the price!</li>
            <li> Pretty color with a very matte finish. Love to top with a lighter gloss and it is the perfect neutral lip!</li>
            <li> Great lipstick!!! One of my favorites. Complements my olive tone skin.</li>
            <li> Pretty color.  It dries my lips.</li>
            <li> I expected this color to be a more rust color. Its pink. It seems dried out as well. I was enthusiastic about this product from the reviews I read. I really wanted to like this but I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice lip cream!  It&#x27;s a matte lip color but it&#x27;s not drying, which is a definite plus.  It goes on very smoothly and the applicator makes it easy to apply with precision.  My skin tone is a light to medium olive tone, and this color looks like a pinky nude on me.  It&#x27;s not a stain, so it does need to be re-applied after eating or drinking.  All in all, I&#x27;d recommend it.  I plan on getting more colors!</li>
            <li> Slightly darker than I expected, but still a very nice tone. Not overwhelming at all. Favorite every day color, will be buying again! I recommend the Soft Matte Lip cream to everyone.</li>
            <li> Love this color and product.</li>
            <li> I love the finish matte look !</li>
            <li> Shipped and delivered EXTREMELY fast! Free shipping is an extra plus as well! Ordered this on Oct.1 and received it on Oct. 4. Extremely satisfied with this product overall; not brown, but a nice, warm mauvey pink color. I looove the matte finish! Definitely a new fave. (Looks perfect with Mac&#x27;s lip liner in Whirl) This was for sure my best Amazon experience. :)</li>
            <li> Cruelty free, great color and texture. Really like it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite color of the NYX line.  It goes on smooth and is a little drying.  The color payout is great.  Make sure you moisturize your lips though.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping! It&#x27;s such a great color and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I THOUGHT THIS COLOR WAS A SHADE OF BROWN.....WHEN I RECEIVED IT IT WAS  A DARK PINK 😩😠 BUT ITS STILL NICE😕</li>
            <li> Love this natural nude-pink color. It&#x27;s an everyday wear.</li>
            <li> I got a tube of this in Giant Eagle, I expected a light brown, it was more rose pink (think old roses) still nice though but I was disappointed the color wasn&#x27;t brown.&lt;br /&gt;It will mute freckles if they&#x27;re already a little pale and adds a few years to my age, appearance wise because of that.</li>
            <li> Love nyx matte lip cream in ever shade. Cannes is a great nude and feels great on my lips.</li>
            <li> These lipstick smells delicious and it stays on. If you don&#x27;t have big lips you should try this, because it stays put and doesn&#x27;t transfer. Very pigmented.</li>
            <li> the color sticks to the lips and does not transfer easily. It is a beautiful color</li>
            <li> Love it. And I have light skin so I thought it would look bad..but it didn&#x27;t. Great Fall, nude type color</li>
            <li> I DO love NYX matte, and I love the &amp;#34;Cannes&amp;#34; color. It is the perfect lip color, that is bold enough for glam... but still looks like a natural lip color. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is how drying it is!!! My lips feel so dried out after wearing it. That is why I only gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> A beautiful, warm, mid-toned peachy-pink that works very well with my NC-20 complexion.&lt;br /&gt;Pleasant vanilla scent, too, which is not too over-whelming.</li>
            <li> perfect natural color</li>
            <li> This colour has become one of the things I never want to run out of! It looks completely natural especially that it&#x27;s matte! It is really easy to apply, and the colour is incredibly natural and amazing. PLUS a very good price too! ;) - the only con I&#x27;ve noticed is it fades away in a short time so you either use it over a lipliner or keep it in your bag all day ;)</li>
            <li> I just bought this lip cream about 2 days ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did some research before ordering it because I am brown skin and was not sure if the shade would be ideal to my skin color. But it looks great!! I love that it is sort of a &amp;#34;neutral&amp;#34; shade that can be worn with almost anything, or for any occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the matte part, I have seen other types of lip stains more matte than this but for being a &amp;#34;lip gloss&amp;#34; style it is perfect anyways. Not shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it really is creamy. I haven&#x27;t worn it for a full day so I am not sure if it needs to frequently be re applied, but I wore it for an evening and i did not have to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely going to buy this in a different shade when I make up my mind what shade it is I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like it is a dupe to &amp;#34;Anastasia Beverly Hills- Veronica&amp;#34;, but not too sure since I have not tried it just yet.</li>
            <li> Omg I&#x27;m truly In Love. this Is My Everyday Lippie. About To Purchase My Second Tube Of This Wonderful Product.</li>
            <li> I am in love with Nyx soft matte lipsticks and this color is SOO pretty and natural looking, also it doesn&#x27;t dry your lips to the extreme it&#x27;s the perfect amount.</li>
            <li> Great shade and great finish!! Recommend! I was happy to find it here on amazon since it was sold out on the official website nor Nordstrom stores.</li>
            <li> Amazing, great staying power, feels good on your lips</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep buying this. It&#x27;s the best</li>
            <li> It looks a little more red than brown to be honest</li>
            <li> There is nothing I don&#x27;t love about this stuff! The color is perfect for my skin tone.. It&#x27;s a bit pinker than it looks in the image. Google swatches if you&#x27;re concerned about it. Others have mentioned that it&#x27;s drying to your lips, but I haven&#x27;t experienced that at all.</li>
            <li> Natural color and it&#x27;s what I expected!!!</li>
            <li> Great color, and NYX makes such beautiful products for reasonable prices... it&#x27;s a god send in this world of overpriced makeup.</li>
