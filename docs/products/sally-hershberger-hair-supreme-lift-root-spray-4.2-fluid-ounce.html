            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love how my hair looks.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this is not my favorite.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best to get volume while you dry!</li>
            <li>Product is weightless and easily applied.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, but a lot of it</li>
            <li>This product is reasonably priced, smells great and really works!  </li>
            <li>I have medium fine hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is baby fine</li>
            <li>and this did nothing at all for my fine to medium hair, not layered but highlighted hair.  </li>
            <li>The scent is fine too.</li>
            <li>Sally H. really makes amazing products, I&#x27;m a HUGE fan.</li>
            <li>Instead, I use biosilk or got 2b \\&quot;smooth operator\\&quot; lotion at the ends.  </li>
            <li>This works so well, my daugher used mine and liked it so much that I oreder this for her.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any significant &amp;#34;life&amp;#34; from this spray.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, straight hair that has no inherent body whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Saw this product advertised elsewhere and thought It looked worth trying.</li>
            <li>Sally Hershberger products for thin hair are the best I have used yet, note..</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and flowing (not stiff) with nice height and volume.</li>
            <li>Nexxus makes a pretty good root boosting foam for much less that is somewhat comparable.</li>
            <li>Seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>I know I purchased it in a local store before, but can no longer find it and was so pleased to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This product is just ok, is not a big deal.</li>
            <li>I am giving this product a 5 star rating because it really does do what it says it does!  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly what was in this bottle</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This stuff works, and keeps working the next day or more.</li>
            <li>I have very thin hair, and this product Works great!</li>
            <li>Great for fine thin hair!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just too healthy and too flat.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and not much of it</li>
            <li>Finally a product that works for my fine colored treated hair.</li>
            <li>then I use a brush to brush it in the opposite direction and it reallllly makes a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ready to be styled or just leave it as is.</li>
            <li>Jury&#x27;s still out on whether I&#x27;ll shell that much moolah out for this product again.</li>
            <li>is too much for my hair.  </li>
            <li>It adds body and my hair looked much fuller since I started using it</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>Very please with results.  </li>
            <li>Be careful about using it on top hair (versus roots).</li>
            <li>As a person with fine hair that tends to get flat, I truly appreciated this spray.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine long hair</li>
            <li>I have long fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have thin, dry hair and this stuff is wonderful!  </li>
            <li>Compared to other products by this company this was a great let down.</li>
            <li>Recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Using a metal round brush when blow drying, this product gives my hair incredible volume and changes the texture in a way that holds my hairstyle all day instead of going flat just a short while later.</li>
            <li>Glad I tried it the inexpensive way (small bottle via Amazon) and didn&#x27;t buy the pricey &#x27;set&#x27; as advertised.</li>
            <li>It will hold like a 1950&#x27;s hairspray-- strong but a little plastic like.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m better off paying the few extra dollars at ulta!</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes.  </li>
            <li>but if i spray it on 4 layers of roots (each side of the had), blow dry it up, flip over blue dry, then lightly ratt with a pic...</li>
            <li>And you really need less of the product than more, so the small bottle goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Miracle product from my fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>I have short, thin, fine hair and EVERY product I try</li>
            <li>I have really thin, fine hair and this product adds volume and definitely lifts and \\&quot;puffs\\&quot; out my hair.  </li>

            <li> Then I blow dry it until it&#x27;s about 50-60% dry</li>
            <li> I put it on while before I blow dry my hair.  </li>

            <li> &amp; since I have gotten older it is also not as thick as it once was.  </li>

            <li> Cute bottle and smell isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I wish it were a bigger bottle, but that&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions carefully and nothing.</li>
            <li> Little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way..</li>
            <li> Just spray a little in and blow dry or not the way you want it to look.</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like is that I&#x27;m almost half way through the bottle already.</li>
            <li> either makes my hair stiff or weighs it down.  </li>
            <li> a little goes along</li>
            <li> I used it after getting a short hair cut and it made my hair feel and look thick + with body!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> and it has a tendency to go limp.</li>
            <li> my hair is up and weightlessly fluffy ALL day.</li>
            <li> It made my hair a little stiff...  </li>
            <li> I used this product for the past year</li>
            <li> No more hairspray ratted hair.</li>
            <li> Not very impressed.  </li>
            <li> , I have thin curly hair.</li>
            <li> I would reccommend this product to those experiencing the frustrating thinning of hair.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s o.k., just not great.</li>
            <li> I mean, who doesn&#x27;t want their hair to look like Meg Ryan&#x27;s?!!!  </li>
            <li> It was so bad</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> Great root lifter, leaves hair very shiny</li>
            <li> I have thin, dry hair and this stuff is wonderful!  Everything else either makes my hair stiff or weighs it down.  This gives great volume and my hair feels wonderful.  Ordering more!</li>
            <li> I have very fine, straight hair that has no inherent body whatsoever. This gives me some body, it&#x27;s definitely better than nothing, but I have found better products out there. My go-to at the moment is Goldwell Style Sign Root Lift Spray. It gives my hair a much more noticeable boost.</li>
            <li> Ok so I tried EVERYTHING on the market and this is the best root lifter by far. Little goes a long way. I have waist length, layered, medium textured, European hair...if I don&#x27;t use any product it&#x27;s just too healthy and too flat. So to play things up a bit, I spray it at the root area and I just comb it through with my fingers. I don&#x27;t want that stuff on the ends of my hair b/c it makes it puffy. Instead, I use biosilk or got 2b \\&quot;smooth operator\\&quot; lotion at the ends.  Then I blow dry it until it&#x27;s about 50-60% dry then I use a brush to brush it in the opposite direction and it reallllly makes a HUGE difference. Wha bam! It&#x27;s ready to be styled or just leave it as is. Sally H. really makes amazing products, I&#x27;m a HUGE fan. Also check out my review for: [[ASIN:B001XS0RN8 Sally Hershberger Finishing Cream for Wavy Hair - 4.2 oz.]]</li>
            <li> Best product ever well worth the $$</li>
            <li> It does what it promises! I wish it were a bigger bottle, but that&#x27;s my only complaint. Smells nice and makes styling my hair a breeze.</li>
            <li> Love this product I give it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> It gets five stars for doing what it says it will. But 3 because of the price and how long the bottle lasts. I have been using this product for a few weeks now. It definitely gives lift. I have fine hair, but a lot of it and it has a tendency to go limp. The volume from this product lasts all day and then some. What I don&#x27;t like is that I&#x27;m almost half way through the bottle already. Nexxus makes a pretty good root boosting foam for much less that is somewhat comparable. Jury&#x27;s still out on whether I&#x27;ll shell that much moolah out for this product again. It&#x27;s a good one to try, though.</li>
            <li> It works, but not like it says on TV.  Its great, and not sticky.</li>
            <li> This product is reasonably priced, smells great and really works!  I have short, thin, fine hair and EVERY product I try is too much for my hair.  This product is weightless and provides lift just like it says.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the past year then I couldn&#x27;t find it in the drug stores anymore, I have thin curly hair. It adds body and my hair looked much fuller since I started using it</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple of years and just love it.  I know I purchased it in a local store before, but can no longer find it and was so pleased to find it on Amazon.  I ordered one bottle for my sister recently to try and she said it made a big difference in giving her hair body,  I have plenty of hair but it is very fine and so I need this for body.  It works just great.  I put it on while before I blow dry my hair.  I squirt it in my hand about 6 squirts and the rub them together and rub into my hair/scalp.  Then I dry it.  Makes a big difference and holds the style for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;As always Amazon delivers fast and is a great price. Recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> This product is just ok, is not a big deal. I have read great reviews about it in some fashion blogs, so I had great expectances to use it. It works but it is not an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair, and this product Works great!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Great for fine thin hair! Will be ordering again in the future!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I have medium fine hair.  It holds my style in place and gives it body and shine without weight.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff !!! It really works. Just spray a little in and blow dry or not the way you want it to look. Perfect every time</li>
            <li> a little goes along way,,,,great stuff,,,it works!!</li>
            <li> This product works on my fine hair and The price is good for my wallet.</li>
            <li> Saw this product advertised elsewhere and thought It looked worth trying. Glad I tried it the inexpensive way (small bottle via Amazon) and didn&#x27;t buy the pricey &#x27;set&#x27; as advertised. This product didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> I am giving this product a 5 star rating because it really does do what it says it does!  My hair is baby fine &amp; since I have gotten older it is also not as thick as it once was.  Sally Hershberger&#x27;s Supreme Lift gives it much more body and oomph &amp; I can style it nicely again.  I would reccommend this product to those experiencing the frustrating thinning of hair.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve discovered as many Amazon reviewers have that some products work on some people  and this did nothing at all for my fine to medium hair, not layered but highlighted hair.  It did nothing - zero.  I followed the instructions carefully and nothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this. Does exactly what it says. Leaves hair soft and flowing (not stiff) with nice height and volume. The scent is fine too.</li>
            <li> Just so so. I didn&#x27;t see any significant &amp;#34;life&amp;#34; from this spray.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine long hair and I need to use plenty of product or my hair just lies flat against my head.  I recently switched from Bed Head Root Boost to this product.  Very please with results.  Product is weightless and easily applied.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff. It works just like it says. Amazon has it for a great price.  I&#x27;ve purchased it twice. I think it would work on all types of hair wet and dry. I use it both ways.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know exactly what was in this bottle probably just water because I&#x27;ve used this product before and it never left my hair feeling like straw! It was so bad I&#x27;ll never order from here again I&#x27;m better off paying the few extra dollars at ulta! So disappointed</li>
            <li> I ran across this product at my local Walgreen&#x27;s over a year ago, but they have now discontinued it and I had to look to Amazon to find it. It really is an amazing product for finer hair! And you really need less of the product than more, so the small bottle goes a long way. I have a shorter hairstyle and just spray the Supreme Lift in several places at the roots and then finger it through. Using a metal round brush when blow drying, this product gives my hair incredible volume and changes the texture in a way that holds my hairstyle all day instead of going flat just a short while later. I have traded all the pre-styling mousses and hair products for the Supreme Lift. I have yet to run across another product like it....give it a try!  :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products and this is my favorite. I do combine it with a nice leave in conditioner but if i spray it on 4 layers of roots (each side of the had), blow dry it up, flip over blue dry, then lightly ratt with a pic... my hair is up and weightlessly fluffy ALL day. No more hairspray ratted hair. I have long fine hair.</li>
            <li> Finally a product that works for my fine colored treated hair. I will definitely be purchasing this product again. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Sally Hershberger products for thin hair are the best I have used yet, note.. a little goes a long way..</li>
            <li> Not very impressed.  Drug store lift root sprays just as good.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.I love how my hair looks.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes.  I mean, who doesn&#x27;t want their hair to look like Meg Ryan&#x27;s?!!!  Anyway, this is not my favorite.  It made my hair a little stiff...  it&#x27;s o.k., just not great.</li>
            <li> Helped give needed volume</li>
            <li> Miracle product from my fine, thin hair. I used it after getting a short hair cut and it made my hair feel and look thick + with body! There is a BIG difference when I style my hair without this!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best to get volume while you dry!</li>
            <li> This product does work. I spray it at the roots of my hair and it appears to be fuller.  It can be reapplied if you don&#x27;t wash your hair every day.  It does a good job!</li>
            <li> Compared to other products by this company this was a great let down. Would not purchase again. The shampoo, primer and conditioner are great but not this product.</li>
            <li> Made my hair greasy, didn&#x27;t help lift. Cute bottle and smell isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I have really thin, fine hair and this product adds volume and definitely lifts and \\&quot;puffs\\&quot; out my hair.  It also holds for the entire day.  So glad I found it!</li>
            <li> This works so well, my daugher used mine and liked it so much that I oreder this for her.  She said it is the best stuff she has ever used.</li>
            <li> As a person with fine hair that tends to get flat, I truly appreciated this spray. It does not make my hair greasy. It smells nice and truly helps to lift the roosts.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and not much of it so am always trying volume products. This stuff works, and keeps working the next day or more. Be careful about using it on top hair (versus roots). It will hold like a 1950&#x27;s hairspray-- strong but a little plastic like.</li>
