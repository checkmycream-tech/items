            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be honest, for the price I wasn&#x27;t expecting the top of the line products.</li>
            <li>I was able to gather it together around my head and turn it into a cap while I waited for the dye to set.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great kit at a very affordable price.  </li>
            <li>everthing seems ok quality and fits in the pouch.</li>
            <li>I was able to get full coverage on my</li>
            <li>Cheap cheap cheap.</li>

            <li>One or two bristles on the brush got bent, but that was due to my own carelessness when I put the brush back into the back.</li>
            <li>Was so surprised by the shipping time.</li>
            <li>so far, all I&#x27;ve used is the hair dye bottle and the clips.</li>
            <li>So much easier than going to the store and buying everything individually.  </li>
            <li>Only complaint wish it came with more glove.</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the bottle, but it looks like it would work well for standard dye.&lt;br /&gt;The gloves are crap and fall apart quickly, but the cap is decent and did exactly what i needed.</li>
            <li> Especially if you like to hightlight your hair with things other than bleach kits.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like the plastic that comes on dry cleaning.</li>
            <li> The bowl is very deep and held half a package of henna hair dye.</li>
            <li> The only minus is that my kit was missing a hair clip.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to tell in this picture, but I had hoped that the neck cape would be the same vinyl material as the highlighting cap.</li>
            <li> My hair is about 1.75 feet long and fairly thick, so filling it twice</li>
            <li> a little cheapish but has everything i need.</li>
            <li> It was missing one piece, a hair clip.</li>
            <li> as soon as I saw on the package the words &amp;#34;disposable cape&amp;#34; i knew it was going to be bad.</li>
            <li> Too bad also the brush had been smushed in the bag and the bristles were bent sideways.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s hard to tell in this picture, but I had hoped that the neck cape would be the same vinyl material as the highlighting cap. Nope. as soon as I saw on the package the words &amp;#34;disposable cape&amp;#34; i knew it was going to be bad. It&#x27;s like the plastic that comes on dry cleaning. Too bad also the brush had been smushed in the bag and the bristles were bent sideways. Cheap cheap cheap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to have I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Great. just what I needed.</li>
            <li> I am just starting to color my hair myself and needed the proper tools.  This kit provided just what I needed in  bag that keeps everything together.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom who requested something like this for Christmas.  She loves this and thinks it&#x27;s perfect!!</li>
            <li> Better than expected for this low price - Should last a good while if taken care of. The brush is perfect for root touchups too!</li>

            <li> Has everything I need!! Arrived quickly too.</li>
            <li> Great value for money, I love using this kit. One or two bristles on the brush got bent, but that was due to my own carelessness when I put the brush back into the back. I could either bend them back or cut them off, but I don&#x27;t think it affects anything greatly.</li>
            <li> Nice. Came early!!! Was so surprised by the shipping time. It was missing one piece, a hair clip. So I only gave four stars.  Overall quality is still good.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be honest, for the price I wasn&#x27;t expecting the top of the line products. I needed something to mix my henna dye for my hair and this worked really well. The bowl is very deep and held half a package of henna hair dye. My hair is about 1.75 feet long and fairly thick, so filling it twice I was able to get full coverage on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The brush worked well to spread the dye and didn&#x27;t fall apart. I didn&#x27;t have to pull any stray brush hairs about of my head. I didn&#x27;t use the bottle, but it looks like it would work well for standard dye.&lt;br /&gt;The gloves are crap and fall apart quickly, but the cap is decent and did exactly what i needed. It has elastic around the neck and kept me clean. I was able to gather it together around my head and turn it into a cap while I waited for the dye to set.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t use the clips then, but have used them for other projects since, and they hold fairly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not a bad kit for the cash.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair coloring kit. It has everything you need to dye hair, whether you dye from a bottle or from a bowl with a brush. I especially like the mixing bottle and the neck/chest cover. The only minus is that my kit was missing a hair clip.</li>
            <li> I loved this product!</li>
            <li> Great kit at a very affordable price.  Materials are a bit cheap, but for the price it&#x27;s unbeatable.</li>
            <li> so far, all I&#x27;ve used is the hair dye bottle and the clips. everthing seems ok quality and fits in the pouch.</li>
            <li> Everything I need, although it would be nice to have a few more clips, but that was easily remedied by another purchase.  Excellent!</li>
            <li> So much easier than going to the store and buying everything individually.  Only complaint wish it came with more glove. But still makes it all easier. Thanks amazon</li>
