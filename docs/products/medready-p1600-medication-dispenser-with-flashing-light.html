            <li>It is WONDERFUL!!  </li>
            <li>This product works perfectly and has allowed my father to maintain his independence.</li>
            <li>Works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Wonderful.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent device for getting your meds on time each day.</li>
            <li>I am impressed with this machine.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with purchase and would recommend.</li>
            <li>Got this for my elderly mother-in-law and it works great</li>
            <li>But for anyone who has some function in that area or that just needs a reminder, this is a great tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a great place to shop AMAZON  </li>
            <li>Very nice product.</li>
            <li>The MedReady Automated Medication Dispenser is the most wonderful thing!  </li>
            <li>Her hearing is also not the best so that flashing light is a great help.  </li>
            <li>My mother&#x27;s blood pressure is good now because she isn&#x27;t forgetting her pills now with the MedReady.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly foolproof.  </li>
            <li>good device.  </li>
            <li>The battery backup is good</li>
            <li>They are very easy to set up (there is an online video), and the design is fairly well thought out.  </li>
            <li>It has kept her from having to move to a higher level of care and she is very happy about that.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and great value.</li>
            <li>And it does seem a bit cheap for the price, but it does what it is supposed to do, and when it is supposed to do it, so I am happy.</li>
            <li>My Mom tells people how wonderful it is - I think it is a relief for them also, because now they don&#x27;t stress over their meds so much.  </li>
            <li>I do believe it will help my mother-in-law stay in her own home longer.</li>
            <li>This medication dispenser works perfectly and has absolutely been a life saver.  </li>
            <li>This device is perfect to make sure I take my meds right on time.</li>
            <li>am a Parish Nurse and have recommended this product for many of our parishioners.</li>
            <li>We are extremely pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>This has alleviated this problem.  </li>
            <li>device may not be appropriate for everyone.  </li>
            <li>An aid can assist with making sure the person in fact takes the meds.&lt;br</li>
            <li>they love the buzzer to remind them to take their medications.  </li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>I had thought I would need to hire someone to come in three times a day to make sure they take their pills.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To get them to take their pills, I had to adjust the times to make sure they would be in their apartment when the alarm goes</li>
            <li>My father is always piling things on top of his unit.</li>
            <li>This was also a problem when we took a trip and something was stacked on top of the unit.</li>
            <li>This gadget is great, and real easy to use, Just remember to move the sliding door back to close when you remove top and re stock, otherwise it cannot turn off the alarm.</li>
            <li>I was very excited about the idea of this unit.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the ease of use and the secure feeling I had once it was locked.</li>
            <li>The dispenser is easy to fill and the time and alarms are easy to set.  </li>
            <li>The unit is easy to set up and easy for her to use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to program.</li>
            <li>Machine \\&quot;testing\\&quot; option works fine, however, when time is set, and pills in place, machine periodically will beep, but tray does NOT advance, and person can NOT get to pills.  </li>
            <li>My friend feels comfortable and secure - waits for the alarm to sound each morning.  </li>
            <li>Since using this my Mom is accurate in her medication regimen.</li>
            <li>As primary caregiver for 2 parentals with lots of meds for each, these dispensers have been a lifesaver.  </li>
            <li>With these machines, I can fill it up once a week, and even feel comfortable going out of town for a night or two, knowing that they cannot overdose on their meds, and then run out.  </li>
            <li>IT might be helpful if the gray cover was lightly spring loaded so that it would close automatically after she opened it to take her pills.</li>
            <li>I believe we saw this before I was familiar with the device.</li>
            <li>Probably overpriced, but then this is what we needed to make certain she is okay with her meds.  </li>
            <li>Our problem was accidentally taking too much medication - taking a dose, forgetting it was taken, and then taking more.  </li>
            <li>My mother really likes it because she is now confident that she&#x27;s taken her medication and not over-taken it.  </li>
            <li>It was well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my Mother who is becoming more forgetful.  </li>
            <li>The best money I have spent in a long time!</li>
            <li>You have to be careful when you put on the top after filling it to make sure the lever that engages with the door is in the right position, or door will not operate properly; once you figure this out, it is smooth sailing.  </li>
            <li>Someone familiar with the medication can prepare it and keep it secure and only those meds needed at a given time will be dispensed.  </li>
            <li>My mother-in-law likes to pick and choose what meds she will take and when and will often take too many of the same drug.  </li>
            <li>I should have done this months before I did - would have saved me so much headache!</li>
            <li>Had one of the units not failed, I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>For me, it was critical that I be able to trust that this device would work so that my Mother could continue to administer her medications independently and safely.  </li>
            <li>when I finally look on Amazon they had what I needed to help my parents take their medications without taking too many.    </li>
            <li>Easy to open and close and is lockable, so easier to know whether meds were taken or not for someone who may not have an aid.  </li>
            <li>The set up was easy and it worked for a short time.</li>
            <li>Not only does it perform accurately, it also reminds our mom to get up off the recliner, stretch those legs and walk to the dispenser to take her pills.  </li>
            <li>This kit (with the extra tray) is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This item worked very well.  </li>
            <li>The flashing red light was her clue.  </li>
            <li>Not flimsy but cannot take much &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>My mom is forgetful, and it did take a couple of weeks to get her used to the fact that each afternoon the alarm would go off and her meds would be in under the slide top.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased...5</li>
            <li>Very reliable so far.</li>
            <li>I can set up 2 weeks worth (twice a day) and lock it and know she can only get to what she needs.  </li>
            <li>It will catch the tab as it should and operate normally again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is an indicator light for each alarm to indicate that it is active.  </li>
            <li>She can&#x27;t take extra, only what is available in the slot.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this product for my 85 year old Mother who has some dementia, but still lives along.</li>
            <li>I do suggest ordering a refill tray with a lid if you have to transport meds to a different location, which I do, because it makes it much easier.</li>
            <li>Set the timers and the machine provides a loud beeping to let you know when to take your medicine.  </li>
            <li>The alarm is loud so it can be heard from anywhere in the house.</li>
            <li>On our unit, one of these lights did not work, so it took some testing to see whether that one was active, but once set, it worked fine, and we only used two of the four anyway.  </li>
            <li>For persons with significant difficultly with short term memory, they may not be able to develop a routine.  </li>
            <li>Need to be careful and do &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; to ensure tray is in right spot and seated well</li>
            <li>well being that this device consistently work properly in order to ensure that she take her daily medications.  </li>
            <li>Other problems were that the alarm indicator light for alarm #1 did not light and when the tray turns the top is slightly out of alignment with the tray.</li>
            <li>Works pretty much as expected.</li>
            <li>Prior to purchasing this dispenser he was taking too much medication because even with weekly pill containers, he would forget the day of the week or whether it was a.m. or p.m. and take extra doses.</li>
            <li>If she is late coming home, the meds are still available even after the alarm has sounded.  </li>
            <li>Removing and replacing the cover is not complicated, but takes a little finesse.  </li>
            <li>It was a little touchy getting it set up for the first time but</li>
            <li>This product enabled him to continue living independently in his own home for the past three years with a caretaker there only a few hours a day.</li>
            <li>It was not user friendly either - somewhat hard to open and close.  </li>
            <li>Its a Very reliable pill dispenser as expected, but I never expected the mental and emotional relief it would bring.  </li>

            <li> Its a Very reliable pill dispenser as expected, but I never expected the mental and emotional relief it would bring.  </li>
            <li> The pill compartments are a little small, so if you have a lot big pills, it can be a problem to fit them all.  </li>
            <li> Easy to read directions, however, unable to keep the machine working.  </li>
            <li> Once the medicine is taken, the cover can be left open or closed.  </li>
            <li> In 8 months of use so far, she has only forgotten a few days meds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only weak point I can identify is a pretty dinky motor that rotates the tray (sounds like a wind-up toy when it moves).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minor issue with the device.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this expensive and important medication device for my 85 year old Mother who suffers from mild dementia.  </li>
            <li> We thought it was due to an insufficiently charged back up battery, so we reset it from the beginning, but were unable to get the clock to light again.</li>
            <li> We tried all sorts of \\&quot;systems\\&quot; for helping them take their meds correctly - you name it, I tried it - I was having to go to their home and check their meds, and often re-do them, every single day.  </li>
            <li> Not what was expected.</li>
            <li> I would recommend getting this machine in place before your situation gets desperate, because even though it is easy to use, it still takes a few days for them to understand what they are supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> It is made bass-ackwards, too hard to open and close and the slots didn&#x27;t align with the contraption.  </li>
            <li> I would hands down recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after about 5 weeks the device stopped working properly - sometimes the alarm would not go off and other times the device would not reset properly, i.e. the &#x27;TBar&#x27; spring would not reset.</li>
            <li> I do keep a couple of days of \\&quot;backup\\&quot; hidden in their home, just in case of machine malfunction, but have not needed to use them.  </li>
            <li> machine is not for people who can&#x27;t set an alarm clock or handle a little bit of mechanical complexity.  </li>
            <li> If you have a parent that needs a little bit of help to remember their medicine,  this product is a miracle.  </li>
            <li> I kept it in my home and tried it a few times.  </li>

            <li> My mother&#x27;s blood pressure is good now because she isn&#x27;t forgetting her pills now with the MedReady.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product for my 85 year old Mother who has some dementia, but still lives along. Now I don&#x27;t have to call her daily to remind her about her pills and there isn&#x27;t any chance of her doubling up on doses by mistake.&lt;br /&gt;I am a Parish Nurse and have recommended this product for many of our parishioners.</li>
            <li> After I purchased this item for a 91-year-old friend, I worried that, if it malfunctioned, the friend would panic.  I kept it in my home and tried it a few times.  Then an emergency situation convinced me to install it in the care facility and to try it.  It is WONDERFUL!!  The care facility charges $550 per month to administer meds.  This device has already paid for itself.  My friend feels comfortable and secure - waits for the alarm to sound each morning.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> This product works perfectly and has allowed my father to maintain his independence.</li>
            <li> The MedReady Automated Medication Dispenser is the most wonderful thing!  I was already handling the meds for my mom.  I would set them up for the week and then put the meds away in the closet.  After finding her once with all the meds set out and mixed up, I knew the time had come to remove them from her place.  This kit (with the extra tray) is fantastic.  I can set up 2 weeks worth (twice a day) and lock it and know she can only get to what she needs.  Sometimes she thinks the alarm didn&#x27;t go off, but I will check and she will have taken the meds and forgotten.  This dispenser removes access to forgotten or future pills and alerts her to when it&#x27;s time so keeps her on schedule.  If she is late coming home, the meds are still available even after the alarm has sounded.  I no longer have to worry about danger of overdosing or taking the wrong med.</li>
            <li> This item worked very well.  I was pleased with the ease of use and the secure feeling I had once it was locked.</li>
            <li> Works but hard to get meds out .small pills will fall into next compartment.</li>
            <li> Its a Very reliable pill dispenser as expected, but I never expected the mental and emotional relief it would bring.  No more worries!!!  No more over doses!!!</li>
            <li> This thing works as advertised.  We got it for my mother to help her comply with her medication schedule.  She had morning an evening doses, so one refill would last a couple of weeks.  It has four alarms that can be set just like an alarm clock, and each time an alarm goes off, it advances one station.  There is an indicator light for each alarm to indicate that it is active.  On our unit, one of these lights did not work, so it took some testing to see whether that one was active, but once set, it worked fine, and we only used two of the four anyway.  You have to be careful when you put on the top after filling it to make sure the lever that engages with the door is in the right position, or door will not operate properly; once you figure this out, it is smooth sailing.  The audible alarm is an annoying mechanical buzzer that is not always the same loudness, but my mom couldn&#x27;t hear it anyway.  The flashing red light was her clue.  The pill compartments are a little small, so if you have a lot big pills, it can be a problem to fit them all.  One problem that could be a problem for some people is that there is no mechanism to keep an exposed dose from cycling back into the machine if the patient doesn&#x27;t remove them.  This was not a problem for us, because the doses were 12 hours apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This machine is not for people who can&#x27;t set an alarm clock or handle a little bit of mechanical complexity.  Removing and replacing the cover is not complicated, but takes a little finesse.  In our case, my mother never had to set or fill the machine because we did it for her, in part to keep her from abusing her medication.</li>
            <li> This was an answer to our prayers! We no longer worry about Mom not taking her meds or possibly overdosing.</li>
            <li> My mother-in-law likes to pick and choose what meds she will take and when and will often take too many of the same drug.  With this dispenser we no longer have that problem.  She can&#x27;t take extra, only what is available in the slot.  The dispenser is easy to fill and the time and alarms are easy to set.  We are extremely pleased with this product.  It was well worth the money.  I do suggest ordering a refill tray with a lid if you have to transport meds to a different location, which I do, because it makes it much easier.</li>
            <li> As primary caregiver for 2 parentals with lots of meds for each, these dispensers have been a lifesaver.  I ordered one to try it out, and when it worked so well, ordered another.  Our problem was accidentally taking too much medication - taking a dose, forgetting it was taken, and then taking more.  This has alleviated this problem.  We tried all sorts of \\&quot;systems\\&quot; for helping them take their meds correctly - you name it, I tried it - I was having to go to their home and check their meds, and often re-do them, every single day.  With these machines, I can fill it up once a week, and even feel comfortable going out of town for a night or two, knowing that they cannot overdose on their meds, and then run out.  I do keep a couple of days of \\&quot;backup\\&quot; hidden in their home, just in case of machine malfunction, but have not needed to use them.  I would recommend getting this machine in place before your situation gets desperate, because even though it is easy to use, it still takes a few days for them to understand what they are supposed to do.  With 2 machines, as I saw someone else recommended, I put a picture of the person whose machine it is on the machine, so there is no confusion in that regard.  I also put a note on each machine as to what time it will go off.  My Mom tells people how wonderful it is - I think it is a relief for them also, because now they don&#x27;t stress over their meds so much.  I should have done this months before I did - would have saved me so much headache!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Mother who is becoming more forgetful.  Her hearing is also not the best so that flashing light is a great help.  The unit is easy to set up and easy for her to use.  She sometimes forgets to close the gray cover and when that happens, the next set of pills does not dispense.  IT might be helpful if the gray cover was lightly spring loaded so that it would close automatically after she opened it to take her pills.</li>
            <li> Purchased two of these units.  They are very easy to set up (there is an online video), and the design is fairly well thought out.  When the alarm sounds, sliding the cover open shuts off the alarm and exposes the medication.  Once the medicine is taken, the cover can be left open or closed.  It&#x27;s fairly foolproof.  The only weak point I can identify is a pretty dinky motor that rotates the tray (sounds like a wind-up toy when it moves).  One of my units failed after two weeks -- the alarm sounded, but the tray would not rotate.  This is not good for a medication dispenser for the elderly.  Since it was in the 30-day period, the seller replaced it without my having to go to the manufacturer (I had to pay $15 shipping to return my unit) .  Don&#x27;t bother purchasing extra keys - each unit comes with 2 keys.  Had one of the units not failed, I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> If you have a parent that needs a little bit of help to remember their medicine,  this product is a miracle.  I would hands down recommend it to everyone. Works wonderfully. Set the timers and the machine provides a loud beeping to let you know when to take your medicine.  And it can be set to beep for up to 2 1/2 hours so theres no way to avoid taking your medicine.</li>
            <li> Wonderful. Easy to use and great value. I work in the medical field and one of the easiest I have seen.</li>
            <li> Not what was expected.</li>
            <li> It is so flimsy, I was afraid to put the necessary pressure on it to close it!  It is made bass-ackwards, too hard to open and close and the slots didn&#x27;t align with the contraption.  Returned it for a refund and purchased the Med-E-Lert Automatic Pill Dispenser&lt;br /&gt;by Med-e-lert...amazing!  A life saver and for only $59.95!</li>
            <li> Got this for my elderly mother-in-law and it works great and she gets her meds when needed.  Would recommend this for those that need reminding to take meds at any age.</li>
            <li> I have worked as an RN for 32 years. This gadget is great, and real easy to use, Just remember to move the sliding door back to close when you remove top and re stock, otherwise it cannot turn off the alarm.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent device for getting your meds on time each day. Has battery backup if power goes out. Need to be careful and do &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; to ensure tray is in right spot and seated well so meds will align with opening. Not flimsy but cannot take much &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; treatment&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My mom is forgetful, and it did take a couple of weeks to get her used to the fact that each afternoon the alarm would go off and her meds would be in under the slide top.  But she did get used to it.  In 8 months of use so far, she has only forgotten a few days meds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device may not be appropriate for everyone.  For persons with significant difficultly with short term memory, they may not be able to develop a routine.  But for anyone who has some function in that area or that just needs a reminder, this is a great tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to program. Has flexible options for number of times per day it will dispense meds.  Easy to open and close and is lockable, so easier to know whether meds were taken or not for someone who may not have an aid.  Even with an aid, this device is helpful. Someone familiar with the medication can prepare it and keep it secure and only those meds needed at a given time will be dispensed.  An aid can assist with making sure the person in fact takes the meds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minor issue with the device.  If the lid is removed and the plastic tab that silences the alarm is moved while that lid is off, it will no longer be in sync with the slide cover.  You will notice the cover does not close all the way.  This won&#x27;t happen often.  I believe we saw this before I was familiar with the device. But if it does occur, just remove the lid and open the slide cover. Put the lid back on with the cover open.  Lock the lid and close the cover.  It will catch the tab as it should and operate normally again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t correct this, I believe the alarm may not silence when you silde the cover open for the days meds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good device.  Very reliable so far.</li>
            <li> I have used this machine for April 2013 - it has been reliable and dependable for my dad.  I&#x27;m going to buy another.  The caregiver who fills the machines has also noted how dependable this machine has been.</li>
            <li> I purchased this expensive and important medication device for my 85 year old Mother who suffers from mild dementia.  It was critical to her well being that this device consistently work properly in order to ensure that she take her daily medications.  For me, it was critical that I be able to trust that this device would work so that my Mother could continue to administer her medications independently and safely.  Unfortunately, after about 5 weeks the device stopped working properly - sometimes the alarm would not go off and other times the device would not reset properly, i.e. the &#x27;TBar&#x27; spring would not reset. Upon receipt, I was concerned about the functionality of the device due to very poor construction and an unimpressive design.  It was not user friendly either - somewhat hard to open and close.  I would not recommend that anyone purchase this item under any circumstances.  It is made in the USA and the manufacturer should redesign the device and fix these problems.</li>
            <li> when I finally look on Amazon they had what I needed to help my parents take their medications without taking too many.    they love the buzzer to remind them to take their medications.  It is a great place to shop AMAZON  thank you.</li>
            <li> Received product as scheduled.  Easy to read directions, however, unable to keep the machine working.  Machine \\&quot;testing\\&quot; option works fine, however, when time is set, and pills in place, machine periodically will beep, but tray does NOT advance, and person can NOT get to pills.  Trying again before machine is sent back.  Directions should provide \\&quot;trouble shooting\\&quot; options.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with this machine. I do believe it will help my mother-in-law stay in her own home longer.</li>
            <li> This device is perfect to make sure I take my meds right on time. The alarm is loud so it can be heard from anywhere in the house.</li>
            <li> Works pretty much as expected. I like the ability to have multiple alarms as well. The battery backup is good but when it is operating on the backup, the clock does not show the time. Not a big deal, but a bit bothersome if one wanted to know about when the next dosage is to be dispensed (yes, this happened to my father once and he kept yelling for the time). Also, it is a bit of a challenge to set. The buttons are pretty small and not the easiest to manipulate. And it does seem a bit cheap for the price, but it does what it is supposed to do, and when it is supposed to do it, so I am happy.</li>
            <li> This works so well for my Mom who gets confused on days and times. Since using this my Mom is accurate in her medication regimen. It has kept her from having to move to a higher level of care and she is very happy about that. The best money I have spent in a long time!</li>
            <li> I was very excited about the idea of this unit. My elderly mother has been confusing her medications and I thought this would be the answer. The set up was easy and it worked for a short time. After unplugging it and moving it, the clock was no longer visible. We thought it was due to an insufficiently charged back up battery, so we reset it from the beginning, but were unable to get the clock to light again. With the clock unlit, it is impossible to set the time or the alarms. Other problems were that the alarm indicator light for alarm #1 did not light and when the tray turns the top is slightly out of alignment with the tray. I am sadly sending it back.</li>
            <li> My mother really likes it because she is now confident that she&#x27;s taken her medication and not over-taken it.  She&#x27;s even shown it to several healthcare workers who have been at her home.  We were using the week-long cases but she sometimes became confused over what day of the week it was.  It was a little touchy getting it set up for the first time but now seems to be working okay.  Probably overpriced, but then this is what we needed to make certain she is okay with her meds.  I bought the extra tray and we load it for her because of her memory issues.</li>
            <li> I bought two units: one for my mother and one for my father. They are in their 90s and each take pills three times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before these units, they would often miss pills. I had thought I would need to hire someone to come in three times a day to make sure they take their pills. With these units, they seldom miss pills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get them to take their pills, I had to adjust the times to make sure they would be in their apartment when the alarm goes off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The units seem sturdy. My father is always piling things on top of his unit. This was a problem since occasionally it caused one of the timer buttons to be pressed and turned off/on a timer. This was also a problem when we took a trip and something was stacked on top of the unit. I remedied this by putting a small piece of cardboard over the timer buttons.</li>
            <li> We purchased this three years ago for our father who has dementia.  Prior to purchasing this dispenser he was taking too much medication because even with weekly pill containers, he would forget the day of the week or whether it was a.m. or p.m. and take extra doses. This product enabled him to continue living independently in his own home for the past three years with a caretaker there only a few hours a day.</li>
            <li> Not only does it perform accurately, it also reminds our mom to get up off the recliner, stretch those legs and walk to the dispenser to take her pills.  This is a package deal!  Very pleased...5+</li>
            <li> This medication dispenser works perfectly and has absolutely been a life saver.  My elderly mother ended up in the hospital because of an overdose of 2 of her medications, it was a constant worry for me.  No more worries!</li>
            <li> Bought for my mother. Very nice product. Locked medications,so no messing with them. I am very happy with purchase and would recommend.</li>
