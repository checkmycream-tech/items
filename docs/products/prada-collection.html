            <li>The scent is balanced, feminine, sensual, and elegant.</li>
            <li>Nordstrom stores will make you samples of anything - all you need to do is ask. :)</li>

            <li>My wife love&#x27;s this stuff</li>
            <li>Love this perfume.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend Prada making the rollerballs that so many manufacturers now sell.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>But I love this smell on me.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love this fragrance if you like powdery-notes.</li>
            <li>as in many sprays-per-morning.</li>
            <li>I use Philosophy scents mostly;</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this on my wife.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>Lovely scent that lingers.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>So I found a better deal on Amazon and ordered it for her for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Wife says that it is now her favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s saying a lot since she has more than 50 bottles of perfume.</li>
            <li>If u enjoy sweetness, this is a parfum must!</li>
            <li>It seems like this perfume smells so much better in the store than on the person.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite perfumes.</li>
            <li>I will still wear it, it&#x27;s not horrible...</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>This fragrance is for you if you like others like Clean or Philosophy Amazing Grace or Michael Kors Sexy Amber.</li>
            <li>Nice clean smell..</li>
            <li>I loved it the first time I put it on but just to be sure</li>
            <li>It makes me think of Madagascar Pure Vanilla extract that is sold on Chef&#x27;s catalog website which is amazing!</li>
            <li>I first tryed this perfume at Sephora and loved it.</li>
            <li>It does disippate a bit quickly, but I think that&#x27;s just to my own nose.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very sweet smelling</li>
            <li>Just as it&#x27;s name implies, Prada Candy is a VERY sweet perfume.</li>
            <li>Light and lovely.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is sweet but light, which is nice for just about any occasion.  </li>
            <li>I loved the smell, however, I am suspicious if this is real Prada.</li>
            <li>It almost seems to change during the day from yummy sweet to a smoother, milder scent but it lasts all day!</li>
            <li>Now, I wiah I payed more but would have gotten the original one.</li>
            <li>This perfume was received VERY quickly and well wrapped.</li>
            <li>Basically this scent is way too strong and gave me a headache.</li>
            <li>I thought I was getting a good deal from a particular seller.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is probably in my top 2 or 3 right now!</li>
            <li>I have received so many compliments...not too sweet or too flowery.</li>
            <li>I love sweet perfumes so this was a hit with me.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to those who love the sweet scent.</li>
            <li>She goes through it super fast, because it smells so good.</li>
            <li>Great price &amp; instant ship</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so happy because Iused my last drop two days ago.  </li>
            <li>- once you find it it&#x27;s no longer available.</li>
            <li>I got such a great deal on this.  </li>
            <li>Someone will enjoy their Christmas.</li>
            <li>If you have used any of those products and like them you will also enjoy Prada Candy.</li>
            <li>I got a free sample of this perfume with a Nordstrom purchase.  </li>
            <li>Enjoyed the smile on my daughter&#x27;s face Christmas morning.</li>
            <li>My favorite right now.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described,Thank You!!</li>
            <li>It is a lightly vanilla-ish and caramel-ish and slightly lightly powder-ish but without being too  sweet or overpowering.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure if I enjoy it that much, anyone standing within 5 feet of me will too!</li>
            <li>(I am familiar with Prada Candy scent as I sampled at Macy&#x27;s - THIS ITEM</li>
            <li>This fragrance is love at first smell.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t received an original but a knock off perfume.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super quick!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and sweet...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the original Prada Candy</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like overpowering scents , this is soft, but sexy!</li>
            <li>Not too strong just the right amount.</li>
            <li>I used it on a special occasion.  </li>
            <li>They sell this at a large beauty retailer nearby, but Amazon&#x27;s price was better.</li>
            <li>Pure Grace, Baby Grace and Falling-in Love.</li>
            <li>I received a sample from an ad in the newspaper and ordered some right away!  </li>
            <li>the price was right!</li>
            <li>its very pleasant and not strong at all i wish it didnt finish so quick</li>
            <li>I thought it might have an overly sweet smell</li>
            <li>My wife smelled a sample of Prada in a magazine and said she liked it, so I surprised her with a bottle of it as a &amp;#34;just because&amp;#34; gift.  </li>
            <li>The scent is sweet, but not overly sweet.</li>
            <li>It is sweet but not overly so.</li>
            <li>I got a sample and love it so much that I spray it before bed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet smelling but not overpowering by any means.</li>
            <li>I love it so much and my wife does too.  </li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t like sweet scents this is not the one for you.</li>
            <li>This perfume is a sweet vanilla based perfume.</li>
            <li>Not too sweet and not too floral.</li>
            <li>This scent is so playful and sweet.</li>
            <li>It has a cotton candy sweet smell.</li>
            <li>Used parfum upon receiving it and the smell is Deliciously sweet.</li>
            <li>The scent is not as sweet and candy as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>On me, this smells woodsy with a touch of floral, not too sweet..</li>
            <li>It is subtle and smells wonderful on her.</li>
            <li>Arrival time was quick.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping, will purchase again</li>
            <li>Really really mild fragrance.</li>
            <li>My wife loves it (and we were up all night to get lucky after she got this</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and without issue.</li>
            <li>The Parfum has a slightly more sophisticated and longer lasting fragrance than the cologne</li>
            <li>Tremendous</li>
            <li>Thanks for such a great product.</li>
            <li>Wears off quickly.</li>
            <li>The bottle is very pretty too.</li>
            <li>Ty very much!</li>
            <li>I Love New York</li>
            <li>new favorite</li>
            <li>While in Atlanta I got so many compliments on my perfume that I had to purchase a new one because my daughter took mine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This smells pretty much the same on me as it does in the container, which I&#x27;m happy about.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely get more when I run out!</li>
            <li>but I liked the eau de toilette better ( A little softer)</li>
            <li>I will only buy this going forward until someone else sends me a free tester that smells better on me.</li>
            <li>Bath &amp; Body Works fruity lotion and Love&#x27;s Baby Soft.</li>
            <li>So many compliments on this soft scent.</li>
            <li>I think people who wear soft scents will love this.</li>
            <li>and it was priced right.</li>
            <li>The sweet smell is sexy at the same time.</li>
            <li>My wife found this at a major department store and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>It dries down very nicely so that the notes unfold softly with precise definition.</li>
            <li>I arrived just as it was stated I was very satisfied quality was as expected</li>
            <li>Smells great, lasts long, when it sprays it&#x27;s a nice mist, and not to heavy on the wallet!</li>
            <li>Others will say I smell nice long after I can&#x27;t smell it anymore.</li>
            <li>Beautiful and long lasting fragrance!</li>
            <li>Very soft, fresh, clean scent.</li>
            <li>Bought the Prada Candy Spray for my wife for Christmas and she loves it very much.</li>
            <li>This shipped very fast</li>
            <li>a complete scam and huge markup...</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>My second favorite perfume is L&#x27;est vi</li>
            <li>Definitely buying more.</li>
            <li>My current favorite.</li>
            <li>would definitely purchase more</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever been compelled to buy a fragrance based on it being in a magazine insert.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more when I use this up.</li>
            <li>For me there was no allergic reactions like itching, redness or break outs since I did the patch test first on inside of wrist.</li>
            <li>arrived exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>I bought my first product perfume when I was going on vacation to visit my daughter.</li>
            <li>They want 10 more words, so hear are exactly ten.</li>
            <li>I will order more in the future.</li>
            <li>and large sizes of fragrances are somewhat more likely to be counterfeited.  </li>
            <li>Feminine, sweet &amp; soft But not floral or cloying!</li>
            <li>Bought from Amazon and as always the shipping was fast, love the big bottle!</li>
            <li>I have lots of perfume and most are half full even after a year or two, not this</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a sweet but mature scent.</li>
            <li>It smells like candy while clean and fresh at the same time.</li>
            <li>Favorite perfume for everyday or for special iccasions.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and completely met my expectations.  </li>
            <li>I agree with another reviewer that said it smelled like strong alcohol and does not last at all.</li>
            <li>This one has a sweet, sexy, sensual quality without being childish or smelling like a piece of, well, candy.</li>
            <li>&amp; this is pure heaven.</li>
            <li>smells old not as fresh as if i bought it in sephora</li>
            <li>Too much alcohol</li>
            <li>I really like this scent.  </li>
            <li>And it really works for me.)  </li>
            <li>I do not believe that product is real.</li>
            <li>I am about ready for another bottle.</li>
            <li>I can really notice  the carmel in this fragrance</li>
            <li>Wish I didn&#x27;t pay so much for it.</li>
            <li>so much</li>
            <li>Love it was able to buy the bigger bottle for the price of the smaller one then shipped to my door in a short amount if time</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Arrived fast.</li>
            <li>smells too much like rubbing alcohol now</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like this scent, but it doesn&#x27;t stay with me throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>and he loves it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>so I can try it for the whole day.</li>
            <li>If not, you are probably like me and expected a heck of a lot more from Prada.</li>
            <li>Product was sent in a very timey manner.</li>
            <li>this a real Prada&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!  </li>
            <li>Being a man, I must admit many womens perfumes smell bad to me, but this one smelled very nice</li>
            <li>w other perfumed on top of, too.</li>
            <li>This is fake and, yes, too good to be true at this price.</li>
            <li>I had to order it the next day because it smells so good once it dies down.</li>
            <li>The sweet intense notes are flat and it borders on an alcohol smell.</li>
            <li>The intial spray is strong but the dry down is calm and will leave everyone you pass getting a wift of the sweet Prada note of caramel.</li>
            <li>Shipping was a little slow but otherwise perfect.</li>
            <li>So read customer feedback before purchasing from a particular seller (click the seller&#x27;s name).  </li>
            <li>We have bought this same perfume from Macy&#x27;s more than once and those have scents lasting all day.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance, my old bottle is almost empty.</li>
            <li>Anyway not only is the smell mild but its not cloying either like literal candy</li>
            <li>sure why so many reviews are screaming fake.</li>
            <li>Oddly enough, I first was able to smell this perfume in the Italy section of Epcot center in Disney.</li>
            <li>Smells like an old lady who eats too much candy.</li>
            <li>I love it because its not over powering yet I get tons of complaints everyday on it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t typically like sweet perfumes I bought a sample of it from an online site and tried it out first.</li>
            <li>I will be one of my new favorites.  </li>
            <li>This fragrance just became my new signature.</li>
            <li>i am 55 and is hard to find something sexy yet not too much for my coworkers to deal with.  </li>
            <li>so I was surprised!</li>
            <li>I have to say it smelled better in a small sample</li>
            <li>bought this for my 22 year old daughter&#x27;s birthday!</li>
            <li>Let me tell u, I applied it in the morning, maybe early afternoon, and by night time, I could still smell it on me!</li>
            <li>It is more of a vague sweet smell.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and carefully packaged.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I finally broke down and bought it.</li>
            <li>I am addicted and so glad I bought it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got sweet taste that won&#x27;t give you or other people around you a headache.</li>
            <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t travel too far, so it shouldn&#x27;t annoy your coworkers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like the old school perfume that would stay on even through the wash.</li>
            <li>I had a sample and one spray would last whole day.</li>
            <li>It is on a sweet side, but without being heavy or headachy.</li>
            <li>Ok..like this scent, not to sweet, not to heavy.</li>
            <li>the original has a lady in a black dress with yellow hair whereas the one i got didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>and occasionally I&#x27;ll try something new.  </li>
            <li>The perfumes I wear are Burberry Brit, Emporio Armani She, and Calvin Klein&#x27;s Euphoria and I was looking for something new and this is definitely it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What may be a great fit for one person, smells awful on another.</li>
            <li>Best perfume &amp; I wear it daily as a base...&amp; layer</li>
            <li>Go to a regular department store, even though you pay full price at least you get the real thing.</li>
            <li>The only down side is that it does fade a lot throughout the day, but in my opinion the scent lasts longer than many other perfumes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now who would pay this much for some smelly water in a pink box?</li>
            <li>This should be illegal to be honest.</li>
            <li>that is kind of flawed...</li>
            <li>However, even though the top was broken off, I could still use the the spray mechanism.</li>
            <li>in the country where i live for the same price you would only buy 1.7 oz..</li>
            <li>This however,  had an odd tinny twinge to it and the scent did not last for more than a half hour.</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable after comparing prices in other stores.</li>
            <li>This perfume is totally different from the perfume I received in a sample bottle from a major department store.  </li>
            <li>So as much as I like the fragrance, it is not worth the cost to me.  </li>
            <li>I wish I&#x27;d ready the other reviews prior to purchasing....</li>
            <li>I would spray it on and barely even notice it after a short while.  </li>
            <li>Like so many other perfume items at Amazon, this one goes straight to the fake item list.</li>
            <li>It has a subtle sweet smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li>Sweet but subtle.</li>
            <li>You only need a little bit and it lasts a whole work day.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love the scent.  </li>

            <li> The scent is balanced, feminine, sensual, and elegant.</li>
            <li> Nordstrom stores will make you samples of anything - all you need to do is ask. :)</li>

            <li> Love this perfume.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend Prada making the rollerballs that so many manufacturers now sell.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> But I love this smell on me.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love this fragrance if you like powdery-notes.</li>
            <li> as in many sprays-per-morning.</li>
            <li> I use Philosophy scents mostly;</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this on my wife.</li>

            <li> Lovely scent that lingers.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> So I found a better deal on Amazon and ordered it for her for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Wife says that it is now her favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s saying a lot since she has more than 50 bottles of perfume.</li>
            <li> If u enjoy sweetness, this is a parfum must!</li>
            <li> It seems like this perfume smells so much better in the store than on the person.  </li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes.</li>
            <li> I will still wear it, it&#x27;s not horrible...</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> This fragrance is for you if you like others like Clean or Philosophy Amazing Grace or Michael Kors Sexy Amber.</li>
            <li> Nice clean smell..</li>
            <li> I loved it the first time I put it on but just to be sure</li>
            <li> It makes me think of Madagascar Pure Vanilla extract that is sold on Chef&#x27;s catalog website which is amazing!</li>
            <li> I first tryed this perfume at Sephora and loved it.</li>
            <li> It does disippate a bit quickly, but I think that&#x27;s just to my own nose.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very sweet smelling</li>
            <li> Just as it&#x27;s name implies, Prada Candy is a VERY sweet perfume.</li>
            <li> Light and lovely.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is sweet but light, which is nice for just about any occasion.  </li>
            <li> I loved the smell, however, I am suspicious if this is real Prada.</li>
            <li> It almost seems to change during the day from yummy sweet to a smoother, milder scent but it lasts all day!</li>
            <li> Now, I wiah I payed more but would have gotten the original one.</li>
            <li> This perfume was received VERY quickly and well wrapped.</li>
            <li> Basically this scent is way too strong and gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a good deal from a particular seller.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is probably in my top 2 or 3 right now!</li>
            <li> I have received so many compliments...not too sweet or too flowery.</li>
            <li> I love sweet perfumes so this was a hit with me.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to those who love the sweet scent.</li>
            <li> She goes through it super fast, because it smells so good.</li>
            <li> Great price &amp; instant ship</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so happy because Iused my last drop two days ago.  </li>
            <li> - once you find it it&#x27;s no longer available.</li>
            <li> I got such a great deal on this.  </li>
            <li> Someone will enjoy their Christmas.</li>
            <li> If you have used any of those products and like them you will also enjoy Prada Candy.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this perfume with a Nordstrom purchase.  </li>
            <li> Enjoyed the smile on my daughter&#x27;s face Christmas morning.</li>
            <li> My favorite right now.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described,Thank You!!</li>
            <li> It is a lightly vanilla-ish and caramel-ish and slightly lightly powder-ish but without being too  sweet or overpowering.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure if I enjoy it that much, anyone standing within 5 feet of me will too!</li>
            <li> (I am familiar with Prada Candy scent as I sampled at Macy&#x27;s - THIS ITEM</li>
            <li> This fragrance is love at first smell.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s light and sweet...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the original Prada Candy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like overpowering scents , this is soft, but sexy!</li>
            <li> Not too strong just the right amount.</li>
            <li> I used it on a special occasion.  </li>
            <li> They sell this at a large beauty retailer nearby, but Amazon&#x27;s price was better.</li>
            <li> Pure Grace, Baby Grace and Falling-in Love.</li>
            <li> I received a sample from an ad in the newspaper and ordered some right away!  </li>
            <li> the price was right!</li>
            <li> its very pleasant and not strong at all i wish it didnt finish so quick</li>
            <li> I thought it might have an overly sweet smell</li>
            <li> My wife smelled a sample of Prada in a magazine and said she liked it, so I surprised her with a bottle of it as a &amp;#34;just because&amp;#34; gift.  </li>
            <li> The scent is sweet, but not overly sweet.</li>
            <li> It is sweet but not overly so.</li>
            <li> I got a sample and love it so much that I spray it before bed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet smelling but not overpowering by any means.</li>
            <li> I love it so much and my wife does too.  </li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t like sweet scents this is not the one for you.</li>
            <li> This perfume is a sweet vanilla based perfume.</li>
            <li> Not too sweet and not too floral.</li>
            <li> This scent is so playful and sweet.</li>
            <li> It has a cotton candy sweet smell.</li>
            <li> Used parfum upon receiving it and the smell is Deliciously sweet.</li>
            <li> The scent is not as sweet and candy as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> On me, this smells woodsy with a touch of floral, not too sweet..</li>
            <li> It is subtle and smells wonderful on her.</li>
            <li> Arrival time was quick.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, will purchase again</li>
            <li> Really really mild fragrance.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it (and we were up all night to get lucky after she got this</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and without issue.</li>
            <li> The Parfum has a slightly more sophisticated and longer lasting fragrance than the cologne</li>
            <li> Tremendous</li>
            <li> Thanks for such a great product.</li>
            <li> Wears off quickly.</li>
            <li> The bottle is very pretty too.</li>

            <li> I Love New York</li>
            <li> new favorite</li>
            <li> While in Atlanta I got so many compliments on my perfume that I had to purchase a new one because my daughter took mine.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This smells pretty much the same on me as it does in the container, which I&#x27;m happy about.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely get more when I run out!</li>
            <li> but I liked the eau de toilette better ( A little softer)</li>
            <li> I will only buy this going forward until someone else sends me a free tester that smells better on me.</li>
            <li> Bath &amp; Body Works fruity lotion and Love&#x27;s Baby Soft.</li>
            <li> So many compliments on this soft scent.</li>
            <li> I think people who wear soft scents will love this.</li>
            <li> and it was priced right.</li>
            <li> The sweet smell is sexy at the same time.</li>
            <li> My wife found this at a major department store and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> It dries down very nicely so that the notes unfold softly with precise definition.</li>
            <li> I arrived just as it was stated I was very satisfied quality was as expected</li>
            <li> Smells great, lasts long, when it sprays it&#x27;s a nice mist, and not to heavy on the wallet!</li>
            <li> Others will say I smell nice long after I can&#x27;t smell it anymore.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and long lasting fragrance!</li>
            <li> Very soft, fresh, clean scent.</li>
            <li> Bought the Prada Candy Spray for my wife for Christmas and she loves it very much.</li>
            <li> This shipped very fast</li>
            <li> a complete scam and huge markup...</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> My second favorite perfume is L&#x27;est vi</li>
            <li> Definitely buying more.</li>
            <li> My current favorite.</li>
            <li> would definitely purchase more</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever been compelled to buy a fragrance based on it being in a magazine insert.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more when I use this up.</li>
            <li> For me there was no allergic reactions like itching, redness or break outs since I did the patch test first on inside of wrist.</li>
            <li> arrived exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> I bought my first product perfume when I was going on vacation to visit my daughter.</li>
            <li> They want 10 more words, so hear are exactly ten.</li>
            <li> I will order more in the future.</li>
            <li> and large sizes of fragrances are somewhat more likely to be counterfeited.  </li>
            <li> Feminine, sweet &amp; soft But not floral or cloying!</li>
            <li> Bought from Amazon and as always the shipping was fast, love the big bottle!</li>
            <li> I have lots of perfume and most are half full even after a year or two, not this</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a sweet but mature scent.</li>
            <li> It smells like candy while clean and fresh at the same time.</li>
            <li> Favorite perfume for everyday or for special iccasions.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and completely met my expectations.  </li>
            <li> I agree with another reviewer that said it smelled like strong alcohol and does not last at all.</li>
            <li> This one has a sweet, sexy, sensual quality without being childish or smelling like a piece of, well, candy.</li>
            <li> &amp; this is pure heaven.</li>
            <li> smells old not as fresh as if i bought it in sephora</li>
            <li> Too much alcohol</li>
            <li> I really like this scent.  </li>
            <li> And it really works for me.)  </li>
            <li> I do not believe that product is real.</li>
            <li> I am about ready for another bottle.</li>
            <li> I can really notice  the carmel in this fragrance</li>
            <li> Wish I didn&#x27;t pay so much for it.</li>
            <li> so much</li>
            <li> Love it was able to buy the bigger bottle for the price of the smaller one then shipped to my door in a short amount if time</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Arrived fast.</li>
            <li> smells too much like rubbing alcohol now</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like this scent, but it doesn&#x27;t stay with me throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> and he loves it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> so I can try it for the whole day.</li>
            <li> If not, you are probably like me and expected a heck of a lot more from Prada.</li>
            <li> Product was sent in a very timey manner.</li>
            <li> this a real Prada&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!  </li>
            <li> Being a man, I must admit many womens perfumes smell bad to me, but this one smelled very nice</li>
            <li> w other perfumed on top of, too.</li>
            <li> This is fake and, yes, too good to be true at this price.</li>
            <li> I had to order it the next day because it smells so good once it dies down.</li>
            <li> The sweet intense notes are flat and it borders on an alcohol smell.</li>
            <li> The intial spray is strong but the dry down is calm and will leave everyone you pass getting a wift of the sweet Prada note of caramel.</li>
            <li> Shipping was a little slow but otherwise perfect.</li>
            <li> So read customer feedback before purchasing from a particular seller (click the seller&#x27;s name).  </li>
            <li> We have bought this same perfume from Macy&#x27;s more than once and those have scents lasting all day.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, my old bottle is almost empty.</li>
            <li> Anyway not only is the smell mild but its not cloying either like literal candy</li>
            <li> sure why so many reviews are screaming fake.</li>
            <li> Oddly enough, I first was able to smell this perfume in the Italy section of Epcot center in Disney.</li>
            <li> Smells like an old lady who eats too much candy.</li>
            <li> I love it because its not over powering yet I get tons of complaints everyday on it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically like sweet perfumes I bought a sample of it from an online site and tried it out first.</li>
            <li> I will be one of my new favorites.  </li>
            <li> This fragrance just became my new signature.</li>
            <li> i am 55 and is hard to find something sexy yet not too much for my coworkers to deal with.  </li>
            <li> so I was surprised!</li>
            <li> I have to say it smelled better in a small sample</li>
            <li> bought this for my 22 year old daughter&#x27;s birthday!</li>
            <li> Let me tell u, I applied it in the morning, maybe early afternoon, and by night time, I could still smell it on me!</li>
            <li> It is more of a vague sweet smell.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and carefully packaged.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I finally broke down and bought it.</li>
            <li> I am addicted and so glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got sweet taste that won&#x27;t give you or other people around you a headache.</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t travel too far, so it shouldn&#x27;t annoy your coworkers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like the old school perfume that would stay on even through the wash.</li>
            <li> I had a sample and one spray would last whole day.</li>
            <li> It is on a sweet side, but without being heavy or headachy.</li>
            <li> Ok..like this scent, not to sweet, not to heavy.</li>
            <li> the original has a lady in a black dress with yellow hair whereas the one i got didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> and occasionally I&#x27;ll try something new.  </li>
            <li> The perfumes I wear are Burberry Brit, Emporio Armani She, and Calvin Klein&#x27;s Euphoria and I was looking for something new and this is definitely it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What may be a great fit for one person, smells awful on another.</li>
            <li> Best perfume &amp; I wear it daily as a base...&amp; layer</li>
            <li> Go to a regular department store, even though you pay full price at least you get the real thing.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that it does fade a lot throughout the day, but in my opinion the scent lasts longer than many other perfumes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now who would pay this much for some smelly water in a pink box?</li>
            <li> This should be illegal to be honest.</li>
            <li> that is kind of flawed...</li>
            <li> However, even though the top was broken off, I could still use the the spray mechanism.</li>
            <li> in the country where i live for the same price you would only buy 1.7 oz..</li>
            <li> This however,  had an odd tinny twinge to it and the scent did not last for more than a half hour.</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable after comparing prices in other stores.</li>
            <li> This perfume is totally different from the perfume I received in a sample bottle from a major department store.  </li>
            <li> So as much as I like the fragrance, it is not worth the cost to me.  </li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d ready the other reviews prior to purchasing....</li>
            <li> I would spray it on and barely even notice it after a short while.  </li>
            <li> Like so many other perfume items at Amazon, this one goes straight to the fake item list.</li>
            <li> It has a subtle sweet smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> Sweet but subtle.</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit and it lasts a whole work day.</li>
            <li> Very subtle scent, doesn&#x27;t smell cheap-</li>
            <li> I really do not like the candy scent - not sure why I bought it - do not think it worth the cost when compare to cashmere mist.  </li>
            <li> NO matter how much I spray on me, there is very little to no scent.  </li>
            <li> The top black piece of the bottle, which is plastic, was broken.  </li>
            <li> There are other fragrances I like that cost much less and last much longer, so I will stick with them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased Prada Candy from a department store before, and I&#x27;m not sure this item is the real thing.</li>
            <li> A small amount had leaked out and the envelope was damp and very fragrant.</li>
            <li> I find that I have to spray quite a bit on though to actually smell it, and still the scent fades very rapidly, so it&#x27;s not a good use of money since this big bottle of perfume will only last</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is pricey and not as long lasting (I think)</li>
            <li> The fragrance last a long time.</li>
            <li> but it doesnt last to long &amp; made my wife doubt &amp;#34;Is</li>
            <li> I like a powdery soft, slightly spicy fragrance</li>
            <li> I like the scent, however you nearly need to use half the bottle to smell it.</li>
            <li> Disappointing because I love this scent, but will not purchase again because this is the second time this nozzle has not worked.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s some where in between natural fragrances ( cinnamon, vanilla, etc) with an ever so slight hint of musk.</li>
            <li> Bottle was much larger than I expected, and comes with a lock cap so it doesn&#x27;t leak while traveling.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> My body chemistry is strange and this smells like it is supposed to on me.  </li>
            <li> Smells similar to pink sugar.</li>
            <li> The sent lasts all day long and it is nothin over powering.</li>
            <li> The smell lingers for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It only lasts about half a day, though, so you may want a purse spray or mini to carry with you so you can reapply.  </li>
            <li> When I received the perfume, it had tiny black flakes floating in it</li>
            <li> which was the same as buy one get one half price</li>
            <li> This perfume has an amazing scent and ending up with the product I received in the mail is very disappointing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got the same caramel notes as Pink Sugar, but it&#x27;s also got a little bit of the musky aroma that I tend to favor in perfumes.  </li>
            <li> A total waste of money.</li>
            <li> , I wore it again a few days later and this was the one for me</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last but a few hours.</li>
            <li> then I expected</li>
            <li> Absolutely no staying power.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Took to long to get is my only complaint, that&#x27;s why 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I am extremely picky when it comes to scents</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle and I am usually fickle about cologne--I cannot always smell it on myself</li>
            <li> For me, the scent did not fade as quickly as other reviewer stated.  </li>
            <li> as my other ones</li>
            <li> It seems to squirt the perfume out at you and doesn&#x27;t mist/spray like other perfumes.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would be too sweet, but that has not proven to be the case.</li>
            <li> It definitely gets everyone attention and its  hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> the average scent time on your body is 1-3 hours vs. Viva La Juicy or Angel that has a scent time of over 6-10 hours.  </li>
            <li> It is not very strong so it is not an over powering smell.</li>
            <li> (Some perfumes do odd things in conjunction with my body chemistry.  </li>
            <li> I received a test bottle of this as a gift with a purchase I made previous.</li>
            <li> I found it to be a little stronger than, I thought it was...</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey</li>
            <li> When I got on Amazon to look for it, I was surprised at how expensive it is.  </li>
            <li> Almost imperceptible.</li>
            <li> Super disappointed and won&#x27;t make this mistake again .</li>
            <li> It is costly; however, the thing that disappointed me is that the fragrance faded quickly.  </li>
            <li> If you like sweet smells you really can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!!</li>
            <li> I think is a little too expensive given the fact that it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I love the smelll but it does not stay, i am very disappointed of the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s watered down with alcohol!!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t either</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s just mine</li>
            <li> But I am disappointed that the perfume does not last very long -</li>
            <li> I smelled this fragrance in an insert in a magazine at least a year ago and it has been stuck in my head ever since.  </li>
            <li> If I could still smell it at the end of the day (or at least two hours after putting it on), I would give it five stars.</li>
            <li> Its very expensive to have to apply it several times a day...</li>
            <li> Amazon sells it for much less!!!</li>
            <li> and when I did, it was subtle.</li>
            <li> So subtle.</li>
            <li> I was so shocked by how big this bottle is!</li>
            <li> Disappointed with it totally.</li>
            <li> i am not happy at all.</li>
            <li> Product knob was broken.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering, very subtle like Philosophy Almond Glaze souffle yet lingers throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Addicted!</li>
            <li> It is sad that Amazon has no policy whatsoever in verifying authenticity of perfumes sold at this site.</li>
            <li> Was scared to get fake product, but Prada Candy it is.  </li>
            <li> very poor quality,not smell anything in minutes  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this item has expired or if it is a FAKE, but there is NO SCENT!  </li>
            <li> The worst perfume in history, don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I had a very unfortunate experience so please beware.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have to keep reapplying it, which is really annoying.</li>
            <li> This can be quite annoying.</li>
            <li> I hated this scent when I tried it on in sephora.</li>
            <li> Sooo disappointed!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fake!!!!</li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>
            <li> Beware it was a fake!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I hate smelling someone coming or leaving!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product was the quality I sought for a price that blindsided me. Excellent.</li>
            <li> I tried the authentic Prada Candy at Macys and the beautiful scent lasted all day. This however,  had an odd tinny twinge to it and the scent did not last for more than a half hour. I wish I&#x27;d ready the other reviews prior to purchasing....what I received cannot be authentic.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance. I have received so many compliments...not too sweet or too flowery. I will definitely get this again.</li>
            <li> smells old not as fresh as if i bought it in sephora</li>
            <li> thanks Amazon best fragrance. Price is great</li>
            <li> Been wearing this for a year now and love it. It does disippate a bit quickly, but I think that&#x27;s just to my own nose. Others will say I smell nice long after I can&#x27;t smell it anymore. Nice to save $30+ through Amazon!</li>
            <li> Great price great product great service.</li>
            <li> Took to long to get is my only complaint, that&#x27;s why 4 stars. I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> This perfume is totally different from the perfume I received in a sample bottle from a major department store.  With that being said, you will get what you paid for.  Had I known of the drastic difference between this amazon perfume and the department store&#x27;s perfume, I would have just paid the extra dollars.  This perfume has an amazing scent and ending up with the product I received in the mail is very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift and my wife was a fan. I thought it might have an overly sweet smell but it does not. It is more of a vague sweet smell. Very nice</li>
            <li> I am extremely picky when it comes to scents but I love this scent. You only need a little bit and it lasts a whole work day. If you like sweet this scent is perfect. Plus it was a GREAT deal.</li>
            <li> Too much alcohol it&#x27;s fake!!!!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it! Bottle was much larger than I expected, and comes with a lock cap so it doesn&#x27;t leak while traveling.</li>
            <li> I really like this scent.  It&#x27;s got the same caramel notes as Pink Sugar, but it&#x27;s also got a little bit of the musky aroma that I tend to favor in perfumes.  (Caramel is one of the easiest scents to identify, I find.  And it really works for me.)  It&#x27;s not fruity and it&#x27;s not floral, and I am happy about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smells pretty much the same on me as it does in the container, which I&#x27;m happy about.  (Some perfumes do odd things in conjunction with my body chemistry.  Your mileage may vary.  If you&#x27;re concerned, get sprayed in a department store before buying!)  It only lasts about half a day, though, so you may want a purse spray or mini to carry with you so you can reapply.  The scent doesn&#x27;t travel too far, so it shouldn&#x27;t annoy your coworkers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be cautious when placing orders for fragrances online.  They are not eligible for 2-day shipping (flammable!) and large sizes of fragrances are somewhat more likely to be counterfeited.  So read customer feedback before purchasing from a particular seller (click the seller&#x27;s name).  This fragrance is probably in my top 2 or 3 right now!</li>
            <li> Came on time and I smell great</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was expecting. Very happy with my purchase. Shipping was a little slow but otherwise perfect.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product and service.</li>
            <li> Perfume scent only lasts an hour. We have bought this same perfume from Macy&#x27;s more than once and those have scents lasting all day. I do not believe that product is real.</li>
            <li> I arrived just as it was stated I was very satisfied quality was as expected</li>
            <li> She loves it, I continue buying it time after time.....not to mention I like smelling it on her also :)</li>
            <li> This scent is amazing! I haven&#x27;t noticed anyone else around wearing it so I constantly get compliments. It almost seems to change during the day from yummy sweet to a smoother, milder scent but it lasts all day! I have gotten constant inquiries! Love it!</li>
            <li> I was so shocked by how big this bottle is! Good value for the $$! Loved the scent from a magazine insert and bought on Amazon without ever seeing the bottle size in person so I was surprised!</li>
            <li> This is seriously my favorite perfume ever. Whenever I wear it, I always get asked what it is - even by strangers! It has a subtle sweet smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering. The only down side is that it does fade a lot throughout the day, but in my opinion the scent lasts longer than many other perfumes.</li>
            <li> Great price &amp; instant ship</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this item has expired or if it is a FAKE, but there is NO SCENT!  My husband ordered this for my recent birthday.  I used it on a special occasion.  NO matter how much I spray on me, there is very little to no scent.  My husband paid almost 100.00 dollars for this item. (I am familiar with Prada Candy scent as I sampled at Macy&#x27;s - THIS ITEM IS NOT THE SAME!!)  DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER.</li>
            <li> Bummer. Get what ya pay for. This perfume is clearly old and a waste of considerable bucks. The sweet intense notes are flat and it borders on an alcohol smell. Super disappointed and won&#x27;t make this mistake again . Save your money.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume! I got a couple samples of this at Nordstrom and had to have it. It was cheaper on Amazon so I jumped at it. My friend loves it too, so after using an entire 2.7 ounce bottle we went in on a bottle together. Got a atomizer and split it. I am about ready for another bottle. I have lots of perfume and most are half full even after a year or two, not this I wear it ALL the time! Every time I wear it I get compliments! I can&#x27;t describe perfume but can tell you this isn&#x27;t a floral. It lasts a long time. It&#x27;s different from anything else. I want to say if you like Bond No 9 I Love New York I think you&#x27;ll like this. They are both so different. The bottle is very pretty too.</li>
            <li> Bought the Prada Candy Spray for my wife for Christmas and she loves it very much.Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this perfume!!!  Every time i wear it I get so many compliments.  My husband loves when I wear it.  I can&#x27;t wait to put it on in the morning.  This shipped very fast and I&#x27;m so happy because Iused my last drop two days ago.  It&#x27;s my signature perfume now.  My second favorite perfume is L&#x27;est vi a Belle and sometimes i wear them together and they smell fabulous!</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this purfume it&#x27;s very sweet smelling and I felt the price was fair I would order again from this vender</li>
            <li> new favorite, i love it and always get compliments when wearing this parfum!!! good price for this bottle size for sure!</li>
            <li> Like most things Prada....a complete scam and huge markup...but the gf likes it.</li>
            <li> I really love this scent. It is a lightly vanilla-ish and caramel-ish and slightly lightly powder-ish but without being too  sweet or overpowering. My girlfriends have loved and borrowed many a spritz from this bottle of yum! The only issue is its staying power...it does seem to disappear.</li>
            <li> I always keep 2 on my shelf becuase it&#x27;s  just like naything you REALLY love - once you find it it&#x27;s no longer available. Get it while it&#x27;s on sale! I just ordered another.</li>
            <li> I can really notice  the carmel in this fragrance and I love it.  Light and lovely. One of my very favorite fragrances.</li>
            <li> My wife smelled a sample of Prada in a magazine and said she liked it, so I surprised her with a bottle of it as a &amp;#34;just because&amp;#34; gift.  When I got on Amazon to look for it, I was surprised at how expensive it is.  The 1.7-oz. bottle is only $10 cheaper than the 2.7-oz. bottle, so I bought the 2.7-oz. bottle for $75.99.  Well, it should last a while...</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance, it is very light and feminine. This is now one of my favorite parfums.</li>
            <li> i was very satisfied with the purchase.  Enjoying the oarfume.</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent and beautiful packaging. A joy to put on every day. Product arrived quickly and carefully packaged. I love it!</li>
            <li> Smells good on me but it wears off. It&#x27;s not like the old school perfume that would stay on even through the wash.</li>
            <li> Love it! Got my order in just days.</li>
            <li> Just received this in the mail. This is fake and, yes, too good to be true at this price. It&#x27;s watered down with alcohol!! Will be looking for a refund!</li>
            <li> You had the best price for the amount in the bottle and my daughter loves it! Was glad I went to your site!</li>
            <li> My Wife loved for Christmas</li>
            <li> I love the smelll but it does not stay, i am very disappointed of the product.</li>
            <li> I agree with another reviewer that said it smelled like strong alcohol and does not last at all. A total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and smells great!</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle and I am usually fickle about cologne--I cannot always smell it on myself but others notice it! I really love this fragrance!!</li>
            <li> Oddly enough, I first was able to smell this perfume in the Italy section of Epcot center in Disney. When I smelled it, I fell in love and had to have it. The scent is sweet, but not overly sweet. It has underlying notes of a flowery smell and lasts quite awhile. It is not very strong so it is not an over powering smell. I love it!</li>
            <li> This fragrance is love at first smell. It is sweet but not overly so. It dries down very nicely so that the notes unfold softly with precise definition. Although it is sweet it is a very sophisticated scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caveat, do not buy from this seller. The cost of the 2.7 oz in Saks, Neiman&#x27;s, Nordstrom&#x27;s and Bloomingdale&#x27;s is $108.  You can even get a set for the same price.</li>
            <li> Though some reviews warned that this fragrance does not have staying power I purchased anyway.  Love, love, love the fragrance so am glad I did.  It does not last for me so I just apply it 3 times a day.  Arrival time was quick.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is for you if you like others like Clean or Philosophy Amazing Grace or Michael Kors Sexy Amber. I got a sample and love it so much that I spray it before bed. It&#x27;s scent lingers and is great to put in your hair too. They sell this at a large beauty retailer nearby, but Amazon&#x27;s price was better. Very soft, fresh, clean scent.</li>
            <li> My favorite right now.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, will purchase again</li>
            <li> Love this scent!  Definitely buying more.</li>
            <li> Mine was packaged well and the Prada box was in perfect condition.  I smelled this fragrance in an insert in a magazine at least a year ago and it has been stuck in my head ever since.  I&#x27;ve worn Chanel No. 5 since I was a teenager and occasionally I&#x27;ll try something new.  I like a powdery soft, slightly spicy fragrance and this fits the bill for me.  I&#x27;m glad I finally broke down and bought it.</li>
            <li> Always get complements on this perfume .</li>
            <li> This fragrance is a top runner among my &amp;#34;favorites&amp;#34; collection. For me, the scent did not fade as quickly as other reviewer stated.  I am so glad I purchased.  Even if it does fade for you it is more of an evening scent, wear it on a date night etc. you will not be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> Do not buy this cause your wife will smell so good and now you will have competition!</li>
            <li> This perfume smells ok. It doesn&#x27;t smell the price though. And the scent doesn&#x27;t last. Disappointed with it totally. Wish I didn&#x27;t pay so much for it.</li>
            <li> Loved this perfume!  Got the largest size for a great price very quick.  It smells so good.  Always happy with Amazon purchases.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best perfumes I&#x27;ve ever smelled! I am addicted and so glad I bought it! Will definitely get more when I run out!</li>
            <li> love it im practically almost out of it and im trying to order another bottle soon im definitely satisfied with it its very pleasant and not strong at all i wish it didnt finish so quick but maybe thats my fault for applying it so much i cant help myself it smells so nice</li>
            <li> Love the way this smells</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!  I received a sample from an ad in the newspaper and ordered some right away!  Very nice, clean scent.</li>
            <li> I got such a great deal on this.  I&#x27;d been wanting this fragrance for quite some time, but found it out of my price range...then up popped Amazon!  It shipped promptly, and I am completely thrilled!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom, for Christmas last year and her birthday this year. She goes through it super fast, because it smells so good. She always gets compliments on it. It&#x27;s sweet smelling but not overpowering by any means.</li>
            <li> Really really mild fragrance. Almost imperceptible. Makes me wonder if it has been diluted????</li>
            <li> I loooove this perfume. My current favorite. It is on a sweet side, but without being heavy or headachy. Very subtle scent, doesn&#x27;t smell cheap- which makes it so much better than something like Juicy Couture.</li>
            <li> Recipient loves this perfume. I love the smell of it but also was pleased with the price of this perfume through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Basically this scent is way too strong and gave me a headache. Its VERY sweet smelling!! Gross. Smells like an old lady who eats too much candy. Please go text at your local department store before buying!!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it (and we were up all night to get lucky after she got this and I took a whiff).  This should be illegal to be honest.</li>
            <li> Prada Candy is a beautiful fragrance. I always get stopped and asked what fragrance I&#x27;m wearing when I use it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume of all time.  I receive many compliments when I wear this.  I love the name and look of the bottle!</li>
            <li> Love the perfume and the scent. would definitely purchase more perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;I got many compliments on how good I smelled at work from coworkers.</li>
            <li> Love it was able to buy the bigger bottle for the price of the smaller one then shipped to my door in a short amount if time</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this wonderful perfume for my best friends Birthday. After I read some reviews, alotta them said, when they received the perfume it was leaking. Not this time! Yaay! I&#x27;m extremely happy with it n so is she. Ty very much! Have a wonderful amazing day!</li>
            <li> perfume is awesome, this is the scent i was looking for ages, it makes my day and my mood!&lt;br /&gt;and i payed quite nice price for 2.7 oz,  in the country where i live for the same price you would only buy 1.7 oz.. so i am glad i bought it. :)</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! It smells great! It&#x27;s not often that a women&#x27;s perfume does to me what a man&#x27;s does...and I&#x27;m sure if I enjoy it that much, anyone standing within 5 feet of me will too! I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Not too strong just the right amount. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a great parfum!</li>
            <li> I love this product! Smells great, lasts long, when it sprays it&#x27;s a nice mist, and not to heavy on the wallet!</li>
            <li> This perfume is yummy smelling and the scent last all day. I have found my signature scent. I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Arrived fast. Smells so good and love the bottle. My friends and family all want to get some.&lt;br /&gt;Sexy scent but not over powering.</li>
            <li> Was at my door the next day, Amazing !!!! Exactly as described,Thank You!!</li>
            <li> FIVE STARS!!! My daughter just loves this!!!&lt;br /&gt;Always the best price!!!</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a good deal from a particular seller. When I received the perfume, it had tiny black flakes floating in it and it did not smell like the prada candy in the stores. So watch who you are buying from!</li>
            <li> Perfect from purchase to smelling AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I received a test bottle of this as a gift with a purchase I made previous. I work with only men and they followed me around all day! This is by far the best smelling perfume I have ever worn. Within one day of using the tester, I ordered this bottle and recieved it in two business days. Before the tester was even gone. I will only buy this going forward until someone else sends me a free tester that smells better on me. Very happy with the product and the turn around time to receive my product.</li>
            <li> Nice clean smell.. Everyone is always asking me what is it that you are wearing.. I bought my mother and my sister this for Christmas and they love it!</li>
            <li> I already use Prada Candy but it cost much more in store  so I purchased  2 which was the same as buy one get one half price</li>
            <li> Daughter is very happy.</li>
            <li> I love it so much and my wife does too.  I love when she smells of this perfume it sets my soul on fire!!!!!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and without issue. Someone will enjoy their Christmas.</li>
            <li> Horrible! Beware it was a fake!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Wife loves it so I love it. Lol.</li>
            <li> Great, good quality product and I love it. I will be ordering this again in the future.</li>
            <li> I have to say it smelled better in a small sample smells too much like rubbing alcohol now</li>
            <li> I love fragrance and this one worked for me.  I tried it in Latvia, wore it all day and still wanted to buy it.</li>
            <li> I was so used to using Chanel Mademoiselle but this fragrance won me over. A vendor at Macy&#x27;s provided me with a sample and I got hooked.</li>
            <li> This smells like grown up cotton candy! I&#x27;ve had so many compliments on how good I smell that I can&#x27;t even count!</li>
            <li> The perfumes I wear are Burberry Brit, Emporio Armani She, and Calvin Klein&#x27;s Euphoria and I was looking for something new and this is definitely it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This perfume has that, something, that gets my attention like my others but with a twist. This one has a sweet, sexy, sensual quality without being childish or smelling like a piece of, well, candy. It&#x27;s definitely a grown up scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard others say it smells like caramel cotton candy or cajeta (a Mexican version of caramel candy) but it took me forever to pick that up and when I did, it was subtle. That&#x27;s just me though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t like sweet scents this is not the one for you. I usually don&#x27;t either but this one is just, special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is pricey and not as long lasting (I think) as my other ones but I really do love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes are Caramel, Musk, Vanilla, and Benzoin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a bit of extra info (:&lt;br /&gt;Because I don&#x27;t typically like sweet perfumes I bought a sample of it from an online site and tried it out first. I loved it the first time I put it on but just to be sure, I wore it again a few days later and this was the one for me</li>
            <li> My body chemistry is strange and this smells like it is supposed to on me.  One of my favorite fragrances.</li>
            <li> Great perfume!  Great price!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and a great value. She loves it. Thanks</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! If you like sweet smells you really can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!! I get so many compliments on this!</li>
            <li> All I can say is love, love, love this fragrance. The Parfum has a slightly more sophisticated and longer lasting fragrance than the cologne but both are wonderful scents and you can&#x27;t beat the price that you find on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This perfume was received VERY quickly and well wrapped. The scent is WONDERFUL! It kinda does smell like \\&quot;Smarties\\&quot; candy. Mmmmm</li>
            <li> LOVE the fragrance, but just evaporates immediately!  Sooo disappointed!</li>
            <li> Bought as gift for wife.  She loves it and I do too.</li>
            <li> I love the scent.  It is authentic!  Would buy again</li>
            <li> Very nice, i loved it.</li>
            <li> I really like this scent, but it doesn&#x27;t stay with me throughout the day. I have to keep reapplying it, which is really annoying. If I could still smell it at the end of the day (or at least two hours after putting it on), I would give it five stars.</li>
            <li> nice fragrance but I liked the eau de toilette better ( A little softer)</li>
            <li> Great price and arrived quickly. Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like overpowering scents , this is soft, but sexy! I will be one of my new favorites.  Bought from Amazon and as always the shipping was fast, love the big bottle!</li>
            <li> I have not bought from this seller, but I have been in love with this scent since it came out. I get compliments on it every day, everyone asks about it. The scent is balanced, feminine, sensual, and elegant. There is nothing \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; of \\&quot;sugary\\&quot; about it. I do have to say, however, a scent smells differently on everyone. What may be a great fit for one person, smells awful on another. I suggest you get a sample and try it at home, not at the cosmetic counter. Nordstrom stores will make you samples of anything - all you need to do is ask. :)</li>
            <li> Addicted! Sweet but subtle.</li>
            <li> very poor quality,not smell anything in minutes  I lost my money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased Prada Candy from a department store before, and I&#x27;m not sure this item is the real thing.</li>
            <li> Great Product.  Fast shipment.</li>
            <li> This perfume is a sweet vanilla based perfume. I love it because its not over powering yet I get tons of complaints everyday on it. Smells similar to pink sugar.</li>
            <li> Wife loved it for Christmas. Very good price.</li>
            <li> i am not happy at all. i didn&#x27;t received an original but a knock off perfume. the original has a lady in a black dress with yellow hair whereas the one i got didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Just as it&#x27;s name implies, Prada Candy is a VERY sweet perfume. I love sweet perfumes so this was a hit with me. The only thing I did not like about this perfume is the bottle nozzle. It seems to squirt the perfume out at you and doesn&#x27;t mist/spray like other perfumes. This can be quite annoying. Not sure if it&#x27;s just mine that is kind of flawed...haha. Either way, I find a way to rub this lovely sent on myself. It&#x27;s a great price and I was pleasantly pleased with this purchase. I would buy this again. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Product knob was broken. Perfime does not spray out properly. Product does not smell the same as orinal through regular retailers I have purchased this item before and love this is not the same.</li>
            <li> I hated this scent when I tried it on in sephora. I sprayed some on my neck and wrist but I didn&#x27;t like it until I got home.  I couldn&#x27;t stop smelling it and smiling it&#x27;s a sweet but mature scent. I had to order it the next day because it smells so good once it dies down.</li>
            <li> My Fiance LOVES this stuff.</li>
            <li> i loved the smell but it goes away within two hours! I bought a good size bottle and went through it in no time ... I think is a little too expensive given the fact that it doesn&#x27;t last. Is almost as wearing a body spray from Bath &amp; Body Works</li>
            <li> I like the scent, however you nearly need to use half the bottle to smell it. It doesn&#x27;t last but a few hours. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for this price at all. The seller was Amazon so I&#x27;m assuming its legit fragrance.</li>
            <li> Got this for my sis for Xmas. Came in a cute box &amp; smells so good, &amp; sweet. Would def recommend!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume ever.  I get tons of compliments on it. I 💗 it!</li>
            <li> Ok..like this scent, not to sweet, not to heavy. It would be good for any age...good  buy, good price, nice buy...</li>
            <li> The spray nozzle does not work so now I can&#x27;t use the perfume. Disappointing because I love this scent, but will not purchase again because this is the second time this nozzle has not worked.</li>
            <li> Arrived perfectly, great price.</li>
            <li> bought this for my 22 year old daughter&#x27;s birthday! She loved this scent the minute it came out. Amazon sells it for much less!!!</li>
            <li> Not too sweet and not too floral. This is a really great scent for winter or summer. I get a lot of compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. It&#x27;s not overpowering, it&#x27;s just right, smells great. I received this as a gift and it was priced right.</li>
            <li> I smelled this Prada Candy Eau De Parfum in a magazine insert at an office and just HAD to have it!  This is the first time I have ever been compelled to buy a fragrance based on it being in a magazine insert.  (Mine was purchased at a department store, not on-line.)  I absolutely LOVE the fragrance.  It is costly; however, the thing that disappointed me is that the fragrance faded quickly.  I would spray it on and barely even notice it after a short while.  So as much as I like the fragrance, it is not worth the cost to me.  There are other fragrances I like that cost much less and last much longer, so I will stick with them.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom for Christmas. It was wonderful and the price was excellent!</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my daughters she loves this fragrance and was very happy to receive. Very pleased with this purchase. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This makes my wife happy...  I really like making her happy !!!</li>
            <li> Love this product totalng compared to everything I ever used.  Tremendous and I would purchase again.  Thanks for such a great product.</li>
            <li> I love the scent - But I am disappointed that the perfume does not last very long - the average scent time on your body is 1-3 hours vs. Viva La Juicy or Angel that has a scent time of over 6-10 hours.  Its very expensive to have to apply it several times a day...but I do love how it smells!</li>
            <li> I really do not like the candy scent - not sure why I bought it - do not think it worth the cost when compare to cashmere mist.  Will not buy this product again.  I would recommend it to those who love the sweet scent.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and completely met my expectations.  Smells just as good as it did on the sample.  Will definitely buy more when I use this up.</li>
            <li> Favorite perfume for everyday or for special iccasions. Feminine, sweet &amp; soft But not floral or cloying! Def fan of vanilla flavored anything- &amp; this is pure heaven. Rcv compliments everytime w this one- from Men &amp; Women. Best perfume &amp; I wear it daily as a base...&amp; layer w other perfumed on top of, too.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, my old bottle is almost empty. So I purchased a new one for an excellent price.</li>
            <li> Wears off quickly. I don&#x27;t think this is parfum...maybe colored water. Want a refund now!</li>
            <li> My wife love&#x27;s this stuff and I agree.  Its a real nice fragrance, going to make a great gift.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume.  It is a combination of all the scents I love best.  I even searched on line to find &amp;#34;mini bottles&amp;#34; to keep in my bag.  I would recommend Prada making the rollerballs that so many manufacturers now sell.</li>
            <li> This scent is so playful and sweet. I love it. It has a cotton candy sweet smell. I felt instantly attracted to it.  But who knows, everyone&#x27;s noses and body chemicals are different.  It might smell different on you.  But I love this smell on me.</li>
            <li> The perfume, which is in a glass bottle, was mailed in a bubble padded envelope. A small amount had leaked out and the envelope was damp and very fragrant.The top black piece of the bottle, which is plastic, was broken.  I was amazed that the glass didn&#x27;t break considering how it was mailed. However, even though the top was broken off, I could still use the the spray mechanism.</li>
            <li> Wife requested it via a smell strip.  I ordered it and she has been delighted.  I was afraid it would be too sweet, but that has not proven to be the case.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the fragrance &amp; the price was right!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love this fragrance if you like powdery-notes. I use lots of fragrance.. as in many sprays-per-morning. This lasts all day and even my olfactory-challenged husband can smell this and he loves it as much as I do. I use Philosophy scents mostly; Pure Grace, Baby Grace and Falling-in Love. If you have used any of those products and like them you will also enjoy Prada Candy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this scent. This is my forth bottle and I love it. Smells very nice and I get tons of compliments. Shipping was super quick!</li>
            <li> WOW!!!  So good.  I love this on my wife.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this perfume with a Nordstrom purchase.  I fell in love with it.  Then my husband bought the bottle for me for Christmas.  It smells like candy while clean and fresh at the same time.</li>
            <li> Used parfum upon receiving it and the smell is Deliciously sweet. The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering, very subtle like Philosophy Almond Glaze souffle yet lingers throughout the day. For me there was no allergic reactions like itching, redness or break outs since I did the patch test first on inside of wrist. Anyway not only is the smell mild but its not cloying either like literal candy it&#x27;s some where in between natural fragrances ( cinnamon, vanilla, etc) with an ever so slight hint of musk. It makes me think of Madagascar Pure Vanilla extract that is sold on Chef&#x27;s catalog website which is amazing!</li>
            <li> The best!  Lovely scent that lingers.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift, she loved it.</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised, no problems at all.  Shop with confidence.</li>
            <li> My favorite, very light.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. So subtle. I receive lots of compliments on it. I recommend this to all women eveywhere.</li>
            <li> great fragrance and was better then I expected</li>
            <li> I first tryed this perfume at Sephora and loved it. So I ordered sample vials online so I can try it for the whole day. Let me tell u, I applied it in the morning, maybe early afternoon, and by night time, I could still smell it on me! The sweet smell is sexy at the same time. I love it.</li>
            <li> the scent stays with me all day! use the body lotion with the perfume...love this perfume!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves Prada but I don&#x27;t like the prices at department stores. I purchased the perfume from Amazon at a great price. Enjoyed the smile on my daughter&#x27;s face Christmas morning.</li>
            <li> My wife found this at a major department store and fell in love with it. So I found a better deal on Amazon and ordered it for her for Christmas. It arrived in plenty of time and she wears it every day.</li>
            <li> Wife says that it is now her favorite perfume.  That&#x27;s saying a lot since she has more than 50 bottles of perfume.</li>
            <li> This was a present for my wife, she had seen it in a magazine and a got it for her as a Christmas present. The fragrance last a long time.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s Prada, but the name is not enough to sell me on this perfume. I don&#x27;t think this scent at all lives up to expectation. It smells like a blend of Bath &amp; Body Works fruity lotion and Love&#x27;s Baby Soft. If that&#x27;s your thing, I say go for it. If not, you are probably like me and expected a heck of a lot more from Prada.</li>
            <li> Product was sent in a very timey manner. The sent lasts all day long and it is nothin over powering. I would definately suggest this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I had a sample and one spray would last whole day. This one is sold by Amazon and it lasts no longer than one hour!!! Now, I wiah I payed more but would have gotten the original one.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very nice, I smelled it in a magazine so ordered it from Amazon. I find that I have to spray quite a bit on though to actually smell it, and still the scent fades very rapidly, so it&#x27;s not a good use of money since this big bottle of perfume will only last a couple months if you want to smell nice every day.</li>
            <li> Thought about returning it but don&#x27;t think you can return perfume.  Absolutely no staying power.  I spray on A TON. And no one can even smell it.  The worst perfume in history, don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Please do not spend your hard-earned money on this counterfeit item. I had a very unfortunate experience so please beware. Like so many other perfume items at Amazon, this one goes straight to the fake item list. It is sad that Amazon has no policy whatsoever in verifying authenticity of perfumes sold at this site. Very disappointing. I will not buy perfumes from Amazon again. Go to a regular department store, even though you pay full price at least you get the real thing.</li>
            <li> If u enjoy sweetness, this is a parfum must! Whenever I wear it, which is often, I get compliments all day. Men and Women stop me as I walk by, and ask me &amp;#34;what are you wearing it smells nice?!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Perfume not as lasting as the last time I purchased her</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t love it more!</li>
            <li> arrived exactly as promised. a+ seller!</li>
            <li> It seems like this perfume smells so much better in the store than on the person.  But my friend loves it and that is all that matters.  I found it to be a little stronger than, I thought it was...</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling cologne ever.  I ordered one for my mom also and she loves it.  The smell lingers for a long time.  It definitely gets everyone attention and its  hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> just received my bottle and it smells amazing! just like the sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not sure why so many reviews are screaming fake.</li>
            <li> A girl wanted them.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;It came.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it.&lt;br /&gt;Mission accomplished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now who would pay this much for some smelly water in a pink box?</li>
            <li> we loved the size of the bottle, the scent........but it doesnt last to long &amp; made my wife doubt &amp;#34;Is this a real Prada&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I loved the smell, however, I am suspicious if this is real Prada. The smell fades within minutes of spraying. Anyone else have that problem? For now on I am going to stick with Sephora.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes. It&#x27;s light and sweet... It wears well throughout the day, and for any occasion.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t get enough of it, it will always sit on my dresser!</li>
            <li> Smells just like the department store but way cheaper.</li>
            <li> Very happy for this purchase. It&#x27;s the original Prada Candy I&#x27;d recognize it in a million. Beautiful and long lasting fragrance! Very good deal.</li>
            <li> Wonderful and got it quickly.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. The scent is not as sweet and candy as I was hoping for. Was thinking of a cotton candy/,lollipop smell. I will still wear it, it&#x27;s not horrible... But won&#x27;t purchase a seCond time</li>
            <li> I love the scent of Prada Candy! It&#x27;s intoxicating and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> This perfume is so beautiful. It has a lasting scent and definitely doesn&#x27;t need several sprays. It lasts quite a while on me. I wouldn&#x27;t wear it as a signature scent but I love it. The intial spray is strong but the dry down is calm and will leave everyone you pass getting a wift of the sweet Prada note of caramel.</li>
            <li> I like it like it....</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my wife on Christmas. It is a little pricey but she absolutley loves this fragerance. Being a man, I must admit many womens perfumes smell bad to me, but this one smelled very nice</li>
            <li> I bought my first product perfume when I was going on vacation to visit my daughter. While in Atlanta I got so many compliments on my perfume that I had to purchase a new one because my daughter took mine.  The fragrance is sweet but light, which is nice for just about any occasion.  The perfume also stays with you so you only need one application.</li>
            <li> Great smelling product...good price at time of purchase</li>
            <li> So many compliments on this soft scent. The only way I can describe it is yummy! If you want everyone to say&amp;#34;You smell so good!&amp;#34;, this is a must try!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Came just as described. smells great!</li>
            <li> HAD TO SEND BACK  THIS FRAGRANCE HAD NO AROMA</li>
            <li> Smells heavenly yet not overpowering!  The price was great compared to stores and free shipping!  It am in love with this perfume!  i am 55 and is hard to find something sexy yet not too much for my coworkers to deal with.  I hate smelling someone coming or leaving!  Smells like candy yet it is still alluring.  I like non floral scents and more earthy smells, but this really is a nice scent.  I think people who wear soft scents will love this.</li>
            <li> No complaints.  Arrived as advertised and the wife is thrilled! They want 10 more words, so hear are exactly ten.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Was scared to get fake product, but Prada Candy it is.  Very happy with purchase from DiscountPerfumes.</li>
            <li> Great perfume at a great price.</li>
            <li> my wife loved it, thats the best thing i can say</li>
            <li> I would have ordered Prada Candy sooner had I known what a great scent it was!  I will order more in the future.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter&#x27;s birthday and she hasn&#x27;t worn anything else since.  This just smells wonderful.  Even my wife has been caught occasionally &amp;#34;sampling&amp;#34; it a bit when my daughter&#x27;s back is turned.  LOL</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my daughter she loved it. It has a very pleasant aroma. The price was reasonable after comparing prices in other stores.</li>
            <li> Prada Candy is the best perfume I found for me thus far. It&#x27;s got sweet taste that won&#x27;t give you or other people around you a headache. I don&#x27;t even notice it on me while people constantly give me compliments and ask what perfume I wear. Definitely a must have for me! I cannot stand it when I run out of it.</li>
            <li> This was a surprise purchase for my daughter who had tried a sample of this fragance and truly loved it.  It is subtle and smells wonderful on her.</li>
            <li> On me, this smells woodsy with a touch of floral, not too sweet.. This fragrance just became my new signature.</li>
