            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this oil.</li>
            <li>and I love the way it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>I put it on my clean hair, brush it into a bun, leave it up for a couple hours, and viola!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m probably going to buy another bottle before it goes up in price or is no longer available.</li>
            <li>Straight hair!!!</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>it helps my feeling a lot to get more peaceful and relaxed</li>

            <li>There is a strong flowerly scent when first applied</li>

            <li>It has a light smell that is relaxing and gentle.</li>
            <li>Nice to have around when you&#x27;re in the mood but using it daily</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing, and I like that the bottle isn&#x27;t glass and the top limits how much pours out.</li>
            <li>I put it in my bath water and also use it when I am fresh out of the shower.</li>
            <li>but it does dissipate pretty quickly</li>
            <li>Smells lovely, lasts a long time and seems to absorb quickly.</li>
            <li>But when you&#x27;re in the mood for a tropical escape slathering this on after a hot bath at night feels indulgent and relaxing.</li>
            <li>Love this product - only wished Maui had a shop that carried it.</li>
            <li>would pretty much mean it&#x27;s your signature scent-not necessarily a great thing, especially if you work for a living:)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent moisturizing oil with a lush, tropical scent.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is heavenly and it leaves my skin silky soft.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s a small bottle and a little bit pricey, but I keep going back for more!</li>
            <li>I noticed my hair felt smoother and less brittle after my first use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d tried many different hair treatments without much improvement and was contemplating cutting my hair short.</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin or are in a very dry climate, I would highly suggest this product.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It smelled really good in the store, but when I put it on after shower, it felt it left residue on my skin and and I ended up having itching and redness and the fragrance was stronger when actually put on. Maybe some other people would like it, but not for me..</li>
            <li> My hair had become brittle and started breaking off as a side effect of medication. I&#x27;d tried many different hair treatments without much improvement and was contemplating cutting my hair short. I started searching for products that help with brittle hair and kept seeing \\&quot;monoi oil\\&quot; in my results. There are sooo many different choices of monoi oil on the market but some of the per-ounce prices are just ridiculously expensive. I finally decided on this product because of the size and the Body Shop name and I was not disappointed. This oil has been amazing! I noticed my hair felt smoother and less brittle after my first use. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily/greasy and I&#x27;ve my brush is no longer full of broken pieces of hair. My hair is shiny and healthy looking and I am very happy. There is a strong flowerly scent when first applied but it does dissipate pretty quickly (I happen to love gardenias so the monoi oil fragrance is heavenly!) I&#x27;m probably going to buy another bottle before it goes up in price or is no longer available.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It can be used year round for skin and hair and the fragrance is heavenly. You use only a little at a time, so this bottle should last you a long time.</li>
            <li> absolutely amazing on curls!</li>
            <li> Smells lovely, lasts a long time and seems to absorb quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent moisturizing oil with a lush, tropical scent. There are better products on the market at this price point for sure, especially for hair (think it may have changed my hair color a bit). But when you&#x27;re in the mood for a tropical escape slathering this on after a hot bath at night feels indulgent and relaxing. Nice to have around when you&#x27;re in the mood but using it daily would pretty much mean it&#x27;s your signature scent-not necessarily a great thing, especially if you work for a living:)</li>
            <li> Does not have a nice scent. It is quite thick and I will never order again!&lt;br /&gt;Description was way off</li>
            <li> No oily residue and smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As described. You get what you pay for. It works. Why is there a minimum word count. Just take the review.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great at the end of a shower. Smells very nice but not too strong. It&#x27;s very moisturizing, and I like that the bottle isn&#x27;t glass and the top limits how much pours out. A little goes a long way. I gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s a small bottle and a little bit pricey, but I keep going back for more!</li>
            <li> I am have water aerobics 3-4X a week. I use this oil after my shower. My skin feels and smells good too.</li>
            <li> Mix a couple drops in your face cream/lotion or mix a couple drops in a styling gel for your hair.....your face feels softer and smoother, and my hair is smoother and more under control. I love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> This smells amazing!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I am on my second bottle - a little goes a long way.  My last bottle lasted about 9 months.  I mix a couple of drops with body lotion and it moisturizes beautifully.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I use it on my feet, hair and in my bath.  The results are amazing.</li>
            <li> I used this oil on my hair and it is the only product out there beyond chemical permanent stuff that will straighten my hair. I put it on my clean hair, brush it into a bun, leave it up for a couple hours, and viola! Straight hair!!! And it smells like heaven.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I am looking for a similar fragrance to nars monoi oil. And this was not it.... it smells like soap... I&#x27;ll use it because I don&#x27;t want ro have wasted my money. But this is a small overpowering scent I&#x27;ll probably use it on my feet.</li>
            <li> I use this product as a facial moisturizer as well as an overall skin softener. It smells amazing and I love the way it makes my skin feel.  I&#x27;m in my 50s so I need more moisture on my face, but this would be great for anyone on their arms and legs.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I received it as a gift and although it was only a 2 oz bottle it lasted me almost a year.  The fragrance is heavenly and it leaves my skin silky soft.</li>
            <li> Love this product - only wished Maui had a shop that carried it.</li>
            <li> I used this oil for massages. It has a light smell that is relaxing and gentle. I will order again...definitely!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing scent! I use this as I&#x27;m taking a bath and was just amazing it helps my feeling a lot to get more peaceful and relaxed I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again. Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin or are in a very dry climate, I would highly suggest this product. I put it in my bath water and also use it when I am fresh out of the shower. It leaves the skin silky smooth as well as has a very light scent that is good for any body type. A must have product!!</li>
            <li> Use after showering, all over.  Leaves skin moisturizer and smells great.&lt;br /&gt;What is left on hands, I run through hair for extra shine.</li>
