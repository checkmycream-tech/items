            <li> but i am not love it too much</li>
            <li> It makes my hair really soft and manageable, and tame the frizz.  </li>
            <li> Those days are long gone!  </li>
            <li> , I still think the lid was on loosely or incorrectly.</li>
            <li> but  it gets very dry  sometimes.</li>
            <li> I only need a little with some water and it make the curls bounce and and the friz to disappear.</li>
            <li> I have thick, course, natural, afro-textured hair</li>
            <li> I usually add 1 to 2 tbsps to either Crece Pelo Hair Treatment, Kanechoem Product, or one of my regular conditioners and mix it together with a 2 tsps of oil (Olive, coconut etc.).  </li>
            <li> only complaint about this product is the way it was packaged &amp; delivered to my home.</li>
            <li> I feel like my $ was being thrown down the drain because of the amount of conditioner I had to throw away.</li>
            <li> or it can weigh  your hair down if you dont rinse it out thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a subtle difference from the regular silicone mix</li>
            <li> wrapped of really tight.</li>
            <li> It also allows the hair to stay straightened after it is blow dried.  </li>
            <li> and I leave on for a few minutes before I rinse.</li>
            <li> Maybe about 10%was wasted.</li>
            <li> If you are not a fan of heavy fragrance you will not like this conditioner.</li>
            <li> i use in my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick but not sticky and hard to wash out like conditioners that have shea butter in them.</li>
            <li> My hair even started looking dull and getting thin.</li>
            <li> I am not happy about that...</li>
            <li> The pacakging was horrible...</li>

            <li> Of course I love this product. It keeps my hair silky smooth and free from dry damage... I have a smaller jar that I replinish with. Since I bought the salon size...I will say I am giving the PRODUCT ONLY 5 STARS. The pacakging was horrible...My container was spilled inside my box. I am not happy about that... They could have made sure the lid was on correct... I dont care if it was a carrier truck, I still think the lid was on loosely or incorrectly.</li>
            <li> makes hair very soft.  one of best conditioners i ever used</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Leaves hair soft, strong, and the shine is amazing.  Great fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Great Product! I recommend for sure!!</li>
            <li> I had an opportunity to try this product &amp; I really like the results that I received. It smells great &amp; since I have VERY curly hair, it helped tremendously with the detangling process. My curls are very defined, bouncy &amp; seem to pop.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about this product is the way it was packaged &amp; delivered to my home. These bottles need to be properly sealed &amp; protected before they are boxed &amp; sent out for delivery. I ordered 2-60oz hair treatments. One of the bottles had a little conditioner coming out which was easy to clean; however, the 2nd bottle was very messy. I feel like my $ was being thrown down the drain because of the amount of conditioner I had to throw away. In my opinion this is considered damaged however, I was able to clean up the mess &amp; keep the product...</li>
            <li> I love the original silicon conditioner and saw this bambu option while at my hair salon. It is highly recommended by my stylist and it did not disappoint. This conditioner is awesome! I have relaxed hair and use this conditioner once a week as a deep conditioner and a rinse. Love the smell and it makes my hair more manageable, shiny and soft. I highly recommend this hair treatment.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for my coily curls. My hair loves it.  I also use it on my weaves and wigs for a beautiful shine and great slip.</li>
            <li> I love it.  It makes my hair really soft and manageable, and tame the frizz.  It makes the hair silky again.  It moisturizes it too.  I have been looking for conditioner for my hair that is damaged by color dye and bleaching, this is one of the better products to make my hair not frizzy and repair it. It is a good value too for the size of the container.</li>
            <li> This product provides moisture and detangles my hair.  It also allows the hair to stay straightened after it is blow dried.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M ON MY THIRD ORDER OF THIS AMAZING PRODUCT !!!, THANKS AGAIN...</li>
            <li> Not leaky at all wrapped of really tight. Very soft on my relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair really soft</li>
            <li> Love it. Works great. Nice and creamy and has a wonderful smell. Its great for straightening your hair but also just as a leave-in for my curls. It&#x27;s a subtle difference from the regular silicone mix but i cant put my finger on it. Its a staple for me and everything else as far as deep conditioners will be getting dumped.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to strengthen hair. I mix it with my shampoo, 1/2 shampoo and 1/2 this product, mix together in hand, apply to hair and I leave on for a few minutes before I rinse. It leaves my hair soft and it also smells nice. Great for dry hair. All the other silicon mixes from avanti are good too.</li>
            <li> I love it&#x27;s great for my hair</li>
            <li> Top was broken and ended up seeping out. Maybe about 10%was wasted.</li>
            <li> Best product ever... Perfect smooth hair!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year and it is the best that I&#x27;ve found for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product and great customer service!</li>
            <li> This Product does wonders for my hair and my girls. We are black, and we take very good care of our hair but  it gets very dry  sometimes. People ask us all the time, what we use in our hair to make it look so shiny and healthy. We love Dominican products. Definitely recommend this product and the leave in conditioner is a must have.</li>
            <li> Love love this product for my hair it just give my hair moisturize moisturize and slip my hair stay soft and silky till my next wash day[3 days or a week]</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product to use on my hair. It smells really nice and my hair gets this fantastic smoothness and shine right after I use it. I like to leave it on a bit longer than suggested (with a disposable conditioning cap), take care of a chore, and then go back into the shower to wash it off. If you&#x27;ve never tried it, buy a sample first because this thing is practically in a jug, I&#x27;ve read that a few people say the smell is what bothers them, but that&#x27;s actually what I really like about this one over the original silicon mix. Try it out and then buy this bulk size if you like it. Overall, my hair looks absolutely fantastic and healthy. I LOVE this product. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> For my natural hair 4 a and 4 b it&#x27;s okay. Maybe if i had heat damage or a chemical treatment on my hair, perhaps the temporary  effects will be much noticeable. My very own handcraft organic  hair butter is the real miracle for my shaft and for others in my community who purchases and uses it from me. I give all glory to God for His wisdom on this miracle. Soon it will hit the market. ;)</li>
            <li> I love the scent, but please note that it is strong. If you are not a fan of heavy fragrance you will not like this conditioner. Although it contains mineral oil, I use it as an all purpose conditioner for my hair. It helps to soften and strengthen my locks. Me encanta mucha :)</li>
            <li> My daughter has beautiful curly hair but it gets dry very easily.  This stuff works great.  I only need a little with some water and it make the curls bounce and and the friz to disappear.</li>
            <li> Well this stuff does wonders for my hair. I am experiencing less breakage and have fewer split ends but the smell is so strong. I can barely take the smell. My husband won&#x27;t even come near me during treatments.</li>
            <li> Love it smells great and it leaves my hair smoth</li>
            <li> It smells absolutely wonderful. . . and it makes my hair super soft. What more can a natural girl ask for?!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have ordered this product because it really works. Last year my hair started breaking and therefore I had lots of split ends. My hair even started looking dull and getting thin. I started steaming my hair with this product every two weeks sometimes every week and  the breakage stopped. After about two (2) months I saw an improvement in the look and feel of my hair. My hair looked healthy and strong. After about five (5) months of using the product my hair had grown a great deal in length (much more growth than I would usually see) and it started to look full. I will continue to use this product because I have experienced great results.</li>
            <li> My daughter  love it.</li>
            <li> Love the product. Makes my natural hair manageable!</li>
            <li> Really good treatment for detangling and keeping hair straight. For best results leave in hair for 2-3 mins. i use in my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> I love silicon mix products this one is the best it leaves your hair soft and smelling really good all week</li>
            <li> This by far is the best conditioner for really thick hair or for hair extensions. It bring your hair to a silky smooth texture, which leaves a nice floresent fragrance.  Be very careful not to use too much or it can weigh  your hair down if you dont rinse it out thoroughly.  I really like what it does to exensions.. Brings the hair back to the original quality..</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It works very well, and it brought my human hair back to it&#x27;s natural state. I just ordered more of this stuff, I love it so much and it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
            <li> Dominican hair products are the best. Leaves you hair soft, shiny, manageable, it really conditions your hair...</li>
            <li> Great for all hair textures. The 60oz bottle lasted me for over a year.</li>
            <li> Growing up, I had straight fine hair with lots of natural shine.  Those days are long gone!  I am now in my sixties and dye my hair to cover the gray.  This product makes my hair feel so soft and it shines like it did in my 20s.  The last two times I got my hair cut, the stylist could not get over how soft my hair was for my age!  It detangles really well and smells great, too!!</li>
            <li> carefully not to leave in your hair beyond the required time</li>
            <li> I bought this in a smaller size (I think 16oz) and I have one use left so I&#x27;m buying the 60oz. I have thick, course, natural, afro-textured hair and I like to use this as a detangling conditioner and deep treatment. I use an obscene amount of conditioner to keep my hair tangle free and soft. Conditioners like this are the main reason my hair is long and healthy.  It has incredible \\&quot;slip\\&quot;, smells tropically, and I really like the consistency. It&#x27;s thick but not sticky and hard to wash out like conditioners that have shea butter in them. I really, really enjoyed using this product and intend on keeping it my hair arsenal for a while.</li>
            <li> I love it! I used to buy from a Dominican salon I go to but its way cheaper on amazon. It makes my hair feel beautiful, soft, silky, and healthy! I will be using for the rest of my life. Lol</li>
            <li> not too bad…..but i am not love it too much</li>
            <li> Excellent product, very good smell.</li>
            <li> Great size for this price!  I love this item and the bamboo formula is just what my hair needs.  30 min under the dryer and my hair is detangled, soft and hydrated.  Perfect for winter routine, my 4C hair loves it.</li>
            <li> I love that this product.  The moment I apply it to my hair I can begin detangling.  I usually add 1 to 2 tbsps to either Crece Pelo Hair Treatment, Kanechoem Product, or one of my regular conditioners and mix it together with a 2 tsps of oil (Olive, coconut etc.).  It leaves my hair feeling very soft and moisturized.  I am natural (3c/4a).</li>
            <li> The best hair treatment EVER.</li>
