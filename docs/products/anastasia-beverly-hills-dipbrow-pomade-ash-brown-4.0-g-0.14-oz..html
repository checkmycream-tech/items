            <li>This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li>I normally use it by itself and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, gives a nicely defined line, and is very easy to use!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product , i really love it .</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t touch it up when I woke up being that I was going to work and getting my makeup done there; my makeup artist said they looked near perfect, woo!</li>
            <li>In LOVE with this product..</li>
            <li>it is safe to buy this color.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I got more out of my $5 brow pencil than I got out of this.</li>
            <li>Definitely my favorite eyebrow product.</li>
            <li>I get sooo many compliments about my brows</li>
            <li>I use a no name brand flat angled brush from Rite Aid and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>It looks beautiful and just overall an amazing product.</li>
            <li>barely touch this stuff in the container and very lightly and briskly whisp over your eyebrows, works great, lasts forever but use very very lightly</li>
            <li>color and product are a lot lighter and better in tone which makes for an easy application.</li>
            <li>It is my absolute favorite, and I&#x27;ve tried may kinds of brow make up and many brands!</li>
            <li>but my primate made it easy</li>
            <li>I can apply this easily even on my hurried days.</li>
            <li>The color , brown ash is perfect if you color your hair dark brown.  </li>
            <li>I had bought chocolate and that color is too light and with a hint of red/orange in it.</li>
            <li>This is very easy to apply, looks so much more natural than a pencil and is easier to blend!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that classic grayish brown brow, I love it, I love these pomades.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>It takes a very long time to get through a bottle, pigmentation is great</li>
            <li>If brown tends to be too bright for you and a dark brown is too dark, this is the perfect shade.</li>
            <li>It is also very versatile as you can do a more bold brow or something lighter.  </li>
            <li>Such a good product and came very fast</li>
            <li>It technically is &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; which is great, but even if you don&#x27;t use makeup remover, your normal face wash will work just as well removing the product.</li>
            <li>I love the pomade because it stays put and looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>It blends smoothly and is absolutely smudge proof once it sets.</li>
            <li>It darkens easily for more dramatic looks (either by adding more, or a powder on top).</li>
            <li>At first I was concerned because in the pod once you open it, it appears to have a very prominent grayish hue hence &#x27;ash&#x27; brown.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this is an ash color and does not have the brassy undertone like most other products I&#x27;ve tried, which only looks good on older retrievers.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a bright brown or dark brown.</li>
            <li>,price is good comparing with other brands,I recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>I bought Ash Brown first.  </li>
            <li>and I will be purchasing more in the future(:</li>
            <li>At first, I used the Ebony.  </li>
            <li>It also seems to last most of the day.</li>
            <li>I have 2 other colors and they are all amazing.</li>
            <li>Also, this works great as a subtle eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>I have dark brown hair, but almost black brows and this color matches perfect</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>She really likes this product.</li>
            <li>Before deciding to try this out I&#x27;d been using Tarte&#x27;s Amazonian Clay brow product, and was fairly happy with it -- but not nearly as happy as I am with Anastasia&#x27;s Dipbrow Pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a much better value and product than the brow pencil Anastasia offers, IMO, which lasted me only a month.  </li>
            <li>You can make it as dark or as light and natural as you&#x27;d like, either way this product is worth every cent.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it this product over anything I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>It lasts FOREVER because it hardly takes any product to achieve a full, filled in brow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is somewhere right in the middle.</li>
            <li>In addition to my regular daily activities it stays put while exercising and showering but fortunately does come off with makeup remover.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, if you mess up, you have a bit of time to correct it.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a lot more wiggle room with Anastasia Ash Brown Dipbrow Pomade, at least for me.</li>
            <li>natural tint to it.</li>
            <li>I got the Ardell Duo Brow Brush and it is only $6 and works exactly the same!!!!</li>
            <li>Perfect color,looks very natural,I was a little bit afraid because colors are different on the internet,but this one is just like I expected</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it looks a little less harsh and is a very good neutral for black hair without looking like I used a sharpie to fill in my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> You also use such a small amount it will probably last for a few years, and it looks so natural!  </li>
            <li> This is a terrific item for me with dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> so a little goes a long long way!</li>
            <li> a lot of people complain saying its hard to maneuver but as long as you dont place too much product on your brush, its not that hard.</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> My hair color is dark brown.</li>
            <li> I can see this product lasting at least 10 months, if not longer.</li>
            <li> To dark and looks terrible!!!&lt;br /&gt;Sorry</li>
            <li> Not for dark skin people.</li>
            <li> If you have dark brown almost black hair</li>
            <li> and I did not want to use black because I felt like it would be to dark and harsh.</li>
            <li> have tan skin, jet black hair and very dark brows.  </li>
            <li> It was a little too chocolatey brown for my coloring.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very dark</li>
            <li> My Daughter has very dark eyebrows</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this over the passed few days</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It has a slight grayish brown,  hardly notice the ash</li>

    <ol>
            <li> barely touch this stuff in the container and very lightly and briskly whisp over your eyebrows, works great, lasts forever but use very very lightly</li>
            <li> Love it ! If you were gonna buy it what are you waiting for lol</li>
            <li> I bought Ash Brown first.  It has a slight grayish brown,  hardly notice the ash but it&#x27;s there.  You can wear this even if you have no gray in your brown hair.  It&#x27;s a good color.  Later I bought Medium Brown.  Just looking at them side by side they look identical!  I prefer the medium brown on the skin.  My hair color is dark brown.</li>
            <li> Love this, it&#x27;s a perfect ash brown which matches my hair. It darkens easily for more dramatic looks (either by adding more, or a powder on top). I normally use it by itself and it&#x27;s perfect. You won&#x27;t regret this one.</li>
            <li> I now have fabulous eyebrows!!! The product wears well and doesn&#x27;t smudge. A little goes a very long way. I can see this product lasting at least 10 months, if not longer. I love the fact that this is an ash color and does not have the brassy undertone like most other products I&#x27;ve tried, which only looks good on older retrievers.</li>
            <li> Perfect color,looks very natural,I was a little bit afraid because colors are different on the internet,but this one is just like I expected,price is good comparing with other brands,I recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> In LOVE with this product..</li>
            <li> I am EXTREMELY HAPPY with this product. I ordered the ash brown color. My hair is very dark and I did not want to use black because I felt like it would be to dark and harsh. The ash brown is perfect!! If you have dark brown almost black hair it is safe to buy this color. Ever since I&#x27;ve started using this dip brow pomade I have been getting non stop compliments on my eye brows! This stuff is amazing and I will be purchasing more in the future(:</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing the pomade by Anastasia, but this time I ordered a different color.  I love the pomade because it stays put and looks very natural.  It is also very versatile as you can do a more bold brow or something lighter.  It lasts FOREVER because it hardly takes any product to achieve a full, filled in brow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tan skin, jet black hair and very dark brows.  At first, I used the Ebony.  It was a little too chocolatey brown for my coloring.  This time, I ordered the ash brown.  In my opinion, it looks a little less harsh and is a very good neutral for black hair without looking like I used a sharpie to fill in my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gone to the gym as well as slept with this pomade on and it has stayed put.  It doesn&#x27;t drip AT ALL when you wash it off (the way eyeliner or mascara does) or get in the pool.  I ordered it on amazon this time because I had a gift certificate, but I matched myself with the ash brown at my local Ulta prior to.  This is a much better value and product than the brow pencil Anastasia offers, IMO, which lasted me only a month.  I use a no name brand flat angled brush from Rite Aid and it works perfectly. Also, this works great as a subtle eyeliner.  I swear by this product.</li>
            <li> love the dipbrow! a lot of people complain saying its hard to maneuver but as long as you dont place too much product on your brush, its not that hard. definitely build up to the color/coverage you want on your brow , dont expect to get it all in one appliance!</li>
            <li> Such a good product and came very fast</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  The color , brown ash is perfect if you color your hair dark brown.  I had bought chocolate and that color is too light and with a hint of red/orange in it.</li>
            <li> To dark and looks terrible!!!&lt;br /&gt;Sorry</li>
            <li> I wear this in my Zumba class, it stays on, a great product.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  In addition to my regular daily activities it stays put while exercising and showering but fortunately does come off with makeup remover. You also use such a small amount it will probably last for a few years, and it looks so natural!  I can say with assurance that this is a product I will use for an indefinite period of time and I have no plans to look for a different one.  If you are on the edge I hope my review helps!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!!! It goes on smoothly, gives a nicely defined line, and is very easy to use! I don&#x27;t pretend to be very talented at doing makeup but my primate made it easy and I only needed a tiny amount! Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I will continue to repurchase this product. It is my absolute favorite, and I&#x27;ve tried may kinds of brow make up and many brands! It can be put on thick as painted brow or wispy to fill in! 100% waterproof and wears all day so so easily!! It takes a very long time to get through a bottle, pigmentation is great so a little goes a long long way! I have dark brown hair, but almost black brows and this color matches perfect it is the perfect blend of color for my brows. I can apply this easily even on my hurried days. It takes some getting used to if you haven&#x27;t used a pomade before but i absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product , i really love it . Wish to buy all colours .</li>
            <li> I love it it doesn&#x27;t smudge very smooth!</li>
            <li> At first I was concerned because in the pod once you open it, it appears to have a very prominent grayish hue hence &#x27;ash&#x27; brown. However, once I applied the pomade, it was beautiful. No grayish shade or tint. It was a perfect match for my hair and eyebrows. It isn&#x27;t a bright brown or dark brown. It is somewhere right in the middle. If brown tends to be too bright for you and a dark brown is too dark, this is the perfect shade. It blends smoothly and is absolutely smudge proof once it sets. Long lasting doesn&#x27;t do it justice. At the end of the day, my brows are flawless and don&#x27;t look drawn or caked on. You can make it as dark or as light and natural as you&#x27;d like, either way this product is worth every cent. It technically is &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; which is great, but even if you don&#x27;t use makeup remover, your normal face wash will work just as well removing the product. It comes off without any problems. I highly recommend it this product over anything I&#x27;ve ever used. It looks beautiful and just overall an amazing product. I don&#x27;t know how I ever got by without it.</li>
            <li> My Daughter has very dark eyebrows and she says this is the perfect color for her.  She really likes this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this over the passed few days and I am very happy with it! Before deciding to try this out I&#x27;d been using Tarte&#x27;s Amazonian Clay brow product, and was fairly happy with it -- but not nearly as happy as I am with Anastasia&#x27;s Dipbrow Pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color and product are a lot lighter and better in tone which makes for an easy application. Don&#x27;t get me wrong -- I could get the same quality brow with Tarte&#x27;s product, too, BUT with a lot more stress and hassle. There&#x27;s a lot more wiggle room with Anastasia Ash Brown Dipbrow Pomade, at least for me. It keeps well, too. The night I opened the package I did my eyebrows before going to bed (as a sort of test). I didn&#x27;t touch it up when I woke up being that I was going to work and getting my makeup done there; my makeup artist said they looked near perfect, woo!</li>
            <li> This is a terrific item for me with dark brown hair. It goes on easily, if you mess up, you have a bit of time to correct it. It also seems to last most of the day.</li>
            <li> Would have been perfect if I got the right shade</li>
            <li> Holy s***, this product is the best product! It&#x27;s that classic grayish brown brow, I love it, I love these pomades. I have 2 other colors and they are all amazing. You won&#x27;t regret this product if you buy it. I promise.</li>
            <li> Not for dark skin people. It doesn&#x27;t last all day. Waste of money. I got more out of my $5 brow pencil than I got out of this.</li>
            <li> This is very easy to apply, looks so much more natural than a pencil and is easier to blend! It lasts all day, doesn&#x27;t smudge, and I can even wear it and not worry while working out. Definitely my favorite eyebrow product. TIP: Save money and don&#x27;t buy the ANASTASIA brush for this. I got the Ardell Duo Brow Brush and it is only $6 and works exactly the same!!!!</li>
            <li> Not as good as the reviews.</li>
            <li> The best brow makeup. It has&lt;br /&gt;A natural tint to it. You can&#x27;t even tell your wearing it. I get sooo many compliments about my brows</li>
