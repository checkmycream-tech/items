            <li>These wipes are great!!!</li>
            <li>The best part is that this product does NOT TEST ON ANIMALS!</li>
            <li>This is the best disposable cleansing wipe I&#x27;ve found for oily skin!</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>I am so happy to have found this!!!!  </li>
            <li>Welcome to acne land!  </li>
            <li>The best I can say about these wipes are that they&#x27;re a good cleanup for my hands &amp; feet, but for my face?  </li>
            <li>My skin feels great</li>
            <li>These are really great for anyone that can&#x27;t keep up the morning and night cleansing for whatever reason.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;+Feel great on skin</li>
            <li>They do remove it, but I noticed my skin doesn&#x27;t feel as great as when i remove makeup before use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>did a great job of removing makeup while leaving my skin feeling great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One great use is for freshening up after a workout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great that they lack scent.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t remove make up well/at all, surprisingly.  </li>
            <li>and oh they work so good.  </li>
            <li>I use these at home, but they would also be good for traveling.  </li>
            <li>They make my face feel good.  </li>
            <li>They do a good job without being harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So these are probably best to use when you&#x27;re not wearing any makeup on your skin, and just need something to lightly wipe off oils from your face.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for times when you need to quickly freshen up.</li>
            <li>These wipes are amazing.</li>
            <li>These are nice medium level exfoliating wipes.</li>
            <li>I am a no fuss kind of gal.  </li>
            <li>Just not like the rose or peach scented stuff</li>
            <li>but they smell nice and cleans my face.</li>
            <li>It feels great after use, leave skin feeling clean and moist and not oily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a nice, easy going wipe, easy to use, a great way to do an end of day clean-up and refresh.</li>
            <li>The twenty-five moist wipes in each moisture-retaining, resealable package are a convenient, effective and refreshing solution for cleaning neck, face and ears.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They seemed to work well in cleaning off my eye makeup and felt ok, but I didn&#x27;t have a nice \\&quot;clean\\</li>
            <li>They are also a good &amp;#34;refresher&amp;#34; after a workout to clean up your face.  </li>
            <li>Nothing like good feeling clean skin after wearing cosmetics all day.</li>
            <li>In AZ we use wipes a great deal during 8 hot months of the year.</li>
            <li>oils and dirts are lifted easily and effectively.  </li>
            <li>I rinse the wipe in very warm water after the first swipe and re-do my face with the rinsed and wrung wipe before drying my skin.  </li>
            <li>They are very refreshing and leave the skin feeling clean but not stripped or irritated.  </li>
            <li>certainly recommend these great wipes.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love these and am so glad to find them here.  </li>
            <li>Many of these types of wipes cause redness or stinging when I use them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying more.  </li>
            <li>I love taking these on vacations, camping, gym, etc.  </li>
            <li>My face even more so</li>
            <li>, I think I will buy more.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from an exfoliating wipe.</li>
            <li>just love these wipes.  </li>
            <li>These are ok.</li>
            <li>I received a pack of these to try out and while the concept was interesting, when I tried one on my face it irritated it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These wipes would work even better if the cleanser it contains lathered in some way.</li>
            <li>my skin didn&#x27;t feel any softer or better, and I can&#x27;t really discern a great benefit.  </li>
            <li>I found that the scrub worked better.</li>
            <li>They are so quick, easy and do a great job getting your face feeling clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>This is perfect for on the go applications since it is easy to use, store, and seal closed.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to tell that these substantial wipes are not water soluble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple</li>
            <li>They are easy and they work.</li>
            <li>It felt fine.</li>
            <li>This worked fine for me.</li>
            <li>In all, I prefer wipes like this with a light texture that scrubs but doesn&#x27;t burn/hurt.</li>
            <li>My skin felt smooth.  </li>
            <li>plus is that they have no perfume and they do leave your face feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>YAY because if they did I wouldnt not be buying anymore (switching to all cruelty free products)</li>
            <li>The weave on it feels like an extremely light sandpaper.</li>
            <li>It was originally something that I used instead of the \\&quot;stuff that works\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These exfoliating wipes are refreshing,and gentle to skin, but in comparison to others I&#x27;ve tested, I&#x27;d rather have a light fragrance with skin feeling more smooth.</li>
            <li>Many people bring back fridge magnets of Kate and William or special chocolate, my last stop is Boots for these wonderful wipes.  </li>
            <li>Wipes are large in size and have a very light, clean fragrance, although package says no parfumes are added.  </li>
            <li>They exfoliate leaving your face clean and soft!&lt;br /&gt;Great for taking off makeup as well.</li>
            <li>Using these exfoliating wipes on my clean skin produces a tingly sensation and noticeably smoother skin.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;+Leave a clean feeling</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get that clean refreshed feeling afterwards either.</li>
            <li>, my skin does fel clean when I use these with some water and after rinsing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did clean and exfoliate, so</li>
            <li>I have chronic condition that has prevent me from taking a bath and reduced the my weekly showers to about 3, so getting my self clean with full water immersion has been</li>
            <li>These \\&quot;Simple Exfoliating Wipes\\&quot; do a good job, leaves my face feeling quite clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;How will this work after a full month of use?  </li>
            <li>Touch did not irritate my skin (something that often is true after cleaning).  </li>
            <li>All is good in the world of facial care!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I notice no redness or discomfort after use, although I have experienced both redness and discomfort with other exfoliating</li>
            <li>They all have a mild smell to them that is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They dont seem to make me break out any more than whats normal for me</li>
            <li>while within the package&#x27;s bullet points it claims to be safe for sensitive eyes and contact lens wearers; I will just keep from wiping it over my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are not very moist to begin with either, which would have made them more refreshing.</li>
            <li>My face feels fresh afterward.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s made by the same folks, and it has a nice exfoliating effect without the diaper wipe experience.  </li>
            <li>The other products they offer I am currently using and they are great!!!!</li>
            <li>They do not lather nor are they moist like most face wipes and made my face super red and hurt for over 30 minutes afterwards.</li>
            <li>Also great for travelers, no longer need to carry small bottle of cleansers.</li>
            <li>adds restoring Vitamin B5, moisturizing Vitamin E and soothing Aloe Vera to these exfoliating facial wipes for a gentle satisfying clean.</li>
            <li>With this in mind, I figured I would be a good test subject for this product.</li>
            <li>They do a pretty good job of that; except they do not leave a cooling sensation as most other facial wipes do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face feels so clean and my skin so fresh and soft after cleaning with one of the wipes that it makes it a pleasure to use it.  </li>
            <li>If you have combination or oily skin particularly in the T-zone, you may enjoy the convenience of this product as well as the fact that it really works.</li>
            <li>I really do not get why this kind of textile..</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t take off your skin the way a mask or scrub would but they are better than using just a facial soap.</li>
            <li>I found this worked much better, especially using a circular wiping motion.</li>
            <li>These were exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Something of note is that these wipes seem to be much bigger than most of the wipes out there.  </li>
            <li>I am an avid exfoliator</li>
            <li>No wetting my face first was needed.</li>
            <li>I have used many brands of facial wipes before, but this is the first time I have used an exfoliating wipe.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it only one week, so I cannot be sure, but I expect to see much clearer and brighter skin then.  </li>
            <li>These handy, unscented cleansing wipes have deep pores, creating a soft, yet abrasive exfoliating surface.</li>
            <li>They felt really nice actually, and I was surprised that for feeling so soft they left my face feeling so smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>i think the regular non exfoliating wipes would probably be great, but these were very rough for my skin.</li>
            <li>None of my local stores carry them any more, but when i was able to find them they worked great to get rid of the dry scaly skin that&#x27;s gotten worse as i&#x27;ve gotten into my 60s.  </li>
            <li>These exfoliating facial wipes make my face feel fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to keep a package in my purse for whenever I feel like I just need to feel a little more cool and refreshed</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other Simple products and have been happily satisfied with most of them.  </li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t drying and leave my skin soft and nicer than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, plus they&#x27;re great if you tend to be lazy at bedtime.  </li>
            <li>These are easy to use and work well for daily use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used it off and on for the last couple months and slowly but surely, it has become my favorite way to clean my face.  </li>
            <li>These wipes seem to do a fine job of removing the dirt, grease and grime from my skin, but I&#x27;m left with a bunch of cotton fibers stuck all over my face.  </li>
            <li>Pretty sure it was due to this brand&#x27;s products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>they are very gentle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>It takes off my makeup, my face feels clean but not dry</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a generous surface amount that makes cleaning your whole face easier.  </li>
            <li>It has a nubbed texture that acts as an exfoliant and gives a gentle scrub.  </li>
            <li>very important.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I enjoy facial wipes-</li>
            <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned these are worth their weight in gold.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These contain enough moisturizing lotion to leave your skin feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely no irritating to my skin at all.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Feels more like a rough wipe than a wipe with cleanser in it</li>
            <li>I guess I don&#x27;t really get the point of these wipes.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell.  </li>
            <li>The front of the package also says \\&quot;for naturally healthy looking skin\\&quot; and \\&quot;double sided cleansing action\\&quot; and \\&quot;sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The Simple Exfoliating wipes gave me no problem, leaving me with clean, fresh-feeling skin.  </li>
            <li>I still feel that they are not abrasive enough, but my face does feel clean after use.  </li>
            <li>I always clean in and around my sink with the wipe before finally tossing it in the trash.</li>
            <li>This is a handy little wipe that gives skin a basic cleansing and is rough enough with what I assume to be the right ingredients to give an awesome exfoliation boost that is on par with your average face scrub.  </li>
            <li>I really had high hopes for these...</li>
            <li>When I say that, I mean I literally roll out of bed to a programmed coffee pot full of my favorite brew, throw on my clothes and hit the gym type of person.  </li>
            <li>This is nice compared to regular diaper wipes that have alcohol in them and dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>Update - Now that I have used nearly all of my first pack</li>
            <li>love facial wipes such as these.  </li>
            <li>BTW, highly recommended... and it&#x27;s cheaper than flying in to Heathrow.</li>
            <li>I have tried several different facial wipes and they have done a good job as far as cleaning my face</li>
            <li>No smell, gentle for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>far as the exfoliating factor, not so much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Therefore, I recommend these to those with normal skin.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty rough, so I avoided using them every day, but on days when my makeup felt like it had seeped into my skin, I could use one of these to feel fresh again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a much less messy way to exfoliate and the wipe format is great.</li>
            <li>I mainly got these wipes to remove makeup in addition to my normal cream cleanser because I felt like I wasn&#x27;t getting a deep enough clean with just the lather-and-rinse method, like</li>
            <li>The texture is great and they scrub well, but I felt like I needed to wet them, especially as I got down to the bottom of the package.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The wipes are a bit rough feeling, which I guess adds to the exfoliating factor, but it does clean quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are SO rough on my face, and i only use these after the gym to wick away perspiration  (meaning, i dont use them to take off my makeup b/c that would require even  more pressure...and irritation).  </li>
            <li>These are nice wipes and they&#x27;re scrubby enough to exfoliate the dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this to people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how well these work.</li>
            <li>First of all, it doesn&#x27;t look like your run of the mill facial wipe.  </li>
            <li>Other wipes I have tested also left more of a cooling sensation, which I didn&#x27;t receive with this product.</li>
            <li>I use exfoliating facial scrubs on a regular basis (I mostly use St Ives apricot facial scrub).</li>
            <li>For better facial cleansing I would recommend [[ASIN:B005TI7NQ2 Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub, 5 Ounce (Pack of 2)]]-</li>
            <li>I ended up using these every time I had makeup that I wanted to get off, and using my normal wipes when I just wanted to wipe down a clean face.  </li>
            <li>About half way through the self-sticking is not as secure which can lead to the wipes drying out.</li>
            <li>They are almost dry right out of the package</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re just slightly damp, even when first opened and aside from makeup, it didn&#x27;t seem like any daily grime came off (not that my face is full of dirt, I even tried my hands :</li>
            <li>They certainly look like they&#x27;ve been used on me by the end of the day (they are not as white as they started out).</li>
            <li>And I certainly appreciate it, because I don&#x27;t want all the extra chemicals going on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I wanted something with a little rougher feel to exfoliate my face and these definitely fit the bill.</li>
            <li>I had a hard time enjoying it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product because I read all the reviews about sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Afterwards, my skin felt unusually soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can see those with sensitive skin yelling \\&quot;too much!\\&quot; on the harshness of these</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>However, I found that even the exfoliating side was gentle enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We also use them frequently.</li>
            <li>skin often feels like it needs something with exfoliating qualities but tends to break out or become very irritated, itchy, inflamed, flaming red, etc when I use them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m surprised and pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&quot; (that&#x27;s me - the person with the sensitive skin - not the sensitive skin</li>
            <li>~The good~&lt;br /&gt;Works well on sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;Good number of wipes per pack (25)&lt;br /&gt;Rough texture of wipes scrubs off color-stay makeup</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with these, but you&#x27;d probably still want to use an gentler wipe around the eyes or for every day use and limit these to every few days for exfoliating.</li>
            <li>I do not have skin I consider to be particularly sensitive;  while I enjoyed how these worked and felt on my skin, these are also the sort of wipes that mean exfoliate when they do say exfoliate.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended if you are in need of facial wipes.</li>
            <li>brand&#x27;s products caused an acne flare up that went away soon after switching back to our normal product.  </li>
            <li>After a week of using these, I noticed my skin becoming more even (less dry in dry areas and less oily in t-zone) and my breakouts are definitely fewer.  </li>
            <li>Simple Exfoliating Wipes have a neutral scent and are gentle on facial skin.  </li>
            <li>This wipe is a thick material that doesn&#x27;t tear easily.  </li>
            <li>put smell as a con; because there aren&#x27;t any frilly perfumes, the only smell there is is from the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>It may be that my skin is ultra-sensitive (as I can&#x27;t use a wash cloth without damage to my face) and that regular sensitive skin will respond well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it did its job; however, I cannot recommend the product to those with sensitivity to abrasion rather than to those who are only sensitive to chemicals.</li>
            <li>I tried a variety of Simple products and found that none of them caused a reaction with my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, because of the lack of liquid issue described, the next night I washed my face (wet my face, applied cleanser, and rinsed lightly, but did not dry my face) and used the wipe on my wet skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I don&#x27;t really have sensitive skin, I didn&#x27;t think these were in any way harsh feeling.</li>
            <li>my favorite wipes, limited ingredients and rough texture to help me get rid of the dead skin.</li>
            <li>, I was expecting something like dry scratchy paper towel sheets that won&#x27;t remove makeup unless you wet your face first.</li>

            <li> Great that they lack scent.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t remove make up well/at all, surprisingly.  </li>
            <li> and oh they work so good.  </li>
            <li> I use these at home, but they would also be good for traveling.  </li>
            <li> They make my face feel good.  </li>
            <li> They do a good job without being harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So these are probably best to use when you&#x27;re not wearing any makeup on your skin, and just need something to lightly wipe off oils from your face.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for times when you need to quickly freshen up.</li>
            <li> These wipes are amazing.</li>
            <li> These are nice medium level exfoliating wipes.</li>
            <li> I am a no fuss kind of gal.  </li>
            <li> Just not like the rose or peach scented stuff</li>
            <li> but they smell nice and cleans my face.</li>
            <li> It feels great after use, leave skin feeling clean and moist and not oily.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a nice, easy going wipe, easy to use, a great way to do an end of day clean-up and refresh.</li>
            <li> The twenty-five moist wipes in each moisture-retaining, resealable package are a convenient, effective and refreshing solution for cleaning neck, face and ears.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They seemed to work well in cleaning off my eye makeup and felt ok, but I didn&#x27;t have a nice \\&quot;clean\\</li>
            <li> They are also a good &amp;#34;refresher&amp;#34; after a workout to clean up your face.  </li>
            <li> Nothing like good feeling clean skin after wearing cosmetics all day.</li>
            <li> In AZ we use wipes a great deal during 8 hot months of the year.</li>
            <li> oils and dirts are lifted easily and effectively.  </li>
            <li> I rinse the wipe in very warm water after the first swipe and re-do my face with the rinsed and wrung wipe before drying my skin.  </li>
            <li> They are very refreshing and leave the skin feeling clean but not stripped or irritated.  </li>
            <li> certainly recommend these great wipes.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love these and am so glad to find them here.  </li>
            <li> Many of these types of wipes cause redness or stinging when I use them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying more.  </li>
            <li> I love taking these on vacations, camping, gym, etc.  </li>
            <li> My face even more so</li>
            <li> , I think I will buy more.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from an exfoliating wipe.</li>
            <li> just love these wipes.  </li>
            <li> These are ok.</li>
            <li> I received a pack of these to try out and while the concept was interesting, when I tried one on my face it irritated it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These wipes would work even better if the cleanser it contains lathered in some way.</li>
            <li> my skin didn&#x27;t feel any softer or better, and I can&#x27;t really discern a great benefit.  </li>
            <li> I found that the scrub worked better.</li>
            <li> They are so quick, easy and do a great job getting your face feeling clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for on the go applications since it is easy to use, store, and seal closed.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to tell that these substantial wipes are not water soluble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple</li>
            <li> They are easy and they work.</li>
            <li> It felt fine.</li>
            <li> This worked fine for me.</li>
            <li> In all, I prefer wipes like this with a light texture that scrubs but doesn&#x27;t burn/hurt.</li>
            <li> My skin felt smooth.  </li>
            <li> plus is that they have no perfume and they do leave your face feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> YAY because if they did I wouldnt not be buying anymore (switching to all cruelty free products)</li>
            <li> The weave on it feels like an extremely light sandpaper.</li>
            <li> It was originally something that I used instead of the \\&quot;stuff that works\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These exfoliating wipes are refreshing,and gentle to skin, but in comparison to others I&#x27;ve tested, I&#x27;d rather have a light fragrance with skin feeling more smooth.</li>
            <li> Many people bring back fridge magnets of Kate and William or special chocolate, my last stop is Boots for these wonderful wipes.  </li>
            <li> Wipes are large in size and have a very light, clean fragrance, although package says no parfumes are added.  </li>
            <li> They exfoliate leaving your face clean and soft!&lt;br /&gt;Great for taking off makeup as well.</li>
            <li> Using these exfoliating wipes on my clean skin produces a tingly sensation and noticeably smoother skin.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;+Leave a clean feeling</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get that clean refreshed feeling afterwards either.</li>
            <li> , my skin does fel clean when I use these with some water and after rinsing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did clean and exfoliate, so</li>
            <li> I have chronic condition that has prevent me from taking a bath and reduced the my weekly showers to about 3, so getting my self clean with full water immersion has been</li>
            <li> These \\&quot;Simple Exfoliating Wipes\\&quot; do a good job, leaves my face feeling quite clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;How will this work after a full month of use?  </li>
            <li> Touch did not irritate my skin (something that often is true after cleaning).  </li>
            <li> All is good in the world of facial care!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I notice no redness or discomfort after use, although I have experienced both redness and discomfort with other exfoliating</li>
            <li> They all have a mild smell to them that is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They dont seem to make me break out any more than whats normal for me</li>
            <li> while within the package&#x27;s bullet points it claims to be safe for sensitive eyes and contact lens wearers; I will just keep from wiping it over my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are not very moist to begin with either, which would have made them more refreshing.</li>
            <li> My face feels fresh afterward.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s made by the same folks, and it has a nice exfoliating effect without the diaper wipe experience.  </li>
            <li> The other products they offer I am currently using and they are great!!!!</li>
            <li> They do not lather nor are they moist like most face wipes and made my face super red and hurt for over 30 minutes afterwards.</li>
            <li> Also great for travelers, no longer need to carry small bottle of cleansers.</li>
            <li> adds restoring Vitamin B5, moisturizing Vitamin E and soothing Aloe Vera to these exfoliating facial wipes for a gentle satisfying clean.</li>
            <li> With this in mind, I figured I would be a good test subject for this product.</li>
            <li> They do a pretty good job of that; except they do not leave a cooling sensation as most other facial wipes do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face feels so clean and my skin so fresh and soft after cleaning with one of the wipes that it makes it a pleasure to use it.  </li>
            <li> If you have combination or oily skin particularly in the T-zone, you may enjoy the convenience of this product as well as the fact that it really works.</li>
            <li> I really do not get why this kind of textile..</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t take off your skin the way a mask or scrub would but they are better than using just a facial soap.</li>
            <li> I found this worked much better, especially using a circular wiping motion.</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Something of note is that these wipes seem to be much bigger than most of the wipes out there.  </li>
            <li> I am an avid exfoliator</li>
            <li> No wetting my face first was needed.</li>
            <li> I have used many brands of facial wipes before, but this is the first time I have used an exfoliating wipe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it only one week, so I cannot be sure, but I expect to see much clearer and brighter skin then.  </li>
            <li> These handy, unscented cleansing wipes have deep pores, creating a soft, yet abrasive exfoliating surface.</li>
            <li> They felt really nice actually, and I was surprised that for feeling so soft they left my face feeling so smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> i think the regular non exfoliating wipes would probably be great, but these were very rough for my skin.</li>
            <li> None of my local stores carry them any more, but when i was able to find them they worked great to get rid of the dry scaly skin that&#x27;s gotten worse as i&#x27;ve gotten into my 60s.  </li>
            <li> These exfoliating facial wipes make my face feel fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to keep a package in my purse for whenever I feel like I just need to feel a little more cool and refreshed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Simple products and have been happily satisfied with most of them.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t drying and leave my skin soft and nicer than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, plus they&#x27;re great if you tend to be lazy at bedtime.  </li>
            <li> These are easy to use and work well for daily use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it off and on for the last couple months and slowly but surely, it has become my favorite way to clean my face.  </li>
            <li> These wipes seem to do a fine job of removing the dirt, grease and grime from my skin, but I&#x27;m left with a bunch of cotton fibers stuck all over my face.  </li>
            <li> Pretty sure it was due to this brand&#x27;s products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> they are very gentle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> It takes off my makeup, my face feels clean but not dry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a generous surface amount that makes cleaning your whole face easier.  </li>
            <li> It has a nubbed texture that acts as an exfoliant and gives a gentle scrub.  </li>
            <li> very important.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I enjoy facial wipes-</li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned these are worth their weight in gold.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These contain enough moisturizing lotion to leave your skin feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely no irritating to my skin at all.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Feels more like a rough wipe than a wipe with cleanser in it</li>
            <li> I guess I don&#x27;t really get the point of these wipes.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell.  </li>
            <li> The front of the package also says \\&quot;for naturally healthy looking skin\\&quot; and \\&quot;double sided cleansing action\\&quot; and \\&quot;sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The Simple Exfoliating wipes gave me no problem, leaving me with clean, fresh-feeling skin.  </li>
            <li> I still feel that they are not abrasive enough, but my face does feel clean after use.  </li>
            <li> I always clean in and around my sink with the wipe before finally tossing it in the trash.</li>
            <li> This is a handy little wipe that gives skin a basic cleansing and is rough enough with what I assume to be the right ingredients to give an awesome exfoliation boost that is on par with your average face scrub.  </li>
            <li> I really had high hopes for these...</li>
            <li> When I say that, I mean I literally roll out of bed to a programmed coffee pot full of my favorite brew, throw on my clothes and hit the gym type of person.  </li>
            <li> This is nice compared to regular diaper wipes that have alcohol in them and dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> Update - Now that I have used nearly all of my first pack</li>
            <li> love facial wipes such as these.  </li>
            <li> BTW, highly recommended... and it&#x27;s cheaper than flying in to Heathrow.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different facial wipes and they have done a good job as far as cleaning my face</li>
            <li> No smell, gentle for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> far as the exfoliating factor, not so much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Therefore, I recommend these to those with normal skin.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty rough, so I avoided using them every day, but on days when my makeup felt like it had seeped into my skin, I could use one of these to feel fresh again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a much less messy way to exfoliate and the wipe format is great.</li>
            <li> I mainly got these wipes to remove makeup in addition to my normal cream cleanser because I felt like I wasn&#x27;t getting a deep enough clean with just the lather-and-rinse method, like</li>
            <li> The texture is great and they scrub well, but I felt like I needed to wet them, especially as I got down to the bottom of the package.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The wipes are a bit rough feeling, which I guess adds to the exfoliating factor, but it does clean quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are SO rough on my face, and i only use these after the gym to wick away perspiration  (meaning, i dont use them to take off my makeup b/c that would require even  more pressure...and irritation).  </li>
            <li> These are nice wipes and they&#x27;re scrubby enough to exfoliate the dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li> and I highly recommend this to people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how well these work.</li>
            <li> First of all, it doesn&#x27;t look like your run of the mill facial wipe.  </li>
            <li> Other wipes I have tested also left more of a cooling sensation, which I didn&#x27;t receive with this product.</li>
            <li> I use exfoliating facial scrubs on a regular basis (I mostly use St Ives apricot facial scrub).</li>
            <li> For better facial cleansing I would recommend [[ASIN:B005TI7NQ2 Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub, 5 Ounce (Pack of 2)]]-</li>
            <li> I ended up using these every time I had makeup that I wanted to get off, and using my normal wipes when I just wanted to wipe down a clean face.  </li>
            <li> About half way through the self-sticking is not as secure which can lead to the wipes drying out.</li>
            <li> They are almost dry right out of the package</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re just slightly damp, even when first opened and aside from makeup, it didn&#x27;t seem like any daily grime came off (not that my face is full of dirt, I even tried my hands :</li>
            <li> They certainly look like they&#x27;ve been used on me by the end of the day (they are not as white as they started out).</li>
            <li> And I certainly appreciate it, because I don&#x27;t want all the extra chemicals going on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I wanted something with a little rougher feel to exfoliate my face and these definitely fit the bill.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time enjoying it.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product because I read all the reviews about sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Afterwards, my skin felt unusually soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can see those with sensitive skin yelling \\&quot;too much!\\&quot; on the harshness of these</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> However, I found that even the exfoliating side was gentle enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We also use them frequently.</li>
            <li> skin often feels like it needs something with exfoliating qualities but tends to break out or become very irritated, itchy, inflamed, flaming red, etc when I use them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m surprised and pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &quot; (that&#x27;s me - the person with the sensitive skin - not the sensitive skin</li>
            <li> ~The good~&lt;br /&gt;Works well on sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;Good number of wipes per pack (25)&lt;br /&gt;Rough texture of wipes scrubs off color-stay makeup</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with these, but you&#x27;d probably still want to use an gentler wipe around the eyes or for every day use and limit these to every few days for exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I do not have skin I consider to be particularly sensitive;  while I enjoyed how these worked and felt on my skin, these are also the sort of wipes that mean exfoliate when they do say exfoliate.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended if you are in need of facial wipes.</li>
            <li> brand&#x27;s products caused an acne flare up that went away soon after switching back to our normal product.  </li>
            <li> After a week of using these, I noticed my skin becoming more even (less dry in dry areas and less oily in t-zone) and my breakouts are definitely fewer.  </li>
            <li> Simple Exfoliating Wipes have a neutral scent and are gentle on facial skin.  </li>
            <li> This wipe is a thick material that doesn&#x27;t tear easily.  </li>
            <li> put smell as a con; because there aren&#x27;t any frilly perfumes, the only smell there is is from the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> It may be that my skin is ultra-sensitive (as I can&#x27;t use a wash cloth without damage to my face) and that regular sensitive skin will respond well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it did its job; however, I cannot recommend the product to those with sensitivity to abrasion rather than to those who are only sensitive to chemicals.</li>
            <li> I tried a variety of Simple products and found that none of them caused a reaction with my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, because of the lack of liquid issue described, the next night I washed my face (wet my face, applied cleanser, and rinsed lightly, but did not dry my face) and used the wipe on my wet skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I don&#x27;t really have sensitive skin, I didn&#x27;t think these were in any way harsh feeling.</li>
            <li> my favorite wipes, limited ingredients and rough texture to help me get rid of the dead skin.</li>
            <li> , I was expecting something like dry scratchy paper towel sheets that won&#x27;t remove makeup unless you wet your face first.</li>
            <li> The package is soft and you pull a self-sticking tab to open it and press it down to close the package again.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how much exfoliating they are</li>
            <li> This takes my evening regimen down to a few seconds of gentle wiping while still getting the grime off!</li>
            <li> Yes, the wipes are textured, giving them a little roughness for exfoliation, but it&#x27;s not nearly as rough as a facial scrub.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell if the cleaner is washing your skin or not, because you can&#x27;t really get any cleanser out of the wipes.</li>
            <li> Without this long term evidence, I cannot give this product five stars, but if it performs as I anticipate, I will update this review and increase my rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four</li>
            <li> , this product caused some minor redness that went away within a minute or two.  </li>
            <li> These facial wipes have a slightly rough texture to them, which gives them the ability to exfoliate your skin.</li>
            <li> Otherwise they were simply too rough on my skin.</li>
            <li> However, despite being used to facial scrubs, I found these wipes to be a bit rough on my skin.</li>
            <li> &quot; feel that I&#x27;ve gotten with other wipes or basic face washing (or even just rinsing).</li>
            <li> They do not over dry or leave patchy dry spots.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t dry my face out either, nor did they leave it feeling oily.</li>
            <li> My forehead and nose tend to get dry &amp; flakey in the winter, and these wipes did nothing to help those problems.  </li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t bone dry nor were they dripping.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These wipes however, I found to be too dry.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint with this product is that it claims to be for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> They also have the most unpleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a thumbs down</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are to be disposed of in the trash, not flushed down the toilet -</li>
            <li> you have delicate or sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but since I do have acne-prone skin so I can never really really tell.</li>
            <li> material is rough and abrasive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wipe itself is rough.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m washing off my makeup, I can see where the rough wipe does pull off makeup, but I don&#x27;t get any soap on my face to wash it with.</li>
            <li> It just feels like I&#x27;m scraping my makeup off with a rough baby wipe.</li>
            <li> but instead it kept getting worse and worse and never got any better...</li>
            <li> usually a quick ways get your makeup off when you are too  lazy or tired to wash.&lt;br /&gt;These wipes however</li>
            <li> They take off makeup easily, nasty gym sweat off your face and they don&#x27;t irritate blemishes (make sure you use the soft side!).  </li>
            <li> It left it feeling as if it were a size too small for my face.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use anything on my face other than soap and water (on my hands) in the morning.</li>
            <li> Some other reviewers mentioned they are scratchy.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other products and they have irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li> Poor results and now knowing that the company isn&#x27;t as &#x27;Simple&#x27; as it once was, I will stick with other brands such as Yes to Carrots.</li>
            <li> and it left behind some white material from the wipe.</li>
            <li> I use them twice a day on average, when I wake up and before bed.  </li>

            <li> couple of other little items I discovered:  </li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t dried out my face or made it greasy like some other products have.  </li>
            <li> Whereas the previous night practically no makeup came off on the wipe (and that was before washing my face), this night a lot of makeup came off onto the wipe(and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking to be less of a slave to my acne.</li>
            <li> did a little research.  </li>
            <li> If your skin feels too raw after use, tone it down a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I then rinsed and dried my face with a towel.</li>
            <li> But I would not rely on them to slough off dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li> The exfoliating side was way too harsh against my skin (leaving it feel skinned), so instead, I then tried the non-exfoliating side.  </li>
            <li> It contains no perfumes or dyes or harsh irritants.  </li>
            <li> These exfoliating wipes seem to do double-duty by removing dead skin and oils -- and then closing up the pores with a toner.  </li>
            <li> skin is oily and  tough, and these were too rough for</li>
            <li> Afterward I looked in the mirror to see if it left shreds behind like others complained about - Nope!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re actually a little rough, and very thin.  </li>
            <li> I know these are supposed to be exfoliating, but even though I consider myself to have very tough (not sensitive at all)</li>
            <li> they seemed so scratchy and harsh to me, and were almost impossible to remove eyemakeup with because of the texture and because they do not have enough liquid on them.</li>
            <li> Everything I&#x27;ve ever used that exfoliates has a grittiness to it, so it&#x27;s hard to imagine how you can deliver an exfoliant in a tossable wipe.</li>
            <li> Use your common sense:  Don&#x27;t scrub too hard and don&#x27;t use these on your eyes.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like washing my face in the sink, never liked the splashing water on my face so having a wipe to do what I should be doing every day</li>
            <li> all the negative reviews I was reading about this product</li>
            <li> I keep this in the kitchen drawer and when I am tired at night, I use it before going up to bed instead of my Clarisonic with Skinmceutical Gel Cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I can not use this for my face, it is painful at least 15 minutes after using.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve used \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; skin products and have been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> Just as bad is that  they always leave flecks of the wipe behind all  over my face.  </li>

            <li> Every time I go to England, this is what I fill my suitcase with for my return to the US.  Many people bring back fridge magnets of Kate and William or special chocolate, my last stop is Boots for these wonderful wipes.  My skin feels great, it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes, they do&#x27;t have any annoying fragrance. I wish they were flushable but oh, well.  I&#x27;ll still visit England, but now I can stock up on Kate and William magnets instead of hauling back Simple wipes.  Thank you, amazon.com.  BTW, highly recommended... and it&#x27;s cheaper than flying in to Heathrow.</li>
            <li> my favorite wipes, limited ingredients and rough texture to help me get rid of the dead skin. love it</li>
            <li> These are really great for anyone that can&#x27;t keep up the morning and night cleansing for whatever reason.  They are so quick, easy and do a great job getting your face feeling clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I read all the reviews about sensitive skin.  I will stick with the ones I use from Neutrogena they are very gentle.&lt;br /&gt;These made my skin feel tingly and they scratched my face, I didnt like them.  I know they are supposed to be exfoliating but I use the exfoliating from Neutrogena and those dont scratch.  I wont be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for on the go applications since it is easy to use, store, and seal closed.  It feels great after use, leave skin feeling clean and moist and not oily.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I can not use this for my face, it is painful at least 15 minutes after using. I really do not get why this kind of textile..</li>
            <li> These wipes are great!!! They exfoliate leaving your face clean and soft!&lt;br /&gt;Great for taking off makeup as well. Highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> These are nice medium level exfoliating wipes. They don&#x27;t take off your skin the way a mask or scrub would but they are better than using just a facial soap. They certainly look like they&#x27;ve been used on me by the end of the day (they are not as white as they started out). They do not over dry or leave patchy dry spots. My skin feel smoother and cleaner. I also never had any tearing up or stringent scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like washing my face in the sink, never liked the splashing water on my face so having a wipe to do what I should be doing every day is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a nice, easy going wipe, easy to use, a great way to do an end of day clean-up and refresh.</li>
            <li> i was really disappointed with these. they seemed so scratchy and harsh to me, and were almost impossible to remove eyemakeup with because of the texture and because they do not have enough liquid on them. i think the regular non exfoliating wipes would probably be great, but these were very rough for my skin.</li>
            <li> I mainly got these wipes to remove makeup in addition to my normal cream cleanser because I felt like I wasn&#x27;t getting a deep enough clean with just the lather-and-rinse method, like not all of my makeup was coming off. I also did nothing to exfoliate and I have acne so I figured I would give these a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry (which is what the directions on the package seem to indicate), these did nothing for me. I would definitely agree with the reviewer that said they were scratchy and did not have enough liquid on them. It also seemed to irritate my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, because of the lack of liquid issue described, the next night I washed my face (wet my face, applied cleanser, and rinsed lightly, but did not dry my face) and used the wipe on my wet skin. I found this worked much better, especially using a circular wiping motion. Whereas the previous night practically no makeup came off on the wipe (and that was before washing my face), this night a lot of makeup came off onto the wipe(and I was using it after washing my face). I then rinsed and dried my face with a towel. Afterwards, my skin felt unusually soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving 4 stars because \\&quot;I like it\\&quot; when I use it according to the second method, but if I just used it the way the directions indicate I would probably give only 2 stars.</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I was looking for. I have tried several different facial wipes and they have done a good job as far as cleaning my face but I wanted something with a little rougher feel to exfoliate my face and these definitely fit the bill. I will order again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----I had to change my rating for this item. They made me break out really bad. I thought it was just that I had changed face care products but instead it kept getting worse and worse and never got any better...I really had high hopes for these...</li>
            <li> I love these and am so glad to find them here.  None of my local stores carry them any more, but when i was able to find them they worked great to get rid of the dry scaly skin that&#x27;s gotten worse as i&#x27;ve gotten into my 60s.  They aren&#x27;t drying and leave my skin soft and nicer than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, plus they&#x27;re great if you tend to be lazy at bedtime.  I&#x27;m going to stock up!!!!</li>
            <li> Using these exfoliating wipes on my clean skin produces a tingly sensation and noticeably smoother skin.  I notice no redness or discomfort after use, although I have experienced both redness and discomfort with other exfoliating products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How will this work after a full month of use?  I&#x27;ve used it only one week, so I cannot be sure, but I expect to see much clearer and brighter skin then.  Without this long term evidence, I cannot give this product five stars, but if it performs as I anticipate, I will update this review and increase my rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four Stars</li>
            <li> I am a no fuss kind of gal.  When I say that, I mean I literally roll out of bed to a programmed coffee pot full of my favorite brew, throw on my clothes and hit the gym type of person.  I can pack these in my gym bag if I want, I can take them in my luggage when I travel, they are just so convenient.  And they get the job done!  They take off makeup easily, nasty gym sweat off your face and they don&#x27;t irritate blemishes (make sure you use the soft side!).  After a week of using these, I noticed my skin becoming more even (less dry in dry areas and less oily in t-zone) and my breakouts are definitely fewer.  I use them twice a day on average, when I wake up and before bed.  They are also a good &amp;#34;refresher&amp;#34; after a workout to clean up your face.  I&#x27;ll definitely be using these for a loooong time!</li>
            <li> My only complaint with this product is that it claims to be for sensitive skin.  I do not have skin I consider to be particularly sensitive;  while I enjoyed how these worked and felt on my skin, these are also the sort of wipes that mean exfoliate when they do say exfoliate.  I can see those with sensitive skin yelling \\&quot;too much!\\&quot; on the harshness of these wipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, I recommend these to those with normal skin.  This is a handy little wipe that gives skin a basic cleansing and is rough enough with what I assume to be the right ingredients to give an awesome exfoliation boost that is on par with your average face scrub.  It&#x27;s a much less messy way to exfoliate and the wipe format is great.</li>
            <li> These handy, unscented cleansing wipes have deep pores, creating a soft, yet abrasive exfoliating surface. The twenty-five moist wipes in each moisture-retaining, resealable package are a convenient, effective and refreshing solution for cleaning neck, face and ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It states to avoid contact with eyes, while within the package&#x27;s bullet points it claims to be safe for sensitive eyes and contact lens wearers; I will just keep from wiping it over my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are to be disposed of in the trash, not flushed down the toilet - it&#x27;s easy to tell that these substantial wipes are not water soluble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple adds restoring Vitamin B5, moisturizing Vitamin E and soothing Aloe Vera to these exfoliating facial wipes for a gentle satisfying clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 50&#x27;s and my skin tends to be oily with clogged pores.  I keep this in the kitchen drawer and when I am tired at night, I use it before going up to bed instead of my Clarisonic with Skinmceutical Gel Cleanser.  It was originally something that I used instead of the \\&quot;stuff that works\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it off and on for the last couple months and slowly but surely, it has become my favorite way to clean my face.  It takes off my makeup, my face feels clean but not dry and my complexion is improving.  If you have combination or oily skin particularly in the T-zone, you may enjoy the convenience of this product as well as the fact that it really works.</li>
            <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;+Feel great on skin&lt;br /&gt;+Leave a clean feeling&lt;br /&gt;+Skin hasn&#x27;t shown a bad reaction&lt;br /&gt;+ Convenient&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-Smell weird&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I don&#x27;t really have sensitive skin, I didn&#x27;t think these were in any way harsh feeling. They felt really nice actually, and I was surprised that for feeling so soft they left my face feeling so smooth and clean. They didn&#x27;t dry my face out either, nor did they leave it feeling oily. I appreciate the ease of use as well. Before this I used scrubs, which get water all over the counter, and the scrubbing beads would get in my eyes-it was annoying. The only thing with these is that you&#x27;ll need to remove your makeup before hand. They aren&#x27;t meant to be a makeup remover. They do remove it, but I noticed my skin doesn&#x27;t feel as great as when i remove makeup before use.&lt;br /&gt;I put smell as a con; because there aren&#x27;t any frilly perfumes, the only smell there is is from the natural ingredients. It doesn&#x27;t smell unpleasant. Just not like the rose or peach scented stuff I&#x27;m used to. And I certainly appreciate it, because I don&#x27;t want all the extra chemicals going on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I certainly recommend these great wipes. They are easy and they work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Simple products and have been happily satisfied with most of them.  These facial wipes are the exception.  First of all, it doesn&#x27;t look like your run of the mill facial wipe.  It looks (and feels) like the wipes you get at rib houses!  The wipes are somewhat textured, but definitely not textured enough to exfoliate your skin!  They&#x27;re actually a little rough, and very thin.  I don&#x27;t get that clean refreshed feeling afterwards either. My forehead and nose tend to get dry &amp; flakey in the winter, and these wipes did nothing to help those problems.  They also have the most unpleasant scent.  I don&#x27;t even know how to describe it. The best I can say about these wipes are that they&#x27;re a good cleanup for my hands &amp; feet, but for my face?  Not what I&#x27;m looking for, want or need.  Definitely a thumbs down</li>
            <li> These wipes are amazing. I feel so refreshed after using them, especially after the gym. I have really sensitive skin and I highly recommend this to people with sensitive skin. Also great for travelers, no longer need to carry small bottle of cleansers.</li>
            <li> I work in a greasy environment (Oil Refinery) and I like to wipe the working grime off my face twice a day (Mid-day and End of work).  These wipes seem to do a fine job of removing the dirt, grease and grime from my skin, but I&#x27;m left with a bunch of cotton fibers stuck all over my face.  This product may not be designed to hold up to the rigors that I am using it for, because I am scrubbing with plenty of elbow grease.  I do not recommend this for someone that is looking to remove working grime in an industrial environment.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin.  Many of these types of wipes cause redness or stinging when I use them.  The Simple Exfoliating wipes gave me no problem, leaving me with clean, fresh-feeling skin.  Something of note is that these wipes seem to be much bigger than most of the wipes out there.  It&#x27;s a generous surface amount that makes cleaning your whole face easier.  The wipes have two sides - there&#x27;s a rougher side for exfoliation and a softer side for gentler cleaning.  However, I found that even the exfoliating side was gentle enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying more.  I&#x27;d like to keep a package in my purse for whenever I feel like I just need to feel a little more cool and refreshed</li>
            <li> These exfoliating wipes are refreshing,and gentle to skin, but in comparison to others I&#x27;ve tested, I&#x27;d rather have a light fragrance with skin feeling more smooth. In AZ we use wipes a great deal during 8 hot months of the year. We also use them frequently. Other wipes I have tested also left more of a cooling sensation, which I didn&#x27;t receive with this product.</li>
            <li> This wipe is a thick material that doesn&#x27;t tear easily.  It has a nubbed texture that acts as an exfoliant and gives a gentle scrub.  Note that it is a facial wipe but it doesn&#x27;t remove make up well/at all, surprisingly.  But I do feel like oils and dirts are lifted easily and effectively.  In all, I prefer wipes like this with a light texture that scrubs but doesn&#x27;t burn/hurt.</li>
            <li> These are easy to use and work well for daily use. I love taking these on vacations, camping, gym, etc.  I am not sure how much exfoliating they are but they smell nice and cleans my face.</li>
            <li> These \\&quot;Simple Exfoliating Wipes\\&quot; do a good job, leaves my face feeling quite clean. I have chronic condition that has prevent me from taking a bath and reduced the my weekly showers to about 3, so getting my self clean with full water immersion has been very important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wipes are a bit rough feeling, which I guess adds to the exfoliating factor, but it does clean quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.  My face even more so and I also have rosacea.  In the past I&#x27;ve used \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; skin products and have been disappointed.  Especially when it comes to anything with exfoliating qualities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin often feels like it needs something with exfoliating qualities but tends to break out or become very irritated, itchy, inflamed, flaming red, etc when I use them.  So I don&#x27;t.  Scrubbing also irritates my facial skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this product caused some minor redness that went away within a minute or two.  My skin felt smooth.  Touch did not irritate my skin (something that often is true after cleaning).  Even the next morning my skin felt and looked good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did a great job of removing makeup while leaving my skin feeling great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m surprised and pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also next to no scent.</li>
            <li> These exfoliating wipes are just that - wipes that exfoliate your skin.  They&#x27;re pretty rough, so I avoided using them every day, but on days when my makeup felt like it had seeped into my skin, I could use one of these to feel fresh again. I ended up using these every time I had makeup that I wanted to get off, and using my normal wipes when I just wanted to wipe down a clean face.  Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with these, but you&#x27;d probably still want to use an gentler wipe around the eyes or for every day use and limit these to every few days for exfoliating.</li>
            <li> These are SO rough on my face, and i only use these after the gym to wick away perspiration  (meaning, i dont use them to take off my makeup b/c that would require even  more pressure...and irritation).  Just as bad is that  they always leave flecks of the wipe behind all  over my face.  nothing simple about these at all!!!</li>
            <li> These facial wipes have a slightly rough texture to them, which gives them the ability to exfoliate your skin. They do a pretty good job of that; except they do not leave a cooling sensation as most other facial wipes do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plus is that they have no perfume and they do leave your face feeling smooth. The package is soft and you pull a self-sticking tab to open it and press it down to close the package again. About half way through the self-sticking is not as secure which can lead to the wipes drying out. They are not very moist to begin with either, which would have made them more refreshing.</li>
            <li> Been using for a few months and really like that they get all the makeup off on one wipe. They dont seem to make me break out any more than whats normal for me but since I do have acne-prone skin so I can never really really tell. The best part is that this product does NOT TEST ON ANIMALS! YAY because if they did I wouldnt not be buying anymore (switching to all cruelty free products)</li>
            <li> Wipes are large in size and have a very light, clean fragrance, although package says no parfumes are added.  No scrubbing material is added to the wipe, rather the open weave provides the texture for exfoliation.  Made in UK.</li>
            <li> I enjoy facial wipes- usually a quick ways get your makeup off when you are too  lazy or tired to wash.&lt;br /&gt;These wipes however, were horrible.&lt;br /&gt;The material is rough and abrasive.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like trying to exfoliate your face with sand paper.&lt;br /&gt;In addition the wipes are not porous- so they on&#x27;t feel \\&quot;wet\\&quot; enough.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is oily and  tough, and these were too rough for me.&lt;br /&gt;If you have delicate or sensitive skin, do not  not use these.&lt;br /&gt;Also way too abrasive for the eye area.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend these at ll.</li>
            <li> I am an avid exfoliator so maybe that&#x27;s why these wipes don&#x27;t seem to do anything for my skin.  They are almost dry right out of the package and I can&#x27;t detect any exfoliation at all when I use them.  They aren&#x27;t bad, my skin does fel clean when I use these with some water and after rinsing. But I would not rely on them to slough off dead skin cells.  Update - Now that I have used nearly all of my first pack, I think I will buy more.  I still feel that they are not abrasive enough, but my face does feel clean after use.  I rinse the wipe in very warm water after the first swipe and re-do my face with the rinsed and wrung wipe before drying my skin.  I always clean in and around my sink with the wipe before finally tossing it in the trash.</li>
            <li> This is the best disposable cleansing wipe I&#x27;ve found for oily skin! I use this in the evening before bed and the exfoliating side scrubs without damaging skin or leaving a residue. I have severe acne prone skin and have always had to thoroughly wash skin morning and night. This takes my evening regimen down to a few seconds of gentle wiping while still getting the grime off! Now that I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s I&#x27;m looking to be less of a slave to my acne. Great product! Please don&#x27;t ever take these off the market!</li>
            <li> The exfoliating side was way too harsh against my skin (leaving it feel skinned), so instead, I then tried the non-exfoliating side.  It was still too drying for my skin.  It left it feeling as if it were a size too small for my face.  Even using moisturizer did not make up for the drying of the product.  When my face starting turning red, I stopped using the product.  It may be that my skin is ultra-sensitive (as I can&#x27;t use a wash cloth without damage to my face) and that regular sensitive skin will respond well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did clean and exfoliate, so it did its job; however, I cannot recommend the product to those with sensitivity to abrasion rather than to those who are only sensitive to chemicals.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use anything on my face other than soap and water (on my hands) in the morning. Never have. So my face hasn&#x27;t been toughened over the years. With this in mind, I figured I would be a good test subject for this product. If it was scratchy - I would definitely feel it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From all the negative reviews I was reading about this product, I was expecting something like dry scratchy paper towel sheets that won&#x27;t remove makeup unless you wet your face first. Boy was I wrong. They weren&#x27;t bone dry nor were they dripping. Just somewhere in-between. I gingerly put the sheet to my face and waited to be scratched as I rubbed it back and forth. Nada! It felt fine. I next swiped it over my eyes to remove my makeup. Yup it removed it. You could see the brown eye makeup residue on the sheet. No wetting my face first was needed. Afterward I looked in the mirror to see if it left shreds behind like others complained about - Nope! So I don&#x27;t know that the problem is with all the others. This worked fine for me.</li>
            <li> Simple Exfoliating Wipes have a neutral scent and are gentle on facial skin.  They are very refreshing and leave the skin feeling clean but not stripped or irritated.  They are even soothing to the skin after shaving.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for a bit now and oh they work so good.  My face feels so clean and my skin so fresh and soft after cleaning with one of the wipes that it makes it a pleasure to use it.  No smell, gentle for sensitive skin but it cleans as though you have scrubbed and scrubbed.  It hasn&#x27;t dried out my face or made it greasy like some other products have.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned these are worth their weight in gold.  Nothing like good feeling clean skin after wearing cosmetics all day.</li>
            <li> I know these are supposed to be exfoliating, but even though I consider myself to have very tough (not sensitive at all) skin, these hurt my face. I actually threw them away.</li>
            <li> I tried a variety of Simple products and found that none of them caused a reaction with my sensitive skin.  They all have a mild smell to them that is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These wipes however, I found to be too dry.  The texture is great and they scrub well, but I felt like I needed to wet them, especially as I got down to the bottom of the package.  Otherwise they were simply too rough on my skin.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from an exfoliating wipe. Everything I&#x27;ve ever used that exfoliates has a grittiness to it, so it&#x27;s hard to imagine how you can deliver an exfoliant in a tossable wipe. The wipe itself is rough. The weave on it feels like an extremely light sandpaper. I was very surprised at how well these work. I do feel like my skin is being exfoliated, but without the gritty aftereffects. This is perfect for times when you need to quickly freshen up.</li>
            <li> These exfoliating facial wipes make my face feel fresh and clean.  These wipes contain vitamins B5 and E, and also aloe vera.  It contains no perfumes or dyes or harsh irritants.  The front of the package also says \\&quot;for naturally healthy looking skin\\&quot; and \\&quot;double sided cleansing action\\&quot; and \\&quot;sensitive skin experts\\&quot; (that&#x27;s me - the person with the sensitive skin - not the sensitive skin expert).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love facial wipes such as these.  I use these at home, but they would also be good for traveling.  The wipes are moist, so you wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about hydrating them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just love these wipes.  They make my face feel good.  They fill my needs.  Highly recommended if you are in need of facial wipes.</li>
            <li> These were awful, I use exfoliates all the time on my face but this was just like rubbing sand paper on my face. They do not lather nor are they moist like most face wipes and made my face super red and hurt for over 30 minutes afterwards.</li>
            <li> Some key points about these wipes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Some other reviewers mentioned they are scratchy.  My understanding is that that is the point of exfoliating wipes - the texture helps exfoliate.  They do a good job without being harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Although not touted to do so, they remove makeup completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ One great use is for freshening up after a workout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Great that they lack scent.  I don&#x27;t like having enduring perfume scents on or around my face.</li>
            <li> I have used many brands of facial wipes before, but this is the first time I have used an exfoliating wipe. I use exfoliating facial scrubs on a regular basis (I mostly use St Ives apricot facial scrub). However, despite being used to facial scrubs, I found these wipes to be a bit rough on my skin. I did not like how they felt. I like that they contain no perfumes or dyes. I also like that they contain vitamins E and B5. So, while not great, they are not all bad.</li>
            <li> These are nice wipes and they&#x27;re scrubby enough to exfoliate the dead skin cells.  They&#x27;re not too abrasive, but still scratchy enough to do their jobs.  The scent is neutral and not offensive.  Use your common sense:  Don&#x27;t scrub too hard and don&#x27;t use these on your eyes.  If your skin feels too raw after use, tone it down a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These contain enough moisturizing lotion to leave your skin feeling smooth.  This is nice compared to regular diaper wipes that have alcohol in them and dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no irritating to my skin at all.  I have tried other products and they have irritated my skin.  I am so happy to have found this!!!!  The other products they offer I am currently using and they are great!!!!</li>
            <li> These are ok. They seemed to work well in cleaning off my eye makeup and felt ok, but I didn&#x27;t have a nice \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feel that I&#x27;ve gotten with other wipes or basic face washing (or even just rinsing). They&#x27;re just slightly damp, even when first opened and aside from makeup, it didn&#x27;t seem like any daily grime came off (not that my face is full of dirt, I even tried my hands :-)&lt;br /&gt;As far as the exfoliating factor, not so much. They&#x27;re a bit rougher than the Dove cloths that I&#x27;ve tried, but didn&#x27;t add anything to their cleaning power.</li>
            <li> I received a pack of these to try out and while the concept was interesting, when I tried one on my face it irritated it. Made my face itch and it left behind some white material from the wipe. I won&#x27;t be using these again.</li>
            <li> These exfoliating wipes seem to do double-duty by removing dead skin and oils -- and then closing up the pores with a toner.  My face feels fresh afterward.  Yes, the wipes are textured, giving them a little roughness for exfoliation, but it&#x27;s not nearly as rough as a facial scrub.  Use them gently but firmly.  The wipes don&#x27;t contain any perfume, and, as the label says, no animals were used in the testing of the product.  All is good in the world of facial care!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</li>
            <li> ~The good~&lt;br /&gt;Works well on sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;Good number of wipes per pack (25)&lt;br /&gt;Rough texture of wipes scrubs off color-stay makeup&lt;br /&gt;Resealable pack keeps wipes moist&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The not so good~&lt;br /&gt;Wipes don&#x27;t produce any sort of lather, even if you add water&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliating effect is produced through a rough textured wipe which can be a little harsher than typical scrubs&lt;br /&gt;Feels more like a rough wipe than a wipe with cleanser in it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These wipes would work even better if the cleanser it contains lathered in some way. It&#x27;s hard to tell if the cleaner is washing your skin or not, because you can&#x27;t really get any cleanser out of the wipes. When I&#x27;m washing off my makeup, I can see where the rough wipe does pull off makeup, but I don&#x27;t get any soap on my face to wash it with. It just feels like I&#x27;m scraping my makeup off with a rough baby wipe. So these are probably best to use when you&#x27;re not wearing any makeup on your skin, and just need something to lightly wipe off oils from your face.</li>
            <li> I guess I don&#x27;t really get the point of these wipes.  They&#x27;re supposed to be exfoliating, but I am supposed to use them as a cleanser?  Do they moisturize?  I can&#x27;t really tell.  The experience of using them is akin to wiping a baby wipe across the face- I had a hard time enjoying it.  As promised, they are scent-free.  When I finished using the wipe my skin didn&#x27;t feel any softer or better, and I can&#x27;t really discern a great benefit.  For better facial cleansing I would recommend [[ASIN:B005TI7NQ2 Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub, 5 Ounce (Pack of 2)]]- it&#x27;s made by the same folks, and it has a nice exfoliating effect without the diaper wipe experience.  I found that the scrub worked better.</li>
            <li> Welcome to acne land!  Switched back to the regular brand after a week and acne cleared up.  Pretty sure it was due to this brand&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a little research.  Simple was bought by Unilever.  Brands include: Aviance, Axe/Lynx, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s, Dove, Flora/Becel, Heartbrand, Hellmann&#x27;s, Knorr, Lipton, Lux/Radox, Omo/Surf, Rexona/Sure, Sunsilk, Toni &amp; Guy, TRESemm&amp;eacute;, VO5 and Wish-Bone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of other little items I discovered:  Simple does contain parabens which several studies have linked to cancer (especially breast cancer).  Also they now animal test.  Just wanted to put that out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brand&#x27;s products caused an acne flare up that went away soon after switching back to our normal product.  Poor results and now knowing that the company isn&#x27;t as &#x27;Simple&#x27; as it once was, I will stick with other brands such as Yes to Carrots.</li>
