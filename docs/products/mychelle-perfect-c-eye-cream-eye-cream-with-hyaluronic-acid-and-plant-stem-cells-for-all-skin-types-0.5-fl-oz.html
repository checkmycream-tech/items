            <li>The best part?</li>
            <li>But the best part is that they work!  </li>
            <li>As I said, I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 years now and am very impressed.  </li>
            <li>Great value- do not see the need to spend lots of money when this one does the trick!</li>
            <li>This product line does wonderful things for the skin.</li>
            <li>and my eyes look great!</li>
            <li>I tried a sample of this cream and loved it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of under-eye creams and gels, all supposedly superior products, but this is the one I&#x27;ve had the best luck with.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s totally great, except I thought it would tighten up these bags.</li>
            <li>I am a beauty product junky and this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>Great eye cream</li>
            <li>It smells great and does not burn your eyes, but I do not feel I have had any improvement with this product.</li>
            <li>As an added bonus, it smells nice too!  </li>
            <li>Really a great product and an amazing deal.</li>
            <li>It is light and perfect for summer...</li>
            <li>Fabulous stuff - with great results!</li>
            <li>Nice but not as great as the night cream.  </li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, and the price was great--</li>
            <li>It is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Amazing stuff.  </li>
            <li>I tried this in a sample before I purchased, so I knew that I liked it.  </li>
            <li>Although I like this eye cream and the ingredients are safe, I would probably not purchase it again, because it was nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li>I was impressed with what was in this, but my eyes are so sensitive that I used it on my neck instead.</li>
            <li>Good that it is paraben free.</li>
            <li>I used to use a popular brand name line for many many years and switched to this because no testing is done on animals.</li>
            <li>The scent is very light floral.  </li>
            <li>I have used Mychelle products for about 2 years now and am thoroughly pleased.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I will definitely reorder since it has good ingredients, seems to work and smells great.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Considering the cost ($52 per year with Shiseido and $58 or more per year with Mychelle), I think I&#x27;m going to stick with Shiseido.      </li>
            <li>This is lovely.</li>
            <li>I love this product, and I love Amazon&#x27;s prices.</li>
            <li>I also love the texture of the cream</li>
            <li>As with most beauty products...</li>
            <li>This eye cream is just ok, does not work much better than others I have purchased.  </li>
            <li>I love it, I use mychelle pumpkin cream, hydrating serum, scrub and this eye cream.</li>
            <li>But for sure over time it would work considering how hydrating it is.</li>
            <li>I love all MyChelle products.</li>
            <li>so why is a great company like MyChelle using so much of it?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for many years.</li>
            <li>I have to make sure to blend it in a bit more once I do apply it.</li>
            <li>I have used many Mychelle products and love most of them, but this was not one of them.</li>
            <li>And I love the fact that has no chemicals.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fairly clean product and it absorbs nicely for under eye makeup.  </li>
            <li>one of the best eye creams I&#x27;ve tried  for dry under eyes.</li>
            <li>so it spreads too easily and gets into your eyes and hurts like heck.</li>
            <li>Although I cannot contest how effective it is, it definitely feels good, and not greasy, doesn&#x27;t cause any problem for me.</li>
            <li>I think it does smooths out the fine lines if you use it along with an anti-wrinkle serum.  </li>
            <li>but when I do apply it it doesn&#x27;t absorb as quickly as the famous brand I used to use.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this eye cream.</li>
            <li>As the name indicates, this is a fabulous product.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous product.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell the same as I remember but it works great.</li>
            <li>While this product is p/g free it did still make the area around my eyes itch.</li>
            <li>Light, not greasy.</li>
            <li>The product is easy to use and a great value which goes a long way.</li>
            <li>(thanks to all at MyChelle!!!)</li>
            <li>The most surprising benefit to me is that it has helped with my dry eyes.</li>
            <li>Good for the price, but nowhere near as soothing, longlasting or effective on my sensitive eyes as Sanitas Peptiderm Eye cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not all that rich either.</li>
            <li>but no one knows for sure if it is actually effective because only time will tell (this is not a well-known brand).</li>
            <li>It seems pleasant enough around the eye</li>
            <li>It has a very natural pleasant smell and moisturizes skin very well.</li>
            <li>, does anything really work like the famous brand name that is not tested on animals and environmentally-friendly?</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using other Mychelle products (Pumpkin Peel and Pumpkin Renewal Cream)and am happy with them, I thought I should give their eye cream a try.    </li>
            <li>Suffice it to say that Mychelle offers superior products using natural and beneficial ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I use it around my eyes, around my nose (for those smile lines) and around my lips.  </li>
            <li>This cream is reported to be one of the most sensitive and can even be used for contact wearers.</li>
            <li>I use with the Magnolia Fresh Eyes.</li>
            <li>Soaks right in.  </li>
            <li>ok I have been sunning a lot this summer, new pool, in the morning I have had very puffy eyes.  </li>
            <li>Got the recommendation from an employee at a local natural store, who said the same thing: best eye cream on the market.</li>
            <li>Not only does my skin stay supple and adequately moist (an essential for make-up wearing and not looking caked), but I think it&#x27;s also been a good wrinkle defense.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not helping the earth by all these little containers, and plastic isn&#x27;t good anyway,</li>
            <li>This cream was just okay for a month--didn&#x27;t notice anything fabulous or horrible...until I developed white bumps around my eyelid called \\&quot;milia.\\</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy, and it&#x27;s absorbed very well.</li>
            <li>Even so, I will not be switching to another brand just yet as I haven&#x27;t even finished the first tube.</li>
            <li>This particular eye cream is VERY creamy and rich feeling going on, not slippery or greasy.  </li>
            <li>If you are a younger person or your eye area is not as dry as mine, this will be great for you.  </li>
            <li>for  nighttime I use shea butter or 100% pure superfruits eye balm.</li>
            <li>A light eye cream that diminishes fine lines and can even be used above upper lip.</li>
            <li>I really like this eye cream.  </li>
            <li>Recommend it to everyone who wants better-looking skin.</li>
            <li>Bought this at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about two weeks and haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li>a teensy dot on over each eyelid and around ... plus some over the upper lip ... fabulous, indeed ...</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot (thicker creme) to get all the spots you need it for.  </li>
            <li>It very hydrating, and I like the way my eyes fill in the morning.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>Item met my expectations and was shipped in a reasonable time frame.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I will give this product line a try for a while longer but really</li>
            <li>Perhaps I am asking for too much...</li>
            <li>It significantly reduces the appearance of my puffy/tired eyes because some nights I don&#x27;t get enough sleep.</li>
            <li>but I have noticed that it does a pretty good job preventing it from getting worse and diminishing depth to them</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know, but very grateful for the unexpected side benefit.</li>
            <li>I love this product line but not a huge fan of this eye cream.</li>
            <li>I do wish that the samples in the sample kits were a tad larger, but this line needs to stay around, because they do things right</li>
            <li>Also, one time I applied to much before bed and woke up the next day with really puffy eyes.</li>
            <li>I think it has been effective at reducing my crows feet and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I am an early 40yrs with dry-dehydrated wrinkle eyes.</li>
            <li>Pro: Not greasy and not heavy.  </li>
            <li>and I wanted to switch to all natural products.</li>
            <li>The company has done extensive studies on skin care ingredients, and the information is available on their website and other publications.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of \\&quot;natural\\&quot; over the counter eye creams and this wins hands down.</li>
            <li>I purchased this along with a few other of their products and am enjoying all of them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m normally sensitive to scent in the facial products, but this didn&#x27;t bother me at all.    </li>
            <li>I have tried about 15 different eye creams because my eyes are so sensitive</li>
            <li>I like the fact it&#x27;s made from natural sources, but it doesn&#x27;t provide enough moisturizing properties for my skin.</li>
            <li>Maybe because I have super dry skin around my eyes, I have to use MyChelle eye cream at least twice as much as I used Shiseido and use additional moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I agree with the other reviewer&#x27;s comments, and wanted to add that this cream also works very well for the wrinkles around your mouth.</li>
            <li>I gave 4 stars because I have been using this product for only three weeks, and it is not fast absorbing cream..</li>
            <li>It gets sticky quickly and then seems like I have to pat and rub my skin too hard to get it to absorb.</li>
            <li>Probably it happens due to high amount of oils in the cream.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s helping the wrinkles around my eyes</li>
            <li> I use it as an interim product, when I just want a moisture boost, or I&#x27;m going to take a shower later and don&#x27;t want to wash off all the expensive stuff.</li>

            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this a long time ago but in the stores its really expensive.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewer&#x27;s comments, and wanted to add that this cream also works very well for the wrinkles around your mouth. The most surprising benefit to me is that it has helped with my dry eyes. No, I don&#x27;t put it in my eyes but since I&#x27;ve been using it, I&#x27;ve noticed my eyes aren&#x27;t dry anymore. Mychelle makes no claims for this, and I have no idea why it&#x27;s helping.  The \\&quot;moisturziing drops\\&quot; never worked well for me - only worked for a few minutes after I put them in, \\&quot;filmed\\&quot; my contacts, etc. It may be just because I&#x27;m massaging the area when I put the cream on - don&#x27;t know, but very grateful for the unexpected side benefit.</li>
            <li> Feels good.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for a couple of years now. It last a long time for me, each tube. Although I cannot contest how effective it is, it definitely feels good, and not greasy, doesn&#x27;t cause any problem for me.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this eye cream. I usually switch between this one for the summer and the 100 percent pure coffee bean eye cream for the winter. It is light and perfect for summer...</li>
            <li> A light eye cream that diminishes fine lines and can even be used above upper lip. I noticed results after 2 days of AM/PM use. A pin drop amount per eye is sufficient. The best part? It&#x27;s vegan!</li>
            <li> I had to work too hard to have this absorb and I don&#x27;t think ou should have to do that with an eye cream. another cream for my hands until its done</li>
            <li> A small amount around the orbital bones around the eye, and that&#x27;s all I need--one tube lasts a while. It makes the delicate skin around my eyes feel \\&quot;humectant\\&quot; and relieves that tight feeling immediately and lastingly. Like the few other MyChelle products I have tried, I can feel that I am putting something beneficial on my skin. I do wish that the samples in the sample kits were a tad larger, but this line needs to stay around, because they do things right (thanks to all at MyChelle!!!)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, and the price was great--about half what I normally pay. I&#x27;ll definitely be looking to restock my other favorites from this retailer.</li>
            <li> I am an early 40yrs with dry-dehydrated wrinkle eyes. I gave 4 stars because I have been using this product for only three weeks, and it is not fast absorbing cream..</li>
            <li> As the name indicates, this is a fabulous product.  I have used Mychelle products for about 2 years now and am thoroughly pleased.  Mychelle&#x27;s philosophy in a nutshell, for those unfamiliar, is that she doesn&#x27;t want to put anything on her face that she would feel unsafe putting in her mouth.  The company has done extensive studies on skin care ingredients, and the information is available on their website and other publications.  Suffice it to say that Mychelle offers superior products using natural and beneficial ingredients.  But the best part is that they work!  I&#x27;ve tried a number of under-eye creams and gels, all supposedly superior products, but this is the one I&#x27;ve had the best luck with.  My skin is not \\&quot;mature\\&quot; but I do tend to run on the dry side.  As I said, I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 years now and am very impressed.  Not only does my skin stay supple and adequately moist (an essential for make-up wearing and not looking caked), but I think it&#x27;s also been a good wrinkle defense.  As an added bonus, it smells nice too!  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I really like this eye cream.  I think it has been effective at reducing my crows feet and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Fabulous stuff - with great results! Recommend it to everyone who wants better-looking skin.</li>
            <li> one of the best eye creams I&#x27;ve tried  for dry under eyes. keeps the area hydrated all day. for  nighttime I use shea butter or 100% pure superfruits eye balm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s helping the wrinkles around my eyes but I have noticed a difference in the how rested my eyes look in the morning. It significantly reduces the appearance of my puffy/tired eyes because some nights I don&#x27;t get enough sleep. I apply it before my morning make-up also. I will definitely reorder since it has good ingredients, seems to work and smells great. UPDATE: I noticed my eyelashes are stronger and longer - I&#x27;ll reorder just cause of that!</li>
            <li> I have horrible puffy, dark bag eyes and the only thing this seems to do is moisturize so I don&#x27;t get wrinkles.  That&#x27;s totally great, except I thought it would tighten up these bags.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I hate using products with lots of chemicals. This just works for me.</li>
            <li> Really a great product and an amazing deal.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Received it in a gift bag from an event and have been purchasing ever since. Small amount goes a long way. Great value- do not see the need to spend lots of money when this one does the trick!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Shiseido Benefiance Anti-Wrinkle Eye Cream for a long time.  When they raised its price to $[...], I thought I should look for another alternative.  Since I&#x27;ve been using other Mychelle products (Pumpkin Peel and Pumpkin Renewal Cream)and am happy with them, I thought I should give their eye cream a try.    Pro: Not greasy and not heavy.  Its consistency is thicker than Shiseido, and it leaves matte finish/look on your skin. I think it does smooths out the fine lines if you use it along with an anti-wrinkle serum.  The scent is very light floral.  I&#x27;m normally sensitive to scent in the facial products, but this didn&#x27;t bother me at all.    Con: Not moisturizing enough compare to Shiseido.  Maybe because I have super dry skin around my eyes, I have to use MyChelle eye cream at least twice as much as I used Shiseido and use additional moisturizer.  Considering the cost ($52 per year with Shiseido and $58 or more per year with Mychelle), I think I&#x27;m going to stick with Shiseido.      If you are a younger person or your eye area is not as dry as mine, this will be great for you.  But unfortunately my skin is too dry for this eye cream.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Update: 6/10/2010    I&#x27;m not using the pumpkin renewal cream anymore, but I&#x27;m keeping the pumpkin peel.</li>
            <li> Bought this at Whole Foods. This cream was just okay for a month--didn&#x27;t notice anything fabulous or horrible...until I developed white bumps around my eyelid called \\&quot;milia.\\&quot; The dermatologist said they&#x27;re trapped dead skin cells from using heavy creams. Since this is the only moisturizer I use, MyChelle must be the culprit. I&#x27;d throw it out but it&#x27;s so expensive that I guess I&#x27;ll just use this $30 half-ounce tube for hand lotion. Waste of money and now I have to deal with the white bumps it caused.</li>
            <li> Good for the price, but nowhere near as soothing, longlasting or effective on my sensitive eyes as Sanitas Peptiderm Eye cream. I use it as an interim product, when I just want a moisture boost, or I&#x27;m going to take a shower later and don&#x27;t want to wash off all the expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> Nice but not as great as the night cream.  It didn&#x27;t stay with me as well.&lt;br /&gt;Great ingredients.  Maybe my fault b/c my eyes water some. ??</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it does NOT have a lot of chemicals in it. However, it doesn&#x27;t absorb well. It gets sticky quickly and then seems like I have to pat and rub my skin too hard to get it to absorb. All that manipulation is not good for skin around the eyes. It&#x27;s not all that rich either. I will not be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> This product line does wonderful things for the skin.</li>
            <li> This is lovely. It moisturizes so well, and gets rid of swelling around the eyes and even on a keloid scar that I have on my neck. It also reduces the amount of eye drops I require, as you can apply it all through your eye lashes and lids without fear of burning.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks and haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference.  The product does hydrate the under eye, however, that is not why I purchased it.  I was looking for a product that would brighten dark circles and so far this has not delivered.  Also, one time I applied to much before bed and woke up the next day with really puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> I love this product, and I love Amazon&#x27;s prices. I&#x27;ve tried a number of \\&quot;natural\\&quot; over the counter eye creams and this wins hands down. Got the recommendation from an employee at a local natural store, who said the same thing: best eye cream on the market.</li>
            <li> a teensy dot on over each eyelid and around ... plus some over the upper lip ... fabulous, indeed ...</li>
            <li> Although I like this eye cream and the ingredients are safe, I would probably not purchase it again, because it was nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> ok I have been sunning a lot this summer, new pool, in the morning I have had very puffy eyes.  I was on automatic reorder for this product in 2009 and stopped using it.  Don&#x27;t know why but just stopped.  Anyway, I found a tube of this eye cream and decided to try it for the puffiness.  Well let me tell you NO MORE puffiness.  It is amazing.  Who knew, I didn&#x27;t.  Fabulous product.  Take it from me,  I am a beauty product junky and this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> This is also my second time purchasing this eye cream!  I use it around my eyes, around my nose (for those smile lines) and around my lips.  I also love the texture of the cream and you don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot (thicker creme) to get all the spots you need it for.  As with most beauty products... I don&#x27;t know that it actually gets rid of wrinkles but I have noticed that it does a pretty good job preventing it from getting worse and diminishing depth to them (I can tell when I use it or don&#x27;t use it).</li>
            <li> DO NOT GET CLOSE TO YOUR EYE. OUCH!!!! The consistency is very thin so it spreads too easily and gets into your eyes and hurts like heck. MINIMAL HYDRATION!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This eye cream is just ok, does not work much better than others I have purchased.  I&#x27;ll kep using it till its all gone.  I won&#x27;t be ordering it again.  I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years now.  It&#x27;s a fairly clean product and it absorbs nicely for under eye makeup.  I would say it lived up to its name....it&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
            <li> I love it, I use mychelle pumpkin cream, hydrating serum, scrub and this eye cream. It very hydrating, and I like the way my eyes fill in the morning. I&#x27;m not sure if it makes fine lines smaller, because i forget to use it everyday. But for sure over time it would work considering how hydrating it is. I love all MyChelle products.</li>
            <li> My skin was very dry this winter and I wanted to switch to all natural products. I tried a sample of this cream and loved it! I like a lot of the MyChelle face products but this is one of my favorites. Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy, and it&#x27;s absorbed very well. Just wish it was cheaper. Haha.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this a long time ago but in the stores its really expensive.  I came across this on amazon and decided to try it.  It doesn&#x27;t smell the same as I remember but it works great. It doesn&#x27;t crease under makeup and keeps my lines from forming. I have it set to the auto ship so I won&#x27;t be without and I get a discount!!</li>
            <li> Good product, though I don&#x27;t know if I will buy it again, maybe, yes maybe no.  I&#x27;m only half way through the tube.  the product works some.  There is an improvement.  But I keep questioning all this use of plastic...  I&#x27;m not helping the earth by all these little containers, and plastic isn&#x27;t good anyway, so why is a great company like MyChelle using so much of it?</li>
            <li> Item met my expectations and was shipped in a reasonable time frame.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a dramatic change in my skin.  The product is easy to use and a great value which goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff.  Soaks right in.  I&#x27;m 43.  Not greasy.  I use this once a day and my eyes look great!</li>
            <li> I have tried about 15 different eye creams because my eyes are so sensitive and I have an allergy to propylene glycol. While this product is p/g free it did still make the area around my eyes itch. This cream is reported to be one of the most sensitive and can even be used for contact wearers. I however was unable to tolerate it.</li>
            <li> Great eye cream Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for many years. Light, not greasy. Non toxic .</li>
            <li> I love this product line but not a huge fan of this eye cream.</li>
            <li> This eye cream isn&#x27;t as moisturizing as others I&#x27;ve tried (Philosophy, Skinceuticals).  I like the fact it&#x27;s made from natural sources, but it doesn&#x27;t provide enough moisturizing properties for my skin.</li>
            <li> I just switched to this line of face care. I used to use a popular brand name line for many many years and switched to this because no testing is done on animals. I hope it is working but no one knows for sure if it is actually effective because only time will tell (this is not a well-known brand). I will just comment on the consistency of the cream. It seems pleasant enough around the eye but when I do apply it it doesn&#x27;t absorb as quickly as the famous brand I used to use. I have to make sure to blend it in a bit more once I do apply it. Even so, I will not be switching to another brand just yet as I haven&#x27;t even finished the first tube. I will give this product line a try for a while longer but really, does anything really work like the famous brand name that is not tested on animals and environmentally-friendly? Not sure.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with what was in this, but my eyes are so sensitive that I used it on my neck instead.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell. Also it irritated the area under my eyes and I returned it.  Good that it is paraben free.</li>
            <li> I like the cream texture.It has a very natural pleasant smell and moisturizes skin very well.Suits sencitive eyes, does not cause any irritation.The only thing I do not like is it causes undereye bags in the morning if I apply it at night.Probably it happens due to high amount of oils in the cream.It is  just my individual reaction.</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with a few other of their products and am enjoying all of them.  This particular eye cream is VERY creamy and rich feeling going on, not slippery or greasy.  The product feels terrific but I am not seeing a lot of miraculous eye wrinkles going away and my hope is for long term results, not for results only during the wearing of the product.  Perhaps I am asking for too much...</li>
            <li> I have used many Mychelle products and love most of them, but this was not one of them. It smells great and does not burn your eyes, but I do not feel I have had any improvement with this product.</li>
            <li> I finally found an eye product that I can see results.  I tried this in a sample before I purchased, so I knew that I liked it.  And I love the fact that has no chemicals.  I use with the Magnolia Fresh Eyes.</li>
