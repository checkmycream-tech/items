            <li>It made my skin more oily at first, and I was going to give up on it, but then my skin somehow balance itself out with this product and it is part of my routine.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin visibly clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cleans out your pores without drying your skin out and I love the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>I had tried many facial cleanser include the top of the line name brand but no succee.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a whole lot and it left my skin feeling nice and fresh. :)</li>
            <li>It is rare for me to break out.</li>
            <li>so you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Really foamy and rich.</li>
            <li>I purchased a tube full of high hopes.</li>
            <li>this thing clears up my skin during its first week two times a day.</li>
            <li>Love this deep cleansing foaming face wash!</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels after washing my face with this, I will definitely repurchase again!</li>
            <li>After reading all the positive reviews, I bought this in hopes of it improving my problem areas around my nose and chin, maybe even help with my oily skin.</li>
            <li>After using it for a week or so my skins shown progress, it&#x27;s clearer and super soft.</li>
            <li>This products really cleanse the face.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Very creamy...but doesn&#x27;t take off makeup....</li>
            <li>Really cleans your face and leaves it smooth and ready for a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Cleared my face up fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why this product is rated so high by other users, I found it at best</li>
            <li>I had 4 new pimples in the first week of using it</li>
            <li>: It has a high surfactant level and gets very sudsy.</li>
            <li>The first few times I used this I had really like it, it&#x27;s foamy and felt nice on my skin, but as time went on I noticed it wasn&#x27;t removing my make up well enough.</li>
            <li>The PH is too high (around 8.5) for it to prevent bacterial growth on the skin.</li>
            <li>It does a good job at completely cleaning my face and a tiny tiny bit goes a long way</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve developed mild acne in my mid 20s and been trying new products to get rid of them.</li>
            <li>and my face would feel super dry afterwards.</li>
            <li>However, My husband said that my skin has a tremendous improvement after only 4 days of using this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>You only need a little bit to clean the entire face which is good because it is a small tube.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel soft after use</li>
            <li>I have a combination and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Definitely would recommend as a gentle cleanser for anyone.</li>
            <li>love this product a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize that this product had such a high PH</li>
            <li>It works really well and doesnt dry out my face.</li>
            <li>The best thing about this product as well, is that a little definitely goes a long way, it may come in a small bottle but it&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li>It came completely out of the blue way after the cream</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling squeaky clean and tight (but not too dry).</li>
            <li>Even a small amount about the size of pinkie nail gives me enough to clean my face with.</li>
            <li>Also, it does not dry my skin out which is another plus.</li>

            <li> Broke me out horribly and irritated my skin very harsh on the skin</li>
            <li> love this product a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;1. Bottle small&lt;br /&gt;2. You only need a dime size or less for foam&lt;br /&gt;3. Makes my skin feel soft after use</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews, I bought this in hopes of it improving my problem areas around my nose and chin, maybe even help with my oily skin. The first few times I used this I had really like it, it&#x27;s foamy and felt nice on my skin, but as time went on I noticed it wasn&#x27;t removing my make up well enough. I always use a toner with a cotton ball after washing my face and would find a lot of foundation on the cotton ball, sometimes I had to use my toner twice just to remove it all. I then started washing my face twice, just to make sure I got all the make up off and my face would feel super dry afterwards. I didn&#x27;t notice any changes to my skin, my skin didn&#x27;t break out or improve. Of course that doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t for someone else, it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it.  It breaks me out</li>
            <li> i havnt used a product ths good in a while. this thing clears up my skin during its first week two times a day. my acne started deflating and my skin is sooooft! u dont need a lt of product each time u cleanse cause it lathers up a lot but when u ,assage it on ur face it dissapears. u wont regret buying.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Changed my skin For the better.</li>
            <li> This product works so well and my blemishes started to go away after only a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> This products really cleanse the face. The texture is creamy and foamy which I like. I use the face wash and the serum from Mizon. I have tried so many facial product and this the best. This cleanser does not leave a residue on face. This is my go to product.</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li> Really foamy and rich. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is a good foaming cleanser, but it will not work well for people who have acne prone skin. The PH is too high (around 8.5) for it to prevent bacterial growth on the skin. I didn&#x27;t realize that this product had such a high PH otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it. I now use it for body wash. I love Mizon products and the seller got the product to me very quickly!</li>
            <li> Love this face wash this is the second time ordering!</li>
            <li> Happy to receive it!  Didn&#x27;t take as long as they had posted it would take.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Great Korean Invention</li>
            <li> Pro: It has a high surfactant level and gets very sudsy. A little goes a long way. Con: It is not ph balanced. Strips the skin of lipids. Caused my skin to break out. I had 4 new pimples in the first week of using it and I don&#x27;t have acne prone skin. It is rare for me to break out. I am a licensed esthetician and would not recommend this product to my clients.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a whole lot and it left my skin feeling nice and fresh. :)</li>
            <li> Foams nicely and doesn&#x27;t have any strong scent which I appreciate. Even a small amount about the size of pinkie nail gives me enough to clean my face with. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> The tube is small but you seriously only need a little dab for your whole face. It works really well and doesnt dry out my face. I really love this line.&lt;br /&gt;I hiiiighly suggest this.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good cleanser. It does a good job at completely cleaning my face and a tiny tiny bit goes a long way so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this. It&#x27;s really cleans out your pores without drying your skin out and I love the way it feels on my skin. The bottle is small but a little goes a long way so it lasts quite a while. Love it!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like this a tiny bit...trash can it went! The product caused my skin to break out like crazy with pockets of cysts...yuck! AND when I accidentally had a tiny bit of the product touched the egde of my lip  or eyes, it burned...</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. Great foamy action leaves my skin feeling smooth &amp; clean.  Prompt delivery too!</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I took a chance and ordered this product. I ordered the facial cleanser, moisturizer and eye cream. I have aging, combination skin and it&#x27;s difficult to find products that I&#x27;m satisfied with. My search is over. My skin has never felt better.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It leaves my face feeling squeaky clean and tight (but not too dry). Furthermore, you only need the tiniest little bit (like half a pea) because it foams up so much!</li>
            <li> Great product! My face glows from it! I love it and I will order it again .</li>
            <li> Very creamy...but doesn&#x27;t take off makeup....but a ok moisturizing cleanser</li>
            <li> Best Foam cleanser I&#x27;ve purchased. Really cleans your face and leaves it smooth and ready for a daily moisturizer. Love it</li>
            <li> Skin feels great and rinses clean. Works best when combined with other Snail products.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I decided to buy this foam wash. I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! A little goes a long way. My face seems cleaner after using.</li>
            <li> I LIKE IT!good for repair skin and spots</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and this made my skin bone dry. Like so dry that it burned and itched afterwards. It&#x27;s also scented, like a chalky floral scent.</li>
            <li> I love this face foaming cleanser! I have used many cleansers in my days and I could honestly say that this one works wonders with my skin. It leaves my skin looking super clean and matte, my skin looks bright and doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all. Also, it does not dry my skin out which is another plus. The best thing about this product as well, is that a little definitely goes a long way, it may come in a small bottle but it&#x27;ll last a long time. Also, the scent is very pleasant as well.</li>
            <li> Love this deep cleansing foaming face wash! A little goes a long ways so you get your money&#x27;s worth. Really excited to try more of Mizon&#x27;s skincare!</li>
            <li> great foaming cleanser! suds up nicely. lightly scented. gentle but effective cleaning. thick and creamy when you squeeze it out of tube. a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast shipping. Cleared my face up fast.</li>
            <li> Cleanser is wonderful.  I use a baby wipe to put it on, add a little water and wash.  I rinse the baby wipe out, wipe off the excess and toss.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> love this still using it will buy again once it&#x27;s done</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this product is rated so high by other users, I found it at best useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve developed mild acne in my mid 20s and been trying new products to get rid of them. I hear that this is suppose to be a \\&quot;miracle worker\\&quot;. I purchased a tube full of high hopes. The first time I tried it I realized that it is sticky :(. OK but maybe it will help with the acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks in I started to notice that my skin got worse! I was calming my self down with \\&quot;it gets worse before it gets better\\&quot;, nah! 4 weeks in---horrible, worse than before. I gave up on the product (used it as hand cream---it is not moisturizing enough for that by the way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never again will I buy this thing!</li>
            <li> I have a combination and sensitive skin. I had tried many facial cleanser include the top of the line name brand but no succee. However, My husband said that my skin has a tremendous improvement after only 4 days of using this facial cleanser. Definitely will continue buying this going forward.</li>
            <li> Cleans every bit of makeup off without using anything else. Leaves skin visibly clean.</li>
            <li> This foaming cleanser is amazing. It contains the amazing snail secretion healing properties and left my face clean and bright. It didn&#x27;t cause tightness which is always a problem when buying face washes. Definitely would recommend as a gentle cleanser for anyone.</li>
            <li> Great product! I love the way my skin feels after washing my face with this, I will definitely repurchase again!</li>
            <li> I think this was free because I didn&#x27;t purchase it. I did get the all in one snail repair cream, so maybe they threw this in. It came completely out of the blue way after the cream so I&#x27;m a bit stumped.</li>
