            <li>and it feels good and cleans well.</li>
            <li>I loved them , they work  just like the Oral B .</li>
            <li>And they fit my Oral B perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Feel as good as branded oral b replacements</li>

            <li>I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>These are great and I love the price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t buy things because they are cheap, I buy things because they have good to great reviews.</li>
            <li>Love them!  </li>
            <li>Take it from me, don&#x27;t be impressed by the large number.</li>
            <li>These replacement heads fit and work great on my Oral B toothbrush.</li>
            <li>what you pay for&amp;#34; kind of experience for me.</li>
            <li>I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>if I didn&#x27;t liked them)  </li>
            <li>Great price they r just like the original heads.</li>
            <li>I just bought it like two weeks ago and it still works perfectly,  ( still looks and feels like new)  </li>
            <li>Excellent brush heads so far!  </li>
            <li>These fit just as good.</li>
            <li>Fits our Oral B Triumph Professional Care toothbrush perfectly.</li>
            <li>But they dont feel as nice as the original OralB heads, or even as nice as the replacements Target makes.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with the toothbrush replacement heads,  they fit my toothbrush perfecly.  </li>
            <li>The Generic Oral B Compatible brush is a perfect fit for the electric brushes we sent to our grandchildren...and a good value for our budget.</li>
            <li>I will surely buy it again.</li>
            <li>I am embarrassed to say, but I have gotten many months of use out of each name brand head -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used one brush for almost 3 months and am happy to report that I&#x27;ve experienced no real issues using this with my Oral B.  </li>
            <li>Have been using about one week and am completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>These toothbrush heads may be better than the ones you&#x27;d buy in a store.</li>
            <li>Bristles seem ok.</li>
            <li>and you will still get a better reliable service.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off spending more and buying the better Brush heads.</li>
            <li>Outstanding.</li>
            <li>more are on their way.</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for.</li>
            <li>I will buy them again :)  </li>
            <li>Was super surprised and happy when I received a package with 20 brush heads!  </li>
            <li>These seem to be a suitable replacement for the original Oral-B brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Work</li>
            <li>And they fit okay.  </li>
            <li>, I bought 20 for $10.99 and free chipping , it doesn&#x27;t get better than that.</li>
            <li>But, I suspect all will be fine</li>
            <li>fine for me.</li>
            <li>I bought official oral b replacements after and they worked fine.</li>
            <li>and it seems as good as the high priced original ones</li>
            <li>The attachement fit fine.</li>
            <li>They do work despite the incorrect fit, however they break (stop rotating) between 3 days to 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I cannot tell the difference between the generic version and the Oral B version and feel like this was a great value.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cheap and you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>They look, feel and sound like the Oral B Braun brushes.</li>
            <li>thank you for making such a great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really a big deal to me, so I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Great alternative to original and store generic brands.</li>
            <li>At this pace 3 Oral B original heads will outlast the 20 cheap copies.</li>
            <li>Many of them broke during the first use.</li>
            <li>Original Oral B replacements never break.  </li>
            <li>This is what being blonde gets you - pleasant surprises.</li>
            <li>These are great, they are a bit stiff yet for the price I can change them more often,</li>
            <li>The only reason I give it a 2 star is because of the good price.</li>
            <li>They last about 6 weeks but for the price that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>The generics are equal to the overpriced brand name and the price is almost too good to be true.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fit right on my Triumph 9000.</li>
            <li>I have not tested each of the 20 toothbrush heads yet, but the first head worked fine for about a week (of 2x a day use).  </li>
            <li>These are much stiffer than the genuine oral B brand</li>
            <li>So far, 2 out of 4 toothbrushes have lasted more than one month.</li>
            <li>The circular colorful piece is already on these replacements.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll come right back to this seller for more.</li>
            <li>The Floss Action replacement works fine.</li>
            <li>however the first head I put on stopped spinning after two weeks.  </li>
            <li>and I will be ordering more of these in the future.</li>
            <li>Will most definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>The first one just stopped spinning after a week of use.</li>
            <li>I broke 3 within the first week.</li>
            <li>The first two I used broke after a couple days ... wouldn&#x27;t rotate at all, just buzzed.</li>
            <li>I believe it is pretty comparable to the propriety version.</li>
            <li>These are definitely good brushes, no fit issues, no abnormal wear issues, no damaging my oral b 1000, no rotation issues.</li>
            <li>The price right, considering how much you pay in the store for these replacements.</li>
            <li>the Braun ones are superior in my opinion, and don&#x27;t make your gums sore ... too much hassle to return the un-used Maxgate pieces, so will just bite the bullet on the wasted expense.</li>
            <li>So even though the price is much lower you go through them very fast.  </li>
            <li>I bought this based on the positive reviews and boy</li>
            <li>The first head stoped working after 2 days, the second brush is working fine.</li>
            <li>Was a bit concerned due to the negative reviews, but these are amazing, just as good as the name brand.</li>
            <li>After having bought the genuine heads for years now, I honestly can&#x27;t tell the difference between these generic heads and the originals, so if your on the fence about buying these based on quality concerns I would say go for it, there&#x27;s not much to lose at this price point!</li>
            <li>Place me in the group of those who have experienced a high failure rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Start out great, but every one breaks/stops working when bristles are only half done.</li>
            <li>Package arrived with no damage (very well packaged).</li>
            <li>Amazingly fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>and I will let you know how much it lasted.</li>
            <li>Absolutely compatible,works as the real thing.</li>
            <li>But when used, the bristles dont move as much when brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>but they really don&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li>This is really cheap stuff made in some 3rd world.</li>
            <li>but it seems to not spin as fast.</li>
            <li>They feel nice and not cheap made.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know how they last like the original ones.</li>
            <li>Finally started using these newly purchased toothbrush heads:  the first one broke during its first use on 1-17-15!  </li>
            <li>These brushes seem to be of high quality and well made.</li>
            <li>I knew that some people had a lot of brush heads that &amp;#34;failed&amp;#34; early, while other people were quite satisfied.</li>
            <li>They look and work exactly the same as original manufacturer product (but at a very low cost).</li>
            <li>But after using them for a couple of months, it has become clear that they are sadly very inferior to the brand name brush heads.</li>
            <li>One of the little yellow rubber bristles did fall off within the first few times of using, but I&#x27;ve also experienced that with the Oral.</li>
            <li>First replacement head only lasted a couple of weeks and the head stripped out.&lt;br /&gt;Had to install a new one.</li>
            <li>With this generic product, it happened with each of the first four brush heads we used.  </li>
            <li>I received the item on April 25 and 5 days later the first brush broke.</li>
            <li>The Oral B heads I have used previously NEVER failed prior to the brush itself wearing out.</li>
            <li>Although the product information and description clearly mentions all the Oral B brush series it fits, I still had my doubts.</li>
            <li>When the product arrived, I was surprised by the packaging.</li>
            <li>Today, I went to Costco and bought the real deal (and threw out the rest of the crappy generic heads).  </li>
            <li>Based on experience so far, I would not recommend buying this product.    </li>
            <li>The brush has worn at about the same pace as the Oral B brushes and has performed very closely to them.  </li>
            <li>May fit a little looser than the name brand but does not cause a problem and as far as I can tell works the same as the name brand.</li>
            <li>The second one worked fine for a couple days, before the same abrupt end of head vibration.  </li>
            <li>Only used one so far</li>
            <li>Practically got these the net day and wow</li>
            <li>Second one has lasted through four 2-minute brushings so far.</li>
            <li>Bristles are not soft, tight fit on my oral b vitality brush, and internal gears are way noisier than the name brand.</li>
            <li>Given the positive reviews, it seems to work for some people - and given that the seller honors the money back guarantee, there&#x27;s not much to lose.</li>
            <li>It is hard to distinguish it from the original brush head.</li>
            <li>These toothbrush heads are very close to the quality of the genuine Oral B heads and cost so much less its a hard deal to pass up.</li>
            <li>It is now one month after the original review was written and two additional brush heads have failed in the same way as the first one.  </li>
            <li>My only issue with the generic version is that it tends to stop short of connecting completely sometimes and has to be re-seated prior to use.  </li>
            <li>Nearly every one of these generic head has stopped rotating long before the brush has worn</li>

            <li> The generics are equal to the overpriced brand name and the price is almost too good to be true.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fit right on my Triumph 9000.</li>
            <li> I have not tested each of the 20 toothbrush heads yet, but the first head worked fine for about a week (of 2x a day use).  </li>
            <li> These are much stiffer than the genuine oral B brand</li>
            <li> So far, 2 out of 4 toothbrushes have lasted more than one month.</li>
            <li> The circular colorful piece is already on these replacements.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll come right back to this seller for more.</li>
            <li> The Floss Action replacement works fine.</li>
            <li> however the first head I put on stopped spinning after two weeks.  </li>
            <li> and I will be ordering more of these in the future.</li>
            <li> Will most definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> The first one just stopped spinning after a week of use.</li>
            <li> I broke 3 within the first week.</li>
            <li> The first two I used broke after a couple days ... wouldn&#x27;t rotate at all, just buzzed.</li>
            <li> I believe it is pretty comparable to the propriety version.</li>
            <li> These are definitely good brushes, no fit issues, no abnormal wear issues, no damaging my oral b 1000, no rotation issues.</li>
            <li> The price right, considering how much you pay in the store for these replacements.</li>
            <li> the Braun ones are superior in my opinion, and don&#x27;t make your gums sore ... too much hassle to return the un-used Maxgate pieces, so will just bite the bullet on the wasted expense.</li>
            <li> So even though the price is much lower you go through them very fast.  </li>
            <li> I bought this based on the positive reviews and boy</li>
            <li> The first head stoped working after 2 days, the second brush is working fine.</li>
            <li> Was a bit concerned due to the negative reviews, but these are amazing, just as good as the name brand.</li>
            <li> After having bought the genuine heads for years now, I honestly can&#x27;t tell the difference between these generic heads and the originals, so if your on the fence about buying these based on quality concerns I would say go for it, there&#x27;s not much to lose at this price point!</li>
            <li> Place me in the group of those who have experienced a high failure rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Start out great, but every one breaks/stops working when bristles are only half done.</li>
            <li> Package arrived with no damage (very well packaged).</li>
            <li> Amazingly fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> and I will let you know how much it lasted.</li>
            <li> Absolutely compatible,works as the real thing.</li>
            <li> But when used, the bristles dont move as much when brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> but they really don&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> This is really cheap stuff made in some 3rd world.</li>
            <li> but it seems to not spin as fast.</li>
            <li> They feel nice and not cheap made.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how they last like the original ones.</li>
            <li> Finally started using these newly purchased toothbrush heads:  the first one broke during its first use on 1-17-15!  </li>
            <li> These brushes seem to be of high quality and well made.</li>
            <li> I knew that some people had a lot of brush heads that &amp;#34;failed&amp;#34; early, while other people were quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> They look and work exactly the same as original manufacturer product (but at a very low cost).</li>
            <li> But after using them for a couple of months, it has become clear that they are sadly very inferior to the brand name brush heads.</li>
            <li> One of the little yellow rubber bristles did fall off within the first few times of using, but I&#x27;ve also experienced that with the Oral.</li>
            <li> First replacement head only lasted a couple of weeks and the head stripped out.&lt;br /&gt;Had to install a new one.</li>
            <li> With this generic product, it happened with each of the first four brush heads we used.  </li>
            <li> I received the item on April 25 and 5 days later the first brush broke.</li>
            <li> The Oral B heads I have used previously NEVER failed prior to the brush itself wearing out.</li>
            <li> Although the product information and description clearly mentions all the Oral B brush series it fits, I still had my doubts.</li>
            <li> When the product arrived, I was surprised by the packaging.</li>
            <li> Today, I went to Costco and bought the real deal (and threw out the rest of the crappy generic heads).  </li>
            <li> Based on experience so far, I would not recommend buying this product.    </li>
            <li> The brush has worn at about the same pace as the Oral B brushes and has performed very closely to them.  </li>
            <li> May fit a little looser than the name brand but does not cause a problem and as far as I can tell works the same as the name brand.</li>
            <li> The second one worked fine for a couple days, before the same abrupt end of head vibration.  </li>
            <li> Only used one so far</li>
            <li> Practically got these the net day and wow</li>
            <li> Second one has lasted through four 2-minute brushings so far.</li>
            <li> Bristles are not soft, tight fit on my oral b vitality brush, and internal gears are way noisier than the name brand.</li>
            <li> Given the positive reviews, it seems to work for some people - and given that the seller honors the money back guarantee, there&#x27;s not much to lose.</li>
            <li> It is hard to distinguish it from the original brush head.</li>
            <li> These toothbrush heads are very close to the quality of the genuine Oral B heads and cost so much less its a hard deal to pass up.</li>
            <li> It is now one month after the original review was written and two additional brush heads have failed in the same way as the first one.  </li>
            <li> My only issue with the generic version is that it tends to stop short of connecting completely sometimes and has to be re-seated prior to use.  </li>
            <li> Nearly every one of these generic head has stopped rotating long before the brush has worn</li>
            <li> At this point it is too soon to know how long the brush will last compared to the much more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> On average, each brush head has lasted about 2 weeks, and I am careful to apply gentle pressure.</li>
            <li> It was confusing at first</li>
            <li> Thanks for providing a quality product for an unbelievable price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long they last yet, but seem to hold up.</li>
            <li> Not a major concern-</li>
            <li> So, while I still believe the product (as I received it) was a waste of money, the seller clearly is trying to improve the product and it honors its \\&quot;100% Satisfaction</li>
            <li> They are harder on your gums that the actual Braun ones, which I ordered also, just to compare ...</li>
            <li> Is not soft but harder than the regular one.</li>
            <li> We have thrown away at least ten of them so far.</li>
            <li> The only problem being it might be a while before I reorder it (20 pcs &#x3D; 2 month average for one head &#x3D;</li>
            <li> On the Oral B replacement heads, they are loose.</li>
            <li> Not sure if twenty if them will last as long as a $22 pack of three.</li>
            <li> Had to leave the review because of how surprised I was by all the negative feedback.</li>
            <li> This product was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of paying so much for heads brush,  </li>
            <li> The name brand brush heads are way more expensive (way too expensive in my mind), but these generic brush heads are NOT a viable substitute.    </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The other brush is still working after two weeks.  </li>
            <li> Can not tell the difference from Brand name product, other than the name not being one the item.  </li>
            <li> The color bands arent as pronounced as the originals or the other replacements.  </li>
            <li> Found other type in package.</li>
            <li> First brush I tried failed within one minute.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t know what to expect since I bought some other one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a few months now and see absolutely no difference other than the price and quantity from the name brand.</li>
            <li> My only beef is that they are a bit hard - I would prefer a softer bristle</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very non-complex brushes with nothing really to go wrong.</li>
            <li> use the Oral B for my son with Down syndrome.</li>
            <li> not sure it has saved me any money in the long run!</li>
            <li> I have a year and a half supply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like when pressure is applied to the teeth, the bristles just vibrate slightly.</li>
            <li> so I will give it a month or a month an half</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re too tight and won&#x27;t go all the way down.</li>
            <li> Just started using one a few days ago</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with this and jut buy the legit 3 pack from oral b.</li>
            <li> There is a spring inside the head of the brushes that breaks after a few weeks of use that stops the bristles from moving.</li>
            <li> I received it about a week and a half ago, and my wife and I have already gone through four brush heads!  </li>
            <li> These work with the base, but are pretty snug so i can&#x27;t pull all the way down.</li>
            <li> I have been unable to find the Braun Vitality brush replacements locally</li>
            <li> I usually buy minimum 4/5 stars.</li>
            <li> When the metallic-looking piece drops down from its usual &#x27;raised&#x27; position, there is no more rapid vibration of the bristles, and the head becomes useless.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are medium to hard, which the brand names don&#x27;t carry.</li>
            <li> It is so hard on your gums you will have pain all day.</li>
            <li> (Immediately) After I posted this review, the seller reached out to me to ask questions about the product failure (and asked me to take pictures, etc.</li>
            <li> These are virtually identical to the brand name version and so so so much less expensive.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re much, much less expensive.</li>
            <li> I bought these after sick of paying big money for the Braun brand.</li>
            <li> When they said vaguely that this was a &amp;#34;20 piece&amp;#34; package, I thought they were including the little tiny colored rings that you find at the base of the stem.  </li>
            <li> With that being said they still &#x27;vibrate&#x27; correctly with the base, but are a little tough to get on and off.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I ordered these.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Once the package is opened we are unable to resell them&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> These are almost identical to the expensive, name brand brush heads.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical but decided to try it out because of the cost and &amp;#34;acceptable&amp;#34; reviews.</li>
            <li> This causes me to believe that a lot of the reviews I&#x27;ve seen are fake and placed by competitors or even Oral B to encourage purchasing the OEM.</li>
            <li> Works just like the expensive Oral B  at the store.  </li>
            <li> Buy knowing you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have Oral B Triumph series. I ordered these for the replaceable brush heads. I was skeptical when I ordered these. Although the product information and description clearly mentions all the Oral B brush series it fits, I still had my doubts. When the product arrived, I was surprised by the packaging. Package arrived with no damage (very well packaged). The brush heads fit perfectly on my Triumph series. They look and work exactly the same as original manufacturer product (but at a very low cost). each brush head has a color band to distinguish brush heads if there are multiple users. I will surely buy it again. The only problem being it might be a while before I reorder it (20 pcs &#x3D; 2 month average for one head &#x3D; 40 months &#x3D; 3 years).&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product if you have Oral B Triumph series.</li>
            <li> Great product; great price; great looking teeth!</li>
            <li> This product was a total waste of money. I received it about a week and a half ago, and my wife and I have already gone through four brush heads!  For some reason, after about 4 or 5 days of use, something in the brush \\&quot;snaps\\&quot; and it no longer rotates when the toothbrush vibrates.  The name brand Oral-B brush heads never have this problem.  I am embarrassed to say, but I have gotten many months of use out of each name brand head - I have never had an issue with them breaking.  With this generic product, it happened with each of the first four brush heads we used.  Today, I went to Costco and bought the real deal (and threw out the rest of the crappy generic heads).  The name brand brush heads are way more expensive (way too expensive in my mind), but these generic brush heads are NOT a viable substitute.    UPDATE 1/26/2015-     (Immediately) After I posted this review, the seller reached out to me to ask questions about the product failure (and asked me to take pictures, etc. to send to its development team).  The seller also promised to refund my money (which I assume they will do - I will edit this review if the money doesn&#x27;t show up in my account).  So, while I still believe the product (as I received it) was a waste of money, the seller clearly is trying to improve the product and it honors its \\&quot;100% Satisfaction Guarantee\\&quot; (which is in the title of the product).  I still rate the product as one star (it didn&#x27;t work), but I suppose some people might still try ordering it and seeing if they break.  Given the positive reviews, it seems to work for some people - and given that the seller honors the money back guarantee, there&#x27;s not much to lose.</li>
            <li> Finally started using these newly purchased toothbrush heads:  the first one broke during its first use on 1-17-15!  When the metallic-looking piece drops down from its usual &#x27;raised&#x27; position, there is no more rapid vibration of the bristles, and the head becomes useless.  The second one worked fine for a couple days, before the same abrupt end of head vibration.  The third one worked for 12 days.  Now I have recently started with the fourth one.  Is there any way the metallic-looking shaft can be reworked to attach it back to the brush head?  There is a 100% satisfaction guarantee on this product with an expectation of the heads working for 3 months!  I will be asking for my money back unless the performance picks up dramatically as I work my way through the remaining four 4-packs of brush heads.  How does one make a claim for a refund?</li>
            <li> Love them!  Feel just like the oral b heads however the first head I put on stopped spinning after two weeks.  Other than that,  they&#x27;re great Toothbrush heads!!</li>
            <li> They look just like the brand name brushes, but...  They don&#x27;t fit right on my Triumph 9000. They&#x27;re too tight and won&#x27;t go all the way down. They do work despite the incorrect fit, however they break (stop rotating) between 3 days to 2 weeks.  The only reason I give it a 2 star is because of the good price.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase!  I have been unable to find the Braun Vitality brush replacements locally so I decided to look on Amazon.  I cannot tell the difference between the generic version and the Oral B version and feel like this was a great value.</li>
            <li> Amazingly fast shipping.  I have placed one of the brush heads on my unit and it fit perfectly.  I used it and it felt the same as the brand name product.  The price was excellent.</li>
            <li> So far, 2 out of 4 toothbrushes have lasted more than one month.</li>
            <li> This is s***. Keeps breaking after 3 days and won&#x27;t rotate.</li>
            <li> Delivery occurred in timely manner two weeks ago.  Brushes were installed on two Oral B Vitality toothbrushes at that time.  After one week, the drive mechanism in one of the brushes broke and the head didn&#x27;t rotate even though the motor was running.  The other brush is still working after two weeks.  Based on experience so far, I would not recommend buying this product.    It is now one month after the original review was written and two additional brush heads have failed in the same way as the first one.  Definitely do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use one of these generic brushes for an extended period before reviewing.  I&#x27;ve used one brush for almost 3 months and am happy to report that I&#x27;ve experienced no real issues using this with my Oral B.  The brush has worn at about the same pace as the Oral B brushes and has performed very closely to them.  My only issue with the generic version is that it tends to stop short of connecting completely sometimes and has to be re-seated prior to use.  Not a major concern-especially given the difference in cost between the generic version and the originals.  I plan to continue buying and using these.</li>
            <li> I have had this product a week.  I have not tested each of the 20 toothbrush heads yet, but the first head worked fine for about a week (of 2x a day use).  Then it stopping moving.  We are currently on toothbrush #2.  Hopefully it will last longer than a week.</li>
            <li> These are virtually identical to the brand name version and so so so much less expensive. I don&#x27;t buy things because they are cheap, I buy things because they have good to great reviews. I&#x27;ve been using these for a few months now and see absolutely no difference other than the price and quantity from the name brand. For the price of three name brand brush heads I have a year and a half supply. Will definitely buy these again.</li>
            <li> These were just as good as the name brand one and way cheaper.  I will definitely buy they again.  I bought some for myself and for my kids and am happy with them.  Great deal and great product.</li>
            <li> We were sent several defective packages of these brush heads. As soon as you begin to brush your teeth, the heads break. We have thrown away at least ten of them so far.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected.  May fit a little looser than the name brand but does not cause a problem and as far as I can tell works the same as the name brand. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I Like Them!  Just started using one a few days ago and it feels good and cleans well. At this point it is too soon to know how long the brush will last compared to the much more expensive ones. But, I suspect all will be fine and I will be ordering more of these in the future.</li>
            <li> Can not tell the difference from Brand name product, other than the name not being one the item.  Have been using about one week and am completely satisfied.  Great savings in price.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. I received the item on April 25 and 5 days later the first brush broke. I guess you get what you paid for. I just put on the second brush and I will let you know how much it lasted. To be continued........</li>
            <li> I loved them , they work  just like the Oral B .</li>
            <li> These seem to be a suitable replacement for the original Oral-B brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Work fine for me.</li>
            <li> These toothbrush heads may be better than the ones you&#x27;d buy in a store. They&#x27;re much, much less expensive. Will most definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Only used one so far and it seems as good as the high priced original ones</li>
            <li> Absolutely compatible,works as the real thing. Is not soft but harder than the regular one.</li>
            <li> I have an Oral B 5000 series. These work with the base, but are pretty snug so i can&#x27;t pull all the way down. With that being said they still &#x27;vibrate&#x27; correctly with the base, but are a little tough to get on and off.</li>
            <li> These are great, they are a bit stiff yet for the price I can change them more often,</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cheap and you get what you pay for.  Yeah, they do the job.  But they dont feel as nice as the original OralB heads, or even as nice as the replacements Target makes.  They work though.  And they fit okay.  Not perfectly, just okay.  There is a tiny gap between the head and the handle, but its not a deal-breaker.  The color bands arent as pronounced as the originals or the other replacements.  My wife sometimes almost ends up using mine.  I got about a year supply and I will definitely use them up.  I just have to get used to the initial stiffness.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews. I knew that some people had a lot of brush heads that &amp;#34;failed&amp;#34; early, while other people were quite satisfied. Place me in the group of those who have experienced a high failure rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Oral B for my son with Down syndrome. The Oral B heads I have used previously NEVER failed prior to the brush itself wearing out. Nearly every one of these generic head has stopped rotating long before the brush has worn out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... it&#x27;s a great price for 20 of them, but not sure it has saved me any money in the long run! I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great price, and they work great.</li>
            <li> Did not receive these heads. Found other type in package.</li>
            <li> Have had these brushes for about a month. Already four have bit the dust. Not sure if twenty if them will last as long as a $22 pack of three. Buy knowing you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great value for the price.</li>
            <li> GREAT BRUSH.WILL ORDER AGAIN FROM SELLER.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what I was thinking.  When they said vaguely that this was a &amp;#34;20 piece&amp;#34; package, I thought they were including the little tiny colored rings that you find at the base of the stem.  Was super surprised and happy when I received a package with 20 brush heads!  What a deal for $20 bucks!  And they fit my Oral B perfectly.  This is what being blonde gets you - pleasant surprises.</li>
            <li> The attachement fit fine. Bristles seem ok. But when used, the bristles dont move as much when brushing my teeth. It&#x27;s like when pressure is applied to the teeth, the bristles just vibrate slightly. I bought official oral b replacements after and they worked fine. It was confusing at first but they really don&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. The bristles are medium to hard, which the brand names don&#x27;t carry. Will be reordering.</li>
            <li> Feel as good as branded oral b replacements</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the positive reviews and boy do I regret it.This is a tale of you &amp;#34;Get what you pay for&amp;#34; kind of experience for me. Take it from me, don&#x27;t be impressed by the large number. I bought this about 2 months ago and I am on my 3rd one. The first one just stopped spinning after a week of use. I contacted the company and they asked for pictures. I sent them a picture and a video and never heard from them again. The return window lapse and so I guess one a week will last me 20 weeks. The second one stops spinning once it touches my teeth. I lighen my hand and spend twice the time to brush my teeth. Trust me, just buy the regular one and use it for 6 months even and you will still get a better reliable service.Definitely not recommending the product. Definitely not recommending the Seller.</li>
            <li> All I can say is, it is not Oral B. it just suffices.</li>
            <li> I bought these after sick of paying big money for the Braun brand. These fit just as good. They last about 6 weeks but for the price that&#x27;s good. I will be resupply with these from now on.</li>
            <li> These are much stiffer than the genuine oral B brand but they work.</li>
            <li> The first head stoped working after 2 days, the second brush is working fine.I contacted the company and there suggestion was that it may be the toothbrush that is not working. &amp;#34;Once the package is opened we are unable to resell them&amp;#34;. I bought it because they claim 100% satisfaction guaranteed.</li>
            <li> I received this product in exchange for an honest review. These replacement heads fit and work great on my Oral B toothbrush. I notice one difference. The circular colorful piece is already on these replacements. On the Oral B replacement heads, they are loose. These brush my teeth the same way and they do the job. I don&#x27;t know how long they last yet, but seem to hold up. The price right, considering how much you pay in the store for these replacements. They also work on my kids toothbrushes, which are another variety of Oral B toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Sure they do a good job before they break!! I went through all 20 in 4 months. The longest one lasted was about 2 weeks. Many of them broke during the first use. These brush heads basically suck! You&#x27;re better off spending more and buying the better Brush heads.</li>
            <li> Outstanding. Fits our Oral B Triumph Professional Care toothbrush perfectly.</li>
            <li> Practically got these the net day and wow - really a good deal.  Brushes are great!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Just as good as store generics at a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t lose. They look, feel and sound like the Oral B Braun brushes. I am very satisfied. One of the little yellow rubber bristles did fall off within the first few times of using, but I&#x27;ve also experienced that with the Oral.B brand as well.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush heads so far!  Awesome price and fits great.  Hope more are on their way.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly in my electric toothbrush.  I am a happy camper.</li>
            <li> First replacement head only lasted a couple of weeks and the head stripped out.&lt;br /&gt;Had to install a new one. Good thing its a pack of 20. Hopefully it won&#x27;t happen again.</li>
            <li> The Floss Action replacement works fine. I received it one week ago and have not had any problems.  It is hard to distinguish it from the original brush head.</li>
            <li> Was a bit concerned due to the negative reviews, but these are amazing, just as good as the name brand.</li>
            <li> This is really cheap stuff made in some 3rd world. It is so hard on your gums you will have pain all day. I broke 3 within the first week. The internal gears will just crumble inside. Don&#x27;t waste your time with this and jut buy the legit 3 pack from oral b.</li>
            <li> they only last about 2 weeks per brush</li>
            <li> These are almost identical to the expensive, name brand brush heads.  My only beef is that they are a bit hard - I would prefer a softer bristle but oh well - these were a great deal!</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly and saved me $$$. What more can you ask for.</li>
            <li> The first two I used broke after a couple days ... wouldn&#x27;t rotate at all, just buzzed. They are harder on your gums that the actual Braun ones, which I ordered also, just to compare ... the Braun ones are superior in my opinion, and don&#x27;t make your gums sore ... too much hassle to return the un-used Maxgate pieces, so will just bite the bullet on the wasted expense.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend. Start out great, but every one breaks/stops working when bristles are only half done. I can&#x27;t find &amp;#34;Maxgate&amp;#34; online to request a replacement with their &amp;#34;100% satisfaction guarantee&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the toothbrush replacement heads,  they fit my toothbrush perfecly.  I would definitely recommend them to all my family and friends.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but decided to try it out because of the cost and &amp;#34;acceptable&amp;#34; reviews. I usually buy minimum 4/5 stars. These are definitely good brushes, no fit issues, no abnormal wear issues, no damaging my oral b 1000, no rotation issues. This causes me to believe that a lot of the reviews I&#x27;ve seen are fake and placed by competitors or even Oral B to encourage purchasing the OEM. These are great and I love the price. Had to leave the review because of how surprised I was by all the negative feedback. They&#x27;re very non-complex brushes with nothing really to go wrong. Will definitely buy again. Just wish I could buy a smaller pack than 20.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: These brushes look and feel identical to the name brand. But after using them for a couple of months, it has become clear that they are sadly very inferior to the brand name brush heads. On average, each brush head has lasted about 2 weeks, and I am careful to apply gentle pressure. I will be going back the Oral B brush heads.</li>
            <li> Works just like the expensive Oral B  at the store.  Will continue to use generic!</li>
            <li> Great price. Compares to The name brand.</li>
            <li> Bristles are not soft, tight fit on my oral b vitality brush, and internal gears are way noisier than the name brand.</li>
            <li> First brush I tried failed within one minute.  Second one has lasted through four 2-minute brushings so far.</li>
            <li> They fit perfect on my Oral B electric toothbrush. They feel nice and not cheap made. I just been using them for about 2 weeks so don&#x27;t know how they last like the original ones.</li>
            <li> These brushes seem to be of high quality and well made. I have been using one for the last three months and endures well. I believe it is pretty comparable to the propriety version.</li>
            <li> Works as well as name brand. I can afford to change these heads once a month now. Definite lifetime buyer.</li>
            <li> The Generic Oral B Compatible brush is a perfect fit for the electric brushes we sent to our grandchildren...and a good value for our budget.</li>
            <li> I bought this from another website,  but I like to read the reviews before I buy something,  so I will leave this one for people like me.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know what to expect since I bought some other one and I wasn&#x27;t to Happy with those, so  I decided to give this one a try, ( since the price was very good,  I won&#x27;t  mind if I didn&#x27;t liked them)  they are just like the OralB  one,  no difference to me at all,  I just bought it like two weeks ago and it still works perfectly,  ( still looks and feels like new)  so I will give it a month or a month an half , I bought 20 for $10.99 and free chipping , it doesn&#x27;t get better than that. I was tired of paying so much for heads brush,  now I found the perfect ones at a great price.  I will buy them again :)  thank you for making such a great product.</li>
            <li> works well saved money</li>
            <li> These are a great deal! They seem to work almost the same as the brand name but it seems to not spin as fast. It&#x27;s not really a big deal to me, so I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Great alternative to original and store generic brands.</li>
            <li> The generics are equal to the overpriced brand name and the price is almost too good to be true. Thanks for providing a quality product for an unbelievable price.</li>
            <li> excellent product, great price</li>
            <li> This item deserves &#x27;best seller&#x27; as it&#x27;s an extraordinary buy...great value ...works just laws well as the brand name for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> These toothbrush heads are very close to the quality of the genuine Oral B heads and cost so much less its a hard deal to pass up. After having bought the genuine heads for years now, I honestly can&#x27;t tell the difference between these generic heads and the originals, so if your on the fence about buying these based on quality concerns I would say go for it, there&#x27;s not much to lose at this price point! Next time I need toothbrush heads I&#x27;ll come right back to this seller for more.</li>
            <li> Great price they r just like the original heads.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.  There is a spring inside the head of the brushes that breaks after a few weeks of use that stops the bristles from moving. Original Oral B replacements never break.  So even though the price is much lower you go through them very fast.  At this pace 3 Oral B original heads will outlast the 20 cheap copies.</li>
