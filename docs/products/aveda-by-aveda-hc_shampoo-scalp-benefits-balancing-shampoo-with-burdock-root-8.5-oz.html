            <li>And the BEST hair spray ever!! :</li>
            <li>Great Product!</li>
            <li>smells great!</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t the greatest, but with what it does with my hair</li>
            <li>Wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Helps with dandruff smells great</li>
            <li>this shampoo is great</li>
            <li>It is truly amazing!</li>
            <li>I love Aveda products and am very happy with this shampoo and the conditioner.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great for dry,flaky scalp and is very healthy to use.</li>
            <li>If your hair itches easily this is the best shampoo!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had good luck with AVEDA so decided to try this shampoo.</li>
            <li>the \\&quot;blue\\&quot; shampo is cheaper and more effective!</li>
            <li>First, it smells great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more pleasant to use than the T-gel.</li>
            <li>My husband &amp; I had been using another \\&quot;scalp care\\&quot; shampoo, but since it didn&#x27;t seem to be as effective anymore we decided to switch to something else temporarily.</li>
            <li>Done my internet research, based on reviews here and elsewhere was confident this shampoo would be effective for itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li>get better results rinsing with a mixture if apple cider vinegar and warm water (1:3).  </li>
            <li>this shampoo isn&#x27;t cheap!</li>
            <li>On top of this, we still had itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>I love the earthy, spa-like smell.</li>
            <li>I love the smell by the way.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m sure I have build up.</li>
            <li>But even better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would love to hear reader&#x27;s feedback.</li>
            <li>good one and useful</li>
            <li>This is my favorite shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Many Aveda products have both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>More importantly, it helps!</li>
            <li>She feels more confident as well.</li>
            <li>It is so natural and smells great.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend using the conditioner as well to get the best results (and take away some of the peppery smell!).</li>
            <li>Within 2 days, HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>That is huge.</li>
            <li>Being a Curly Girl, I&#x27;ve been free of sulfates and silicones for 5 years.  </li>
            <li>Great product for multiple hair types -</li>
            <li>recently tried Yes To Carrots scalp relief shampoo and conditioner, which worked amazingly well!</li>
            <li>It did, however, leave my hair squeaky clean and the scent leaves an earthy/herbaceous smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It didn&#x27;t seem to be very concentrated, either, and I found I had to use more than what I would expect for Aveda.  </li>
            <li>Super drying / frying.</li>
            <li>Is actually a nice shampoo, left hair feeling good, but actually feel like it worsened my scalp condition.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery makes easy shopping.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to achieve this effect without using any harsh chemicals on my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it just takes some time before it goes away completely.</li>
            <li>It also smells nice and is a good overall shampoo and comparable for my hair to other quality shampoos.</li>
            <li>I first came across this product when I went to a salon that only uses Aveda products, so I already knew that I liked it.</li>
            <li>daughter has straight hair and has developed very fine flakes in parts of her scalp.  </li>
            <li>Even their \\&quot;Curly\\&quot; products are full of sulfates and silicones which is very drying:(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have mild scalp psoriasis and have pretty much tried everything under the sun when it comes to shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I just finished my first bottle of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Since starting the bottle my skin feels a lot better and there is no flaking.</li>
            <li>It does not have any harsh chemicals and is good for cleaning your hair and maintaining scalp and hair health.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t use shampoo, but when my poo-less regimen leaves my scalp itchy and I need to do a re-boot, this is a good product.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This shampoo didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li>I cant really complain.</li>
            <li>No scalp flakes, my scalp and hair really does like this product.</li>
            <li>It also really helps the ph...</li>
            <li>Our whole family uses this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Aside from the normal hair loss</li>
            <li>They are probably right, but I haven&#x27;t used only the shampoo.</li>
            <li>Got a new bottle of Scalp Benefits today.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m typically a product user: root lift (I like Pantene for fine hair, even though mine is course).</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair soft and shines!</li>
            <li>I only gave 4 stars because the smell, while not horrible in my opinion, is slightly herby smelling and it does take quite a bit to to wash all of my hair which is a pain when you have a lot of it and</li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived early and in the condition described</li>
            <li>Apple Cider vinegar is a natural anti-bacterial and anti-fungal.</li>
            <li>After my package arrived, I used it just one time, and the itching is completely gone.</li>
            <li>Though I would note that it doesn&#x27;t do much as far as body goes.</li>
            <li>Hair is soft and literally squeaky after!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>Now that my scalp is back to normal</li>
            <li>I MUST warn you, though, that this shampoo smells of *freshly ground black pepper.</li>
            <li>3 days, barely a flake.</li>
            <li>More dryness to my poor scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Finally back to my Aveda.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve pretty much been stuck with using T Gel, which I wanted to get away from due to the smell and harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>And no harsh ingredients to dry out your hair.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have a dry itchy scalp, and my hairdresser says it&#x27;s not due to dandruff</li>
            <li> Seriously I think all shampoos work better with a little water added.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had an itchy, oily scalp; however, other brands such as Head and Shoulders and Garnier anti-dandruff shampoos always made my fine, oily hair feel dry and dull.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair really dry.</li>
            <li> I occasionally have issues with my scalp being very dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> long.</li>
            <li> In one word...\\&quot;YUCK.\\&quot; Apparently, burdock root smells like ground black pepper.</li>
            <li> my scalp became dry, itchy and flakey.</li>
            <li> Spray it on and pat dry with a separate towel so not to transfer bacteria.</li>
            <li> Of course my first thought was to buy some Head and Shoulders from the grocery store and that made it worse.</li>
            <li> This Shampoo balances and heals dry scalp unlike anything I have ever tried!</li>
            <li> At least THAT is pure and not full of nasties.  </li>
            <li> and my husband has dry scalp and oily hair due to wearing hats all the time.  </li>
            <li> rather it&#x27;s due to dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I had to go back to using T Gel after a few days, although I found alternating between this product and T Gel worked ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have started only shampooing my scalp, then letting the soap rinse down into the rest of my hair which helps cut down on the amount I need to use.</li>
            <li> Also, other reviews have stated that the shampoo alone doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This shampoo though it may seem a little bit expensive is well worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll try some of their other hair care lines!</li>
            <li> Cost cut in half...</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s much less itchy and flakey.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a little bit of dandruff still, but my scalp was so itchy and dandruffy to begin with that</li>
            <li> After just a few uses my head stopped itching and the flakes went away.</li>
            <li> have had occasional issues with dandruff over the years, and I bought this when the problem got really bad last summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I finally gave up and went to my usual stylist at an Aveda salon and mentioned my issues, she recommended this shampoo and it was a miracle for my poor scalp!</li>
            <li> Not only does the shampoo smell terrible, but we had to use quite alot to distribute to the entire scalp &amp; we both have short hair.</li>
            <li> What I had not done in the past, was to let the shampoo sit before rinsing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only did it NOT do a thing for my 8yo, but it made my head worse!  </li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this did not do the trick.</li>
            <li> Sorry Amazon, I buy almost everything from you but could not wait for delivery.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this shampoo did not work for me.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the salon no longer carries the Scalp Benefits line, so I bought it here.</li>
            <li> My husband thought I was crazy every time I took something from the pantry up to the bathroom to put in my hair.</li>
            <li> Rinse with cold water.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me since I struggle with terrible scalp issues.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t harm my hair, keeps the nasty pool smell out of my sons hair and keeps my husband from being itchy and gets rid of that \\&quot;hat smell\\&quot;.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> After I had my daughter my scalp freaked out! Aside from the normal hair loss my scalp became dry, itchy and flakey. Of course my first thought was to buy some Head and Shoulders from the grocery store and that made it worse. After trying everything from the grocery isle with the words \\&quot;itchy\\&quot; and \\&quot;flakey\\&quot; on it I started trying home remedies. My husband thought I was crazy every time I took something from the pantry up to the bathroom to put in my hair. I finally gave up and went to my usual stylist at an Aveda salon and mentioned my issues, she recommended this shampoo and it was a miracle for my poor scalp! After just a few uses my head stopped itching and the flakes went away. I only gave 4 stars because the smell, while not horrible in my opinion, is slightly herby smelling and it does take quite a bit to to wash all of my hair which is a pain when you have a lot of it and this shampoo isn&#x27;t cheap! I have started only shampooing my scalp, then letting the soap rinse down into the rest of my hair which helps cut down on the amount I need to use. I also use the Scalp Benefits Balancing Conditioner that I like just the same. Now that my scalp is back to normal I think I&#x27;ll try some of their other hair care lines!</li>
            <li> Helps with dandruff smells great</li>
            <li> My husband &amp; I had been using another \\&quot;scalp care\\&quot; shampoo, but since it didn&#x27;t seem to be as effective anymore we decided to switch to something else temporarily. I&#x27;ve always had good luck with AVEDA so decided to try this shampoo. In one word...\\&quot;YUCK.\\&quot; Apparently, burdock root smells like ground black pepper. Not only does the shampoo smell terrible, but we had to use quite alot to distribute to the entire scalp &amp; we both have short hair. On top of this, we still had itchy scalp. Save your money. BUY SOMETHING ELSE.</li>
            <li> Hi do u sale 33oz. With this product …aveda scalp benefits shampoo ? Also must be can send to Taiwan ! Thanks</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me since I struggle with terrible scalp issues. I&#x27;ve pretty much been stuck with using T Gel, which I wanted to get away from due to the smell and harsh chemicals. Unfortunately, this did not do the trick. I had to go back to using T Gel after a few days, although I found alternating between this product and T Gel worked ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently tried Yes To Carrots scalp relief shampoo and conditioner, which worked amazingly well! If you are stuck with using T Gel and this didn&#x27;t work for you, try Yes to Carrots!</li>
            <li> If your hair itches easily this is the best shampoo! And no harsh ingredients to dry out your hair. Great for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Done my internet research, based on reviews here and elsewhere was confident this shampoo would be effective for itchy scalp.  Did not work.  Is actually a nice shampoo, left hair feeling good, but actually feel like it worsened my scalp condition.  NOTE: bought from AVEDA store, did not purchase conditioner to go along.  So maybe that is why, but if that is the case, AVEDA consultant at the store should have said that you MUST use both to get the desired affect.  So don&#x27;t buy this thinking it will cure Itchy Scalp / Dandruff as it does NOT.....</li>
            <li> I just finished my first bottle of this shampoo. I love the earthy, spa-like smell. It makes me feel like I am taking a shower in the rain forest. I occasionally have issues with my scalp being very dry and flaky. Since starting the bottle my skin feels a lot better and there is no flaking. It&#x27;s nice to be able to achieve this effect without using any harsh chemicals on my hair.</li>
            <li> this shampoo is great I have used it for years and to find this deal was better.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived early and in the condition described</li>
            <li> Last weekend all I had to do was run my hand thru my hair and I scattered flakes everywhere. Itchy and irritated. Did some research: Apple cider vinegar with tea tree oil and water instead of conditioner and back to my Aveda Scalp Benefits. I always dilute my shampoos. That said, cost not so prohibitive. What I had not done in the past, was to let the shampoo sit before rinsing. Makes sense if you want benefit and also want it to get to your scalp. My hair is 1-2&amp;#34; long. I love the smell by the way. Anyway, shampoo, wash you body and THEN rinse. Rinse with cold water. I also have the conditioner but I alternate with the vinegar mixture. Spray it on and pat dry with a separate towel so not to transfer bacteria. Apple Cider vinegar is a natural anti-bacterial and anti-fungal. Within 2 days, HUGE difference. 3 days, barely a flake. Vinegar smell goes away too. My organic vinegar just arrived, but the store brand worked so far.&lt;br /&gt;  Next day: used the compatible conditioner today. I would appreciate any feedback from users... I have short hair so I&#x27;m typically a product user: root lift (I like Pantene for fine hair, even though mine is course). And the BEST hair spray ever!! : Tigi Work It.  So I&#x27;m sure I have build up. Tried using those build up remover shampoos. Super drying / frying. Yikes! That citrusy/ grapefruit stuff. More dryness to my poor scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Finally back to my Aveda. Sorry Amazon, I buy almost everything from you but could not wait for delivery. Got a new bottle of Scalp Benefits today. Drove 20 miles to buy it. Seriously I think all shampoos work better with a little water added. Shake vigorously and sudsy. Cost cut in half... Scratching my head and no flakes. Yay! But even better. No irritation. That is huge. AVEDA + Apple Cider Vinegar. Actually thinking the ACV might work as a root lift.&lt;br /&gt;Would love to hear reader&#x27;s feedback.</li>
            <li> What it was telling in the review and itself, it didnt work well at all. I wont buy it again.</li>
            <li> It is so natural and smells great. Hair loss stopped and Dandruff reduced. Great Product! Costly on the flip side but good one and useful</li>
            <li> I have mild scalp psoriasis and have pretty much tried everything under the sun when it comes to shampoos.  Unfortunately, this shampoo did not work for me.  It did, however, leave my hair squeaky clean and the scent leaves an earthy/herbaceous smell.</li>
            <li> I first came across this product when I went to a salon that only uses Aveda products, so I already knew that I liked it. Unfortunately, the salon no longer carries the Scalp Benefits line, so I bought it here. I&#x27;ve always had an itchy, oily scalp; however, other brands such as Head and Shoulders and Garnier anti-dandruff shampoos always made my fine, oily hair feel dry and dull.  After my package arrived, I used it just one time, and the itching is completely gone. I&#x27;ve seen a little bit of dandruff still, but my scalp was so itchy and dandruffy to begin with that I&#x27;m sure it just takes some time before it goes away completely. I MUST warn you, though, that this shampoo smells of *freshly ground black pepper.* If you can&#x27;t stand that smell, you should probably try another product.  Also, other reviews have stated that the shampoo alone doesn&#x27;t work. They are probably right, but I haven&#x27;t used only the shampoo. I strongly recommend using the conditioner as well to get the best results (and take away some of the peppery smell!). I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo didn&#x27;t really work for me. It left my hair really dry. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo though it may seem a little bit expensive is well worth every penny.This stuff is great for dry,flaky scalp and is very healthy to use.It does not have any harsh chemicals and is good for cleaning your hair and maintaining scalp and hair health.I would recommend this product for anyone who is experiencing the issues that this shampoo treats.</li>
            <li> massage for my scalp. smells great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting alot of compliments on the shine and health of my hair since using this product. The smell isn&#x27;t the greatest, but with what it does with my hair I cant really complain. No scalp flakes, my scalp and hair really does like this product. Though I would note that it doesn&#x27;t do much as far as body goes.</li>
            <li> This Shampoo balances and heals dry scalp unlike anything I have ever tried! It is truly amazing! Treat your self!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had occasional issues with dandruff over the years, and I bought this when the problem got really bad last summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo seems to keep it under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice a week and leave it on a couple minutes, massaging it in well. It also smells nice and is a good overall shampoo and comparable for my hair to other quality shampoos.</li>
            <li> Being a Curly Girl, I&#x27;ve been free of sulfates and silicones for 5 years.  Many Aveda products have both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has straight hair and has developed very fine flakes in parts of her scalp.  Beautician that cuts her hair recommended this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I also seemed to develop some of it (Celiac issues), I thought I&#x27;d give it a whirl once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did it NOT do a thing for my 8yo, but it made my head worse!  I ended up with bumpy patches, itchiness, and larger flakes!  Ugh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t seem to be very concentrated, either, and I found I had to use more than what I would expect for Aveda.  Even their \\&quot;Curly\\&quot; products are full of sulfates and silicones which is very drying:(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get better results rinsing with a mixture if apple cider vinegar and warm water (1:3).  At least THAT is pure and not full of nasties.  It also really helps the ph... Hair is soft and literally squeaky after!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money.  Apple Cider Vinegar and/or the \\&quot;blue\\&quot; shampo is cheaper and more effective!</li>
            <li> Great product for multiple hair types - I have my hair colored, my son is a swimmer and in the pool 6 days a week and my husband has dry scalp and oily hair due to wearing hats all the time.  Our whole family uses this shampoo.  It doesn&#x27;t harm my hair, keeps the nasty pool smell out of my sons hair and keeps my husband from being itchy and gets rid of that \\&quot;hat smell\\&quot;.  I love Aveda products and am very happy with this shampoo and the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Fast delivery makes easy shopping. Will definitely come back.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t use shampoo, but when my poo-less regimen leaves my scalp itchy and I need to do a re-boot, this is a good product.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair soft and shines!</li>
            <li> My daughter has  scalp issues. She has psoriasis and is often, itchy and flakey. It&#x27;s been an ongoing struggle for her for years. She has tried numerous things, including T-gel shampoo. We finally stumbled on this product and decided to give it a try. First, it smells great! It&#x27;s much more pleasant to use than the T-gel. More importantly, it helps! She&#x27;s much less itchy and flakey. She feels more confident as well.</li>
            <li> This product definitely did not help balance my scalp...I have a dry itchy scalp, and my hairdresser says it&#x27;s not due to dandruff rather it&#x27;s due to dry skin.  I was hoping that this would help nourish and balance my scalp.  It didn&#x27;t.  In fact I have purchased another product hoping that will help, while this one sits unused.  Waste of money!</li>
