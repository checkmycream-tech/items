            <li>I ordered this along with the Tea Rose Eau de Toilette Spray for my best friend at work</li>
            <li>Very nice, if pricey for the amount received.</li>
            <li>now that tells you something, when the bees think that you are a rose!  </li>
            <li>The lotion&#x27;s consistency is pleasant</li>
            <li>Good softening lotion with pleasant smell of roses.</li>
            <li>smells good</li>

            <li>Have loved it for years and it never disappoints.</li>
            <li>This had really good reviews</li>
            <li>I did give it to my mother, and she loved it</li>
            <li>(so maybe a good mother&#x27;s day gift?)</li>
            <li>This lotion smells so good and stays with you all through the day.  </li>
            <li>I just Love it!</li>
            <li>She loves the smell of rose.</li>
            <li>I had not been able to find another one in stores, so I am extremely pleased to be able to purchase it online!  </li>
            <li>This smells nothing like rose to me but more of a strong perfume, something your mom would wear.</li>
            <li>Lovely scent.</li>
            <li>Glad I found it&lt;</li>
            <li>I  love it  </li>
            <li>It has a mild rose scent and makes me smell lovely.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft and great fragrance.</li>
            <li>effective and a nice soft scent</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of strong smelling things</li>
            <li>I bought this because a lot of reviewers said it was light and floral.</li>
            <li>But if you like light floral lotion/perfume and have never used this, I&#x27;d consider looking around a bit.</li>
            <li>This lotion does not leave a sticky residue, and if you enjoy floral scents you will most likely love the scent of this lotion!</li>
            <li>Yardley&#x27;s English Rose body lotion has a very light smell.</li>
            <li>Would have liked if it was a little stronger scent but good lotion.</li>
            <li>English rose is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I bought this lotion for my great grandma right before she died of a massive stroke.  </li>
            <li>When I bought this lotion, she got it right the day before she passed on to be with God.  </li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful though,  very subtle.</li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased with my purchase..</li>
            <li>I really like this cream.</li>
            <li>bought this for my mom and she really enjoys it.great product</li>
            <li>It lingers in the air and just has that gentle ghostly smell if that makes sense.  </li>
            <li>It has a strong scent in the beginning, but later the scent begins to tone down, but the lingering scent is very gentle.  </li>
            <li>very soft smell that stays</li>
            <li>Soft and not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when  it was in my mailbox so soon.</li>
            <li>However, if you do use this with it make sure that scent is subtle or it will over power this smell.</li>
            <li>The smell of roses brings back childhood memories, so when I came across a small container of this rose-scented lotion I simply fell in love.  </li>

            <li> It smells so wonderful. It has a mild rose scent and makes me smell lovely. If you wear this, I truly don&#x27;t believe you need perfume. However, if you do use this with it make sure that scent is subtle or it will over power this smell.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream. Makes my skin soft and great fragrance. I bought an extra bottle and will definitely keep buying it.</li>
            <li> This product is too greasy and smells terrible!</li>
            <li> Very nice, if pricey for the amount received. Can&#x27;t be found in stores, even if requested.</li>
            <li> Would have liked if it was a little stronger scent but good lotion.</li>

            <li> Great lotion, pump quit working, so I have to take the pump out and pour the lotion into my hand</li>
            <li> smells good but once you put it on it has a weird dead flower smell.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash it off and give it away to someone else.</li>

She loved the scent of roses and I wanted her to know she was loved when we would rub this lotion on her.  It has a strong scent in the beginning, but later the scent begins to tone down, but the lingering scent is very gentle.

            <li> I bought this because a lot of reviewers said it was light and floral. This had really good reviews so I went ahead and got it. I wish I would have just bough something from the store. I don&#x27;t hate it, but It won&#x27;t be something I&#x27;ll be using daily. I&#x27;m not a fan of strong smelling things so it&#x27;s just a personal preference. But if you like light floral lotion/perfume and have never used this, I&#x27;d consider looking around a bit.

            <li> Oh My goodness this is the best smelling rose lotion from Yardley.  I put this on and when I go outside, I got bees swarmming around me...now that tells you something, when the bees think that you are a rose!  This lotion smells so good and stays with you all through the day.  I just Love it!</li>
            <li> This product is most difficult or locate in the Chocolate City (Washington DC) area.  So when I am down to one bottle I order another, given that they ship from London.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was pleasantly surprised when  it was in my mailbox so soon.</li>
            <li> I ordered this along with the Tea Rose Eau de Toilette Spray for my best friend at work and she comes to work smelling so good!!!!!  She loved it!!!!! She loves the smell of rose.</li>
