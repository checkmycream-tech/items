            <li>So smooth!</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>The thing I love about Body Shop products (as opposed to ones like this or like Bath &amp; Body Works products) is that Body Shop products smell like the scents they&#x27;re supposed to -- and nothing else.</li>
            <li>And it moisturizes better than anything else Ive ever tried.</li>
            <li>I love the subtle-natural-not-very-sweet coconut smell</li>
            <li>you go...  :]</li>
            <li>It never gets sticky, like most over the counter moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>Smells like coconut sun tan lotion, love it reminds everyone of the beach.</li>
            <li>I thought I would like the pomegranate better, but the coconut is the winner.</li>
            <li>It has more of an coconut smell the container wasn&#x27;t damaged.</li>
            <li>Fabulous!</li>
            <li>I just love Delon body butter.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This product is fabulous!  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite body butters.  </li>
            <li>I love this product I used to buy it at Costco</li>
            <li>It is so creamy and the smell lasts I get so many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>but I the coconut is my favorite of the two.</li>
            <li>All of my daughters love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Still really enjoyed this item for the moisturizing feel and scent.</li>
            <li>This is a good one, it smells great, and lasts a long time..</li>
            <li>As for moisturizing, it does a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product to keep elbows from looking dry.</li>
            <li>It smells INCREDIBLE, a nice coconut smell, not a watered-down lotion smell like a lot of other \\&quot;coconut\\&quot; lotions and body butters I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest this if you want a nice coconut scent, it reminds me of the beach!</li>
            <li>This feels light, refreshing and soothing to my skin.</li>
            <li>The container isn&#x27;t completely filled to the top.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and smells really good.</li>
            <li>For me, it soaks in easily.  </li>
            <li>i always order plenty to last me through the summer, love it, smells great, everyone compliments my skin all the time</li>
            <li>Smells way too strong.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery, high quality of the product, very good scent...  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no other store anywhere that has a better smelling coconut smell!!</li>
            <li>The jar is fine.</li>
            <li>It warms up quickly between your hands and feels lovely on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I immediately got a compliment on how I smelled with the very first person I ran into after putting just a quarter sized dab of it on!</li>
            <li>Light scent.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a big fan of Bath and Body Works products then you will probably like this stuff and find it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li>Most scented moisturizers don&#x27;t smell as good shortly after applied.  </li>
            <li>so, I am very excited to be able to find it on amazon.[[ASIN:B000LPOPVO DELON Intense Moisturizing Coconut Body Butter 6.9oz/196g]]</li>
            <li>New favorite!</li>
            <li>As far as a lotion goes it smells great, there is a lot of product, and its an overall nice lotion.</li>
            <li>I had originally used the Body Shops body butter</li>
            <li>Wow, I absolutely LOVE this body butter!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t looking for a great moisturizer (I use Aveeno when my skin gets super dry), but this one actually does a really good job.  </li>
            <li>Completely unexpected, as I mainly bought this for the smell, but a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li>It was only about 2/3 full, I liked the smell and everything</li>
            <li>my skin is very soft and more evenly toned.  </li>
            <li>and i actually like the texture of it better!</li>
            <li>The best thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that when I put it on areas that tend to get extra dry and itchy, it does the trick!  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes very well and has a fantastic scent.</li>
            <li>it goes on more smoothly, it&#x27;s lighter, and seems to last all day.</li>
            <li>However, if you are more of a purist when it comes to scent and truly want to smell like coconut -- and only coconut -- when you apply a coconut body butter, then I suggest you look elsewhere or stick with body shop products because this stuff smells cheap.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>After that, it seems to have been completely absorbed.  </li>
            <li>works into your skin to leave it soft and added bonus that smells good enough to eat..thank you and enjoy</li>
            <li>If you want to get a great body butter for less than $10, buy this product!</li>
            <li>but when I got it, it was pretty melted, kind of slimy, and some may have leaked out because the container was only about 40% full which I guess probably isn&#x27;t their fault because I live in a hot area and the package was in the sun all day.</li>
            <li>The product is very fragrant and the hydration is very intense!</li>
            <li>i am an avid body butter user..</li>
            <li>i tried this one for the first time</li>
            <li>and I would love to purchase more however, the shipping cost was excessive</li>
            <li>I have used many different brands</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try the mango next:)</li>
            <li>It smells really great, is creamy and a long lasting moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin super soft and I get tons of compliments on the scent.</li>
            <li>I used to wake in the morning and find that I had scratched certain areas during the night until they were quite irritated---but no more!&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li>for years i purchased tree hut brazilian nut and original body butter (they are less expensive than body shop&#x27;s version, but just as good even smells better!)</li>
            <li>Soaks in fast.</li>
            <li>, I like them so much.</li>
            <li>but I really feel that the Delon brand is outstanding.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it does have a nice long lasting scent</li>
            <li>It seems to last a while---I only use it once or twice a day at most.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this body butter because of the rave reviews it got on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It has a very tropical smell, very fruity, sweet with a little tang, not bad, but it was definitely not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a long time specifically for a coconut scented body butter that wasn&#x27;t full of tons of chemicals like The Body Shop&#x27;s moisturizers.</li>
            <li>So five minutes after applying the cheap butter you don&#x27;t smell so much like coconut as you do like cheap perfume with just a hint of fake coconut smell.</li>
            <li>I shouldn&#x27;t knock it down so many stars, because the main problem was my own expectation and it wasn&#x27;t necessarily anything inherently wrong with this product.</li>
            <li>scent of coconut is very pleasing and makes me feel like I&#x27;m at the beach in the middle of Summer.  </li>
            <li>The texture of the creme is not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>skin feels creamy soft after I use it.</li>
            <li>This has a very nice coconut smell- it&#x27;s not overpowering, and it doesn&#x27;t smell artificial.</li>
            <li>Such an amazing product shouldn&#x27;t be so hard to buy!  </li>
            <li>My fair skin is pretty sensitive to products, AND I wanted something with as few unnecessary chemicals as possible.  </li>
            <li>so I have been struggling with very itchy dry skin.</li>
            <li>tree hut&#x27;s version smells way better, that would be my only complaint (</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve already noticed major improvements.</li>
            <li>This stuff really worked for me and my aging, dry skin!</li>
            <li>You also don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it, I just barely dabbed my fingertips on it</li>
            <li>It is a white cream and when you put it on it melts into your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling oily or full of residue at all like some heavy butters can.</li>
            <li>I should have known better than to stray from Body Shop products but a few reviewers on Amazon said it was \\&quot;just as good\\&quot; and less money</li>
            <li>Not only does this product provide intense moisturizing for your dry skin, the smell is to die for!</li>
            <li>-I&#x27;m usually not into beauty product indulgence and started using this for dry hands in the winter, but NOW I use it all the time.</li>
            <li>A little gos a long way, well worth the money for me.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> As far as a lotion goes it smells great, there is a lot of product, and its an overall nice lotion.</li>
            <li> I had originally used the Body Shops body butter</li>
            <li> Wow, I absolutely LOVE this body butter!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t looking for a great moisturizer (I use Aveeno when my skin gets super dry), but this one actually does a really good job.  </li>
            <li> Completely unexpected, as I mainly bought this for the smell, but a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li> It was only about 2/3 full, I liked the smell and everything</li>
            <li> my skin is very soft and more evenly toned.  </li>
            <li> and i actually like the texture of it better!</li>
            <li> The best thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that when I put it on areas that tend to get extra dry and itchy, it does the trick!  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes very well and has a fantastic scent.</li>
            <li> it goes on more smoothly, it&#x27;s lighter, and seems to last all day.</li>
            <li> However, if you are more of a purist when it comes to scent and truly want to smell like coconut -- and only coconut -- when you apply a coconut body butter, then I suggest you look elsewhere or stick with body shop products because this stuff smells cheap.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li> After that, it seems to have been completely absorbed.  </li>
            <li> works into your skin to leave it soft and added bonus that smells good enough to eat..thank you and enjoy</li>
            <li> If you want to get a great body butter for less than $10, buy this product!</li>
            <li> but when I got it, it was pretty melted, kind of slimy, and some may have leaked out because the container was only about 40% full which I guess probably isn&#x27;t their fault because I live in a hot area and the package was in the sun all day.</li>
            <li> The product is very fragrant and the hydration is very intense!</li>
            <li> i am an avid body butter user..</li>
            <li> i tried this one for the first time</li>
            <li> and I would love to purchase more however, the shipping cost was excessive</li>
            <li> I have used many different brands</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try the mango next:)</li>
            <li> It smells really great, is creamy and a long lasting moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin super soft and I get tons of compliments on the scent.</li>
            <li> I used to wake in the morning and find that I had scratched certain areas during the night until they were quite irritated---but no more!&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> for years i purchased tree hut brazilian nut and original body butter (they are less expensive than body shop&#x27;s version, but just as good even smells better!)</li>
            <li> Soaks in fast.</li>
            <li> , I like them so much.</li>
            <li> but I really feel that the Delon brand is outstanding.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it does have a nice long lasting scent</li>
            <li> It seems to last a while---I only use it once or twice a day at most.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this body butter because of the rave reviews it got on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It has a very tropical smell, very fruity, sweet with a little tang, not bad, but it was definitely not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a long time specifically for a coconut scented body butter that wasn&#x27;t full of tons of chemicals like The Body Shop&#x27;s moisturizers.</li>
            <li> So five minutes after applying the cheap butter you don&#x27;t smell so much like coconut as you do like cheap perfume with just a hint of fake coconut smell.</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t knock it down so many stars, because the main problem was my own expectation and it wasn&#x27;t necessarily anything inherently wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> scent of coconut is very pleasing and makes me feel like I&#x27;m at the beach in the middle of Summer.  </li>
            <li> The texture of the creme is not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> skin feels creamy soft after I use it.</li>
            <li> This has a very nice coconut smell- it&#x27;s not overpowering, and it doesn&#x27;t smell artificial.</li>
            <li> Such an amazing product shouldn&#x27;t be so hard to buy!  </li>
            <li> My fair skin is pretty sensitive to products, AND I wanted something with as few unnecessary chemicals as possible.  </li>
            <li> so I have been struggling with very itchy dry skin.</li>
            <li> tree hut&#x27;s version smells way better, that would be my only complaint (</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve already noticed major improvements.</li>
            <li> This stuff really worked for me and my aging, dry skin!</li>
            <li> You also don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it, I just barely dabbed my fingertips on it</li>
            <li> It is a white cream and when you put it on it melts into your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling oily or full of residue at all like some heavy butters can.</li>
            <li> I should have known better than to stray from Body Shop products but a few reviewers on Amazon said it was \\&quot;just as good\\&quot; and less money</li>
            <li> Not only does this product provide intense moisturizing for your dry skin, the smell is to die for!</li>
            <li> -I&#x27;m usually not into beauty product indulgence and started using this for dry hands in the winter, but NOW I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> A little gos a long way, well worth the money for me.</li>
            <li> Long lasting scent and softness.</li>
            <li> not so interested in ordering from this site again as had so much trouble ordering-confusing re: $25 order to be eligable for other items</li>
            <li> I recently moved to a dry climate</li>
            <li> Used to have dry skin and itched constantly.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of this brand of body butters for a long time.</li>
            <li> It also keeps its scent all day long!</li>
            <li> Use every day post shower for dry skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin</li>
            <li> The scent is long lasting and a \\&quot;little goes a long</li>
            <li> I spent a long time comparing body moisturizers online.  </li>
            <li> item had to be returned because when you opened the container it was not full - looked like a third of it</li>
            <li> I could even smell it a little bit the next day when I put my nose to my skin.</li>
            <li> way\\&quot; I especially like the round packaging that the butter was in.</li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t used any other lotions, body butters or even perfumes!</li>
            <li> I went on to purchase the four-pack after I&#x27;d used about half the tub.  </li>
            <li> It is quite a natural scent too, not too overpowering or artificial smelling but simply present and the scent lasts all day..</li>
            <li> My oldest sister even uses on her little dog after bathing her.  </li>
            <li> It smelled a little like pina colada to me, but when I put it on, my husband told me it made him hungry for a Mounds candy bar.</li>
            <li> The coconut oil lingers for a little while, leaving a semi-greasy feel for about 15 minutes after application.  </li>
            <li> I prefer a subtle scent when I put it on, this scent lingers too long.</li>
            <li> The coconut was given to me by a co-worker a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use oils anymore, they are just too messy.  </li>
            <li> was  missing.</li>
            <li> and it would do half a leg!</li>
            <li> My main disappointment was the smell.</li>
            <li> I usually put it on my arms before bed.  </li>
            <li> I gave several coconut body butters as gifts and without fail the recipients were won over by the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Even the \\&quot;chicken skin\\&quot; on my upper arms is less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> the scent is so subtle that you can wear your everyday perfume with it</li>
            <li> but this time it was not as thick as the lotion I got before, not sure why.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding it</li>
            <li> Whereas cheaper butters like this one have that cheap perfume-y undertone in the scent that ends up being the dominant smell; I HATE THAT!!</li>
            <li> A common comment was &amp;#34;It smells like Grandmother&#x27;s kitchen.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have serious problems with hands in winter.  </li>
            <li> but this product sadly did not.</li>
            <li> I used to use a very expensive one but not anymore !</li>
    </ol>

            <li> not so interested in ordering from this site again as had so much trouble ordering-confusing re: $25 order to be eligable for other items but if you wanted to purchase them w/out  $25 order-no way to do so</li>
            <li> i am an avid body butter user..for years i purchased tree hut brazilian nut and original body butter (they are less expensive than body shop&#x27;s version, but just as good even smells better!) i tried this one for the first time and i actually like the texture of it better! it goes on more smoothly, it&#x27;s lighter, and seems to last all day. the smell is nice but tree hut&#x27;s version smells way better, that would be my only complaint (if that&#x27;a even a ligitiment one!)</li>
            <li> The coconut was given to me by a co-worker a few years ago. Since, then I have bought some for my sisters&lt;br /&gt;&amp; friends.  Both of my sisters love it.  My oldest sister even uses on her little dog after bathing her.  They are&lt;br /&gt;ordering some for their friends.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Excellent product to keep elbows from looking dry. Not greasy. Soaks in fast. Light scent. My husband says it&#x27;s better than perfume.</li>
            <li> Wow, I absolutely LOVE this body butter! It smells INCREDIBLE, a nice coconut smell, not a watered-down lotion smell like a lot of other \\&quot;coconut\\&quot; lotions and body butters I&#x27;ve tried. It also keeps its scent all day long! I didn&#x27;t have to layer it with anything. It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s overpowering at all, it&#x27;s just perfect. You also don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it, I just barely dabbed my fingertips on it and it would do half a leg! So smooth! This has been my scent of choice since I bought it, I haven&#x27;t used any other lotions, body butters or even perfumes! I highly suggest this if you want a nice coconut scent, it reminds me of the beach! &#x3D;) Perfect for summer!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this body butter because of the rave reviews it got on Amazon. I should have known better than to stray from Body Shop products but a few reviewers on Amazon said it was \\&quot;just as good\\&quot; and less money so I took the bait. What can I say? I got burned. The thing I love about Body Shop products (as opposed to ones like this or like Bath &amp; Body Works products) is that Body Shop products smell like the scents they&#x27;re supposed to -- and nothing else. Whereas cheaper butters like this one have that cheap perfume-y undertone in the scent that ends up being the dominant smell; I HATE THAT!! So five minutes after applying the cheap butter you don&#x27;t smell so much like coconut as you do like cheap perfume with just a hint of fake coconut smell. If you&#x27;re a big fan of Bath and Body Works products then you will probably like this stuff and find it&#x27;s a great deal. However, if you are more of a purist when it comes to scent and truly want to smell like coconut -- and only coconut -- when you apply a coconut body butter, then I suggest you look elsewhere or stick with body shop products because this stuff smells cheap. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, high quality of the product, very good scent...  If you want to get a great body butter for less than $10, buy this product!</li>
            <li> This is the most perfect lotion, it literally does last all day and people do compliment you on how good it smells.  I&#x27;ve tried several of the scents and my favorites are Coconut and Olive.  I&#x27;d recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> As far as a lotion goes it smells great, there is a lot of product, and its an overall nice lotion. It does not however help get rid of stretch marks which is why I bought it. Still a nice lotion though, I will get a lot of use out of it.</li>
            <li> My mom bought this maybe in 2003. As soon as I opened it the smell totally got me. And it moisturizes better than anything else Ive ever tried. By far my favorite lotion. A little gos a long way, well worth the money for me.</li>
            <li> This product smells like FRESH COCONUTS!!!  There&#x27;s no other store anywhere that has a better smelling coconut smell!! You have to try it.  You&#x27;ll be hooked!!</li>
            <li> I am totally hooked on DELON body butter...it works...pure and simple! I&#x27;ve never had a body butter that moisturizes better! Sherry Dorn</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.  I have a hard time finding it so, I am very excited to be able to find it on amazon.[[ASIN:B000LPOPVO DELON Intense Moisturizing Coconut Body Butter 6.9oz/196g]]</li>
            <li> I am still trying to find out if they have a body butter that doesn&#x27;t clog your pores so I can use it on my face too.</li>
            <li> Mosturizes great and it does have a nice long lasting scent but it smells more like cocoa butter than coconut!</li>
            <li> Although the product lived up to expectation and I would love to purchase more however, the shipping cost was excessive</li>
            <li> I had originally used the Body Shops body butter and I was looking for similar products when I stumbled on to this on Amazon. The reviews were good but when I got it, it was pretty melted, kind of slimy, and some may have leaked out because the container was only about 40% full which I guess probably isn&#x27;t their fault because I live in a hot area and the package was in the sun all day. My main disappointment was the smell. I love the subtle-natural-not-very-sweet coconut smell but this was nothing like it. I can&#x27;t even say it smells like coconut at all. It has a very tropical smell, very fruity, sweet with a little tang, not bad, but it was definitely not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! -I&#x27;m usually not into beauty product indulgence and started using this for dry hands in the winter, but NOW I use it all the time. Gives skin a great radiance without being too oily. &#x3D;BEST PART&#x3D; walk around smelling like the beach all day and get compliments on how gooood you smell EVERYWHERE you go...  :]</li>
            <li> The product is very fragrant and the hydration is very intense! I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for massages.  It is very lightly scented, it doesn&#x27;t drip or run.  It never gets sticky, like most over the counter moisturizers.  It warms up quickly between your hands and feels lovely on your skin.  For me, it soaks in easily.  I don&#x27;t use oils anymore, they are just too messy.  I have bought three of these, I like them so much.</li>
            <li> Smells like coconut sun tan lotion, love it reminds everyone of the beach. Lots of compliments. Great as a $5 gift.</li>
            <li> This stuff has an AMAZING texture and an even better smell. I recently moved to a dry climate so I have been struggling with very itchy dry skin. I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week and I&#x27;ve already noticed major improvements. Great value</li>
            <li> Such an amazing product shouldn&#x27;t be so hard to buy!  Most scented moisturizers don&#x27;t smell as good shortly after applied.  This one smells edible all day!</li>
            <li> I opened this up &amp; was intoxicated! A beautiful, tropical coconut scent, not too strong. It smelled a little like pina colada to me, but when I put it on, my husband told me it made him hungry for a Mounds candy bar. And I&#x27;ve never had a body butter make my skin feel so silky...excellent!</li>
            <li> Great stuff and at a greater price. Use every day post shower for dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;No greasy feeling a plus</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the scent of this body butter! Coconut with no additional scents - perfect.  As for moisturizing, it does a pretty good job.  I usually put it on my arms before bed.  The coconut oil lingers for a little while, leaving a semi-greasy feel for about 15 minutes after application.  After that, it seems to have been completely absorbed.  I wasn&#x27;t looking for a great moisturizer (I use Aveeno when my skin gets super dry), but this one actually does a really good job.  I notice in the morning my skin is very soft and more evenly toned.  Even the \\&quot;chicken skin\\&quot; on my upper arms is less noticeable.  Completely unexpected, as I mainly bought this for the smell, but a pleasant surprise.  I went on to purchase the four-pack after I&#x27;d used about half the tub.  New favorite!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It&#x27;s super moisturizing without being greasy and the smell is very nice to boot. I&#x27;ll likely buy from this brand again.</li>
            <li> Smells way too strong.  I prefer a subtle scent when I put it on, this scent lingers too long. Did not like it at all.</li>
            <li> I purchase the pomegranate and the coconut.  I thought I would like the pomegranate better, but the coconut is the winner. It has more of an coconut smell the container wasn&#x27;t damaged.</li>
            <li> DELON body butter makes your skin feel like silk, and it smells wonderful.......  I stocked up on it so I wouldn&#x27;t run out!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a long time specifically for a coconut scented body butter that wasn&#x27;t full of tons of chemicals like The Body Shop&#x27;s moisturizers. On the jar it says it&#x27;s made in Canada. They shipped it much earlier than Amazon projected too; it was here in about 2 days. I wanted to smell like the beach and this is it! It is a white cream and when you put it on it melts into your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling oily or full of residue at all like some heavy butters can. This feels light, refreshing and soothing to my skin. I immediately got a compliment on how I smelled with the very first person I ran into after putting just a quarter sized dab of it on! It smells tropical and makes me think about being under palm trees. It is quite a natural scent too, not too overpowering or artificial smelling but simply present and the scent lasts all day.. I could even smell it a little bit the next day when I put my nose to my skin. I say buy it!</li>
            <li> item had to be returned because when you opened the container it was not full - looked like a third of it was  missing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and wonderful for dry skin . I received it for a Christmas gift two years ago and I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I gave several coconut body butters as gifts and without fail the recipients were won over by the fragrance. A common comment was &amp;#34;It smells like Grandmother&#x27;s kitchen.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Simply wonderful. Perfect for a moisturizer yet not greasy. I buy it for my second home in Jamaica.  Just great</li>
            <li> This has a very nice coconut smell- it&#x27;s not overpowering, and it doesn&#x27;t smell artificial. The consistency is great as well; it absorbs fairly quickly into my skin and never leaves a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of this brand of body butters for a long time. I have used many different brands but I really feel that the Delon brand is outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of coconut is very pleasing and makes me feel like I&#x27;m at the beach in the middle of Summer.  The texture of the creme is not heavy or greasy. It goes on light, absorbs quickly, makes my skin feel wonderful and smells devine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try the White Chocolate, too.  Fabulous!</li>
            <li> i always order plenty to last me through the summer, love it, smells great, everyone compliments my skin all the time</li>
            <li> I just love Delon body butter. I had an operation. And I&#x27;ve use it for my scares and it works wonders. I love it. Thank you</li>
            <li> Not only does this product provide intense moisturizing for your dry skin, the smell is to die for!</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous!  Why spend money on perfume when this product doubles as a wonderful scent and is healthy for skin.</li>
            <li> I have ordered Body Butter before and Loved it but this time it was not as thick as the lotion I got before, not sure why. But it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer.  I have serious problems with hands in winter.  I cant say this cured it, but I can say that I have tried every product out there!  This is a good one, it smells great, and lasts a long time..</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite body butters.  It moisturizes very well and has a fantastic scent. Leaves my skin super soft and I get tons of compliments on the scent.</li>
            <li> DELON Coconut Body Butter was an amazing find for me!  The scent is long lasting and a \\&quot;little goes a long way\\&quot; I especially like the round packaging that the butter was in. Product arrived on time and in good shape.  I will be ordering more.&lt;br /&gt;JADE</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!! Long lasting scent and softness. I would recommend this product 100%.  I&#x27;m going to try the mango next:)</li>
            <li> I love this product I used to buy it at Costco but they haven&#x27;t had it in awhile. It is so creamy and the smell lasts I get so many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> works into your skin to leave it soft and added bonus that smells good enough to eat..thank you and enjoy</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and I love this stuff! It is a nice whipped, creamy consistency. Both the coconut and olive scents smell amazing!</li>
            <li> How can I say coconut body butter dream. It is not greasy. it is creamy and absorbs very nicely as you put it on. The smell is lovely.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels creamy soft after I use it. The jar is fine. if your worried about putting your fingers in get a spatula just for it. wash it every time your done.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It smells really great, is creamy and a long lasting moisturizer.  I also tried the Mango scent but I the coconut is my favorite of the two.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and smells really good. I wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey. The container isn&#x27;t completely filled to the top.</li>
            <li> I have never tried this body butter till today and I love it! Especially the way it absorbs and the way my skin feels. I used to use a very expensive one but not anymore ! Will stick with Delon from now on.</li>
            <li> I spent a long time comparing body moisturizers online.  My fair skin is pretty sensitive to products, AND I wanted something with as few unnecessary chemicals as possible.  I had tried a friend&#x27;s body butter and so that&#x27;s the direction I took.  I was immediately impressed with this product!  It seems to last a while---I only use it once or twice a day at most.  The best thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that when I put it on areas that tend to get extra dry and itchy, it does the trick!  I used to wake in the morning and find that I had scratched certain areas during the night until they were quite irritated---but no more!&lt;br /&gt;  One caution---The Body Shop similar product(with even similar packaging) is not the same.  It is no longer made with ingredient oversight and is made in Thailand.  After contacting the Delon company, I am convinced that they are conscientious about their product, and it shows.  This stuff really worked for me and my aging, dry skin!</li>
            <li> The best body butter i have tried.  smells great and goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky or greasy.  the scent is so subtle that you can wear your everyday perfume with it and they don&#x27;t clash.</li>
            <li> Best cream ever made.  All of my daughters love this stuff.  Costco only carries this at Christmas so now I can get it all year.</li>
            <li> I heard coconut butter removes stretch marks but this product sadly did not. Still really enjoyed this item for the moisturizing feel and scent. I shouldn&#x27;t knock it down so many stars, because the main problem was my own expectation and it wasn&#x27;t necessarily anything inherently wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> Greatest body lotion I have ever used. Used to have dry skin and itched constantly. Will not use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;My friend is now sold on it.  Great fragrance too.</li>
            <li> It was only about 2/3 full, I liked the smell and everything but I Didn&#x27;t pay for just 2/3 of it.&lt;br /&gt;Ruturning.</li>
