            <li>This is one of my favorite perfumes.</li>
            <li>Nice, clean fragrance</li>
            <li>Smell so good , and very fast shipping</li>
            <li>Packaging and product was pretty good.</li>
            <li>When you are able to smell perfume over a fast food joint, then you know you have a good</li>
            <li>Not \\&quot;old\\&quot; but more of a more mature grown &amp; sexy scent beyond the 20&#x27;s but it smells so good  </li>
            <li>Completely full bottle!</li>
            <li>This big bottle of perfume it smells so good!</li>
            <li>Recieve package very quick.....</li>
            <li>The sent isn&#x27;t as strong as what was in the store and the bottle leaks everywhere.</li>
            <li>Wished it wasn&#x27;t as strong, but the body mist is lighter than the eau de toilette.</li>
            <li>Not only am I happy with the product, the package was delivered a week early which was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and feminine and can be worn on any occasionâ€‹.</li>
            <li>Trust me when I say there&#x27;s no one more surprised with my love for Rihanna&#x27;s perfume than myself, but I love this scent.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the smell ...</li>
            <li>I fell in love with the perfume &amp; when I saw the body mist for such a good price, I just had to buy it.  </li>
            <li>i love love its a whole lot</li>
            <li>This is an amazing scent that is powerful yet subtle and smells delicious.</li>
            <li>smell very good but not last so long, i think is just good for the price.</li>
            <li>I got it a lot faster than I originally thought it would be here</li>
            <li>Based on the notes and positive reviews I read online, I imagined something tropical, coconutty and lovely.</li>
            <li>so I can leave the costly stuff for special occasions.</li>
            <li>I loved the perfume and wanted to get something for my sisters and my mom as an overall every day fragrance.</li>
            <li>It a good present.</li>
            <li>i just want to spray more and more, and it last all day.</li>
            <li>Normally, when you purchase new cologne, you have to press the squirt nozzle a good two - three times for anything to come out, since there is no liquid flowing threw the &amp;#34;hose&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is pretty big as well which is always a good thing.</li>
            <li>Strong not like over-powering but as in extremely long-lasting for a body mist/body spray and even in this form vs the perfume/parfum a little still goes a long way which is pretty awesome and just boosts up the great value it already is vs getting this at the price I saw perfume/parfum at.</li>
            <li>Was shipped real fast</li>
            <li>I would recommend buying this, well worth it &amp; will be purchasing this again</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and was anxious and happy to receive it.</li>
            <li>This Perfume cost way more in the major Department stores.  </li>
            <li>It kinda smells good right after spraying then the more you smell the worse</li>
            <li>This is such a nice sweet &amp; soft scent.  </li>
            <li>The delivery of this item was very fast.  </li>
            <li>but when it becomes tame its pleasant to smell.</li>
            <li>Much better deal then the mall and 4xs bigger bottle</li>
            <li>First time buying this ...</li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured and fast service!</li>
            <li>Thank you soo much!</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it lasts a really long tie.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was a used bottle, but a good half inch was already missing from the bottle, and unlike all the colognes/perfumes I purchase for my Fiancee and I online, the second I popped the cap to test spray it, a good amount comes out.  </li>
            <li>The price is reasonable, and it doesn&#x27;t give me, my family or the people I work with a headache.</li>
            <li>This item was shipped fast.</li>
            <li>really nicen fragance</li>
            <li>Gave to my cousin anc she really likes it.</li>
            <li>I really like this one.</li>
            <li>ITS NOT THE REAL THING</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong and lasts very long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually going to buy a full size of the Paris Hilton can can</li>
            <li>it dies down to a more manageable level and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>To be honest I was shocked at how nice it smelled on me.</li>
            <li>For a body spray its pretty strong fragrance is long lasting.</li>
            <li>I love this smell , the only thing is the fragrance doesn&#x27;t lasta long time.</li>
            <li>This body mist is a lighter scent and much more of an everyday type of fragrance.</li>
            <li>for a body mist it is incredibly strong and long lasting - it wouldn&#x27;t go away no matter how much I scrubbed..</li>
            <li>i had to buy a new perfume bottle to transfer it into</li>
            <li>I ordered this because I wanted to try a new scent.</li>
            <li>The small samples that were given to me in this package smell waaaaayyy better</li>
            <li>I purchased for my teen daughter when it first came out</li>
            <li>It smells exactly like the perfume and is just as concentrated but is much larger for a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li>I will say the scent is a tiny bit more mature than I expected.</li>
            <li>it starts to smell because to me it has a old musky like scent to it.</li>
            <li>I spritzed this onto my work shirt and jeans, and recieved several compliments from people and I work in fast food.</li>
            <li>Be subtle not saturated :)</li>
            <li>Although it is a little heavy, it would be nice on a breezy summer night</li>
            <li>and it came with a coupon and a few free samples of different perfumes .</li>
            <li>the scent is a bit sharp at first almost like a cologne</li>
            <li>Even though seeing how much came in the bottle it could last a long time.</li>
            <li>Of course it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the actual perfume, like all body mists, but it smells exactly the same</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little over powering when I first put it on but by the time I leave my room</li>

            <li> Normally, when you purchase new cologne, you have to press the squirt nozzle a good two - three times for anything to come out, since there is no liquid flowing threw the &amp;#34;hose&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is pretty big as well which is always a good thing.</li>
            <li> Strong not like over-powering but as in extremely long-lasting for a body mist/body spray and even in this form vs the perfume/parfum a little still goes a long way which is pretty awesome and just boosts up the great value it already is vs getting this at the price I saw perfume/parfum at.</li>
            <li> Was shipped real fast</li>
            <li> I would recommend buying this, well worth it &amp; will be purchasing this again</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and was anxious and happy to receive it.</li>
            <li> This Perfume cost way more in the major Department stores.  </li>
            <li> It kinda smells good right after spraying then the more you smell the worse</li>
            <li> This is such a nice sweet &amp; soft scent.  </li>
            <li> The delivery of this item was very fast.  </li>
            <li> but when it becomes tame its pleasant to smell.</li>
            <li> Much better deal then the mall and 4xs bigger bottle</li>
            <li> First time buying this ...</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured and fast service!</li>
            <li> Thank you soo much!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it lasts a really long tie.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was a used bottle, but a good half inch was already missing from the bottle, and unlike all the colognes/perfumes I purchase for my Fiancee and I online, the second I popped the cap to test spray it, a good amount comes out.  </li>
            <li> The price is reasonable, and it doesn&#x27;t give me, my family or the people I work with a headache.</li>
            <li> This item was shipped fast.</li>
            <li> really nicen fragance</li>
            <li> Gave to my cousin anc she really likes it.</li>
            <li> I really like this one.</li>
            <li> ITS NOT THE REAL THING</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong and lasts very long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually going to buy a full size of the Paris Hilton can can</li>
            <li> it dies down to a more manageable level and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> To be honest I was shocked at how nice it smelled on me.</li>
            <li> For a body spray its pretty strong fragrance is long lasting.</li>
            <li> I love this smell , the only thing is the fragrance doesn&#x27;t lasta long time.</li>
            <li> This body mist is a lighter scent and much more of an everyday type of fragrance.</li>
            <li> for a body mist it is incredibly strong and long lasting - it wouldn&#x27;t go away no matter how much I scrubbed..</li>
            <li> i had to buy a new perfume bottle to transfer it into</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I wanted to try a new scent.</li>
            <li> The small samples that were given to me in this package smell waaaaayyy better</li>
            <li> I purchased for my teen daughter when it first came out</li>
            <li> It smells exactly like the perfume and is just as concentrated but is much larger for a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> I will say the scent is a tiny bit more mature than I expected.</li>
            <li> it starts to smell because to me it has a old musky like scent to it.</li>
            <li> I spritzed this onto my work shirt and jeans, and recieved several compliments from people and I work in fast food.</li>
            <li> Be subtle not saturated :)</li>
            <li> Although it is a little heavy, it would be nice on a breezy summer night</li>
            <li> and it came with a coupon and a few free samples of different perfumes .</li>
            <li> the scent is a bit sharp at first almost like a cologne</li>
            <li> Even though seeing how much came in the bottle it could last a long time.</li>
            <li> Of course it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the actual perfume, like all body mists, but it smells exactly the same</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little over powering when I first put it on but by the time I leave my room</li>
            <li> But does not last long.</li>
            <li> Instead I got a heavy, overwhelming and sickening sweet patchouli bomb.</li>
            <li> It was just as expected.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected.</li>
            <li> The perfume smells godg as i expected.  </li>
            <li> Not the traditional champagne color it usually comes in.</li>
            <li> Mine did not come watered down or damaged an any way which was my biggest concern in ordering.</li>
            <li> Just spray a little.</li>
            <li> i bought it for everyday use</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not really good at it.</li>
            <li> but I am shocked at rihanna because this stinks I&#x27;m giving this away.</li>
            <li> absolutely *hated* it.</li>
            <li> Never smelled it before I ordered it - was just going off of reviews, and I think it smells terrible.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Was shipped real fast but I am shocked at rihanna because this stinks I&#x27;m giving this away. The small samples that were given to me in this package smell waaaaayyy better I&#x27;m actually going to buy a full size of the Paris Hilton can can and Fairy dust perfume smells wonderful</li>
            <li> It was just as expected. Now, I can&#x27;t vouch if this is official Rihanna perfume or not but I do know it made a great gift and it smelled amazing. I&#x27;d buy again and again. Even though seeing how much came in the bottle it could last a long time.</li>
            <li> To be honest I was shocked at how nice it smelled on me. It lasts all day for me. The price is reasonable, and it doesn&#x27;t give me, my family or the people I work with a headache. Just spray a little. Be subtle not saturated :)</li>
            <li> The delivery of this item was very fast.  This Perfume cost way more in the major Department stores.  I&#x27;m happy that the cost was reasonable and this perfume smells great.  Don&#x27;t pass up this great opportunity.</li>

            <li> the scent is a bit sharp at first almost like a cologne but when it becomes tame its pleasant to smell. i bought it for everyday use so I can leave the costly stuff for special occasions.</li>

            <li> Great and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Packaging and product was pretty good. I ordered it Thursday it was here this afternoon. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that the perfume is purple.. Not the traditional champagne color it usually comes in.</li>
            <li> I love this scent &amp; have been using it for years!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.. it smell so gooooddd..&lt;br /&gt;great product.!!</li>
            <li> smells amazing but the bottle cap broke easily i had to buy a new perfume bottle to transfer it into</li>
            <li> Much better deal then the mall and 4xs bigger bottle</li>
            <li> My wife love it... Smells like some perfume</li>
            <li> I love this smell , the only thing is the fragrance doesn&#x27;t lasta long time.</li>
            <li> This is only a body MIST but its longevity is very impressive. It lasts all day on me without having to spritz some on again. Great scent too!</li>
            <li> The smell is intoxicating. i just want to spray more and more, and it last all day. The bottle is pretty big as well which is always a good thing. I plan to order more. And i am glad that the container isn&#x27;t glass since I plan to bring it to school (for gym).</li>
            <li> This is a review of the scent of this body mist, not the seller or anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely *hated* it. Based on the notes and positive reviews I read online, I imagined something tropical, coconutty and lovely. Instead I got a heavy, overwhelming and sickening sweet patchouli bomb. I donated it to my local Goodwill the very next day.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, for a body mist it is incredibly strong and long lasting - it wouldn&#x27;t go away no matter how much I scrubbed.. so I suppose it has to get some points for that. A definite try before you buy.</li>
            <li> Will never purchase again, I should&#x27;ve known for the price it couldn&#x27;t be to great but I bought it anyways. It kinda smells good right after spraying then the more you smell the worse it starts to smell because to me it has a old musky like scent to it.</li>
            <li> Love this smell! Completely full bottle!</li>
            <li> great sexy scent, not to strong, or overpowering, very soft great price.</li>
            <li> This is such a great fragrance! I loved the perfume and wanted to get something for my sisters and my mom as an overall every day fragrance. This is an amazing scent that is powerful yet subtle and smells delicious. This is a hit!</li>
            <li> love the smell I have been wanting this for a while I seen it was 10 dollars so I had to buy it and glad I did.  smells lasts for hours also..</li>
            <li> Trust me when I say there&#x27;s no one more surprised with my love for Rihanna&#x27;s perfume than myself, but I love this scent. I purchased for my teen daughter when it first came out and I decided I finally needed to stop sneaking in her closet to put on and get my own.&lt;br /&gt;Beyond happy!</li>
            <li> This is such a nice sweet &amp; soft scent.  I fell in love with the perfume &amp; when I saw the body mist for such a good price, I just had to buy it.  Of course it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the actual perfume, like all body mists, but it smells exactly the same &amp; I love spraying it all over.  Good buy for the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for the roller ball version of this forever and when I stumbled upon the body mist I just could not resist. It smells exactly like the perfume and is just as concentrated but is much larger for a fraction of the cost! Not only am I happy with the product, the package was delivered a week early which was a pleasant surprise. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase!</li>
            <li> First time buying this ... I really enjoy the smell ... I&#x27;m close to Rihanna&#x27;s age who is 25 now but I think she was about 22 when she created (have her beat by 2.5 yrs) this.  I will say the scent is a tiny bit more mature than I expected. It smells like something a woman about 10 years her senior would&#x27;ve created. Not \\&quot;old\\&quot; but more of a more mature grown &amp; sexy scent beyond the 20&#x27;s but it smells so good  Solid 4 out 5 stars. Very nice. Strong not like over-powering but as in extremely long-lasting for a body mist/body spray and even in this form vs the perfume/parfum a little still goes a long way which is pretty awesome and just boosts up the great value it already is vs getting this at the price I saw perfume/parfum at.</li>
            <li> smells soooooooo good! really nicen fragance</li>
            <li> Smells SO GOOD!! I ordered this because I wanted to try a new scent. Boy, am I glad I did!!! It smells mouthwateringly delicious! I LOVE the scent! Seductive and spicy at the same time. MMMMM!!!</li>
            <li> I gave this body mist 5 stars because it smells so sensual. Lasts all day or night (wink). I would recommend this to a lady who doesn&#x27;t always like to play nice with her scents. Although it is a little heavy, it would be nice on a breezy summer night</li>
            <li> it smells good and it lasts a while for being body mist it is a very nice price and quality.</li>
            <li> smells nice will buy again</li>
            <li> excellent fragrance......</li>
            <li> Recieve package very quick.....love love this fragrance. For a body spray its pretty strong fragrance is long lasting. I would recommend to try!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caseyâ™¥</li>
            <li> Love this perfume great body spray!</li>
            <li> Fairly pissed off that this product came to me USED.  I don&#x27;t know if it was a used bottle, but a good half inch was already missing from the bottle, and unlike all the colognes/perfumes I purchase for my Fiancee and I online, the second I popped the cap to test spray it, a good amount comes out.  Normally, when you purchase new cologne, you have to press the squirt nozzle a good two - three times for anything to come out, since there is no liquid flowing threw the &amp;#34;hose&amp;#34;.  Nope, not with this one.  Despite the product coming to me &amp;#34;Used&amp;#34; (Maybe some of the perfume &amp;#34;evaporated&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t know) it smells good.  Just won&#x27;t be purchasing from this seller again.&lt;br /&gt;My star rating for this cologne goes as follows:&lt;br /&gt;1 Star for receiving the item, 2 Stars for the product meeting my standards in terms of smell, 3 Stars for the item being in the condition I expect, 4 Stars for recommending this item/seller in the future, 5 Stars for being blown away (And for that, all 4 pre-req&#x27;s will have to be met).</li>
            <li> This mist smells sooo good.  Love it!</li>
            <li> very nice after 5 sent</li>
            <li> This big bottle of perfume it smells so good! The price was really really good! Going to have to get some more!</li>
            <li> the scent is wonderful ! I got it a lot faster than I originally thought it would be here and it came with a coupon and a few free samples of different perfumes . I would recommend buying this, well worth it &amp; will be purchasing this again (:</li>
            <li> its an ok smell.. i just really buy it because i love rihanna lol...</li>
            <li> This perfume smells awful. Though I&#x27;m sure some people may like the smell.</li>
            <li> smells great I get tons of complements on a daily basis would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> The sent isn&#x27;t as strong as what was in the store and the bottle leaks everywhere. Probably won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> smell very good but not last so long, i think is just good for the price.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected.</li>
            <li> Body spray smells good.it was on time .</li>
            <li> great product fast and easy shipping!!!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the rihanna reb&#x27;l Fleur perfume. This body mist is a lighter scent and much more of an everyday type of fragrance. I am so glad I got this!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and was anxious and happy to receive it.</li>
            <li> omg omg omg i love love its a whole lot u get for the price 8oz better than when u buy perfume n get 3 oz for way more the price the smell is awesome  i will defininetly  buy again</li>
            <li> inlove with this scent</li>
            <li> The perfume smells godg as i expected.  It is a good deal between the price and the quality. It a good present.</li>
            <li> Sexy and seductive. Smells just as the perfume.</li>
            <li> Smells Awesome!! Exactly as pictured and fast service! Thank you soo much!</li>
            <li> This smells amazing!!! I spritzed this onto my work shirt and jeans, and recieved several compliments from people and I work in fast food. When you are able to smell perfume over a fast food joint, then you know you have a good perfume!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall is the lasting ability. I feel like it stayed on my clothes better than it stayed on my skin, which I prefer a perfume to stay a good 4 or 5 hours on my skin.</li>
            <li> Nice, clean fragrance</li>
            <li> Very nice scent but too strong for me because of my allergies. I wish I was able to wear. Gave to my cousin anc she really likes it.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this fragrance smelled better on someone else than on my. Wished it wasn&#x27;t as strong, but the body mist is lighter than the eau de toilette.</li>
            <li> love the fragance like having body spray quick ship great price</li>
            <li> I really like this one. It&#x27;s a lighter - cheaper version of the perfume. Great for summer.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I LOVE THE SMELL. THIS ONE IS MY FAVORITE FROM ALL HER PRODUCTS. ITS THE CHEAPEST AT AMAZON. YOU CAN ALSO BUY IT AT WALGREENS FOR $7 AND AT SEARS FOR $18 BUT SOMETIMES SEARS HAS A SALE AND IT BE&#x27;S $10.</li>
            <li> Always have been my favorite use this for work keeps me refreshedðŸ˜˜</li>
            <li> The scent is good. But does not last long.</li>
            <li> Smell so good , and very fast shipping</li>
            <li> ITS NOT THE REAL THING IT SMELLS LIKE GRANDMA PERFUME.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes. I&#x27;d try to describe but I&#x27;m not really good at it. Suffice it to say that this is the same perfume you can find in store. Mine did not come watered down or damaged an any way which was my biggest concern in ordering. I get compliments every morning when I go in to work as well as people wanting to know what the fragrance is. It&#x27;s a little over powering when I first put it on but by the time I leave my room it dies down to a more manageable level and lasts all day.</li>
