            <li>Would have liked them delivered sooner.  </li>
            <li>The clips are nicely made and not too flimsy.</li>
            <li>They bend and break very easy.</li>
            <li>They are a nice size so if you want to use them for decorative purposes, it would be really easy to glue something onto them.  </li>
            <li>If you are using them for hair or something else that doesn&#x27;t require an iron grip, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d be just fine!</li>
            <li>The value was still better than I have found in stores.</li>
            <li>They are OK if they don&#x27;t need to support any weight, but otherwise, they will slip, despite the teeth.</li>
            <li>I love them.  </li>
            <li>I use them to attach to bows for my canine Yorkshire Terrier&#x27;s top notch.  </li>
            <li>I will get more of these when I run out.</li>
            <li>Perfect plain sliver alligator clips good for crafting.</li>
            <li>I am using these for crafts instead of my electrical projects, and the majority of them are pretty sturdy and can keep a good hold.</li>
            <li>These were the exact size that I was expecting, and definitely a good value.</li>
            <li>I am excited to use these on my handmade bows!</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and they look to be good quality.</li>
            <li>Her hair is fine and the clips work well in her hair.</li>
            <li>These clips are perfect for making little hair bows.  </li>
            <li>so I just figured it incorrectly), but overall, it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li>Easy to decorate these clips to make them special for my daughter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very useful item.  </li>
            <li>They work perfect for small bows.</li>
            <li>Nice grip, strong with nice little teeth.  </li>
            <li>Having a smooth side to complement the \\&quot;tooth\\&quot; side really helps me slide the clip easily into almost anything I make.</li>
            <li>Stay in really well, perfect for bows for little girls hair.</li>
            <li>They are sturdy metal construction, gripping teeth, and a decent size.  </li>
            <li>work great for hair clips &amp; easily dressed up with a small crochet flower glued to them</li>
            <li>These are pretty cheaply made.</li>
            <li>The amount was nice but half of them came without the pegs that hold the top and bottom together.</li>
            <li>This was very much worth the price.</li>
            <li>Nice to know where they are available in quantity for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Right away when I opened the bag, I spotted two that had come apart.  </li>
            <li>nice quality just took a long time to get here</li>
            <li>I originally tried making my projects with the two-pronged smooth clips from a beauty supply store, but the alligator \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; are essential for staying attached to your hair.</li>
            <li>so I tend to order from whichever Amazon partner offers me free Prime shipping with the rest of my stuff.</li>
            <li>exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly as it was described.</li>
            <li>These are exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>I figure the overall price is still good even if I only get 197 functioning clips instead of 200.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Either the seller needs to go back to packaging them securely, or Amazon needs to partner with a more reliable third party.</li>
            <li>They stayed in their hair well and hot glue sticks to them very well.</li>
            <li>and I can snap it back together easily,</li>
            <li>and they certainly will for my use of them.  </li>
            <li>very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clips are very flemsy and break easily.&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li>Some were bent but the quality is about what I expected for the most part.</li>
            <li>I am not making them to sell, though, so I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li>Just like the ones at michaels much cheaper will order again just wish deliver was quicker must order before needed</li>
            <li>/&gt;These clips have teeth, so they work really well.  </li>
            <li>The clips stay in my daughter&#x27;s hair, but they don&#x27;t seem to pull too much.  </li>
            <li>Very versatile that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hot glue sticks</li>
            <li>it is a grab bag filled with clips around the same size.</li>
            <li>The Amazon box was sealed only with one strip of strapping tape, which was perfectly secure for the larger items, but left gaps where some of the clips were able to fall out the sides of the box during shipping.</li>
            <li>There were only a few out of the lot that had the spring loose, but again, we still got a great value.</li>
            <li>I will say that the tops are curved instead of flat which makes it a little less ideal for making barrettes with.  </li>
            <li>originally (accidentally) ordered another product that didn&#x27;t have teeth, and when I had a hair accessory making party, we all ended up using these and not the other ones.  </li>
            <li>A couple of the clips came in a little bent, not a big deal me, but other than that, great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad they have think of compensation but the number of clips broken is higher than compensation.</li>
            <li>Either way, this packaging is a problem and needs to be fixed.</li>
            <li>They are a tad flimsy, it nearly takes intent to bend them, though.</li>
            <li>so I had to wait for these clips to complete the project.  </li>
            <li>Waited almost 10 weeks to only be able to use half of them!</li>
            <li>Therefore, I&#x27;m not even 100% sure if these clips are from the same source as my last few orders.</li>
            <li>Apparently, that&#x27;s a no-no in goverment</li>
            <li>She is only 5 months old now, but she has a lot of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the package of 200 there are a lot more clips included, but there clips broken also.&lt;br</li>
            <li>many of the clips were misaligned, which meant i couldn&#x27;t use them, or the screws were broken (that hold it together).</li>
            <li>/&gt;The clips are large enough to work as a single hair accessory, or you could put something smaller on them and use them on both sides.  </li>
            <li>These are hard to find in physical stores, at least in my area, so ordering these bags in bulk has been a good deal for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>My wife made 100 bows to sell with these and have to take all off the shelf and take apart to replace clip because these are such poor quality and break and bend so easy.</li>
            <li>The Alligator clips are made of such thin metal that they bend and break easily.  </li>
            <li>Without exageration more than 1/3 of all the clips were either too hard to open or the little spring inside just flew out.</li>

            <li> other than that they are well made, and so far have worked well.</li>
            <li> ( I thought one would be flat and one would have teeth) but</li>
            <li> of the ones that were aligned, the metal is very weak and bends easily.</li>
            <li> I understand chinese products aren&#x27;t exactly quality, but this was ridiculous.</li>
            <li> The clips have sharp ends; when they press against thin plastic it will easily give way before</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered plenty of stuff from China and never waited close to this long for anything.</li>
            <li> problem with my last order, however: the bag the clips came in split at the bottom, and when my order arrived the clips were all clattering around loose inside the Amazon box (I had ordered other, unrelated items in the same shipment).</li>
            <li> so they make it a little more difficult to my pin curls...</li>
            <li> The metal is a bit flimsy, and they&#x27;re a little smaller than I thought they were going to be (my mind works in inches, not centimeters</li>
            <li> They are as expected.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> A few were &amp;#34;sprung&amp;#34;, but only one or two out of the 200 in the bag.</li>
            <li> Came just as expected!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed.</li>
            <li> Got in a little trouble with the management down at the DMV last week (walked in with 50 of them clipped to my Kangol).</li>
            <li> In my previous orders, the clips arrived in bags that were so thick that I had to cut them open with scissors, and this bag was very thin and pretty well shredded by the time I got it.</li>
            <li> I predict that the clips will fail and cannot handle much use.</li>
            <li> I make fabric hair flowers, bows, and other little fashion accessories to sell at craft shows and online, so I go through a lot of them!  </li>
            <li> we&#x27;re already out of place, crooked, or broken.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re small and don&#x27;t show beneath my little fabric creations that I attach to them.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, there were a few broken ones in the package but not many.  </li>
            <li> We use these as &amp;#34;markers&amp;#34; in a line so that we do not have to use different colored markers which blind or color-blind people can&#x27;t see well.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not indestructible, however, and every batch I&#x27;ve purchased has had at least 2 or 3 clips fall apart.</li>
            <li> Based on other reviews I was expecting half the bag to be useless, but my single photo video shows what was bad after stacking my clips on pieces of cards; only about three or four was bad, and the rest were intact.</li>

            <li> I read the reviews before I purchased them but found no indication that they were so bad.</li>
            <li> 1/4 were BROKEN another 1/4 rusty!!!!</li>

            <li> The clips do not function properly. They open then misalign when they close. Not impressed with this product AT ALL!</li>
            <li> Easy to decorate these clips to make them special for my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing what you can glue to these clips.</li>
            <li> A lot of the clips are misaligned. Spring is just wedged between the two clip halves and not secured. I predict that the clips will fail and cannot handle much use.</li>
            <li> The amount was nice but half of them came without the pegs that hold the top and bottom together. Some were bent or smashed. Over all I woo t purchase from them again.</li>
            <li> Remember to look and make you know that both jaws of the hair pins have teeth ( I thought one would be flat and one would have teeth) but both jaws have teeth so they make it a little more difficult to my pin curls... other than that they are well made, and so far have worked well.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd or 4th time I&#x27;ve ordered this same bulk bag of alligator clips. I make fabric hair flowers, bows, and other little fashion accessories to sell at craft shows and online, so I go through a lot of them!  I originally tried making my projects with the two-pronged smooth clips from a beauty supply store, but the alligator \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; are essential for staying attached to your hair. These are hard to find in physical stores, at least in my area, so ordering these bags in bulk has been a good deal for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the most part, these are great. They are lightweight and quite secure, even in short or thin hair. They&#x27;re small and don&#x27;t show beneath my little fabric creations that I attach to them. Having a smooth side to complement the \\&quot;tooth\\&quot; side really helps me slide the clip easily into almost anything I make. They&#x27;re not indestructible, however, and every batch I&#x27;ve purchased has had at least 2 or 3 clips fall apart. Sometimes it&#x27;s just a misaligned spring and I can snap it back together easily, but sometimes it just gets thrown away. I figure the overall price is still good even if I only get 197 functioning clips instead of 200.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A problem with my last order, however: the bag the clips came in split at the bottom, and when my order arrived the clips were all clattering around loose inside the Amazon box (I had ordered other, unrelated items in the same shipment). The Amazon box was sealed only with one strip of strapping tape, which was perfectly secure for the larger items, but left gaps where some of the clips were able to fall out the sides of the box during shipping. In my previous orders, the clips arrived in bags that were so thick that I had to cut them open with scissors, and this bag was very thin and pretty well shredded by the time I got it. The clips have sharp ends; when they press against thin plastic it will easily give way before very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an Amazon Prime member so I tend to order from whichever Amazon partner offers me free Prime shipping with the rest of my stuff. Therefore, I&#x27;m not even 100% sure if these clips are from the same source as my last few orders. Either way, this packaging is a problem and needs to be fixed. Either the seller needs to go back to packaging them securely, or Amazon needs to partner with a more reliable third party.</li>
            <li> I like shiny things. Always have. And at 4.5cm, these things are as close to perfect as Lonnie can imagine. You can clip &#x27;em on almost anything. And I stress \\&quot;ALMOST\\&quot; anything. Got in a little trouble with the management down at the DMV last week (walked in with 50 of them clipped to my Kangol). Seems they fall into the category of what they refer to as \\&quot;parafinallia\\&quot;. Apparently, that&#x27;s a no-no in goverment buildings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bulk Bag is the way to go. You can use ten for clothes pins. Another fifteen for snorkelin&#x27; nose clips. And still have 50 left over for marital aids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Some were bent and broke but for the most part they were great.  They took forever to get here .</li>
            <li> I love them! Great item!!</li>
            <li> Horrible quality. They bend and break very easy. My wife made 100 bows to sell with these and have to take all off the shelf and take apart to replace clip because these are such poor quality and break and bend so easy. Will definitely not buy these again</li>
            <li> I love these clips they work great for my loc!</li>
            <li> I should have paid more attention to the image; I thought these were the electrical kind! I am using these for crafts instead of my electrical projects, and the majority of them are pretty sturdy and can keep a good hold. They are a tad flimsy, it nearly takes intent to bend them, though. If you are using them for hair or something else that doesn&#x27;t require an iron grip, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d be just fine!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1AEQXDAMXQ2UI]]This is an updated review. The clips are think but durable enough keep working for you with care; you might have to baby sit them a bit. Based on other reviews I was expecting half the bag to be useless, but my single photo video shows what was bad after stacking my clips on pieces of cards; only about three or four was bad, and the rest were intact. Hope this was helpful</li>
            <li> These were the exact size that I was expecting, and definitely a good value. They work perfect for small bows.</li>
            <li> When buying bulk clips you always face duds in the bag. This company has the best ratio of good clips that I have found</li>
            <li> A portion of these were broken and did not work. The value was still better than I have found in stores.</li>
            <li> Stay in really well, perfect for bows for little girls hair.</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed.  Would have liked them delivered sooner.  Everything else I ordered came in record time so I had to wait for these clips to complete the project.  Still very happy with them.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Nice grip, strong with nice little teeth.  Looks like they would hold up well and they certainly will for my use of them.  They are a nice size so if you want to use them for decorative purposes, it would be really easy to glue something onto them.  I think they are a lot stronger and sturdier than clips you get in a craft store.  I am very happy with them.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal. The metal is a bit flimsy, and they&#x27;re a little smaller than I thought they were going to be (my mind works in inches, not centimeters so I just figured it incorrectly), but overall, it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li> These are pretty cheaply made. Right away when I opened the bag, I spotted two that had come apart.  They are OK if they don&#x27;t need to support any weight, but otherwise, they will slip, despite the teeth.</li>
            <li> It was exactly as it was described. No gimmicks no lies. 200 4.5cm silver alligator clips! There were very few broken!</li>
            <li> Clips are very flemsy and break easily.&lt;br /&gt;Most we&#x27;re already out of place, crooked, or broken. Very poor quality. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> They are as expected. Good quality and quantity.</li>
            <li> worked great to make clips for some decorative wreaths we are making</li>
            <li> These clips are perfect for making little hair bows.  As other reviewers have said, there were a few broken ones in the package but not many.  We used these to make flower hair clip SWAPS for our Girl Scout troop, the clips held up well to crazy little girls!  They stayed in their hair well and hot glue sticks to them very well.</li>
            <li> everything was perfect came in just in time</li>
            <li> Perfect plain sliver alligator clips good for crafting.</li>
            <li> The Alligator clips are made of such thin metal that they bend and break easily.  They are so bad that I cannot use them for my project.  I am very sorry I purchased this product.  I read the reviews before I purchased them but found no indication that they were so bad.</li>
            <li> I love them.  I use them to attach to bows for my canine Yorkshire Terrier&#x27;s top notch.  Her hair is fine and the clips work well in her hair.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I needed. The clips are nicely made and not too flimsy. They are a good strength for the children&#x27;s hair clips that I&#x27;m making. There are about one or two duds in each bag but it&#x27;s to be expected. I will get more of these when I run out.</li>
            <li> they are not the quality I have bought before but they are usable.</li>
            <li> These are great. They are the perfect size for what I need and with teeth. It was nearly impossible to find clips with teeth and the size I needed.</li>
            <li> I bought these to make fabric flower hair clips.  They have worked great.  They are durable and grip well (don&#x27;t slide off of hair).</li>
            <li> We use these as &amp;#34;markers&amp;#34; in a line so that we do not have to use different colored markers which blind or color-blind people can&#x27;t see well. A few were &amp;#34;sprung&amp;#34;, but only one or two out of the 200 in the bag. Shipped promptly.</li>
            <li> These are good quality. I make hair bows with mine and these seem to hold up the best against tot abuse.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product not knowing if it was the size I needed to finish my project. I was very pleased with my purchase and would recommend and buy from this vendor again.Which I did!</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I needed. Came just as expected! Great price!</li>
            <li> Perfect clips and great quality. Only a few &amp;#34;useless&amp;#34; ones in the whole package.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T ORDER!!!! It literally took an entire MONTH to receive the items. I&#x27;ve ordered plenty of stuff from China and never waited close to this long for anything. The worse part is, once I received the clips, they were crap. Without exageration more than 1/3 of all the clips were either too hard to open or the little spring inside just flew out. I understand chinese products aren&#x27;t exactly quality, but this was ridiculous. I couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed. I would never order from this company again.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for they are perfect and dont slip. They came in faster than what was anticipated.</li>
            <li> This was very much worth the price. There were only a few out of the lot that had the spring loose, but again, we still got a great value. I will order these again.</li>
            <li> In the package of 200 there are a lot more clips included, but there clips broken also.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad they have think of compensation but the number of clips broken is higher than compensation.</li>
            <li> Some were bent but the quality is about what I expected for the most part. I would order these again.</li>
            <li> A couple of the clips came in a little bent, not a big deal me, but other than that, great.</li>
            <li> 1/4 were BROKEN another 1/4 rusty!!!! Waited almost 10 weeks to only be able to use half of them! 😡😡😡</li>
            <li> I am excited to use these on my handmade bows! Shipping was fast and they look to be good quality.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to make hair barrettes.  They are sturdy metal construction, gripping teeth, and a decent size.  I will say that the tops are curved instead of flat which makes it a little less ideal for making barrettes with.  I am not making them to sell, though, so I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li> many of the clips were misaligned, which meant i couldn&#x27;t use them, or the screws were broken (that hold it together). of the ones that were aligned, the metal is very weak and bends easily.</li>
            <li> Work great. Use these for clipping things onto wreaths during crafting.</li>
            <li> We are making bracelet aids and theme clips work perfectly for them.  Very useful item.  Nice to know where they are available in quantity for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> nice quality just took a long time to get here</li>
            <li> Love them!  They are great for so many things!  I&#x27;d order them again if I ever need more!</li>
            <li> just as ordered!  work great for hair clips &amp; easily dressed up with a small crochet flower glued to them</li>
            <li> Just like the ones at michaels much cheaper will order again just wish deliver was quicker must order before needed</li>
            <li> Oh, yes, these are perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wanting to make some bows and flowers for my daughter&#x27;s hair.  She is only 5 months old now, but she has a lot of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clips have teeth, so they work really well.  They are the perfect size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lined the bottom and side with ribbon, and leave the part with the teeth un-lined, and that seems to work well.  The clips stay in my daughter&#x27;s hair, but they don&#x27;t seem to pull too much.  She doesn&#x27;t mind them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clips are large enough to work as a single hair accessory, or you could put something smaller on them and use them on both sides.  Very versatile that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hot glue sticks well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally (accidentally) ordered another product that didn&#x27;t have teeth, and when I had a hair accessory making party, we all ended up using these and not the other ones.  These are just better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed the only thing to add is they aren&#x27;t the same size or the same clip it is a grab bag filled with clips around the same size. I would add that to the listing still what I like and needed just not what i thought</li>
            <li> Products were just as described</li>
