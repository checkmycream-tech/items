            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>I think the quality is good.</li>
            <li>It was a good buy</li>
            <li>Though, like may others have said, some instructions included in the box would be nice.</li>
            <li>Great and arrived quickly</li>
            <li>Allow it to harden completely and then attach the bottom circle cap up to close off the great</li>
            <li>If filled from the top they are inoperable.</li>
            <li>I buy these continuously; they work great and provide customers with a professional looking product.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you pour in through the bottom not the top like I did at first.</li>
            <li>Tightly secure the cap and pour your product in from the bottom.</li>
            <li>I have not had a chance to use these yet, I will post again after I have filled them.</li>
            <li>, It just did&#x27;t fit my needs.</li>
            <li>They are incredibly cheap.</li>
            <li>Put the caps on all of them, filled them with water and watched each one leak.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>And most importantly, they do not leak when you pour in molten hot product to set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are pleasing to put in your hand, easy to fill and get a professional rounded top on the product, easy to advance using the rotary dial at the bottom.  </li>
            <li>Get those bottoms on real good, or you will have a real mess on your hands!  </li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re my favorite and high quality.</li>
            <li>I had to buy a different kind from another manufacturer.</li>
            <li>I did learn the hard way to pour from the bottom and then put the cap on lol.</li>
            <li>Spend more money and get some that actually work.</li>
            <li>They may work fine for something that is already solid when you put it in the container, so I am going to keep them....</li>
            <li>these are good, however, they are hard to get the cap off.</li>
            <li>haha.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The tubes themselves are very clean looking with no scratches on them and are easy to open and screw up and down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different empty deodorant containers over the years since I enjoy making healthy beauty/hygiene products at home from organic ingredients I can trust.  </li>
            <li>The description said high quality</li>
            <li>I wasted all my product pouring from the top instead of the bottom, which would not have happened if there were instruction.</li>
            <li>An extra tip would be to make sure that you pour in enough product to completely cover the grate at the bottom so that it attaches and the role up mechanism works properly.</li>
            <li>These are the only ones I&#x27;ve consistently achieved professional results with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I see another customer recommends pouring into them upside down which I will try once I can manage to clean these up.</li>
            <li>My deodorant may have been too soft of a set up for this dial up tube.it all sank beneath the part hat would push the product up.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps Amazon wants to show pictures of the inserts so people can see the entire product.</li>
            <li>The kind of empty deodorant containers I usually buy were sold out, so I decided to try these.</li>

            <li> The kind of empty deodorant containers I usually buy were sold out, so I decided to try these.</li>
            <li> My soft deodorant wasn&#x27;t pushed up, it just went right through the bar, leaving half behind stuck in the tube.  </li>
            <li> and I think only two of them actually turn, the rest won&#x27;t move the deodorant up and down.</li>
            <li> Very thin plastic and cheap lids.</li>
            <li> These are nice containers, the only bad deal is they need to tell you before hand that you need to fill upside down, or put instructions in side the package.</li>
            <li> They poured all out the bottom, and I lost a lot of product due to this.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Need instructions that state you need to fill upside down.</li>
            <li> I thought it was odd that you had to pop a plastic piece into the bottom before you could fill them, it wasn&#x27;t until I used two of the dispensers that I realized that you are meant to fill these from the bottom.</li>
            <li> Half of them leaked out the bottom even with the bottom piece pushed all the way in.</li>
            <li> but that is unfortunately not true.</li>
            <li> Waste of my product, these went in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when I poured the liquid into the containers, they leaked badly, even though I had secured the caps to the bottoms securely.  </li>
            <li> I returned it, and purchased a solid base push up style of tube.</li>
            <li> I used this to make bug repellent bars and deodorants using all natural and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I think the bad reviews are caused by not realizing these have to be poured while upside down.</li>
            <li> never you mind that I spelled &amp;#34;deodorant&amp;#34; wrong in my picture.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I do not want to say the product is bad, because it isn&#x27;t in my opinion</li>
            <li> Boy was I mad when I had to reprint all of those!</li>
            <li> Worthless.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in these.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product.</li>

            <li> So far so good. Just make sure you pour in through the bottom not the top like I did at first.</li>
            <li> I think the bad reviews are caused by not realizing these have to be poured while upside down. Tightly secure the cap and pour your product in from the bottom. There&#x27;s a form inside the cap that causes your melted product to harden in a rounded shape like a store bought deodorant. Allow it to harden completely and then attach the bottom circle cap up to close off the great were you poured it in. I now only buy these for my handmade deodorants that I sell and they&#x27;re my favorite and high quality. An extra tip would be to make sure that you pour in enough product to completely cover the grate at the bottom so that it attaches and the role up mechanism works properly.</li>
            <li> My deodorant may have been too soft of a set up for this dial up tube.it all sank beneath the part hat would push the product up.  I returned it, and purchased a solid base push up style of tube. That works perfectly</li>
            <li> Unusable. They poured all out the bottom, and I lost a lot of product due to this. I see another customer recommends pouring into them upside down which I will try once I can manage to clean these up. Very disappointed in these.</li>
            <li> these are good, however, they are hard to get the cap off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different empty deodorant containers over the years since I enjoy making healthy beauty/hygiene products at home from organic ingredients I can trust.  I&#x27;m done shopping around.  These are the only ones I&#x27;ve consistently achieved professional results with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are pleasing to put in your hand, easy to fill and get a professional rounded top on the product, easy to advance using the rotary dial at the bottom.  And most importantly, they do not leak when you pour in molten hot product to set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just never you mind that I spelled &amp;#34;deodorant&amp;#34; wrong in my picture.  haha.  Boy was I mad when I had to reprint all of those!</li>
            <li> Would be helpful if instructions were included. I wasted all my product pouring from the top instead of the bottom, which would not have happened if there were instruction.</li>
            <li> If you had included instructions I would have given 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product. Ingredients leak out the bottom!! Going back to my trusted source for these tubes.</li>
            <li> Bought these to make lotion bars.  They leaked when I pour contents into the container.  Did not work at all for me.</li>
            <li> Need instructions that state you need to fill upside down.</li>
            <li> I have not had a chance to use these yet, I will post again after I have filled them. I am using these for homemade deodorant and I like the fact that I can fill these from the bottom. Will update soon.&lt;br /&gt;The tubes themselves are very clean looking with no scratches on them and are easy to open and screw up and down.</li>
            <li> I think the quality is good. The only problem I have with them is that the bottom is open so the deodorant cannot be poored into the container while it is in liquid state. I had to buy a different kind from another manufacturer. I do not want to say the product is bad, because it isn&#x27;t in my opinion, It just did&#x27;t fit my needs. Perhaps Amazon wants to show pictures of the inserts so people can see the entire product.</li>
            <li> These get the job done. Though, like may others have said, some instructions included in the box would be nice. I thought it was odd that you had to pop a plastic piece into the bottom before you could fill them, it wasn&#x27;t until I used two of the dispensers that I realized that you are meant to fill these from the bottom. Now that I know, they work great!</li>
            <li> Get those bottoms on real good, or you will have a real mess on your hands!  Other than that, they work great!</li>
            <li> Perfect for homemade deodorant!</li>
            <li> I bought these for a homemade deodorant recipe.  Unfortunately, when I poured the liquid into the containers, they leaked badly, even though I had secured the caps to the bottoms securely.  I ended up putting the deoderant into 4 oz jars instead and have not found another use for these yet.  They may work fine for something that is already solid when you put it in the container, so I am going to keep them....maybe a  lotion bar that has already set up.</li>
            <li> The product is as described, however, they do not include instructions to fill from the bottom. If filled from the top they are inoperable.</li>
            <li> I will be returning these deodorant containers. The kind of empty deodorant containers I usually buy were sold out, so I decided to try these. They are incredibly cheap. Very thin plastic and cheap lids.</li>
            <li> I buy these continuously; they work great and provide customers with a professional looking product.  Doctoral Candidate P. Roulier aka The Soap Maker</li>
            <li> These containers leaked out the bottom.  Disappointing.</li>
            <li> These are perfect worked great! It was a good buy</li>
            <li> These are nice containers, the only bad deal is they need to tell you before hand that you need to fill upside down, or put instructions in side the package. I almost returned them until I read that from others comments.</li>
            <li> I used this to make bug repellent bars and deodorants using all natural and organic ingredients. I did learn the hard way to pour from the bottom and then put the cap on lol. I will definitely be buying this again as I give home made products for gifts.</li>
            <li> Half of them leaked out the bottom even with the bottom piece pushed all the way in.</li>
            <li> Worthless. Put the caps on all of them, filled them with water and watched each one leak.</li>
            <li> I bought these for homemade deodorant and I think only two of them actually turn, the rest won&#x27;t move the deodorant up and down. The description said high quality but that is unfortunately not true. Spend more money and get some that actually work.</li>
            <li> Perfect for making your own balm.  Dispensing on the skin without contaminating with your fingers.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Great price.</li>
            <li> Great and arrived quickly</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t work for me, the pusher plate is not one solid piece. It&#x27;s like a cage. My soft deodorant wasn&#x27;t pushed up, it just went right through the bar, leaving half behind stuck in the tube.  Waste of my product, these went in the garbage.</li>
