            <li>:  )</li>
            <li>It took some getting used to the taste of this toothpaste, but it feels pretty good on your gums and teeth</li>
            <li>If Vicco would remove the saccharin I would gladly give this 5 stars because the toothpaste and other Vicco products that I&#x27;ve used are otherwise excellent.</li>
            <li>Tastes fine and it is being spit out.  </li>
            <li>I have used Vicco for 20years and as is the modis operandi of getting old - all &#x27;good things&#x27; seem to come to an end... of being manufactured!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cleans without abrasives, not overly sweet as the regular brands, great for sensitivity.</li>
            <li>Gently abrasive enough to keep teeth smooth and cleaned with lovely quality ingredients and oils for the gums!  </li>
            <li>I love the all natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It is all natural with a unique ayurvedic formula originally from india.</li>
            <li>It has a mild flavor which I really like in a toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I know the power of herbs and yoga since childhood because I am an Indian but lost in western world by tempting that they are more aware as they do lot of research.  </li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t aware before I received the product that it contains saccharin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t sud like crazy like the ones you buy at the grocery store, and the most important thing is that it cleans my teeth nicely.</li>
            <li>and classic!  </li>
            <li>Very helpful in reducing sensitivity of teeth.</li>
            <li>I have very inflamed gums because of which my three back molars were wobbling and the dentist wants to remove them (with other dental work which was costing me 21000 dollars) which I didn&#x27;t allow him and took my oral health in my own hands.</li>
            <li>Recommend it to everyone who wants natural products.</li>
            <li>The product works well and leaves the teeth and mouth feeling fresh and clean without the excessive minty taste that kills the taste of anything eaten after brushing.</li>
            <li>no harsh cleansers , no additives.</li>
            <li>I have more than 18 years using this toothpaste and my gums have not been bleeding like it use to when I used the regular toothpastes in the past.</li>
            <li>All natural product, feel really different after using it.</li>

            <li> Mouth is fresher too probably due to antimicrobial action of some ingredients.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste so its really not too intimidating if it is expired.  </li>
            <li> I will be loading up as I think it may not be being manufacture any longer due to the close or expired expiration dates on packaging.  </li>
            <li> but I noticed that even after brushing and flossing,  my mouth is not fresh and gum inflammation is increasing.  </li>

            <li> A couple of years back I saw that Vicco was no longer being carried at my local Coop, then it disappeared from all my usual sources!!!  </li>
            <li> I bought these in small quantity to begin with - to check out the source.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>

            <li> The best tooth paste I ever tried.</li>
            <li> Never tried it before, have always used the powder. This has a very strong taste, takes some getting used too.</li>
            <li> Love it! All natural product, feel really different after using it. Mouth is fresher too probably due to antimicrobial action of some ingredients. Was afraid after reading some reviews that the taste would be awful, but it is not, it very pleasant, but everyones taste preferences are different. I also do not have any bitterness that i started to experience while using traditional toothpastes. So glad i found this tooth remedy. Recommend it to everyone who wants natural products.</li>
            <li> Though I didn&#x27; t buy it from Amazon but still would like to review because excellent products should be promoted so the people can take advantage of it.  I have very inflamed gums because of which my three back molars were wobbling and the dentist wants to remove them (with other dental work which was costing me 21000 dollars) which I didn&#x27;t allow him and took my oral health in my own hands. After using this toothpaste my gums are not swollen and teeth are stable.  I used to use Colgate Total and I do like it,  but I noticed that even after brushing and flossing,  my mouth is not fresh and gum inflammation is increasing.  I have been using vicco for the last two weeks and my gums has been improved and inflammation is reducing.  I know the power of herbs and yoga since childhood because I am an Indian but lost in western world by tempting that they are more aware as they do lot of research.  But Yup ! I was wrong.  All american toothpastes has SLS and blah blah.  Didn&#x27;t realize that manmade chemicals can not stand in front of herbs given by nature. I am back to my herbal world and very happy with this product because its works!</li>
            <li> It took some getting used to the taste of this toothpaste, but it feels pretty good on your gums and teeth&lt;br /&gt;I will see if it comes in cinnamon, I hope that it will helps with some of my gum issues and I am going continue&lt;br /&gt;using this product instead of regular toothpaste in the future and I would recommend this product to family and friends</li>
            <li> A great product at a great price, for competing products, make sure you note the size.</li>
            <li> I have been using Vicco Vajradanti since 1993. Works really great to keep my gums and teeth healthy.</li>
            <li> My husband is using this toothpaste for his soar and bleeding gums. Will let you later know if it works.</li>
            <li> A couple of years back I saw that Vicco was no longer being carried at my local Coop, then it disappeared from all my usual sources!!!  OH NO!... and classic!  I have used Vicco for 20years and as is the modis operandi of getting old - all &#x27;good things&#x27; seem to come to an end... of being manufactured!&lt;br /&gt;So I started my search.  I bought these in small quantity to begin with - to check out the source.  I will be loading up as I think it may not be being manufacture any longer due to the close or expired expiration dates on packaging.  It&#x27;s toothpaste so its really not too intimidating if it is expired.  Tastes fine and it is being spit out.  Oh, and did I mention this is the best toothpaste EVER!!! Gently abrasive enough to keep teeth smooth and cleaned with lovely quality ingredients and oils for the gums!  You won&#x27;t be sorry.... wait - why am I sharing this information with you?  :  )</li>
            <li> The product works well and leaves the teeth and mouth feeling fresh and clean without the excessive minty taste that kills the taste of anything eaten after brushing. Best of all, the product also provides medicinal properties that help guard against gum disease.</li>

            <li> I have more than 18 years using this toothpaste and my gums have not been bleeding like it use to when I used the regular toothpastes in the past. It is a healing paste and prevents any gum problems you may have in the future. I do recommend this excellent product. no harsh cleansers , no additives. It is all natural with a unique ayurvedic formula originally from india.</li>
            <li> I have been using vicco for years because it is healthier and does not have floride. I love the all natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It has a mild flavor which I really like in a toothpaste. It doesn&#x27;t sud like crazy like the ones you buy at the grocery store, and the most important thing is that it cleans my teeth nicely.</li>
