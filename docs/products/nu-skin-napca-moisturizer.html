            <li>Please note that a Sponsor Distributor ID# is not a promo code and it should not be posted and used freely, it&#x27;s against Nu Skin&#x27;s policy for a good reason.</li>
            <li>It seems to be absorbed by my skin and works great with my makeup.  </li>
            <li>This is very light and not oily at all.  </li>

            <li>Love this product and have used it over the years.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years and really love it.</li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>I only gave 3 stars knowing this product works wonderfully for my acneskin because the one I bought from the vendor did not show a expiration date.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this cream and have used it for many years.  </li>
            <li>Love the product and hope to continue using it for many more years.</li>
            <li>I love the way that my skin feels after I use this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Love this.for ease of absorption &amp; used it for many years.  </li>
            <li>I really like the Nu Skin Moisturizer---it absorbs right into your skin with no greasy feel and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>People have noticed how soft and beautiful my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>Once done, I lightly moisten my face again and blend one more time.  </li>
            <li>Using only the moisturizer doesn&#x27;t hurt, it just doesn&#x27;t give the opportunity for the best success.  </li>
            <li>One of the very best daily moisturizers there is plus very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I lightly moisten my skin before applying a bit of moisturizer to my cheeks and forehead, then gently smooth around my face and chin.  </li>
            <li>I used it regularly with great results.</li>
            <li>Glad to get it at such a good price.</li>
            <li>and I will continue to be loyal to this brand.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many facial creams and most of them are oily and I get the feeling that my face is being covered up and makes me sweat.  </li>
            <li>and/or use sunscreen, you will have beautiful skin long after your friends have started to get very noticeable</li>
            <li>It absorbs so quickly in your skin and it&#x27;s not oily at all.</li>
            <li>Before I used this particular cream, I used a different one that also had NaPCA in it, and it was great too.  </li>
            <li>I have not worn any type of make-up during this time, and only wash my face with warm water.  </li>
            <li>One must remember that &amp;#34;needy skin&amp;#34; takes some amount of time to get better and a complete routine is what supports success.  </li>
            <li>I used NuSkin back in the early 90&#x27;s and thought it was a great product.  </li>
            <li>and if it does what it says 20- years from now I will be looking the same as I do today, wrinkle free:)</li>
            <li>and I have tried to find the right makeup for my skin.</li>
            <li>Not sure why but nobody wanted to step up and try to make a custumer happy.</li>
            <li>and It&#x27;s the best moisturizer for my face and other parts of the body that get very dry.</li>
            <li>I am 55 and get compliments all the time on how fresh and pure my face looks.  </li>
            <li>This product has been part of Nu Skin&#x27;s facial care for many years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll most likely stay with this forever.</li>
            <li>I first started using Nu Skin Napca Moisturizer about 3 years ago</li>
            <li>It is great for dealing with winter dryness and the dry air of the western states.</li>
            <li>and they did absolutely nothing because I bought it off a company on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The price is reasonable compaired to the $25-$30</li>
            <li>It is a light cream that simply works!</li>
            <li>It really does keep in the moisture.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend !</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and absorbs very well.</li>
            <li>Amazon is much easier.</li>
            <li>I cannot say  whether it works or not because I really did not have any issues with my skin</li>
            <li>Since I use Napca liquid daily, I thought the moisturizer would be adequate.</li>
            <li>i would recommend it highly</li>
            <li>I have used this for a few years and love how it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>so I would say that one container will last you 6 months so it is worth the price</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and NAPCA</li>
            <li>Before I forget, I use the PH balance facial toner first.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it consistently for several months.</li>
            <li>I am 67 years young and have been using Nu Skin Napca Moisturizer for over 15 years.  </li>
            <li>the quality is nowhere near.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the natural humectant for skin</li>
            <li>He always gets compliments on how young his skin looks.  </li>
            <li>My sister has rosacea and this cream has completely cleared up her face.</li>
            <li>I am a 43 year old woman suffering from adult acne for the last 4 years</li>
            <li>I am also a distributor, but not actively participating in building a business.  </li>
            <li>I will tell you, using this and staying out of the sun have protected my facial skin so much that, at age 56, I still have no wrinkles unless I smile really hard</li>
            <li>When you consider the cost of other brands, Nu skin is a real bargain.  </li>
            <li>and I live in a dry climate.  </li>
            <li>What if you like using Nu Skin products so much that you want to become an active distributor?</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that tends to be dry and</li>
            <li>My 64 yr old skin is very dry</li>

            <li> My 64 yr old skin is very dry</li>
            <li> I teach adults ESL, and when I get a new student, and the subject of my age comes up, they are always flabbergasted.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for over 15 years and have had long lasting results of my skin staying younger without wrinkles!!</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t throw it away lightly by signing up with a wrong distributor who we already know is unethical.</li>
            <li> I apply it very heavily and simply let it absorb completely on</li>
            <li> I have tried walking away to other products but the results simply were not there.  </li>
            <li> Bought this based on reviews, extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> For me it doesn&#x27;t do the job since my skin is very, very dry, I need a richer product, for some it might be wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I only use a little</li>
            <li> and it is not very drying as some cleansers can be.</li>
            <li> Not so heavy on my skin but gives just enough nutrients for my face.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would do the same for me, but after a few days of using it, my face broke out.</li>
            <li> It gets rid of the tight, dry feeling I get after washing my face without leaving it looking or feeling oily.</li>
            <li> In really harsh or cold weather the rejuvenating moisturizer works well if you need a little more than an everyday treatment for dry skin.</li>
            <li> That really irritates me when it&#x27;s so expensive.</li>
            <li> Maybe something is wrong with this particular jar?</li>
            <li> I still have a little acne that I need to control with a hormonal product.</li>
            <li> face cleansing gel for everyday.</li>
            <li> After using it for just a few days, my skin is softer.</li>
            <li> A waste of money for me.  </li>
            <li> A small &amp;#34;daub&amp;#34; goes along way, and a jar lasts about three months.</li>
            <li> Anytime I ordered this product in the past, it is thicker in substance, so it won&#x27;t spill or run.  </li>
            <li> We got a new secretary in the office who was shocked when I told her my age.  </li>
            <li> bad moisturizer not like old nu skin products all filler they even put a fragrance in skin product</li>
            <li> no good cuased my skin to break out</li>
            <li> I have used only Nuskin products on my face since the 90&#x27;s and have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> It did nothing for me, not impressed.</li>
            <li> Difficult to find</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed and almost afraid to use it.</li>
            <li> If you use a Sponsor ID# from someone you don&#x27;t know, unbeknownst to you, you could get stuck with a business partner you hate for life.</li>
            <li> This is fake!!!</li>

            <li> Bought this based on reviews, extremely dry skin. It did nothing for me, not impressed. I will stick with Aveeno does much better for me.</li>
            <li> Love this product and have used it over the years. Know it well as I used to be a NuSkin distributor. One of the very best daily moisturizers there is plus very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I really like the Nu Skin Moisturizer---it absorbs right into your skin with no greasy feel and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> thank you!! always best!!</li>
            <li> I am 67 years young and have been using Nu Skin Napca Moisturizer for over 15 years.  People have noticed how soft and beautiful my skin looks.  I have not worn any type of make-up during this time, and only wash my face with warm water.  I lightly moisten my skin before applying a bit of moisturizer to my cheeks and forehead, then gently smooth around my face and chin.  Once done, I lightly moisten my face again and blend one more time.  A small &amp;#34;daub&amp;#34; goes along way, and a jar lasts about three months. When you consider the cost of other brands, Nu skin is a real bargain.  Before I forget, I use the PH balance facial toner first.  I would not use the moisturizer with out it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than a year and has greatly moisturized my skin.yes i would recommend it highly</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and really love it. Glad to get it at such a good price.</li>
            <li> I have used only Nuskin products on my face since the 90&#x27;s and have never been disappointed. I have very sensitive skin that tends to be dry and this moisturizer works well for my skin coupled with a Nu skin face cleansing gel for everyday. In really harsh or cold weather the rejuvenating moisturizer works well if you need a little more than an everyday treatment for dry skin. I also use the Antibacterial cleansing gel for the body daily and it is not very drying as some cleansers can be. Great products and I will continue to be loyal to this brand.</li>
            <li> bad moisturizer not like old nu skin products all filler they even put a fragrance in skin product no good cuased my skin to break out</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 25 years and I have always liked it.  My last jar at no fault of this distributer was not what I have been use to over the years.  I purchased this product from another company on Amazon and the product was so runny that I emailed the Nu skin corporate office to complain and they did absolutely nothing because I bought it off a company on Amazon.  The price is reasonable compaired to the $25-$30 a jar I was paying before, but the quality is nowhere near. Not sure why but nobody wanted to step up and try to make a custumer happy.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  Love the product.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This product has been part of Nu Skin&#x27;s facial care for many years. While I was a distributer, (about 15 yrs ago) I used it regularly with great results. I just recently came across the product on Amazon so I purchased it again. It is a light cream that simply works! I&#x27;ll most likely stay with this forever.</li>
            <li> I only gave 3 stars knowing this product works wonderfully for my acneskin because the one I bought from the vendor did not show a expiration date. I am a 43 year old woman suffering from adult acne for the last 4 years and I have tried to find the right makeup for my skin. I found this one and it works great for my face. Not so heavy on my skin but gives just enough nutrients for my face. FYI I still have a little acne that I need to control with a hormonal product.</li>
            <li> Anytime I ordered this product in the past, it is thicker in substance, so it won&#x27;t spill or run.  I am very disappointed and almost afraid to use it.</li>
            <li> Please note that a Sponsor Distributor ID# is not a promo code and it should not be posted and used freely, it&#x27;s against Nu Skin&#x27;s policy for a good reason. Would you want someone unethical to be your business partner? What if you like using Nu Skin products so much that you want to become an active distributor? If you use a Sponsor ID# from someone you don&#x27;t know, unbeknownst to you, you could get stuck with a business partner you hate for life. I had bought Nu Skin products about 5 years ago from a beauty salon and I love it. Now, I&#x27;m a distributor and have a wonderful sponsor distributor to help and guide me to grow my Nu Skin business. This might be the business opportunity that you&#x27;ve been looking for and it may become your future and retirement income one day. Please don&#x27;t throw it away lightly by signing up with a wrong distributor who we already know is unethical.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I have used this for a few years and love how it makes my skin feel.  I have tried so many facial creams and most of them are oily and I get the feeling that my face is being covered up and makes me sweat.  This is very light and not oily at all.  It seems to be absorbed by my skin and works great with my makeup.  It gets rid of the tight, dry feeling I get after washing my face without leaving it looking or feeling oily.</li>
            <li> I love this cream and have used it for many years.  Before I used this particular cream, I used a different one that also had NaPCA in it, and it was great too.  The key is the NaPCA.  It&#x27;s the natural humectant for skin and I do believe it has made a difference.  I will tell you, using this and staying out of the sun have protected my facial skin so much that, at age 56, I still have no wrinkles unless I smile really hard and you look up close.  I teach adults ESL, and when I get a new student, and the subject of my age comes up, they are always flabbergasted.  We got a new secretary in the office who was shocked when I told her my age.  Her words: \\&quot;But you don&#x27;t have any wrinkles!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use this cream every day and stay out of the sun faithfully and/or use sunscreen, you will have beautiful skin long after your friends have started to get very noticeable lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;Karen</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this daily for 30 years.  He always gets compliments on how young his skin looks.  Great moisturizer.  Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought this and love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for over 15 years and have had long lasting results of my skin staying younger without wrinkles!!</li>
            <li> What is the expiration date of this Nu skin Napca moistuizer?</li>
            <li> I have been a NuSkin user for over 20 years.  I am also a distributor, but not actively participating in building a business.  I have tried walking away to other products but the results simply were not there.  One must remember that &amp;#34;needy skin&amp;#34; takes some amount of time to get better and a complete routine is what supports success.  Using only the moisturizer doesn&#x27;t hurt, it just doesn&#x27;t give the opportunity for the best success.  I use this product for my daytime moisturizer.  My 64 yr old skin is very dry and I live in a dry climate.  I apply it very heavily and simply let it absorb completely on it&#x27;s own. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> This product is great ! It absorbs so quickly in your skin and it&#x27;s not oily at all. I&#x27;ve been using this product for quite some time and my skin looks great ! It really does keep in the moisture. Highly recommend !</li>
            <li> My sister has rosacea and this cream has completely cleared up her face. I was hoping it would do the same for me, but after a few days of using it, my face broke out. It also smells like chemical, almost like nail polish remover. Maybe something is wrong with this particular jar?</li>
            <li> NuSkin is a great product. I Have been using NuSkin for about 20 years. Always receive compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> I first started using Nu Skin Napca Moisturizer about 3 years ago and It&#x27;s the best moisturizer for my face and other parts of the body that get very dry. I will never change products.. Hiley recomend to any one looking for the best moisturizer on the market.</li>
            <li> I have been using NuSkin products for over 25 years.  I have very sensitive skin and NAPCA is the only product I can use that does not burn my skin.  I am 55 and get compliments all the time on how fresh and pure my face looks.  Love the product and hope to continue using it for many more years.</li>

            <li> This is fake!!! It burns my face plus is too watery!!! Dont buy!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream off and on for 15 years. I haven&#x27;t found another that I like as well as this one. It is not greasy and absorbs very well. After using it for just a few days, my skin is softer. It is great for dealing with winter dryness and the dry air of the western states. Before realizing that I could get it from Amazon, I had to order through NuSkin. Amazon is much easier.</li>
            <li> A waste of money for me.  I used NuSkin back in the early 90&#x27;s and thought it was a great product.  Not so with my recent purchase.  Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> For me it doesn&#x27;t do the job since my skin is very, very dry, I need a richer product, for some it might be wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I will switch. Since I use Napca liquid daily, I thought the moisturizer would be adequate. My error...I would recommend it for someone maybe with oily skin, I am not a Dermatologist, so that will be all.</li>
            <li> I have been using this products for over 40 years, can not do without it, especially in the winter time</li>
            <li> I purchased this a while ago and wanted to give it some time for the review.  I have been using it consistently for several months. I love the way that my skin feels after I use this moisturizer. I cannot say  whether it works or not because I really did not have any issues with my skin and I purchased it  for preventative measures. I only use a little so I would say that one container will last you 6 months so it is worth the price and if it does what it says 20- years from now I will be looking the same as I do today, wrinkle free:)</li>
            <li> I like this,,,for my face</li>
            <li> Love this.for ease of absorption &amp; used it for many years.  Difficult to find so wish I didn&#x27;t have to pay postage.  That really irritates me when it&#x27;s so expensive.</li>
