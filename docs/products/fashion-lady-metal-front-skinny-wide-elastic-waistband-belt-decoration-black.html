            <li>The belt is super cute.</li>
            <li>I wear a size 14 and the belt fit just fine.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s kind of nice, but I just think it&#x27;s to big.</li>

            <li>For how inexpensive this belt is it sure looks like it should have been priced higher.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Metal is able to bend a little be able to fit to body however you would like.</li>
            <li>I wear with it with quite a few outfits and it takes the outfits to a much more trendy level.</li>
            <li>The service was super fast, I got it in the mail within a couple of days.</li>
            <li>I receive so many compliments on this belt and my teenage daughter loves to wear it as well.  </li>
            <li>This belt is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li>This belt was exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li>Very unique but definitely chic.</li>
            <li>I really like this belt a lot I find myself wearing this belt with almost everything it really makes my outfits stand out.</li>
            <li>Very on trend and affordable.</li>
            <li>The metal part is REAL metal and gold in color.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the model must be about 5&#x27;1&amp;#34; becaue this looks much bigger in the picture than it actually is.  </li>
            <li>Love the belt, you can bend the metal a little so that it lies flatter.  </li>
            <li>This is a very cute belt but the elasticity of it is for a very small waist young lady.</li>
            <li>The elastic is black and very stretchy, so don&#x27;t be fooled by how short it appears in the package, it will fit!</li>
            <li>I would be much happier if it was a smaller size</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m selling mine or giving it away if I dont wear it in at least two more months.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a little frustrating that it&#x27;s not more curved to fit your body better.</li>

            <li> It will come to you flat but bend it ever so slightly so that it will lay curved around your waist.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the money for a random fashion statement.</li>
            <li> it was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> It fits a little snug due to the tight elastic but overall</li>
            <li> Wonky clasp.  </li>
            <li> was so mad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy but the metal is in no way painful.</li>

            <li> This belt is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for. It&#x27;s sturdy but the metal is in no way painful. This belt makes any one of my outfits look instantly fabulous!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend it buying the two belts at the same time because they send both the same color I thought I&#x27;m going to receive one silver and another in gold, and I received both in gold .I was so mad</li>

            <li> I bought this almost five months ago and still haven&#x27;t worn it yet. I guess it&#x27;s just not what I expected and feels and looks strange to me when on. It was wrapped noce and everything but maybe its just not for me. I&#x27;m selling mine or giving it away if I dont wear it in at least two more months.</li>
            <li> I love it I can wear whenever I want, the quality, the color is as same as the picture, excellent</li>

            <li> I got so many compliments on this belt!!!!  I only paid about $6 bucks for this!  It looks like the Rachel Pally belt ($90 bucks)!  The metal part is REAL metal and gold in color.  It will come to you flat but bend it ever so slightly so that it will lay curved around your waist.  The elastic is black and very stretchy, so don&#x27;t be fooled by how short it appears in the package, it will fit!</li>
            <li> For how inexpensive this belt is it sure looks like it should have been priced higher. Such a beautiful and trendy belt. I wear with it with quite a few outfits and it takes the outfits to a much more trendy level. Gives them a pop! This has become one of my favorite pieces in my accessory closet. I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the model must be about 5&#x27;1&amp;#34; becaue this looks much bigger in the picture than it actually is.  I like it though so it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> The belt is super cute. It&#x27;s just a little frustrating that it&#x27;s not more curved to fit your body better.</li>
