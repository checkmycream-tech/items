            <li>This curling iron is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>The Good:</li>
            <li>I could not blink and it was in good condition.  </li>
            <li>The quality of the iron is quite good.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s good reputation.</li>
            <li>This iron was a good price and the color i wanted.</li>
            <li>But it was a good curling iron, so I decided to stick with that brand.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a $10 CVS brand curler for almost 6 years and it gave me the most beautiful curls.</li>
            <li>I have exceptionally heat resistant hair.</li>
            <li>It quickly heats up and creates perfect curls.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve am very satisfied with my ceramic titanium curling iron.</li>
            <li>Very glad I purchased this iron.</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that it is purple!</li>
            <li>I read a lot of reviews about curling irons and was led to believe that Hot Tools was the best value.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>Mine and my daughters favorite curling iron!</li>
            <li>Hot Tools is the best brand we&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li>Love this curling iron!  </li>
            <li>This size (1 1/4&amp;#34;) is perfect for medium sized spiral curls.  </li>
            <li>Hot tools has the best curling iron they get hot n create the best curls ever.</li>
            <li>As always, Hot Tools is an excellent product.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve been curling my own hair a lot more!</li>
            <li>It provides great volume for my fine, color-treated hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>I have never curled my hair on my own.</li>
            <li>It heats up really fast and curls perfectly!</li>
            <li>Nice curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Gives hair a nice sheen.</li>
            <li>Barrel produces nice beachy waves on my past-the-shoulder hair.</li>
            <li>The curling iron warms up quickly, has a great sturdy cord that doesn&#x27;t get tangled, and it does look somewhat sylish for a curling iron.</li>
            <li>It works best to get a good grip with a bigger chunk of hair.</li>
            <li>I am very happy so far!  </li>
            <li>It gets nice and hot to make great curls that stay in all day.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use for a beginner like me!</li>
            <li>So when I found this product on Amazon, and at such an amazing price, I figured it was the perfect time to upgrade and renew! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I used to spend much more time using a blow dryer and those things get so hot that I find this to be a happy medium.  </li>
            <li>My daughter and I both love how fast it heats up and curls so beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I am sure they make a version like that, and you are probably no suppose to unscrew and remove the latch on this one</li>
            <li>but I did anyway and love it.</li>
            <li>I have to turn the heat of the iron to the maximum to be able to get the curl/</li>
            <li>All in all, i love it</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for an iron that you&#x27;ll love...</li>
            <li>Love this-</li>
            <li>I still can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s taken me this many years to try a curling iron...</li>
            <li>I love the option to set the temperature to my needs.</li>
            <li>and I love hers.  </li>
            <li>I love the size of the barrel for my shorter haircut.  </li>
            <li>I think this is better for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I ABOSOLUTELY LOVE THIS CURLING IRON.</li>
            <li>I AM SO GLAD</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>But the only thing that didn&#x27;t work the best is the clamp.</li>
            <li>It comes in my favorite purple color.</li>
            <li>I love these curling iron check them out guys</li>
            <li>u will love them</li>
            <li>I love this curling iron.</li>

            <li>it up :)</li>
            <li>I love this curling iron.</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite curling iron for years.</li>
            <li>So far, so good!      </li>
            <li>I absolutely loved this curling iron for the first 2 months</li>
            <li>I love the colour of the iron and how easy it can be stored.  </li>
            <li>This curling iron is the perfect size barrel for loose curls.  </li>
            <li>WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED AT THE GREAT CURLS</li>
            <li>Overall, excellent purchase and it makes styling my hair quick and easy.</li>
            <li>(My sister in law has easy to curl hair and bought this too, and she also returned hers.)</li>
            <li>This curling iron is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>My hair glides through easily and my hair doesn&#x27;t get caught or pulled which can be a problem with some irons.  </li>
            <li>I used it on my hair and immediately noticed a strong burnt hair</li>
            <li>I love the cool tip for easy handling.  </li>
            <li>It got hot REALLY fast, stays hot, and made beautiful curls!</li>
            <li>I have medium fine, color treated,</li>
            <li>The ceramic titanium seemed to be the best fit for my thick, kind of wavy kind of straight, color treated hair.</li>
            <li>but I would suggest a lower temp for anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li>I ordered the 1 1/2&amp;#34; barrel and super pleased with this iron and would order another one if needed.</li>
            <li>Hot Tools curling and flat irons are the best...</li>
            <li>She says the ceramic cylinder is a huge improvement over the metal ones she has always used.</li>
            <li>I currently have a one inch ceramic cheap curler that works great</li>
            <li>The ceramic iron is smooth and my hair doesn&#x27;t stick to it even when it&#x27;s a day-old style with residual hairspray.    </li>
            <li>Clamp releases and closes smoothly.</li>
            <li>This is a great curling iron, this is the only brand I pay!</li>
            <li>Heats fast, which is nice in the morning.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; light flickers off/on, (the power shuts off) as the cord moves.</li>
            <li>Great product, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>My smaller iron is still in great shape after 6 plus years...</li>
            <li>It has a 360 degree free spinning cord attachment so the cord never tangles.</li>
            <li>This curling iron is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>It has the adjustable temperature control and the ceramic help keep your hair damage free.</li>
            <li>This exact curling iron from my distributor was $60!!</li>
            <li>Hot tools offers great customer service as well.</li>
            <li>I had the first on for over 10 years I love it.</li>
            <li>I chose Hot Tools after reading the reviews and I&#x27;m really pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>I used hot tools many years ago and purchased this curling iron to achieve the &amp;#34;soft wavy&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li>After using this for several weeks, I am very happy with how my hair looks - it is much shinier and healthier looking and it retains more of a natural looking curl throughout the day.</li>
            <li>After doing intensive research, on which one was the perfect one to buy, that would LEAST damage my hair..</li>
            <li>Bought this in April because of the good price and my last one died after a year or two.</li>
            <li>Love that I could find it much cheaper online.</li>
            <li>I figured my curls would be even better if I got a real hair curler.</li>
            <li>I LOVED my last one but after 7 years</li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I loved my curling iron until just recently.</li>
            <li>It is easy and comfortable to use and heats up super fast.</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair, make sure you don&#x27;t use these things too frequently.  </li>
            <li>It keeps a steady constant heat on any setting, and creates beautiful waves and curls.</li>
            <li>Fast heat up, easy to use, and worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Quickly curls my hair</li>
            <li>So much better than my older metal iron.  </li>
            <li>Im a huge fan of the hot tools line.</li>
            <li>I love my new curling iron.  </li>
            <li>The barrel has great grip, so your hair doesn&#x27;t come half way out while twisting it</li>
            <li>This curling iron heat up fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I found the Hot Tools Ceramic!</li>
            <li>The first one was purchased at a beauty supply and I paid just over $100 for it!</li>
            <li>but beware they are HOT tools!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have straight hair!!</li>
            <li>I only use the curler to make them more defined!</li>
            <li>Get&#x27;s really hot though!</li>
            <li>I have multiple sizes of this curling iron and its amazing.</li>
            <li>I was able to trash all of the old \\&quot;wannabe</li>
            <li>It forms nice big curls.  </li>
            <li>Super fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>Price is right.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length hair and it gives just the right curl, not spiral, not wa y.</li>
            <li>Stopped heating up right under a year.</li>
            <li>This iron does a stellar job curling my hair the first time around!</li>
            <li>Smooth on the hair and high heat for my course hair.</li>
            <li>Compare to other curling iron I used before, it makes my hair really smooth and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Though it does get warmer than I would have expected, which I am very pleased with.  </li>
            <li>heats up quickly will purchase more hot tools in the future</li>
            <li>You can control the temp, which is nice (just be careful not to burn yourself, it gets hot!).  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m hoping they will do the right thing and return/refund, and take it up with Hot Tools on my behalf.</li>
            <li>It heats up super fast.</li>
            <li>The temperature button is clearly labeled and easy to set.  </li>
            <li>Super fast service.</li>
            <li>but the service was very fast</li>
            <li>Curling iron heats up very fast.</li>
            <li>I like this item very much.</li>
            <li>It gets very hot, pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Gets hot, very fast, and has an extended cord.</li>
            <li>I love this wand because it is totally customizable!</li>
            <li>This curling iron is my favorite, and I have several.</li>
            <li>very helpful if you&#x27;re a novice with curling irons!  </li>
            <li>The owner of one of the hair salons I go to recommended Hot Tools</li>
            <li>My first one didn&#x27;t do this so</li>
            <li>Hopefully Babyliss will last more than a year</li>
            <li>My last Hot Tool curling iron lasted probably 10 years, which I love that reliability.</li>
            <li>First time we bought one it lasted about 4 maybe 5 years.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this curling iron, although the price is higher than others.</li>
            <li>I have been using this curling iron since first came out and will not switch.</li>
            <li>I had a gold/metal hot tools curling iron prior and it seemed to work better than the ceramic version.  </li>
            <li>I love this curling iron, second one I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>Contacted Hot Tools who said they would send me out a replacement.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a Cosmetologist, &amp; Hot Tools is a trusty brand to use.</li>
            <li>so I got the Hot tools 1 1/2 inch ceramic titanium curler.</li>
            <li>It does get hot</li>
            <li>Ceramic and a hot tools product...</li>
            <li>The curling iron is the tool that I really needed!</li>
            <li>In the meantime, I did further research and found that many users said that the purple coating flaked off and got into their hair.  </li>
            <li>THIS CURLING IRON GETS HOT AND STAYS HOT...</li>
            <li>Was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>so I need it on the higher setting to hold all the hair into the curl</li>
            <li>The tip is long and stays cool, easy for holding.</li>
            <li>I bought 1/2 size too big as they didn&#x27;t have my size so fitting too largely was known.  </li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair which tends to get frizzy during the summer and this iron helps smooth it out, without straightening it too much.</li>
            <li>This iron works great on my hair and my friends, who have thing straight hair to thick curly hair.</li>
            <li>It gets hot really fast, and stays hot.</li>
            <li>it curled it very well and very fast.  </li>
            <li>Heats fast and consistently.</li>
            <li>Holds curls and gets to a really hot temp which I need to curl my straight as a board hair</li>
            <li>The curler doesn&#x27;t really seem to get that hot either.</li>
            <li>Variable temperatures  settings, swivel cord at the end, comes with extra springs, heats up very quickly    </li>
            <li>I am not sure if it is meant to be, but I love that you are able to unscrew the latch thing and remove it completely so you just have a wand.</li>
            <li>Frankly, I haven&#x27;t got a clue about curlers, and I&#x27;m probably not qualified to provide any real information about this product.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast.</li>
            <li>Really dissapointed.</li>
            <li>I wear them all the time though and really like them.</li>
            <li>I purchased one of these several years ago, and while they aren&#x27;t mega-bucks, they aren&#x27;t cheap either.</li>
            <li>This product arrived so fast</li>
            <li>Heated up much faster too.  </li>
            <li>even do I do not use it much</li>
            <li>Pink one is better</li>
            <li>I really would not repurchase one of these</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;m writting this I&#x27;m waiting for my CVS curler to heat up because my Hot Tools curls have already fallen out, and I haven&#x27;t gotten to the top half of my head yet.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to use this curling iron, because I had bought one last year for my sister in law.</li>
            <li>This is my second Hot Tools curling iron (different sizes), and I love it.</li>
            <li>and I like to use this smaller one just to wrap my hair around quick for waves.</li>
            <li>I love how you can adjust the curling iron temperature and how the clamp is tight on the barrel</li>
            <li>I was growing my hair out and had prematurely bought it (got too excited about having long hair!)</li>
            <li>Second time I have owned one and the first one lasted me 5 years!</li>
            <li>She had great things to say about it, but unfortunately when I got mine, it didn&#x27;t curl my hair at all.</li>
            <li>Gets hot really fast and my curls last for days!!</li>
            <li>AND I HAVE BOUGHT A FEW MORE SIZES SINCE THEN.</li>
            <li>I also like how the cord is super long and has the ability to swivel around where it connects to the curling iron.</li>
            <li>It really holds up well to daily use, and it should last for years if you clean it to avoid product buildup.</li>
            <li>Time for a new brand.</li>
            <li>BUT THAT IS JUST BECAUSE IT WAS NEW.</li>
            <li>I already new the name brand, new of it</li>
            <li>I will look for a new brand.</li>
            <li>; Well, I can eat those words because right around the 30 days to return, with just moderate use, mine has developed a chip in the finish that pulls at and rips out my hair -</li>
            <li>I was in complete horror!</li>
            <li>I only use hot tools to curl my hair-</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase of the hot tools curling iron.</li>
            <li>I contacted the seller who said it&#x27;s only warranteed for a year, &amp; to contact Hot Tools, which I did, and they wouldn&#x27;t help me , either.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to &amp;#34;singe&amp;#34; my hair like the gold one did on the exact same heat setting, so the ceramic seems to be doing its job of protecting my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly!</li>
            <li>I had the larger Hot Tools Professional</li>
            <li>The ceramic seems to work better with less sticking, especially to the glue holding the hair extensions.</li>
            <li>3 months it worked fine and now its dead.  </li>
            <li>This was a gift for my 18 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>because I have just asian stick straight hair</li>
            <li>and so far, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li>but, better late than never.</li>
            <li>No problems with the purple coating so far. .</li>
            <li>After reading this, I decided not to invest in the product until they fixed this issue.</li>
            <li>was a complete waist of my money.  </li>
            <li>Saves a hairdo after a no hairwash shower, super humid day or frizz from being active.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally straight, on the finer side, and has trouble holding a curl, but with this iron I&#x27;ve noticed that my curls last pretty much all day.  </li>
            <li>I went to one of the local beauty supply stores and the price was higher and no option to return for a cash refund (store credit only).  </li>
            <li>Retail is very expensive and this was a great price and item shipped in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried different techniques, using massive amounts of hairspray, pinning them into loops but at the end of the day my hair is straight.</li>
            <li>I will use no other.</li>
            <li>Wish the iron would clamp down on the hair a little better.</li>
            <li>She has long blond hair and was wanting a curling iron that would get hot enough the curls would last.  </li>
            <li>Holding it on my hair for 30 seconds barely heats up my hair.</li>
            <li>I loved how it curls, but I don&#x27;t even use it 1 X per day and feel it should have lasted much, much longer than this :-(  </li>
            <li>If i pull my hair back when it&#x27;s wet, it&#x27;s becomes straight with some flow so this iron helped me curl (and wave)</li>
            <li>I DID LET A LITTLE SMOKE OFF THE FIRST TIME THAT I USED IT</li>
            <li>It felt like Christmas when I saw the big 1&amp;1/4 inch barrel(I have a half inch marcel iron by hot tools too.</li>
            <li>Apparently these products are not made to last.</li>
            <li>This is my third Hot Tool, one was used beyond salvation and the other is a flat iron that is waiting for my ever changing hair style to use it properly.</li>
            <li>It lasted slightly longer then when I used a ceramic Conair curling iron but not by much.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and has a tight grip on your hair-hair does not slide out.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This curling iron is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> The Good:</li>
            <li> I could not blink and it was in good condition.  </li>
            <li> The quality of the iron is quite good.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s good reputation.</li>
            <li> This iron was a good price and the color i wanted.</li>
            <li> But it was a good curling iron, so I decided to stick with that brand.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a $10 CVS brand curler for almost 6 years and it gave me the most beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> I have exceptionally heat resistant hair.</li>
            <li> It quickly heats up and creates perfect curls.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve am very satisfied with my ceramic titanium curling iron.</li>
            <li> Very glad I purchased this iron.</li>
            <li> and I love the fact that it is purple!</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews about curling irons and was led to believe that Hot Tools was the best value.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> Mine and my daughters favorite curling iron!</li>
            <li> Hot Tools is the best brand we&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron!  </li>
            <li> This size (1 1/4&amp;#34;) is perfect for medium sized spiral curls.  </li>
            <li> Hot tools has the best curling iron they get hot n create the best curls ever.</li>
            <li> As always, Hot Tools is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve been curling my own hair a lot more!</li>
            <li> It provides great volume for my fine, color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I have never curled my hair on my own.</li>
            <li> It heats up really fast and curls perfectly!</li>
            <li> Nice curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Gives hair a nice sheen.</li>
            <li> Barrel produces nice beachy waves on my past-the-shoulder hair.</li>
            <li> The curling iron warms up quickly, has a great sturdy cord that doesn&#x27;t get tangled, and it does look somewhat sylish for a curling iron.</li>
            <li> It works best to get a good grip with a bigger chunk of hair.</li>
            <li> I am very happy so far!  </li>
            <li> It gets nice and hot to make great curls that stay in all day.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use for a beginner like me!</li>
            <li> So when I found this product on Amazon, and at such an amazing price, I figured it was the perfect time to upgrade and renew! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I used to spend much more time using a blow dryer and those things get so hot that I find this to be a happy medium.  </li>
            <li> My daughter and I both love how fast it heats up and curls so beautifully.  </li>
            <li> I am sure they make a version like that, and you are probably no suppose to unscrew and remove the latch on this one</li>
            <li> but I did anyway and love it.</li>
            <li> I have to turn the heat of the iron to the maximum to be able to get the curl/</li>
            <li> All in all, i love it</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an iron that you&#x27;ll love...</li>
            <li> Love this-</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s taken me this many years to try a curling iron...</li>
            <li> I love the option to set the temperature to my needs.</li>
            <li> and I love hers.  </li>
            <li> I love the size of the barrel for my shorter haircut.  </li>
            <li> I think this is better for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I ABOSOLUTELY LOVE THIS CURLING IRON.</li>
            <li> I AM SO GLAD</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> But the only thing that didn&#x27;t work the best is the clamp.</li>
            <li> It comes in my favorite purple color.</li>
            <li> I love these curling iron check them out guys</li>
            <li> u will love them</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron.</li>
            <li> I will be sure to rate it.</li>
            <li> it up :)</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite curling iron for years.</li>
            <li> So far, so good!      </li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this curling iron for the first 2 months</li>
            <li> I love the colour of the iron and how easy it can be stored.  </li>
            <li> This curling iron is the perfect size barrel for loose curls.  </li>
            <li> WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED AT THE GREAT CURLS</li>
            <li> Overall, excellent purchase and it makes styling my hair quick and easy.</li>
            <li> (My sister in law has easy to curl hair and bought this too, and she also returned hers.)</li>
            <li> This curling iron is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> My hair glides through easily and my hair doesn&#x27;t get caught or pulled which can be a problem with some irons.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my hair and immediately noticed a strong burnt hair</li>
            <li> I love the cool tip for easy handling.  </li>
            <li> It got hot REALLY fast, stays hot, and made beautiful curls!</li>
            <li> I have medium fine, color treated,</li>
            <li> The ceramic titanium seemed to be the best fit for my thick, kind of wavy kind of straight, color treated hair.</li>
            <li> but I would suggest a lower temp for anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 1 1/2&amp;#34; barrel and super pleased with this iron and would order another one if needed.</li>
            <li> Hot Tools curling and flat irons are the best...</li>
            <li> She says the ceramic cylinder is a huge improvement over the metal ones she has always used.</li>
            <li> I currently have a one inch ceramic cheap curler that works great</li>
            <li> The ceramic iron is smooth and my hair doesn&#x27;t stick to it even when it&#x27;s a day-old style with residual hairspray.    </li>
            <li> Clamp releases and closes smoothly.</li>
            <li> This is a great curling iron, this is the only brand I pay!</li>
            <li> Heats fast, which is nice in the morning.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; light flickers off/on, (the power shuts off) as the cord moves.</li>
            <li> Great product, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> My smaller iron is still in great shape after 6 plus years...</li>
            <li> It has a 360 degree free spinning cord attachment so the cord never tangles.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> It has the adjustable temperature control and the ceramic help keep your hair damage free.</li>
            <li> This exact curling iron from my distributor was $60!!</li>
            <li> Hot tools offers great customer service as well.</li>
            <li> I had the first on for over 10 years I love it.</li>
            <li> I chose Hot Tools after reading the reviews and I&#x27;m really pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> I used hot tools many years ago and purchased this curling iron to achieve the &amp;#34;soft wavy&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> After using this for several weeks, I am very happy with how my hair looks - it is much shinier and healthier looking and it retains more of a natural looking curl throughout the day.</li>
            <li> After doing intensive research, on which one was the perfect one to buy, that would LEAST damage my hair..</li>
            <li> Bought this in April because of the good price and my last one died after a year or two.</li>
            <li> Love that I could find it much cheaper online.</li>
            <li> I figured my curls would be even better if I got a real hair curler.</li>
            <li> I LOVED my last one but after 7 years</li>
            <li> I love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I loved my curling iron until just recently.</li>
            <li> It is easy and comfortable to use and heats up super fast.</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair, make sure you don&#x27;t use these things too frequently.  </li>
            <li> It keeps a steady constant heat on any setting, and creates beautiful waves and curls.</li>
            <li> Fast heat up, easy to use, and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Quickly curls my hair</li>
            <li> So much better than my older metal iron.  </li>
            <li> Im a huge fan of the hot tools line.</li>
            <li> I love my new curling iron.  </li>
            <li> The barrel has great grip, so your hair doesn&#x27;t come half way out while twisting it</li>
            <li> This curling iron heat up fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I found the Hot Tools Ceramic!</li>
            <li> The first one was purchased at a beauty supply and I paid just over $100 for it!</li>
            <li> but beware they are HOT tools!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have straight hair!!</li>
            <li> I only use the curler to make them more defined!</li>
            <li> Get&#x27;s really hot though!</li>
            <li> I have multiple sizes of this curling iron and its amazing.</li>
            <li> I was able to trash all of the old \\&quot;wannabe</li>
            <li> It forms nice big curls.  </li>
            <li> Super fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> Price is right.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair and it gives just the right curl, not spiral, not wa y.</li>
            <li> Stopped heating up right under a year.</li>
            <li> This iron does a stellar job curling my hair the first time around!</li>
            <li> Smooth on the hair and high heat for my course hair.</li>
            <li> Compare to other curling iron I used before, it makes my hair really smooth and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Though it does get warmer than I would have expected, which I am very pleased with.  </li>
            <li> heats up quickly will purchase more hot tools in the future</li>
            <li> You can control the temp, which is nice (just be careful not to burn yourself, it gets hot!).  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m hoping they will do the right thing and return/refund, and take it up with Hot Tools on my behalf.</li>
            <li> It heats up super fast.</li>
            <li> The temperature button is clearly labeled and easy to set.  </li>
            <li> Super fast service.</li>
            <li> but the service was very fast</li>
            <li> Curling iron heats up very fast.</li>
            <li> I like this item very much.</li>
            <li> It gets very hot, pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Gets hot, very fast, and has an extended cord.</li>
            <li> I love this wand because it is totally customizable!</li>
            <li> This curling iron is my favorite, and I have several.</li>
            <li> very helpful if you&#x27;re a novice with curling irons!  </li>
            <li> The owner of one of the hair salons I go to recommended Hot Tools</li>
            <li> My first one didn&#x27;t do this so</li>
            <li> Hopefully Babyliss will last more than a year</li>
            <li> My last Hot Tool curling iron lasted probably 10 years, which I love that reliability.</li>
            <li> First time we bought one it lasted about 4 maybe 5 years.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this curling iron, although the price is higher than others.</li>
            <li> I have been using this curling iron since first came out and will not switch.</li>
            <li> I had a gold/metal hot tools curling iron prior and it seemed to work better than the ceramic version.  </li>
            <li> I love this curling iron, second one I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> Contacted Hot Tools who said they would send me out a replacement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Cosmetologist, &amp; Hot Tools is a trusty brand to use.</li>
            <li> so I got the Hot tools 1 1/2 inch ceramic titanium curler.</li>
            <li> It does get hot</li>
            <li> Ceramic and a hot tools product...</li>
            <li> The curling iron is the tool that I really needed!</li>
            <li> In the meantime, I did further research and found that many users said that the purple coating flaked off and got into their hair.  </li>
            <li> THIS CURLING IRON GETS HOT AND STAYS HOT...</li>
            <li> Was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> so I need it on the higher setting to hold all the hair into the curl</li>
            <li> The tip is long and stays cool, easy for holding.</li>
            <li> I bought 1/2 size too big as they didn&#x27;t have my size so fitting too largely was known.  </li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair which tends to get frizzy during the summer and this iron helps smooth it out, without straightening it too much.</li>
            <li> This iron works great on my hair and my friends, who have thing straight hair to thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> It gets hot really fast, and stays hot.</li>
            <li> it curled it very well and very fast.  </li>
            <li> Heats fast and consistently.</li>
            <li> Holds curls and gets to a really hot temp which I need to curl my straight as a board hair</li>
            <li> The curler doesn&#x27;t really seem to get that hot either.</li>
            <li> Variable temperatures  settings, swivel cord at the end, comes with extra springs, heats up very quickly    </li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is meant to be, but I love that you are able to unscrew the latch thing and remove it completely so you just have a wand.</li>
            <li> Frankly, I haven&#x27;t got a clue about curlers, and I&#x27;m probably not qualified to provide any real information about this product.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast.</li>
            <li> Really dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I wear them all the time though and really like them.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these several years ago, and while they aren&#x27;t mega-bucks, they aren&#x27;t cheap either.</li>
            <li> This product arrived so fast</li>
            <li> Heated up much faster too.  </li>
            <li> even do I do not use it much</li>
            <li> Pink one is better</li>
            <li> I really would not repurchase one of these</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m writting this I&#x27;m waiting for my CVS curler to heat up because my Hot Tools curls have already fallen out, and I haven&#x27;t gotten to the top half of my head yet.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use this curling iron, because I had bought one last year for my sister in law.</li>
            <li> This is my second Hot Tools curling iron (different sizes), and I love it.</li>
            <li> and I like to use this smaller one just to wrap my hair around quick for waves.</li>
            <li> I love how you can adjust the curling iron temperature and how the clamp is tight on the barrel</li>
            <li> I was growing my hair out and had prematurely bought it (got too excited about having long hair!)</li>
            <li> Second time I have owned one and the first one lasted me 5 years!</li>
            <li> She had great things to say about it, but unfortunately when I got mine, it didn&#x27;t curl my hair at all.</li>
            <li> Gets hot really fast and my curls last for days!!</li>
            <li> AND I HAVE BOUGHT A FEW MORE SIZES SINCE THEN.</li>
            <li> I also like how the cord is super long and has the ability to swivel around where it connects to the curling iron.</li>
            <li> It really holds up well to daily use, and it should last for years if you clean it to avoid product buildup.</li>
            <li> Time for a new brand.</li>
            <li> BUT THAT IS JUST BECAUSE IT WAS NEW.</li>
            <li> I already new the name brand, new of it</li>
            <li> I will look for a new brand.</li>
            <li> ; Well, I can eat those words because right around the 30 days to return, with just moderate use, mine has developed a chip in the finish that pulls at and rips out my hair -</li>
            <li> I was in complete horror!</li>
            <li> I only use hot tools to curl my hair-</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of the hot tools curling iron.</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller who said it&#x27;s only warranteed for a year, &amp; to contact Hot Tools, which I did, and they wouldn&#x27;t help me , either.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to &amp;#34;singe&amp;#34; my hair like the gold one did on the exact same heat setting, so the ceramic seems to be doing its job of protecting my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly!</li>
            <li> I had the larger Hot Tools Professional</li>
            <li> The ceramic seems to work better with less sticking, especially to the glue holding the hair extensions.</li>
            <li> 3 months it worked fine and now its dead.  </li>
            <li> This was a gift for my 18 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> because I have just asian stick straight hair</li>
            <li> and so far, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li> but, better late than never.</li>
            <li> No problems with the purple coating so far. .</li>
            <li> After reading this, I decided not to invest in the product until they fixed this issue.</li>
            <li> was a complete waist of my money.  </li>
            <li> Saves a hairdo after a no hairwash shower, super humid day or frizz from being active.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally straight, on the finer side, and has trouble holding a curl, but with this iron I&#x27;ve noticed that my curls last pretty much all day.  </li>
            <li> I went to one of the local beauty supply stores and the price was higher and no option to return for a cash refund (store credit only).  </li>
            <li> Retail is very expensive and this was a great price and item shipped in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different techniques, using massive amounts of hairspray, pinning them into loops but at the end of the day my hair is straight.</li>
            <li> I will use no other.</li>
            <li> Wish the iron would clamp down on the hair a little better.</li>
            <li> She has long blond hair and was wanting a curling iron that would get hot enough the curls would last.  </li>
            <li> Holding it on my hair for 30 seconds barely heats up my hair.</li>
            <li> I loved how it curls, but I don&#x27;t even use it 1 X per day and feel it should have lasted much, much longer than this :-(  </li>
            <li> If i pull my hair back when it&#x27;s wet, it&#x27;s becomes straight with some flow so this iron helped me curl (and wave)</li>
            <li> I DID LET A LITTLE SMOKE OFF THE FIRST TIME THAT I USED IT</li>
            <li> It felt like Christmas when I saw the big 1&amp;1/4 inch barrel(I have a half inch marcel iron by hot tools too.</li>
            <li> Apparently these products are not made to last.</li>
            <li> This is my third Hot Tool, one was used beyond salvation and the other is a flat iron that is waiting for my ever changing hair style to use it properly.</li>
            <li> It lasted slightly longer then when I used a ceramic Conair curling iron but not by much.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and has a tight grip on your hair-hair does not slide out.</li>
            <li> why I am only giving it 4 stars, is because it doesn&#x27;t clamp down very well on whispy loose ends of hair.  </li>
            <li> The curling iron isn&#x27;t anything special, it gets hot and curls hair; however, I haven&#x27;t used it much because its awkward to use on myself, and wish my old one hadn&#x27;t broken.</li>
            <li> It has soft handles for comfort for those of us that have alot of hair and your hand won&#x27;t slide off the handle from sweating because you have hair halfway down your back</li>
            <li> but when i used the curling with hair spray before and after curling the curls didn&#x27;t last that long.  </li>
            <li> just long enough to add some waves to my shoulder length hair.    </li>
            <li> Last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have a flat iron as well in this brand</li>
            <li> Have been using hair dryers and flat irons for a decade.</li>
            <li> but hey, it works on my super thick black hair and takes only 5 second holds on each piece!  </li>
            <li> went back and read the 1 &amp; 2 star reviews here on amazon, and noticed this has happened to several other people.</li>
            <li> I use my curling irons daily and travel with them regularly, and they are extremely durable.</li>
            <li> I try to do the least damage by using WEN Cleansing Conditioner (which I&#x27;ve used for 5 years &amp; will never stop using!), letting my hair air dry as often as possible and then using the Hot Tools Ceramic Curling Iron about twice a week.  </li>
            <li> Too bad since the iron curled my hair really nice.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t leave it on my hair for long...</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take me long to get the hang of it</li>
            <li> Meaning turned it on the hottest setting and held the iron in their hair a long time.  </li>
            <li> Used this for only 2-3 months then the pink coating started coming off and leaving brown residue in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have really long hair</li>
            <li> Shipping was on point and came 2 days earlier than i expected.</li>
            <li> Really no faster than cheaper irons, but definitely hotter.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased this same product through Amazon, but a different seller, in 2012.that one lasted over 2 years.  </li>
            <li> wavy hair and using this curling iron has seriously reduced the time it takes me to get ready to go out.  </li>
            <li> Actually because it has a tight grip, my hair doesnt fall out, so curling doesn&#x27;t take too long.  </li>
            <li> I got the 1 1/4 barrel to make loose waves and it does the job.</li>
            <li> If your looking for big tight curls, this is not the curling iron for you.</li>
            <li> The curls last for days also with just a little touch up.</li>
            <li> The little handle that supports the iron to stand on a surface heats up so it could slightly burn the edge of the ear if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> I have fine/ wavy hair that is a little difficult but not impossible to curl.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been looking for an iron that was small enough without making \\&quot;poodle\\&quot; hair and also make spirals.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any other curling iron experience</li>
            <li> She mentioned the iron gets hotter faster than any other curling iron she has owned.</li>
            <li> My one and only complaint and</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, coarse hair that is medium length.</li>
            <li> I have previously purchased the Gold editions of Hot Tools curling irons, but noticed that my hair was frizzy when it was humid and just seemed a little dull and unhealthy.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because as I use it, the cord gets twisted up, so I have to stop every so often and untwist the cord (not a big deal).</li>
            <li> maybe just one of those odd things with this one.</li>
            <li> However-I am modifying my previous review from 5 stars to 3 because of it&#x27;s quality.</li>
            <li> I got the item less then 5 days&lt;</li>
            <li> I paid half that</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with these high quality products</li>
            <li> Used the lowest setting due to other reviewer&#x27;s suggestions and even though I have thick hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit over a year since I bought it and the purple paint (or</li>
            <li> Of course, I don&#x27;t use it everyday and time will tell.  </li>
            <li> I use it for minutes a day-not heavy overuse.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended it to me as an everyday curler.</li>
            <li> I would say not good for the younger diva&#x27;s because of the temperature and possible burns to scalp or skin in the wrong hands.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s little hard to use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using it almost every day for the past 3 weeks and every time my curls fall out before I even finish.</li>
            <li> curling iron&#x27;s heat settings had apparently gone crazy, and the iron burnt off a lot of my hair :</li>
            <li> I think the folks who have had a bad experience with this curling iron must have treated it like their old metal curling irons...</li>
            <li> At least, that&#x27;s what I got out of the conversation.</li>
            <li> The only disappointment was that is does NOT have auto shut-off.</li>
            <li> i have thick hair with some waves in it.</li>
            <li> THE CORD IS THICK AND DOESNT GET ALL CURLED UP AND TANGLED.</li>
            <li> I have really thick course hair and this curling iron</li>
            <li> I usually turn the iron around to avoid that when i&#x27;m curling the hair strands around the ear area!    </li>
            <li> (you know what I mean ladies).</li>
            <li> It would be ridiculous not to....</li>
            <li> Not sure why the short life-span.  very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I definately recommend this product for anyone with thick hair wanting a curl!</li>
            <li> and they stand behind their products.</li>
            <li> I like the iron a lot, except that the leg it sits has already broken off and the coating the iron is already coming off</li>
            <li> day-- I showered, dried my hair, and found every end split/broke/and fried!!!!</li>
            <li> I also thought that they might be difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it stopped heating up.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I was sent the wrong size by the Seller, so I returned it.  </li>
            <li> The Bad:</li>
            <li> The curl didn&#x27;t hold in my hair longer than 5 minutes. :(</li>
            <li> Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Totally worthless on my hair</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed in this purchase!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed because I used it maybe a dozen times.</li>
            <li> I am THOROUGHLY DISGUSTED!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> heats up quickly will purchase more hot tools in the future</li>
            <li> This item came in a timely manner. I love this wand because it is totally customizable! I am not sure if it is meant to be, but I love that you are able to unscrew the latch thing and remove it completely so you just have a wand. I am sure they make a version like that, and you are probably no suppose to unscrew and remove the latch on this one but I did anyway and love it. It keeps a steady constant heat on any setting, and creates beautiful waves and curls. It is the perfect diameter and I love the fact that it is purple! Great product!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my 18 year old daughter.  She has long blond hair and was wanting a curling iron that would get hot enough the curls would last.  This did it!!!</li>
            <li> My search for a curling iron ended when i found this affordable iron. i have thick hair with some waves in it. If i pull my hair back when it&#x27;s wet, it&#x27;s becomes straight with some flow so this iron helped me curl (and wave) my hair as i would like it to be. I love the colour of the iron and how easy it can be stored.  The reason i gave it 4 stars instead of five is:  1. I have to turn the heat of the iron to the maximum to be able to get the curl/wave i want.  2. The little handle that supports the iron to stand on a surface heats up so it could slightly burn the edge of the ear if you&#x27;re not careful. I usually turn the iron around to avoid that when i&#x27;m curling the hair strands around the ear area!    All in all, i love it and i recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love my new curling iron.  I went to one of the local beauty supply stores and the price was higher and no option to return for a cash refund (store credit only).  I read a lot of reviews about curling irons and was led to believe that Hot Tools was the best value.  I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use this curling iron, because I had bought one last year for my sister in law. She had great things to say about it, but unfortunately when I got mine, it didn&#x27;t curl my hair at all. I sent it back in, and I&#x27;m still waiting for my refund.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been looking for an iron that was small enough without making \\&quot;poodle\\&quot; hair and also make spirals.  I FINALLY found it.  I was able to trash all of the old \\&quot;wannabe irons\\&quot; and settled on this one.  It gets nice and hot to make great curls that stay in all day.  The ceramic iron is smooth and my hair doesn&#x27;t stick to it even when it&#x27;s a day-old style with residual hairspray.    If you&#x27;re looking for an iron that you&#x27;ll love...this is it!</li>
            <li> The Good: Variable temperatures  settings, swivel cord at the end, comes with extra springs, heats up very quickly    The Bad: No automatic off feature, does not hold the curls for longer then 30 mins.    I don&#x27;t know if its because I have just asian stick straight hair but when i used the curling with hair spray before and after curling the curls didn&#x27;t last that long.  It lasted slightly longer then when I used a ceramic Conair curling iron but not by much.</li>
            <li> This curling iron gets the job done well! I have never curled my hair on my own. My friend used her Revlon curling iron on me and the next day-- I showered, dried my hair, and found every end split/broke/and fried!!!! I was in complete horror! However, it never did that to her hair. Therefore, we came to the conclusion that every curling iron works differently with different hair. After doing intensive research, on which one was the perfect one to buy, that would LEAST damage my hair.. I found the Hot Tools Ceramic! I LOVE IT! I curled my hair 3 days in a row with excitement! Not once did it do to my hair what the Revlon did. It got hot REALLY fast, stays hot, and made beautiful curls! Recommend it 100%. Price is right. Easy to use for a beginner like me! The tip is long and stays cool, easy for holding. Cord never gets in the way! Clamp releases and closes smoothly. 2 day shipping was also on time. Kudos Amazon!</li>
            <li> Gift for the wife. She&#x27;s very happy, so I&#x27;m happy. She says the ceramic cylinder is a huge improvement over the metal ones she has always used. At least, that&#x27;s what I got out of the conversation. Frankly, I haven&#x27;t got a clue about curlers, and I&#x27;m probably not qualified to provide any real information about this product.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is my favorite, and I have several. It heats up fast. It has adjustable heat settings which stay in place. The end of it is big enough that I don&#x27;t burn my fingers. I have natural curly hair which tends to get frizzy during the summer and this iron helps smooth it out, without straightening it too much.</li>
            <li> Bought this in April because of the good price and my last one died after a year or two. Went to turn it on and nothing! 3 months it worked fine and now its dead.  Time for a new brand.</li>
            <li> Love this- I only use hot tools to curl my hair- ceramic is a plus!</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, coarse hair that is medium length. This iron works great on my hair and my friends, who have thing straight hair to thick curly hair. It heats up really fast and curls perfectly! My curls last all day, and i dont even use any product in my hair! I recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always stayed away from curling irons because I know they&#x27;re damaging to the hair.  I also thought that they might be difficult to use.  Blow drying is also damaging.  I try to do the least damage by using WEN Cleansing Conditioner (which I&#x27;ve used for 5 years &amp; will never stop using!), letting my hair air dry as often as possible and then using the Hot Tools Ceramic Curling Iron about twice a week.  I have medium fine, color treated, wavy hair and using this curling iron has seriously reduced the time it takes me to get ready to go out.  I don&#x27;t leave it on my hair for long... just long enough to add some waves to my shoulder length hair.    It didn&#x27;t take me long to get the hang of it but, I did cheat a bit by checking out some of the \\&quot;how to\\&quot; videos on YouTube... very helpful if you&#x27;re a novice with curling irons!  The owner of one of the hair salons I go to recommended Hot Tools and so far, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I don&#x27;t have any other curling iron experience so I can&#x27;t compare it but, I haven&#x27;t noticed any damage to my hair and I&#x27;ve yet to experience any problem with the ceramic peeling off (as some others have mentioned).  Of course, I don&#x27;t use it everyday and time will tell.  So far, so good!      I&#x27;m happy to recommend it!  If you have fine hair, make sure you don&#x27;t use these things too frequently.  I have close friends who are hair stylists and they all say not to use them on a regular basis.  However, I used to spend much more time using a blow dryer and those things get so hot that I find this to be a happy medium.  I still can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s taken me this many years to try a curling iron... but, better late than never.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for perfect curls.</li>
            <li> This is a great curling iron, this is the only brand I pay! It lasted me 3 years.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I have owned. The first one was purchased at a beauty supply and I paid just over $100 for it! I finally wore it out after about 2 years of daily use. I love the option to set the temperature to my needs. It heats up super fast. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because as I use it, the cord gets twisted up, so I have to stop every so often and untwist the cord (not a big deal). My first one didn&#x27;t do this so maybe just one of those odd things with this one. I LOVE it! You won&#x27;t be disappointed in this purchase!</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of the hot tools curling iron. I had the first on for over 10 years I love it.</li>
            <li> My mom has this curling iron and I love hers.  I has to get one too.  Love that I could find it much cheaper online.</li>
            <li> Heats fast, which is nice in the morning. However-I am modifying my previous review from 5 stars to 3 because of it&#x27;s quality. Apparently these products are not made to last. I bought this in  summer 2015 &amp;  it has a wiring short. The &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; light flickers off/on, (the power shuts off) as the cord moves. I contacted the seller who said it&#x27;s only warranteed for a year, &amp; to contact Hot Tools, which I did, and they wouldn&#x27;t help me , either. I had previously purchased this same product through Amazon, but a different seller, in 2012.that one lasted over 2 years.  So based on my 2 purchases, I do not believe this product is designed to last. I use it for minutes a day-not heavy overuse. I am going to try another brand of curling iron. Hopefully Babyliss will last more than a year and they stand behind their products.</li>
            <li> Hot Tools curling and flat irons are the best...but beware they are HOT tools! Retail is very expensive and this was a great price and item shipped in a timely manner. I would say not good for the younger diva&#x27;s because of the temperature and possible burns to scalp or skin in the wrong hands. This is my third Hot Tool, one was used beyond salvation and the other is a flat iron that is waiting for my ever changing hair style to use it properly.</li>
            <li> Very good product. My wife loves it! She mentioned the iron gets hotter faster than any other curling iron she has owned. She will definitely consider sticking with this brand.</li>
            <li> I love how you can adjust the curling iron temperature and how the clamp is tight on the barrel so your hair doesn&#x27;t fall through. I also like how the cord is super long and has the ability to swivel around where it connects to the curling iron. My last Hot Tool curling iron lasted probably 10 years, which I love that reliability.</li>
            <li> I love the size of the barrel for my shorter haircut.  It works well and doesn&#x27;t burn the hair.</li>
            <li> I was using a curling iron without the titanium and my hair was thinning.  I think this is better for my hair.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> It gets hot really fast, and stays hot. I dont know if its the ceramic or what but the curls do not last, it stays curled for about 30 mins, then starts to fall out. If your looking for big tight curls, this is not the curling iron for you.</li>
            <li> I had this iron for 6 months and only used it a handful of times.  I was growing my hair out and had prematurely bought it (got too excited about having long hair!) and had to wait a bit for my hair to catch up.  Unfortunately it stopped heating up.  Really dissapointed.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both love how fast it heats up and curls so beautifully.  The curls last for days also with just a little touch up. I love the cool tip for easy handling.  No problems with the purple coating so far. . love it!</li>
            <li> Curls the hair without burning your fingers. Plenty of area to grab and style. Heats fast and consistently. Creates beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing. I have exceptionally heat resistant hair. This iron does a stellar job curling my hair the first time around! It felt like Christmas when I saw the big 1&amp;1/4 inch barrel(I have a half inch marcel iron by hot tools too.</li>
            <li> I have multiple sizes of this curling iron and its amazing. Quickly curls my hair and I like to use this smaller one just to wrap my hair around quick for waves.</li>
            <li> Works Great!! its my go to curilng iron. Gets hot really fast and my curls last for days!! And its PURPLE!!</li>
            <li> I bought 1/2 size too big as they didn&#x27;t have my size so fitting too largely was known.  I wear them all the time though and really like them.</li>
            <li> Ended up returning this. The curl didn&#x27;t hold in my hair longer than 5 minutes. :( (My sister in law has easy to curl hair and bought this too, and she also returned hers.)</li>
            <li> Great product! I have previously purchased the Gold editions of Hot Tools curling irons, but noticed that my hair was frizzy when it was humid and just seemed a little dull and unhealthy. After using this for several weeks, I am very happy with how my hair looks - it is much shinier and healthier looking and it retains more of a natural looking curl throughout the day. It doesn&#x27;t seem to &amp;#34;singe&amp;#34; my hair like the gold one did on the exact same heat setting, so the ceramic seems to be doing its job of protecting my hair.</li>
            <li> Mine and my daughters favorite curling iron! First time we bought one it lasted about 4 maybe 5 years. Now we just bought our second one. Hot Tools is the best brand we&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> Nice curling iron.  I like the variable heat setting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a $10 CVS brand curler for almost 6 years and it gave me the most beautiful curls. I figured my curls would be even better if I got a real hair curler. I&#x27;ve tried using it almost every day for the past 3 weeks and every time my curls fall out before I even finish. I used to keep curls in for over 2 days and now I can&#x27;t keep them in 2 minutes. I&#x27;ve tried different techniques, using massive amounts of hairspray, pinning them into loops but at the end of the day my hair is straight. I don&#x27;t even have straight hair!! My hair is naturally curly! I only use the curler to make them more defined! As I&#x27;m writting this I&#x27;m waiting for my CVS curler to heat up because my Hot Tools curls have already fallen out, and I haven&#x27;t gotten to the top half of my head yet.</li>
            <li> Great salon quality. Holds curls and gets to a really hot temp which I need to curl my straight as a board hair</li>
            <li> I did my research reading up on the different types of curling iron barrels.  The ceramic titanium seemed to be the best fit for my thick, kind of wavy kind of straight, color treated hair. The curling iron warms up quickly, has a great sturdy cord that doesn&#x27;t get tangled, and it does look somewhat sylish for a curling iron. It keeps my ends from looking split or frayed and has never \\&quot;fried\\&quot; them even at the highest temperature.  Though it does get warmer than I would have expected, which I am very pleased with.  My one and only complaint and why I am only giving it 4 stars, is because it doesn&#x27;t clamp down very well on whispy loose ends of hair.  It works best to get a good grip with a bigger chunk of hair. Overall, excellent purchase and it makes styling my hair quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these several years ago, and while they aren&#x27;t mega-bucks, they aren&#x27;t cheap either. They are supposed to be professional-grade curling irons. I LOVED my last one but after 7 years, it was showing it&#x27;s age, and I wanted a smaller size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I ordered, I saw reviews where people said the finish chipped after just a short time, and I&#x27;m thinking to myself &amp;#34;Are they crazy?&amp;#34; Well, I can eat those words because right around the 30 days to return, with just moderate use, mine has developed a chip in the finish that pulls at and rips out my hair - I am THOROUGHLY DISGUSTED! I&#x27;ve contacted the seller today to see what my options are and I&#x27;m hoping they will do the right thing and return/refund, and take it up with Hot Tools on my behalf. It would be ridiculous not to....so here&#x27;s hoping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am writing this today to say - BELIEVE it! It&#x27;s not the same product you may have purchased before!</li>
            <li> This curling iron is DA BOMB DIGGITY!!! Gets hot, very fast, and has an extended cord. I love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This product arrived so fast I could not blink and it was in good condition.  Excellent curling iron as I have used it for years.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is easy to use.  The temperature button is clearly labeled and easy to set.  There is an on/off switch on the side. It forms nice big curls.  I haven&#x27;t had issues with the coating flaking off, but I will update my review if it does happen.  I would recommend this curling iron, although the price is higher than others.</li>
            <li> Smooths hair into a gorgeous curl! I definately recommend this product for anyone with thick hair wanting a curl! Great product!</li>
            <li> The curling iron isn&#x27;t anything special, it gets hot and curls hair; however, I haven&#x27;t used it much because its awkward to use on myself, and wish my old one hadn&#x27;t broken.</li>
            <li> Just got my curling iron and curled my hair.  Worked wonderfully!  So much better than my older metal iron.  Used the lowest setting due to other reviewer&#x27;s suggestions and even though I have thick hair it curled it very well and very fast.  Heated up much faster too.  I am very happy so far!  I think the folks who have had a bad experience with this curling iron must have treated it like their old metal curling irons...Meaning turned it on the hottest setting and held the iron in their hair a long time.  Don&#x27;t do this!  This iron is supercharged.  Use  the lowest setting and hold a curl about 10 seconds and check it.  Increase from there only if needed.</li>
            <li> even do I do not use it much but the service was very fast I got the item less then 5 days&lt;br /&gt;when I did use the iron couple times I burned my hand it&#x27;s little hard to use</li>
            <li> A necessary tool for any woman. I have been using this curling iron since first came out and will not switch.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold curl well. Pink one is better</li>
            <li> Perfect size for &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; waves!</li>
            <li> I loved my curling iron until just recently. It&#x27;s a little bit over a year since I bought it and the purple paint (or whatever it is) is chipping. I am very disappointed because I used it maybe a dozen times.</li>
            <li> I like the iron a lot, except that the leg it sits has already broken off and the coating the iron is already coming off&lt;br /&gt;So I really would not repurchase one of these</li>
            <li> This curling iron is AMAZING! Fast heat up, easy to use, and worth every penny! I wouldn&#x27;t even consider buying another brand. Zero disappointments here!</li>
            <li> Great product, especially for the price! My stylist recommended it to me as an everyday curler. Hot tools offers great customer service as well.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is the perfect size barrel for loose curls.  I have shoulder length hair and it gives just the right curl, not spiral, not wa y.</li>
            <li> I had a gold/metal hot tools curling iron prior and it seemed to work better than the ceramic version.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to curl as well.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron, second one I&#x27;ve owned. Last a long time.</li>
            <li> The quality of the iron is quite good. The only disappointment was that is does NOT have auto shut-off. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> The ceramic seems to work better with less sticking, especially to the glue holding the hair extensions. I bought 2</li>
            <li> I ABOSOLUTELY LOVE THIS CURLING IRON. IT IS THE PERFECT SIZE AND DOES NOT YANK MY HAIR. I DID LET A LITTLE SMOKE OFF THE FIRST TIME THAT I USED IT BUT THAT IS JUST BECAUSE IT WAS NEW. THE CORD IS THICK AND DOESNT GET ALL CURLED UP AND TANGLED. I AM SO GLAD THAT I BOUGHT THIS CURLING IRON AND I HAVE BOUGHT A FEW MORE SIZES SINCE THEN.</li>
            <li> I rave about this iron to all my girlfriends!  It quickly heats up and creates perfect curls.  May not be the healthiest to keep it on the highest heat...but hey, it works on my super thick black hair and takes only 5 second holds on each piece!  I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> Love it. Shouldv&#x27;e bought two.</li>
            <li> Used this for only 2-3 months then the pink coating started coming off and leaving brown residue in my hair.  Couldn&#x27;t figure out what it was until I looked under the underside of the curling clamp. Contacted Hot Tools who said they would send me out a replacement. Too bad since the iron curled my hair really nice.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd iron like this.....I just ordered a larger barrel. Smooth on the hair and high heat for my course hair. My smaller iron is still in great shape after 6 plus years...even through all the dropping and banging I have done to it.</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron!  I have a flat iron as well in this brand and they are the best I have ever used.  The barrel has great grip, so your hair doesn&#x27;t come half way out while twisting it (you know what I mean ladies). It has soft handles for comfort for those of us that have alot of hair and your hand won&#x27;t slide off the handle from sweating because you have hair halfway down your back (that&#x27;s me)!  Actually because it has a tight grip, my hair doesnt fall out, so curling doesn&#x27;t take too long.  You can control the temp, which is nice (just be careful not to burn yourself, it gets hot!).  The finished product (my hair) looks great! Bottom line...great brand...great iron...I will use no other.</li>
            <li> Love it. Second time I have owned one and the first one lasted me 5 years! yes. Perfect curling iron.</li>
            <li> The iron heats up and curls well. But the only thing that didn&#x27;t work the best is the clamp. Wish the iron would clamp down on the hair a little better.</li>
            <li> Great inexpensive curler</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve am very satisfied with my ceramic titanium curling iron.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this curling iron for the first 2 months I had it. One day I went to use it, and noticed the tip was spinning around like it had melted away from the metal. I used it on my hair and immediately noticed a strong burnt hair scent.&lt;br /&gt;The curling iron&#x27;s heat settings had apparently gone crazy, and the iron burnt off a lot of my hair :(&lt;br /&gt;I went back and read the 1 &amp; 2 star reviews here on amazon, and noticed this has happened to several other people.</li>
            <li> This is my second Hot Tools curling iron (different sizes), and I love it. I use my curling irons daily and travel with them regularly, and they are extremely durable. Great curls at a great price.</li>
            <li> I already new the name brand, new of it&#x27;s good reputation. So when I found this product on Amazon, and at such an amazing price, I figured it was the perfect time to upgrade and renew! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy that I did, this is a great curling iron! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Cosmetologist, &amp; Hot Tools is a trusty brand to use. This exact curling iron from my distributor was $60!! I paid half that and it&#x27;s everything I wanted. Works so well, I&#x27;ve been curling my own hair a lot more! Super fast shipping too! Arrived in 4 days!</li>
            <li> The Best curling iron!!!!! Curls hair perfectly and lasts all day and night. Gives hair a nice sheen. Curling iron heats up very fast.</li>
            <li> I chose Hot Tools after reading the reviews and I&#x27;m really pleased with it.  I like that I can adjust the temperature for my hair type so I can curl it without frying it.  It has a 360 degree free spinning cord attachment so the cord never tangles. It&#x27;s easy/comfortable to hold and use.  My hair glides through easily and my hair doesn&#x27;t get caught or pulled which can be a problem with some irons.  This size (1 1/4&amp;#34;) is perfect for medium sized spiral curls.  My hair is naturally straight, on the finer side, and has trouble holding a curl, but with this iron I&#x27;ve noticed that my curls last pretty much all day.  I would recommend this to anyone, it&#x27;s a great iron.</li>
            <li> I have fine/ wavy hair that is a little difficult but not impossible to curl. I currently have a one inch ceramic cheap curler that works great but I wanted a bigger curl so I got the Hot tools 1 1/2 inch ceramic titanium curler. It does not create a curl that lasts longer than two minutes... literally. I have really long hair so I know it&#x27;s not just that the barrel is too big, it just doesn&#x27;t work with my hair. The curler doesn&#x27;t really seem to get that hot either. Holding it on my hair for 30 seconds barely heats up my hair. Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Stopped heating up right under a year.</li>
            <li> This curling iron heat up fast and easy to use. It comes in my favorite purple color. Compare to other curling iron I used before, it makes my hair really smooth and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Hot tools has the best curling iron they get hot n create the best curls ever. I love these curling iron check them out guys u will love them</li>
            <li> I actually bought this from a suggestion and I am very happy with this purchase.  I&#x27;ve suggested it to multiple people and will continue to do so!</li>
            <li> Im a huge fan of the hot tools line. I have used them for years. This iron was a good price and the color i wanted. Shipping was on point and came 2 days earlier than i expected. I would definitely recommend this seller!</li>
            <li> This curling iron is fabulous.  It has the adjustable temperature control and the ceramic help keep your hair damage free.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron. It is easy and comfortable to use and heats up super fast. The tension is absolutely perfect as it does not pull my hair when turning the barrel. I had ordered the 2&amp;#34; barrel by mistake and had to return it. I got my refund immediately after the return was received. Super fast service. Thank you for that. I ordered the 1 1/2&amp;#34; barrel and super pleased with this iron and would order another one if needed.</li>
            <li> I have the regular curling iron that isn&#x27;t ceramic and it curls great.  However, I wanted to get a larger size and wanted to protect my hair but no mater what I do, I can&#x27;t get product to hold a curl.  It does get hot so I can&#x27;t figure it out.  I ended up ordering the BaByliss Pro Ceramic.  I will be sure to rate it.</li>
            <li> Ceramic and a hot tools product... You can&#x27;t go wrong. I&#x27;m just replacing my 1 of 5 that finally gave out after ten years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sums it up :)</li>
            <li> Have been using hair dryers and flat irons for a decade. The curling iron is the tool that I really needed! The adjustable temp on this one prevents scorching. Barrel produces nice beachy waves on my past-the-shoulder hair. Saves a hairdo after a no hairwash shower, super humid day or frizz from being active. I&#x27;ve used it for a month and no hairs are getting caught in the hinge (a deal breaking pet peeve of mine). I love this curling iron.</li>
            <li> I used hot tools many years ago and purchased this curling iron to achieve the &amp;#34;soft wavy&amp;#34; look. It works like a dream. It gets very hot, pretty fast. Really no faster than cheaper irons, but definitely hotter. Very glad I purchased this iron.</li>
            <li> I was sent the wrong size by the Seller, so I returned it.  In the meantime, I did further research and found that many users said that the purple coating flaked off and got into their hair.  Apparently the coating did not last long and hair even got caught on the jagged barrel after coating flaked off.  After reading this, I decided not to invest in the product until they fixed this issue.</li>
            <li> I had the larger Hot Tools Professional and it was great, just wouldn&#x27;t turn on one day.  Stuck in the Off position.  But it was a good curling iron, so I decided to stick with that brand.  This one does not get to the temperature as advertised.  I have really thick course hair and this curling iron was a complete waist of my money.  I will look for a new brand.</li>
            <li> Wife  loves it....Best EVER!!!!!!!! I bought the gold &amp; tormouline coated. Both work equally as well. I bought one for upstairs and one for downstairs.....You cannot go wrong with these high quality products</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite curling iron for years. It provides great volume for my fine, color-treated hair. It really holds up well to daily use, and it should last for years if you clean it to avoid product buildup.</li>
            <li> I purchased this curling iron on June 1, 2014, and it died on March 28, 2015.  I loved how it curls, but I don&#x27;t even use it 1 X per day and feel it should have lasted much, much longer than this :-(  I don&#x27;t leave it on except when I&#x27;m heating it up and using it.  Not sure why the short life-span.  very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I ordered. 1 1/4&amp;#34; curling iron but received a 2 inch. Totally worthless on my hair so I just feel swindled.</li>
            <li> THIS CURLING IRON GETS HOT AND STAYS HOT...WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED AT THE GREAT CURLS THIS IRON PRODUCES.  WOULD BUY ANOTHER ONE IN A DIFFERENT SIZE</li>
            <li> Was exactly as described. It heats up fast and has a tight grip on your hair-hair does not slide out. The best curling iron I have found</li>
            <li> As always, Hot Tools is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I like this item very much. I accidentally bought this item instead of the thicker curling iron so I ended up purchasing that too. I still use this to touch up my curls. Te quality is great, nonetheless.</li>
            <li> This is a great curling iron. I got the 1 1/4 barrel to make loose waves and it does the job. Get&#x27;s really hot though! I have thicker hair so I need it on the higher setting to hold all the hair into the curl but I would suggest a lower temp for anyone with fine hair.</li>
