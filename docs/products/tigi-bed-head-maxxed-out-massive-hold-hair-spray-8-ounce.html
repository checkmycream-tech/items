            <li>No, it doesn&#x27;t hold quite as well as my beloved Lanza product, but its hold is much better than the others I had tried.  </li>
            <li>but this really is the best holding hairspray in the world!  </li>
            <li>it didnt hold my hair as good as cheap spray!  </li>
            <li>This hairspray works great with the right amount of hold without being tacky.</li>

            <li>I wear my hair short and kind of spiky and this stuff works great!</li>

            <li>My daughter said they don&#x27;t make this any more</li>
            <li>I was spoiled by Lanza&#x27;s wonderful hair spray Total Recall, which they discontinued.  </li>

            <li>This pump is the best delivering every last drop of this product.</li>

            <li>this is my favorite brand of hairspray.  </li>
            <li>Have used this for a long time and love it!!!</li>
            <li>smells like grapefruit and isn&#x27;t so strong that people around you would object.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My fine hair drives me nuts as it never stays in place and always blowing around</li>
            <li>I have tried many hairsprays, but none that are as gently powerful as Maxxed Out.</li>
            <li>Great for those hold for thos spikey, short hairdo&#x27;s</li>
            <li>It has a great scent to it and the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It does give me a little more of a crispy feeling in my hair than I like in my hairspray but the hold is great</li>
            <li>i was surprised this product didnt work better!  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it for anyone who wants great hold without the helmet-head.</li>
            <li>Works great and does not weight your hair down</li>
            <li>This hair spray works very good to hold my naturally curly hair after I put product in it and dry it.</li>
            <li>It really holds my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Smells great, isn&#x27;t sticky, and doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling stiff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells a bit like grapefruit, its easy to use but clogs up after a few uses (run under warm water)</li>
            <li>I have very fine and straight hair and so most hairsprays just weigh it down.</li>
            <li>Sty;e first before spraying.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper that what I used to pay at my salon!</li>
            <li>holds pretty well.</li>
            <li>Also works great for thick hair.</li>
            <li>i will buy again - thanks!</li>
            <li>When I brush my hair out, it feels soft, silky and as clean as when I washed it.</li>
            <li>Luckily, we have the old bottle, and use this one as just a refill product container.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something to help my large curls stay in place.</li>
            <li>It really holds and does leave a flaky residue.</li>
            <li>Really does hold your hair in place.  </li>
            <li>I have come to really like this hair spray.  </li>
            <li>and I really do like it.  </li>
            <li>This one works really well.  </li>
            <li>and the price is reasonable for the quality of the product.</li>
            <li>My family loves this hairspray so much we do the subscribe &amp; save monthly</li>
            <li>waste of money, makes my hair frizzy super frizzy ;l won&#x27;t take it even for free</li>
            <li>The salons stopped carrying it where i live!</li>
            <li>I always get it exactly as expected very quickly</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>I have used this for years and do highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and will buy again.</li>
            <li>She is a dancer and needs a strong hair spray for her bun and other hairstyles.  </li>
            <li>Great for people with long or thick hair that easily looses curl due to the weight.</li>
            <li>product doesnt live up to that</li>
            <li>One quick spritz and it holds my hair much longer than any other hair spray</li>
            <li>This product has really helped the blowout look last MUCH longer.</li>
            <li>And I am being generous with the two (2) stars, because I have used this company before for the exact same product with no trouble.</li>
            <li>Also, my hair is not stiff and sticky.</li>
            <li>The only exception is when it&#x27;s a very humid or rainy day.</li>
            <li>It smells really good &amp; has a medium to heavy hold but not too heavy for fine thin hair.</li>
            <li>I have searched high and low to find a non-aerosol hairspray that actually works and this is it!</li>
            <li>When I could no longer find the Total Recall, I went on the search, reading review after review on several different products that looked promising.  </li>
            <li>That being said, be careful not to use too much (unless you&#x27;ve got a prom-like updo)</li>
            <li>and I have fine, hard to hold hair!</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair and to mist my hair before each roller helped creat volume.</li>
            <li>I use this very sparingly and it holds what little curl</li>

            <li> I use this very sparingly and it holds what little curl</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other firm hold hairsprays that made my hair feel stiff, dry and flat.  </li>
            <li> Bed head holds my hair in place all day long.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll be careful next time</li>
            <li> I like it because it doesn&#x27;t dry out and look crusty.</li>
            <li> I was used to a pump spray, not aerosol, and I tried a few different ones that I didn&#x27;t like at all, but then after reading the reviews for TIGI Bed Head Maxxed Out Massive Hold Hair Spray, I bought it...</li>
            <li> I curled my hair spraying first, not great hold.</li>
            <li> Be careful.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair spray, must be used sparingly but it doesn&#x27;t make my hair dirty or stiff.  </li>
            <li> When it comes to this product, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> smelled different and it has very little holding</li>
            <li> I can comb or brush through my hair without pulling and tugging like what happens with the other super-hold hair sprays.</li>
            <li> It is not so heavy when you spray it  to your hair</li>
            <li> and I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> Have used it for a few years.</li>
            <li> Your hair will be stiff and won&#x27;t want to be disturbed.  </li>
            <li> This product holds well, but doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel stiff.</li>
            <li> This product kept my bangs out of my face all day without feeling stiff or sticky.  </li>
            <li> The hair spray itself smells fantastic and holds spiky hair without making it painful to touch!</li>
            <li> I am not sure I would buy again, though.  </li>
            <li> waste of money!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for at least 10 years.  </li>
            <li> Curled and THEN sprayed, not great hold.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> My favorite and on one I use</li>
            <li> This product was great when rolling my hair with the rollers.  I have fine, thin hair and to mist my hair before each roller helped creat volume. Great product.</li>
            <li> The smell of this hairspray is awesome! It really holds and does leave a flaky residue. Love Bedhead products. :)</li>
            <li> Bed head holds my hair in place all day long.  It is not sticky at all, but you can feel it in your hair if you touch it.  It has a great scent to it and the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray.  It really holds my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Wife Love&#x27;s it. When she is satisfied I am satisfied. HA</li>
            <li> My fine hair drives me nuts as it never stays in place and always blowing around and this spray holds it with out my hair looking like a helmet.</li>
            <li> Be careful. Your hair won&#x27;t move after spraying !! Sty;e first before spraying. A Hurricaine couldn&#x27;t move it  after you&#x27;ve sprayed</li>
            <li> Received and and works as promised and described!</li>
            <li> Works great and does not weight your hair down</li>
            <li> So much cheaper that what I used to pay at my salon! Great for curly hair and it smells good too.</li>
            <li> holds pretty well. The scent is so fruity. I hope my hair doesn&#x27;t smell like that once it dries.</li>
            <li> I have a bottle that I carry with me to the gym. I use it at 6:00am and it last all day. I like it because it doesn&#x27;t dry out and look crusty. It actually keeps my hair spiky even after a night of sleep, at 3:30 am I want to look half way decent at the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like grapefruit and isn&#x27;t so strong that people around you would object.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using a products from Aveda for the last 8 years but the price has increased and I started having second thoughts on spend $18 bucks for it. Plus, the Firmata smelled like bug spray.</li>
            <li> waste of money, makes my hair frizzy super frizzy ;l won&#x27;t take it even for free</li>
            <li> I have searched high and low to find a non-aerosol hairspray that actually works and this is it! Also, my hair is not stiff and sticky. HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> This hairspray is excellent! Smells great, isn&#x27;t sticky, and doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling stiff.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair spray, must be used sparingly but it doesn&#x27;t make my hair dirty or stiff.  Only one I buy.....and I am fussy.</li>
            <li> Love this product, have already reordered!!!  great hold without looking like a helmet head!!!</li>
            <li> This hairspray works great with the right amount of hold without being tacky. It smells GREAT! Reminds me of a grapefruit type of smell. I have used this for years and do highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> great product, smells good, holds my hair leaving my hair shiny, would reccomend to anybody trying to accomplish a perfect up do</li>
            <li> To say that something will have Massive Hold, keeping your hairstyle frozen in place to the Maxx is a lofty claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product doesnt live up to that claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells a bit like grapefruit, its easy to use but clogs up after a few uses (run under warm water) I curled my hair spraying first, not great hold. Curled and THEN sprayed, not great hold. I wouldnt buy this again.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  The fragrance is awesome and it holds very well.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Great price great product!</li>
            <li> I am using this for 10 years. It smells so great and it is so nice. It is not so heavy when you spray it  to your hair and I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> My daughter said they don&#x27;t make this any more and it was what I used for years</li>
            <li> Really does hold your hair in place.  Your hair will be stiff and won&#x27;t want to be disturbed.  I am not sure I would buy again, though.  Does have a nice smell, however.</li>
            <li> I have come to really like this hair spray.  I was spoiled by Lanza&#x27;s wonderful hair spray Total Recall, which they discontinued.  I was heartbroken because I had been a Lanza customer for over 20 years.  When I could no longer find the Total Recall, I went on the search, reading review after review on several different products that looked promising.  I was used to a pump spray, not aerosol, and I tried a few different ones that I didn&#x27;t like at all, but then after reading the reviews for TIGI Bed Head Maxxed Out Massive Hold Hair Spray, I bought it...and I really do like it.  No, it doesn&#x27;t hold quite as well as my beloved Lanza product, but its hold is much better than the others I had tried.  Plus, the smell was very pleasant and nice.  I like the lacquer, mega hold that a lot of hair sprays no longer have.  I don&#x27;t use the hair spray all over my hair, just on my bangs to hold them in place and this stuff works.  I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> this is the worlds best hairspray... it holds yet moves, it smells great and washes out easiy.  Nothing I have tried tops it.</li>
            <li> Nice &amp;#34;extra hold&amp;#34; hair spray - nice aroma!</li>
            <li> I have tried many hairsprays, but none that are as gently powerful as Maxxed Out. This product holds well, but doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel stiff. I can comb or brush through my hair without pulling and tugging like what happens with the other super-hold hair sprays. I would definitely recommend it for anyone who wants great hold without the helmet-head.</li>
            <li> Awesome hairspray - My go to hair product!!</li>
            <li> When it comes to this product, a little goes a long way. One quick spritz and it holds my hair much longer than any other hair spray and I have fine, hard to hold hair!</li>
            <li> Was already familiar with it; smells great, good hold.  Got a good deal.</li>
            <li> Have used it for a few years. It holds your hair without being sticky. Good product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other firm hold hairsprays that made my hair feel stiff, dry and flat.  This one works really well.  It holds without drying and has a pleasant fragrance.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This hairspray is great. I have very fine and straight hair and so most hairsprays just weigh it down. I use this very sparingly and it holds what little curl I can get my hair to do. The only exception is when it&#x27;s a very humid or rainy day. Nothing holds my hair then.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray. I can never find it in my hair salon anymore, and it&#x27;s not at Target with the rest of the Bedhead line, so I get it on Amazon. I always get it exactly as expected very quickly and the price is reasonable for the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> love this hair spray has a great smell. I wont use anything but bed head items on my hair these days</li>
            <li> This pump is the best delivering every last drop of this product. The hair spray itself smells fantastic and holds spiky hair without making it painful to touch!</li>
            <li> My family loves this hairspray so much we do the subscribe &amp; save monthly so we don&#x27;t run out! It smells really good &amp; has a medium to heavy hold but not too heavy for fine thin hair. Also works great for thick hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this hairspray before, but this time you could tell it had not been stored properly.&lt;br /&gt;it smelled different and it has very little holding power.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be careful next time I order</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to help my large curls stay in place. I found a great larger barreled curing iron that gave me a great blow out look, but it was falling in a matter of minutes. This product has really helped the blowout look last MUCH longer. It does give me a little more of a crispy feeling in my hair than I like in my hairspray but the hold is great so I don&#x27;t mind. It also smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> I have bangs to the side that are constantly falling in my eyes.  This product kept my bangs out of my face all day without feeling stiff or sticky.  When I brush my hair out, it feels soft, silky and as clean as when I washed it.</li>
            <li> The two (2) stars is for the spray bottle not the hairspray itself. And I am being generous with the two (2) stars, because I have used this company before for the exact same product with no trouble. The spray head is/was defective and does not spray. When primed and pumped the spray does not make it to the spray head, so nothing comes out. Luckily, we have the old bottle, and use this one as just a refill product container.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used to use this product, and I still love it. Great for those hold for thos spikey, short hairdo&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I could not imagine life without this hairspray!  Well, just kidding about that, but this really is the best holding hairspray in the world!  I have been using it for at least 10 years.  I wear my hair short and kind of spiky and this stuff works great!</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for someone, and I love the product. Way cheaper than it is in stores.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite brand of hairspray.  i was very pleased with the purchase!  i will buy again - thanks!</li>
            <li> This hair spray works very good to hold my naturally curly hair after I put product in it and dry it.</li>
            <li> Great for people with long or thick hair that easily looses curl due to the weight. This stuff holds your hair in place for the entire day. That being said, be careful not to use too much (unless you&#x27;ve got a prom-like updo) otherwise your hair will feel like cement.</li>
            <li> Best hair spray ever!  I have fine hair and it holds it in place all day!  Always order a case at a time.. No tax no shipping</li>
            <li> I have been buying this for my daughter for years.  She is a dancer and needs a strong hair spray for her bun and other hairstyles.  Highly recommend and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Have used this for a long time and love it!!! The salons stopped carrying it where i live!</li>
            <li> i was surprised this product didnt work better!  it didnt hold my hair as good as cheap spray!  waste of money!</li>
