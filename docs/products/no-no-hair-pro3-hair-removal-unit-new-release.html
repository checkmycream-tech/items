    <ol>

            <li>excellent product best yet!</li>
            <li>and she said it is great</li>
            <li>lol I rather shave thankyou</li>
            <li>I am not too happy about that.  </li>
            <li>so I would not have to spend my own hard-earned money!</li>
            <li>I would love this product to be excellent because I have researched reviews of the no no for years hoping it has improved.</li>
            <li>did not have good result  from it</li>
            <li>Vender made good on it.</li>
            <li>does good on peach fuzz.</li>
            <li>Oh, and good luck trying to return it.  </li>
            <li>Unit arrived in good condition however it does not work quite like the advertisements on TV etc.</li>
            <li>no, no not too good, had to return it.</li>
            <li>work nice and good</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t liked the NO NO Pro3 Hair Removal Burning Hair</li>
            <li>I  excited thought it was going to be great</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll gladly pay my wax lady, I appreciate her more now!</li>
            <li>I sincerely appreciate the reviews and based on them WILL NOT buy this product for my wife&#x27;s Christmas present.&lt;br</li>
            <li>spends WAYYYY more money on advertising than on the product</li>
            <li>Like many others said, I wasn&#x27;t sure what it WAS doing.</li>
            <li>This happened a couple more times in the bikini area too.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>We followed the instructions to the letter and we couldn&#x27;t be more disapointed.</li>
            <li>Ha :)</li>
            <li>I love it/</li>
            <li>If you enjoy the smell of burnt hair then you will love it.</li>
            <li>Works great doesn&#x27;t work like you think it would , you really have to use it very single day in rode for it to work, but if you keep it up its an awesome product, don&#x27;t really need the buffer or the cream in order for it to work</li>
            <li>But it works for me, may be because I have fine hair?</li>
            <li>Save the huge price tag and invest in razors.  </li>
            <li>I suffer from light hirsutism (side effect of PCOS---on my chest and neck).</li>
            <li>It has been replaced with some cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li>If you compare to the nono 8800- run your finger along the plastic or as in the direction your face would, the 8800 is smooth,</li>
            <li>The pro 3 is like taking a cheap disposable razor on your face.  </li>
            <li>so you have to shave anyway if you want a clean</li>
            <li>After reading ALL the reviews I decided that its not such a good product after all.</li>
            <li>It really does not do a very close job of removing hair or maybe I just need more practice.  </li>
            <li>but well worth it and no burning hair.</li>
            <li>I returned the product then had a real issue getting a full refund......</li>
            <li>last time I received this I used it one year and was going to try this one because I was informed it had more power because it was the pro</li>
            <li>Thankfully a wealthy relative purchased this gift for me</li>
            <li>they go by when it was PURCHASED, not by when it was actually first USED,</li>
            <li>You will be much happier!</li>
            <li>I would buy again Thanks</li>
            <li>A real rip off.  </li>
            <li>It really don&#x27;t work like they say it would save your money.</li>
            <li>Just go to your dermatologist if you want real hair removal.</li>
            <li>Too much money for what it does.</li>
            <li>Second, it is finicky to use and often does nothing (you can tell because the light is not flashing).</li>
            <li>Third, it works only on very fine practically invisible hair.  </li>
            <li>bought the product on a special discount using the promo on the TV commercial.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s visible, but its NOT thick.</li>
            <li>They are very STRICT about their return policy, even though I used it for nearly 60 days, guess what...</li>
            <li>(smell of burnt hair, is normal it says) ?</li>
            <li>too new to rate-</li>
            <li>The new item came in..........</li>
            <li>Last time I buy something without reviewing it first.</li>
            <li>so it comes off easyer if you watch the advertisement it shows a man run the no no on his arm and a large patch of hair was gone when in fact that will never happen if you ran it on your arm in the same place for 45 days</li>
            <li>I just sent mine back to much money</li>
            <li>Please do not waste your money or your time on this product.</li>
            <li>It makes you look old and doesn&#x27;t remove the hair period.</li>
            <li>I ordered through the company direct, so nothing against Amazon or anything.  </li>
            <li>no drag.  </li>
            <li>It burns away the hair as well or even better, but that plastic is irritating.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a new, more expensive product on the market.</li>
            <li>Apparently it takes a while for the hair to come off and it grows back sooner than the box said it does.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t waste your money, because you are better off using a dull razor pulled out of a dumpster.</li>

            <li> It makes you look old and doesn&#x27;t remove the hair period.</li>
            <li> I ordered through the company direct, so nothing against Amazon or anything.  </li>

            <li> I was not sure I should get this after so many negative reviews, and planning to return it...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a piece of crap does not work good at all</li>
            <li> So I had to smell burnt hair for that long to see ZERO results and it took almost 2 months to be refunded!</li>
            <li> First, to get any sort of results you need to spend a lot (and I mean a LOT!)</li>
            <li> The reason it takes a lot of time is that not only because the working tip covers a small area but because you need to swipe multiple times because it does not work every time and when it works it does not treat every hair.</li>
            <li> hate it so much!!!!!</li>
            <li> All it tries to do is burn some of the hair.  </li>
            <li> Poor build quality and all it really does is make a lot of noise.</li>
            <li> The plastic that runs along your face to help keep it upright has a lot of drag.  </li>
            <li> so &amp;#34;sorry, we cannot refund anything&amp;#34;  Extremely dissatisfied.  </li>
            <li> was not a good product for my tough hair am going to send it back and get my money back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Apparently, whoever makes No No (a very appropriate name now that I&#x27;m an informed consumer)</li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY,</li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME, USE A RAZOR</li>
            <li> Not filled my expectations</li>
            <li> maybe a few hairs here or there.</li>
            <li> Its not cheap either, but it doesn&#x27;t work PERIOD.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a poor product that doesn&#x27;t do what they say and edeals does not honor the money back guarantee</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it was false advertisement on the commercial</li>
            <li> After Three sessions, the wide tip is broken, I have BURNS on my legs &amp; face</li>
            <li> of time on each small area.</li>
            <li> given how false the other claims were.</li>
            <li> Hard to use&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> Usually it is a friend of the seller and write false reviews for their friends.</li>
            <li> So sorry I did not write down the name... but go and get that instead.</li>
            <li> This is not a good product.</li>
            <li> it was very hard for me to operate</li>
            <li> waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> Crap product, DOES NOT WORK, its that simple.  </li>
            <li> I am not happy.</li>
            <li> Took a lot of time to produce poor results&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like this product, falsely advertised.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of a product!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Return process was difficult</li>
            <li> My hair there is VERY thin..</li>
            <li> However, it is an expensive purchase, but I hate shaving or waxing</li>
            <li> But what DID happen is that a couple of the hairs that it did succeed in burning off (or maybe broke off) became these horrible ingrown hairs worse than I&#x27;ve ever had in my life.</li>
            <li> was so disappointed</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY, THIS MADE IN CHINA GARBAGE DOES NOTHING TO REMOVE HAIR , I WISH AMAZON WOULD STOP SELLING MADE IN CHINA TRASH</li>
            <li> No No! It removed no hair!</li>
            <li> I just got this. I was not sure I should get this after so many negative reviews, and planning to return it... But it works for me, may be because I have fine hair? However, it is an expensive purchase, but I hate shaving or waxing so I am keeping it.</li>
            <li> The  no no pro do not work for me,I wanted  to stop  citing  myself  when shaving .I  did not have good result  from it</li>
            <li> I sincerely appreciate the reviews and based on them WILL NOT buy this product for my wife&#x27;s Christmas present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, whoever makes No No (a very appropriate name now that I&#x27;m an informed consumer) spends WAYYYY more money on advertising than on the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Guys!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kim in GA</li>
            <li> Did not work for me.  Vender made good on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen this advertised on TV a lot; so I thought I would order one for my wife. After reading ALL the reviews I decided that its not such a good product after all. My advice would be &amp;#34;Save your money&amp;#34;. &amp;#34;Shave it off&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> very dangerous, burned skin</li>
            <li> I read and reviewed the instructions numerous times. Like many others said, I wasn&#x27;t sure what it WAS doing. Yes, you can smell burning hair and even after weeks of using, I saw no difference from shaving. But what DID happen is that a couple of the hairs that it did succeed in burning off (or maybe broke off) became these horrible ingrown hairs worse than I&#x27;ve ever had in my life. One in the middle of my cheek and one on the jaw line! They looked like the pimples from h-*-L-L. This happened a couple more times in the bikini area too. I promptly mailed it back!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll gladly pay my wax lady, I appreciate her more now!</li>
            <li> It really does not do a very close job of removing hair or maybe I just need more practice.  I&#x27;ll keep trying.</li>
            <li> it would take forever to do legs i only use it for facial hair and if that is to course it won&#x27;t work,</li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME, USE A RAZOR</li>
            <li> The product didn&#x27;t work. I was informed that there is a&amp;#34; restocking fee&amp;#34; &amp; return shipping costs that are deducted/added on. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!/ WASTE OF YOUR MONEY!!!!!!</li>
            <li> was not a good product for my tough hair am going to send it back and get my money back. does good on peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> too new to rate- last time I received this I used it one year and was going to try this one because I was informed it had more power because it was the pro, I guess I will see!</li>
            <li> Love it n I would buy again Thanks</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed! It does not remove any hair..... At all! I have faithfully used it and see no results.</li>
            <li> I just sent mine back to much money no results after 2 months  I  excited thought it was going to be great was so disappointed</li>
            <li> did not take hair off had to go over it 9 times just to make a place you could even see anything happened can shave 100 times faster</li>
            <li> It has not heped me to remove my face hair. Not filled my expectations</li>
            <li> I did get one and I tried it everyweek for a month.&lt;br /&gt;What I found is that it does take some of the hair off but it leaves some so you have to shave anyway if you want a clean look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like this product, falsely advertised.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t liked the NO NO Pro3 Hair Removal Burning Hair it was very hard for me to operate&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to any one</li>
            <li> I got it for my wife she seems to like it so I guess that is all I can say.</li>
            <li> I got  this for my daughter and she said it is great it is much better than a razor!!!!!</li>
            <li> The name says it all.  NO NO don&#x27;t buy this.  A real rip off.  I would give it 0 stars but that was not a choice.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband and he loves it.</li>
            <li> Did not work the way I thought, I&#x27;ll keep using wax. It really don&#x27;t work like they say it would save your money.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!! Thankfully a wealthy relative purchased this gift for me so I would not have to spend my own hard-earned money! Complete waste of a product!!!!!!!!! No No Pro DOES NOT WORK. I have some hair on my arms. It&#x27;s visible, but its NOT thick. No No would not remove the hair. I also tried on my legs, which also did not work. I suffer from light hirsutism (side effect of PCOS---on my chest and neck). My hair there is VERY thin.. maybe a few hairs here or there. It didn&#x27;t work there, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured that the product just did not work........ So we called Customer Service and we determined the item was defective. The new item came in.......... Still did not work!! Please do not waste your money or your time on this product. There&#x27;s a new, more expensive product on the market. So sorry I did not write down the name... but go and get that instead. Please!</li>
            <li> Wish I had read the reviews before I ordered this. I lost my packing information so I cannot return it. Last time I buy something without reviewing it first. Stack it up to a learning lesson!!</li>
            <li> No no is a no no.  Did not work at all.</li>
            <li> Worst product ever.  It doesn&#x27;t work and it is a horror on your skin. It makes you look old and doesn&#x27;t remove the hair period. What a scam. I ordered through the company direct, so nothing against Amazon or anything.  I just hope nobody else gets duped.  Just go to your dermatologist if you want real hair removal.</li>
            <li> results not as advertised</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t by!! &#x3D;hate it so much!!!!! waste of money!!! (smell of burnt hair, is normal it says) ? I hate the smell of burnt hair!! lol I rather shave thankyou no no!! !!!</li>
            <li> it was false advertisement on the commercial it shows the hair coming rite off where in fact it takes 45 days of continues use and eventually the hair will grow back thinner and lighter so it comes off easyer if you watch the advertisement it shows a man run the no no on his arm and a large patch of hair was gone when in fact that will never happen if you ran it on your arm in the same place for 45 days it may I was very disappointed .</li>
            <li> Works great doesn&#x27;t work like you think it would , you really have to use it very single day in rode for it to work, but if you keep it up its an awesome product, don&#x27;t really need the buffer or the cream in order for it to work but I like it, not a permanent hair removal system</li>
            <li> Crap product, DOES NOT WORK, its that simple.  All it tries to do is burn some of the hair.  Tried it on neck, arms, nothing, only the smell of burning hair.  Oh, and good luck trying to return it.  It was a gift to me, purchased about a month before Christmas.  They are very STRICT about their return policy, even though I used it for nearly 60 days, guess what...they go by when it was PURCHASED, not by when it was actually first USED, so &amp;#34;sorry, we cannot refund anything&amp;#34;  Extremely dissatisfied.  I will post this review on every site I know - they should not be selling an inferior product like this.  Its not cheap either, but it doesn&#x27;t work PERIOD.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy nono from edeals! It&#x27;s a poor product that doesn&#x27;t do what they say and edeals does not honor the money back guarantee .i bought and got stuck both ways.</li>
            <li> overpriced item that quite simply does not work. don&#x27;t waste your money, because you are better off using a dull razor pulled out of a dumpster. Poor build quality and all it really does is make a lot of noise. We followed the instructions to the letter and we couldn&#x27;t be more disapointed.</li>
            <li> This device just doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> This product burns your hair and that is how it is removed!  The smell of the hair being burned is sickening to me.  The name is perfect No no .......  I returned the product then had a real issue getting a full refund......awhhhh they hit you for shipping x charges to return this horrid thing that burns your hair.  I now use an epilator a bit of a bite but well worth it and no burning hair.</li>
            <li> it dosent take all the hair off and its back the next day.</li>
            <li> I almost bought this piece of junk until I got on here and read through the reviews. Thank you for those reviews, they saved me a ton of money (and not on gieco)! Ha :)</li>
            <li> Unit arrived in good condition however it does not work quite like the advertisements on TV etc. It has a tendency to feel like it is burning my wife&#x27;s skin and one has to move over the unit over the area several times to remove almost all the hair. It may take some time to get used to it but my wife would have some speculations of ordering another one, not quite like the ease of operation as advertised.</li>
            <li> Does not work! Do not purchase.</li>
            <li> can not get the same results as shown on their website or on their  commercials...</li>
            <li> Too much money for what it does.</li>
            <li> My wife says she likes it...</li>
            <li> Pay no attention to reviews that do not say the reviewer is \\&quot;verified\\&quot;. A review from someone who is not verified basically means they did not purchase the item. Usually it is a friend of the seller and write false reviews for their friends. I would love this product to be excellent because I have researched reviews of the no no for years hoping it has improved. I would buy one in a heartbeat if they worked....they dont.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a piece of crap does not work good at all</li>
            <li> does not work as well as my wife hoped it would. Now trying to get it repaired, but company will not respond</li>
            <li> I got this item as a gift for my sister and she said the commercials lied. Apparently it takes a while for the hair to come off and it grows back sooner than the box said it does. I regret buying this without doing my homework.</li>
            <li> excellent product best yet! B</li>
            <li> no, no not too good, had to return it.</li>
            <li> I have used the nono 8800 for a couple of years before it pooped out.  Now I got the nono pro3 on hsn.  What I don&#x27;t like:  The plastic that runs along your face to help keep it upright has a lot of drag.  It has been replaced with some cheap plastic.  I am not too happy about that.  If you compare to the nono 8800- run your finger along the plastic or as in the direction your face would, the 8800 is smooth, no drag.  The pro 3 is like taking a cheap disposable razor on your face.  It burns away the hair as well or even better, but that plastic is irritating.  I am not happy.</li>
            <li> After Three sessions, the wide tip is broken, I have BURNS on my legs &amp; face and I feel like a gorilla.  This thing does not work!  Save the huge price tag and invest in razors.  You will be much happier!</li>
            <li> If you enjoy the smell of burnt hair then you will love it. The product singes your hair and it doesn&#x27;t even take it all the way off your left with pokey stubble. I called and tried to return to the NONO company where I purchased it from and they told me I had to keep it and do it for 60days cause I will see results in that time frame. So I had to smell burnt hair for that long to see ZERO results and it took almost 2 months to be refunded!</li>
            <li> This is not a good product. First, to get any sort of results you need to spend a lot (and I mean a LOT!) of time on each small area. Second, it is finicky to use and often does nothing (you can tell because the light is not flashing). Third, it works only on very fine practically invisible hair.  The reason it takes a lot of time is that not only because the working tip covers a small area but because you need to swipe multiple times because it does not work every time and when it works it does not treat every hair. To treat an area sized 2-3 inches you would need to spend several hours. The product claims that it will not grow back over time, but the hair does grow back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the product on a special discount using the promo on the TV commercial. I was worried about getting my money back given how false the other claims were. It took some aggressive screaming over the phone to get them to give me a refund, but they never refunded the cost of shipping the No!no! unit back even though in their advertising they promise it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DID NOT LIKE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Hard to use&lt;br /&gt;2) Did not work on all hair&lt;br /&gt;3) Took a lot of time to produce poor results&lt;br /&gt;4) Hair grew back&lt;br /&gt;5) Return process was difficult&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LIKED:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Commercial...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No! NO! NO! DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
            <li> work nice and good I love it/</li>
            <li> My wife like it and she will recommend this to buy it.</li>
