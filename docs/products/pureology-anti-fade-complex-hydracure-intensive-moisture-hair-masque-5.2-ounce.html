            <li>While i love the product, I will not be buying it at this price.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be more convenient to order it online.  </li>
            <li>This product is normally very good, when bought from reputable seller, for the slight discount I will buy from salon.</li>
            <li>(It smells lightly fruity.)  </li>
            <li>price was much more economical than my salon.  </li>
            <li>how good Pureology products are and I will keep using them as long as I have hair.</li>
            <li>Worth the money if you can swing it.</li>
            <li>First of all when I received it, it was not even the right masque.  </li>
            <li>This product is great to use at least once a week.</li>
            <li>I adore this Pureology product and have since I first bought it in the salon.  </li>
            <li>This time it is the right consistency and what you would expect when spending this much on a product.</li>
            <li>A must have..keeps my hair true to color, soft, its just truly amazing...and trust me I have tried them</li>
            <li>I would put this stuff in it every morning before school and within a week my hair was back to normal and repaired my split ends and made my hair extremely healthy.</li>
            <li>I just started using this product and it  really does work.</li>
            <li>The product I received from seller had the expiration date scraped off bottom the box, the packaging was pretty beat up and ovviously old.  </li>
            <li>however, i&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s as effective as when I get conditioning treatments at the salon.  </li>
            <li>Does not weigh my hair down and makes it so shiny and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>I wish the price wasn&#x27;t so high</li>
            <li>The results are worth every second.</li>
            <li>Normally with this product, the comb will glide through.  </li>
            <li>This purchase was the third time I have purchased this particular product through Amazon, the first time with Deals on Demand.</li>
            <li>The package arrived one day early.</li>
            <li>For my professional activity I use [[ASIN:B00D0APJB2</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost the same by quality but much cheaper.</li>
            <li>and she had the nerve to tell me she ordered it directly from the company!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate and it keeps my hair shiny and very manageable.</li>
            <li>I usually need to use a leave in conditioner after washing my hair in order to brush out all of the tangles, but when I use this product once a week my hair is tangle free.  </li>
            <li>I had to use my normal conditioner after using the deep conditioner - just to get a comb through it.</li>
            <li>I spend a lot of time outside  in the Arizona sun and this helps keep my hair  soft and repair the dryness of it.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time last night and let me tell you- be very careful buying this online.  </li>
            <li>I am positive what I received was not filled with pureology product.</li>
            <li>I have naturally dark hair and die it blonde with lighter blonde highlights so my hair really goes through a lot.  </li>

            <li> I have naturally dark hair and die it blonde with lighter blonde highlights so my hair really goes through a lot.  </li>
            <li> I first used it a few years ago when I bleached my hair from a dark brown to a platinum blonde.</li>
            <li> I have medium texture long highlighted blonde hair (aka fried)---this stuff works!!!!</li>
            <li> It has been too thick which makes it hard to use and causes you to use more each time.</li>
            <li> Use before having hair colored and it help hold color long term.</li>
            <li> My hair became so dry in the shower as I was trying to use the comb to work in the masque.  </li>
            <li> Personally I love this mask, although it&#x27;s quite expensive for my everyday use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this conditioner a handful of times, so far, but after using this product I do not have a hard time getting my comb through my hair and, therefore, there is less breakage.  </li>
            <li> Rebleaching it every month would normally damage it pretty bad</li>
            <li> A bit expensive but well worth it.</li>
            <li> I usually rotate different conditioners, depending on the day.  </li>
            <li> In previous orders the conditioner was not the consistency it would be if you purchase from a salon.</li>
            <li> Previously when I had this product (again from the salon)</li>
            <li> I did a little research and discovered that the barcode is from Cambodia.  </li>
            <li> I got one in a green bottle with purple lid.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels brittle and dried out today.  </li>
            <li> Even with all the conditioner I use, I still have a hard time getting a wide-toothed comb through my hair and often have a lot of breakage.  </li>
            <li> I used Pureology Anti-Fade Complex</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very expensive conditioner but even with all of my hair, it only requires a small amount of the product.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair which usually requires a lot of conditioner.  </li>
            <li> An almost doubling in price in 2 months is completely ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m telling you a fake product like this</li>
            <li> is dangerous.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let horrible sellers sell you</li>

            <li> Smells great, and conditions hair very well!  I put it on 1x/week and wear a shower cap around the house for about 30 minutes, and my hair has become easier to handle since I started using it.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product and it  really does work. I spend a lot of time outside  in the Arizona sun and this helps keep my hair  soft and repair the dryness of it. I use it  in combination of the shampoo and daily conditioner.</li>
            <li> I used Pureology Anti-Fade Complex HydrCure Intensive Moisture Hair Masque once before and it is a great product.  I have naturally dark hair and die it blonde with lighter blonde highlights so my hair really goes through a lot.  This product is a great conditioning treatment and helps to keep my hair healthy.  I usually need to use a leave in conditioner after washing my hair in order to brush out all of the tangles, but when I use this product once a week my hair is tangle free.  I would recommend this product to those who die they&#x27;re hair often.</li>
            <li> helps with colored hair</li>
            <li> Had another product by them before which was a bit better. This works well though. Should be perfect for the price&#x27;</li>
            <li> This purchase was the third time I have purchased this particular product through Amazon, the first time with Deals on Demand. In previous orders the conditioner was not the consistency it would be if you purchase from a salon. It has been too thick which makes it hard to use and causes you to use more each time. This time it is the right consistency and what you would expect when spending this much on a product. The package arrived one day early. I will always use Deals on Demand in the future to purchase this product!</li>
            <li> This is amazing! I first used it a few years ago when I bleached my hair from a dark brown to a platinum blonde. My hair was so fried that it felt and looked like a plastic wig. I would put this stuff in it every morning before school and within a week my hair was back to normal and repaired my split ends and made my hair extremely healthy. You can wash it out after 5 minutes, or you can leave it in all day, that&#x27;s what I did. I have recently been bleaching my hair and putting Manic Panic or Pravana semi permanent color every month or so. Rebleaching it every month would normally damage it pretty bad but my hair hasn&#x27;t taken any damage and has gotten stronger and healthier. I have told a lot of people how good Pureology products are and I will keep using them as long as I have hair.</li>
            <li> I am positive what I received was not filled with pureology product. I have bought this from a salon before and it has a totally different consistency as well after I use it and rinse - my hair felt like it wasn&#x27;t even conditioned! I had to use my normal conditioner after using the deep conditioner - just to get a comb through it. Previously when I had this product (again from the salon) my hair would feel like silk after rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would caution that this product may have pureology on the outside but who-knows-what on the inside.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner and does not weight the hair. Use before having hair colored and it help hold color long term.</li>
            <li> Love this luxurious hair masque. Don’t cheat on the 3-minute treatment wait time recommendation. The results are worth every second. Easy detangling; superior softness and manageability; fewer frizzies; and my hair looks clean, healthy and keeps its style for days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Intensive Moisture Hair Masque for over a year and love it!  I live in a dry climate and it keeps my hair shiny and very manageable.</li>
            <li> This product is great to use at least once a week. Once in a while, leave it in over night.  It will be kind to your hair!</li>
            <li> I have medium texture long highlighted blonde hair (aka fried)---this stuff works!!!! it is soooooo amazing, it smells so good, I&#x27;m not allergic like I am to most products, and my hair loves it! I&#x27;m so glad my friend, who&#x27;s a beautician, gave me some to try, I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair which usually requires a lot of conditioner.  Even with all the conditioner I use, I still have a hard time getting a wide-toothed comb through my hair and often have a lot of breakage.  I usually rotate different conditioners, depending on the day.  I&#x27;ve only used this conditioner a handful of times, so far, but after using this product I do not have a hard time getting my comb through my hair and, therefore, there is less breakage.  It&#x27;s a very expensive conditioner but even with all of my hair, it only requires a small amount of the product.  It feels and smells luxurious.  (It smells lightly fruity.)  I wish the price wasn&#x27;t so high but, even so, I will be buying this product, again.  Update:  I came back to re-order this product and it jumped from $39.99 on July 21 to $78 on September 27.  An almost doubling in price in 2 months is completely ridiculous.  While i love the product, I will not be buying it at this price.</li>
            <li> Does not weigh my hair down and makes it so shiny and healthy looking.  A bit expensive but well worth it.</li>
            <li> If you have brittle hair this is the thing to use.  One medium jar lasts me well over a year, and I have used it for years.  I know&lt;br /&gt;about this stuff and it has my highest possible recommendation.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pricey but it is a treat for your hair. Worth the money if you can swing it.</li>
            <li> A must have..keeps my hair true to color, soft, its just truly amazing...and trust me I have tried them ALL!!&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has the best prices, I have looked around, always order from here as it never goes on sale!!&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT, and you will too!!</li>
            <li> The product I received from seller had the expiration date scraped off bottom the box, the packaging was pretty beat up and ovviously old.  Still tried the product to see if it was okay, needless to say it was not, I had to rewash my hair to get the residue out.  This product is normally very good, when bought from reputable seller, for the slight discount I will buy from salon.</li>
            <li> price was much more economical than my salon.  however, i&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s as effective as when I get conditioning treatments at the salon.  my stylist told me a different method to use so will try it and see.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a self-employed hairdresser. Personally I love this mask, although it&#x27;s quite expensive for my everyday use. For my professional activity I use [[ASIN:B00D0APJB2 Glossco Avocado Hair Mask]]. It&#x27;s almost the same by quality but much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I adore this Pureology product and have since I first bought it in the salon.  I thought it would be more convenient to order it online.  First of all when I received it, it was not even the right masque.  I got one in a green bottle with purple lid.  I contacted the seller who agreed to give me a $10 discount.  I agreed because I needed product and thought if it was Pureology it would be a good product.  I used it for the first time last night and let me tell you- be very careful buying this online.  My hair became so dry in the shower as I was trying to use the comb to work in the masque.  Normally with this product, the comb will glide through.  I had to rinse it out and apply another conditioner.  I&#x27;m telling you a fake product like this is dangerous.  My hair feels brittle and dried out today.  I did a little research and discovered that the barcode is from Cambodia.  GEE, I thought Pureology was in Irvine California!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the seller again and told her and asked her where she got it and she had the nerve to tell me she ordered it directly from the company!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go to a salon from now on is my advice.  We pay lots for this product because it&#x27;s so awesome!  Don&#x27;t let horrible sellers sell you God knows what.</li>
