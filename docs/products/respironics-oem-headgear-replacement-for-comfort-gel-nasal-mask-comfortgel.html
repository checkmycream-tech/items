            <li>This is NOT OEM, but OEM &amp;#34;replacement&amp;#34;... not as good of quality as the OEM, but it&#x27;s functional.</li>
            <li>The rougher material also scratches your face a good  bit and is quite irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Good quality.</li>

            <li>This is a well made and a good fit -</li>
            <li>Elasticity is not as good as original nor is velcro.  </li>
            <li>Good replacement for original headgear</li>
            <li>My husband says this is very comfortable</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Unlike the complaints from others, the headgear that I received is clearly branded Respironics and is very good quality.  </li>
            <li>The webbing wears out much more often than the mask.</li>
            <li>Had it two nights, now, and it&#x27;s better than the ResMed.  </li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t been able to use yet, because the gel part wasn&#x27;t shipped with mask.otherwise</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>Nothing better</li>
            <li>/&gt;i love that&lt;</li>
            <li>Glad I found that out before it turned fatal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I paid $10 for this item and it is an appropriate value at this price.</li>
            <li>Even though I use another brand CPAP, I love this headgear.  </li>
            <li>I own a ResMed Mirage (original) CPAP mask.  </li>
            <li>but it is lighter and more comfortable.</li>
            <li>My old headgear disintegrated and I needed a replacement--got this and am totally happy.</li>
            <li>Good product, fast shipping with pr8me</li>
            <li>It comes undone easily.</li>
            <li>Great price, being only $1 more than a cheap aftermarket strap.</li>
            <li>Not the thickest material but works fine.</li>
            <li>Was not OEM but works fine</li>
            <li>Comfortable and we&#x27;ll made</li>
            <li>I have been gotten before by cheap imitations that were not the OEM replacement.  </li>
            <li>Cheap knock off.  </li>
            <li>It is also cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Very stuff not flexible as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, I bought from Health Store and More with a price of $9.89.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable,  </li>
            <li>So comfortable</li>
            <li>Cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li>Fit, form and function as original.</li>
            <li>++  Exactly what I wanted, and arrived fast and in good condition.  </li>
            <li>All I had to do was unwind the original headgear from the plastic clips.  </li>
            <li>It works as a replacement,  but it is inferior to the original in every way.</li>
            <li>it works OK, the material begins to stretch  pretty quickly</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;They&amp;#34; were right!</li>
            <li>Velcro adjustments are not as great as expected.</li>
            <li>Cheap, Fast shipping and was able to use it right away.</li>
            <li>Wore out too quickly...</li>
            <li>Stretches more than I like but comfortable and soft.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Most of the stuff you buy is pretty high priced.  </li>
            <li>Works good and as expected.</li>
            <li>I ordered the correct headgear and it is working much better than the original one because the strap around the back of the neck is wider.</li>
            <li>It fit my older Respironics mask without issue.  </li>
            <li>Their pic shows the Respironics logo apparently making you think that you buying a authentic Respironics product.</li>
            <li>great price, I usually order fron cpap.com</li>
            <li>Unlike the OEM versions that can be slightly stretched (good for adjusting, or maybe scratching a quick itch under the mask), this one is firm, once you set it don&#x27;t expect to be able to move it.</li>
            <li>It finally fell apart, and I haven&#x27;t been able to find another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It will do the job for a short time, nothing more.</li>
            <li>Exact replacement for the piece i had to have replaced</li>
            <li>I first tried &amp;#34;Headgear Replaces: Respironics.</li>
            <li>The only reason it will not be returned is because it will work (just okay) and is sorely needed now.</li>
            <li>best guess, felt blanket material and is utterly useless after a month.  </li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;same item&amp;#34; is available from several sellers, so maybe who you buy from (even if Amazon fulfills the order) determines if you get the true OEM version.  </li>
            <li>so it comes loose very easily and also scratches your face.</li>
            <li>Thinner by far and of inferior materials than those of the original.</li>
            <li>Not an OEM replacement, nowhere near the build quality of the original,  the picture is misleading in that it shows the manufacturer logo.  </li>
            <li>And no where worth the high price.</li>
            <li>Simple and easy to get replacement headgear this way.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is more comfortable after the usual tweaking and adjusting.  </li>
            <li>I feel this is a pure misrepresentation.  </li>
            <li>exactly the same as original.</li>
            <li>The quality is not as good as the original, there is less material, the straps are not as wide.</li>
            <li>Much thinner that the real one, and the hook and loop stink.  </li>
            <li>Fits very well.</li>
            <li>works really well very comforble</li>
            <li>A cheap generic knock off.</li>
            <li>Absolute junk.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>the headgear does not stick very well</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t the oem headgear and straps are very flemsy.</li>
            <li>You would think someone could come up with a reasonably priced durable hear gear.</li>
            <li>The product I received was of much lower grade than the OEM headgear.  </li>
            <li>The material is much thinner and no elasticity.</li>
            <li>Fits well and reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Very flimsy.</li>
            <li>This headgear is much sturdier, and has shown no signs of fatigue after 3 months.</li>
            <li>This is a cheap copy of the proper headgear.</li>
            <li>Not even the same design though it does fit.</li>
            <li>It is a poor-quality knock-off version made by &amp;#34;LegendMD.&amp;#34;  The real thing is made from fabric-backed neoprene and lasts about six months.  </li>
            <li>it god and thanks 4 u</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m thankful that it can be had for a reasonable price from this vendor at Amazon.</li>
            <li>This headgear appears to be a generic knock-off of the original.  </li>
            <li>Mine was the same as factory original.</li>
            <li>This is not the same at the original headgear.</li>
            <li>not similar in quality to the original headbands.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended and fast shipment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Materials quality is high.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.    </li>
            <li>In fact it works better, for me, that the headgear that game with the original equipment.  </li>
            <li>i have been a regular buyer of this item but this last headgear i got appears to be a cheap knockoff of the real thing.</li>
            <li>Deluxe Black Universal 4-Point Attachment Headgear, each&amp;#34;, bought from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Same exact thing from the expensive respiratory office, works great</li>
            <li>I joke about being the poster child in New Mexico for CPAP - living in a valley at 6300&#x27; altitude.  </li>
            <li>I slipped the new Phillips Respironics into the clips and adjusted the Velcro for my head.    </li>
            <li>Cheap imitation.  </li>
            <li>They are intentionally misleading and DEFRAUDING customers by selling a cheap imitation product.  </li>
            <li>Exact OEM should say Phillips and respiranics on back of headgear and made in Mexico.</li>
            <li>This will likely work for most other full-face adult CPAP masks that use four strap points, two at forehead area and two at the lower face area.</li>
            <li>I was a little concerned by the wide range of reviews even though most were positive.  </li>
            <li>The picture clearly shows Respironics name brand under the product description.  </li>
            <li>It is not branded yet image clearly shows Respironics logo.</li>
            <li>It is NOT like the photo which clearly shows the Resprironics logo.</li>
            <li>Came in a timely fashion and worked seamlessly with my mask.  </li>
            <li>the price seems to fluctuate wildly between $15 and $8.00.</li>
            <li>Misrepresented product completely.  </li>
            <li>It is also cheaply made and has begun to show fatigue after just a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>The doctor&#x27;s office wants to overcharge grossly for this item</li>
            <li>I hit buy it again and Amazon selected Medical USA, if it is not OEM it is going right back to the sender via Amazon.</li>
            <li>Does not fit like the original, at all</li>
            <li>Does not fit like the original, at all.  </li>
            <li>For a third of the price of an OEM ResMed headgear I have something now that has a slightly softer surface finish, just a little more elasticity than the RedMed blue original.  </li>
            <li>No logo and very thin cheap material compared to the original.  </li>
            <li>this one is of marginal quality and not enough elasticity to stay in place, even as brand new.</li>
            <li>Well, even though I read several reviews that said that this was NOT the same as the OEM headgear for Respironics  my wife really needed it so it was purchased.</li>
            <li>The one I got has no logo on the back like the image, it is clearly some type of knock off</li>
            <li>Does not have much &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; and is harder to get on and off.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t breathe when I sleep, apparently I will die.  </li>
            <li>Cheap replica, no good</li>
            <li>wear a large mask and cushion though not a full face  </li>
            <li>The material much lower quality than the previous purchase.  </li>
            <li>This headgear seems less sturdy than others I have had, and the velcro doesn&#x27;t stick very well.</li>
            <li>While I found the headgear for the Mirage mask, I wanted something less expensive but just as good.  </li>

            <li> Unlike the OEM versions that can be slightly stretched (good for adjusting, or maybe scratching a quick itch under the mask), this one is firm, once you set it don&#x27;t expect to be able to move it.</li>
            <li> It finally fell apart, and I haven&#x27;t been able to find another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It will do the job for a short time, nothing more.</li>
            <li> Exact replacement for the piece i had to have replaced</li>
            <li> I first tried &amp;#34;Headgear Replaces: Respironics.</li>
            <li> The only reason it will not be returned is because it will work (just okay) and is sorely needed now.</li>
            <li> best guess, felt blanket material and is utterly useless after a month.  </li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;same item&amp;#34; is available from several sellers, so maybe who you buy from (even if Amazon fulfills the order) determines if you get the true OEM version.  </li>
            <li> so it comes loose very easily and also scratches your face.</li>
            <li> Thinner by far and of inferior materials than those of the original.</li>
            <li> Not an OEM replacement, nowhere near the build quality of the original,  the picture is misleading in that it shows the manufacturer logo.  </li>
            <li> And no where worth the high price.</li>
            <li> Simple and easy to get replacement headgear this way.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is more comfortable after the usual tweaking and adjusting.  </li>
            <li> I feel this is a pure misrepresentation.  </li>
            <li> exactly the same as original.</li>
            <li> The quality is not as good as the original, there is less material, the straps are not as wide.</li>
            <li> Much thinner that the real one, and the hook and loop stink.  </li>
            <li> Fits very well.</li>
            <li> works really well very comforble</li>
            <li> A cheap generic knock off.</li>
            <li> Absolute junk.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> the headgear does not stick very well</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t the oem headgear and straps are very flemsy.</li>
            <li> You would think someone could come up with a reasonably priced durable hear gear.</li>
            <li> The product I received was of much lower grade than the OEM headgear.  </li>
            <li> The material is much thinner and no elasticity.</li>
            <li> Fits well and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Very flimsy.</li>
            <li> This headgear is much sturdier, and has shown no signs of fatigue after 3 months.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap copy of the proper headgear.</li>
            <li> Not even the same design though it does fit.</li>
            <li> It is a poor-quality knock-off version made by &amp;#34;LegendMD.&amp;#34;  The real thing is made from fabric-backed neoprene and lasts about six months.  </li>
            <li> it god and thanks 4 u</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m thankful that it can be had for a reasonable price from this vendor at Amazon.</li>
            <li> This headgear appears to be a generic knock-off of the original.  </li>
            <li> Mine was the same as factory original.</li>
            <li> This is not the same at the original headgear.</li>
            <li> not similar in quality to the original headbands.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended and fast shipment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Materials quality is high.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.    </li>
            <li> In fact it works better, for me, that the headgear that game with the original equipment.  </li>
            <li> i have been a regular buyer of this item but this last headgear i got appears to be a cheap knockoff of the real thing.</li>
            <li> Deluxe Black Universal 4-Point Attachment Headgear, each&amp;#34;, bought from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Same exact thing from the expensive respiratory office, works great</li>
            <li> I joke about being the poster child in New Mexico for CPAP - living in a valley at 6300&#x27; altitude.  </li>
            <li> I slipped the new Phillips Respironics into the clips and adjusted the Velcro for my head.    </li>
            <li> Cheap imitation.  </li>
            <li> They are intentionally misleading and DEFRAUDING customers by selling a cheap imitation product.  </li>
            <li> Exact OEM should say Phillips and respiranics on back of headgear and made in Mexico.</li>
            <li> This will likely work for most other full-face adult CPAP masks that use four strap points, two at forehead area and two at the lower face area.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned by the wide range of reviews even though most were positive.  </li>
            <li> The picture clearly shows Respironics name brand under the product description.  </li>
            <li> It is not branded yet image clearly shows Respironics logo.</li>
            <li> It is NOT like the photo which clearly shows the Resprironics logo.</li>
            <li> Came in a timely fashion and worked seamlessly with my mask.  </li>
            <li> the price seems to fluctuate wildly between $15 and $8.00.</li>
            <li> Misrepresented product completely.  </li>
            <li> It is also cheaply made and has begun to show fatigue after just a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> The doctor&#x27;s office wants to overcharge grossly for this item</li>
            <li> I hit buy it again and Amazon selected Medical USA, if it is not OEM it is going right back to the sender via Amazon.</li>
            <li> Does not fit like the original, at all</li>
            <li> Does not fit like the original, at all.  </li>
            <li> For a third of the price of an OEM ResMed headgear I have something now that has a slightly softer surface finish, just a little more elasticity than the RedMed blue original.  </li>
            <li> No logo and very thin cheap material compared to the original.  </li>
            <li> this one is of marginal quality and not enough elasticity to stay in place, even as brand new.</li>
            <li> Well, even though I read several reviews that said that this was NOT the same as the OEM headgear for Respironics  my wife really needed it so it was purchased.</li>
            <li> The one I got has no logo on the back like the image, it is clearly some type of knock off</li>
            <li> Does not have much &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; and is harder to get on and off.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t breathe when I sleep, apparently I will die.  </li>
            <li> Cheap replica, no good</li>
            <li> wear a large mask and cushion though not a full face  </li>
            <li> The material much lower quality than the previous purchase.  </li>
            <li> This headgear seems less sturdy than others I have had, and the velcro doesn&#x27;t stick very well.</li>
            <li> While I found the headgear for the Mirage mask, I wanted something less expensive but just as good.  </li>
            <li> After just a few weeks it has stretched out and does not fit like the original.</li>
            <li> This strap will not last long.</li>
            <li> It will not last nearly as long as the Respironics version.</li>
            <li> This new headgear doesn&#x27;t detract from that - and saved me a few buck$ as well.</li>
            <li> My husband sleeps with a CPAP and the strap on his headgear had become stretched and would not stay in place while he slept.  </li>
            <li> Stretched out after a week of use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The material is not soft, it has no flexibility/elasticity.</li>
            <li> After a couple of months the straps are coming apart and I will have to find another headgear before long.  </li>
            <li> Stretched out after about two weeks of use.</li>
            <li> No playing games getting it to perform as expected.</li>
            <li> As other reviews have noted the headgear is not very durable.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also cheaper now than the other one...</li>
            <li> They will work but not very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Equivalent headgear at half the cost.  </li>
            <li> It replaces the head gear I got from my CPAP supply company and costs slightly less without me having to mess with the supply company&#x27;s inane robo-calls.</li>
            <li> Could be just a little sturdier.  </li>
            <li> Was not original OEM product.  </li>
            <li> Meaning, the Velcro works for a few weeks, and then begins coming undone by itself.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will need to replace the strap in a few months</li>
            <li> sturdy holds my mask firm and in place even when I turn to my side.</li>
            <li> Not sure this was made for Respironics (the Philips company)</li>
            <li> I had purchased in the past and it was as described, so I had no problem re-ordering.</li>
            <li> Not sure what has changed</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because the price was so low, but, quality product</li>
            <li> The material is very thin when compared to the origina and the material has a completely different composition.</li>
            <li> Very poor copy with velcro that will not last.  </li>
            <li> The box could at hold at least 4 of them.</li>
            <li> However I do plan to lodge a formal complaint with Amazon.</li>
            <li> Quite expensive though.</li>
            <li> The is NO elasticity in the headgear and the Velcro is impossible to adjust because the material rolls up not allowing any surface got you to re attach the Velcro straps.</li>
            <li> and it is worthless.  </li>
            <li> Given two stars because I don&#x27;t hate [it], just the untruthful sellers.</li>
            <li> am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Terrible.  </li>
            <li> Horrible, flimsy construction and material.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Not sure this was made for Respironics (the Philips company) but it is lighter and more comfortable.</li>
            <li> My husband sleeps with a CPAP and the strap on his headgear had become stretched and would not stay in place while he slept.  This replacement Headgear was just what he needed and is working great for him.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Materials quality is high.</li>
            <li> NOT Respironics OEM.  Not the item that is pictured.  It has no logo. Much thinner that the real one, and the hook and loop stink.  I have had it for 1 week over a month and it is worthless.  DO NOT WAST YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> Simple and easy to get replacement headgear this way.  The webbing wears out much more often than the mask.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and we&#x27;ll made</li>
            <li> i just purchased and received from P &amp; B and is same as from respiranics. I hit buy it again and Amazon selected Medical USA, if it is not OEM it is going right back to the sender via Amazon. I have been gotten before by cheap imitations that were not the OEM replacement.  Exact OEM should say Phillips and respiranics on back of headgear and made in Mexico.</li>
            <li> Works good and as expected.</li>
            <li> Same exact thing from the expensive respiratory office, works great</li>
            <li> Fits very well. Quite expensive though.</li>
            <li> works really well very comforble</li>
            <li> fits good great pricing cheaper than my copay.</li>
            <li> This headgear appears to be a generic knock-off of the original.  The material is very thin when compared to the origina and the material has a completely different composition. The picture clearly shows Respironics name brand under the product description.  I feel this is a pure misrepresentation.  Price is attractive, but would gladly pay more for Respironics branded item.</li>
            <li> Works great a life saver</li>
            <li> A nice and comfortable head strap for my CPAP mask at a great price.</li>
            <li> this is a really good product.  i ordered it for my husband to replace one he had used for years.  good quality product - works like a champ</li>
            <li> Same OEM but cheaper than ordering from cpap medical supply store.</li>
            <li> This is deceptive. They ARE NOT Respironics headgear !!! A cheap generic knock off. Their pic shows the Respironics logo apparently making you think that you buying a authentic Respironics product. They fool you by saying its a &amp;#34;Respironics OEM Headgear Replacement for...&amp;#34; The key word is &amp;#34;Replacement&amp;#34; Watch the wording. Buyer beware. The is NO elasticity in the headgear and the Velcro is impossible to adjust because the material rolls up not allowing any surface got you to re attach the Velcro straps. Absolute junk.</li>
            <li> Came in a timely fashion and worked seamlessly with my mask.  Thanks</li>
            <li> i have been a regular buyer of this item but this last headgear i got appears to be a cheap knockoff of the real thing. Stretched out after a week of use. am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned by the wide range of reviews even though most were positive.  Let me add another positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear a large mask and cushion though not a full face  job even with my beard.  For a third of the price of an OEM ResMed headgear I have something now that has a slightly softer surface finish, just a little more elasticity than the RedMed blue original.  A style I&#x27;ve used for a decade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is more comfortable after the usual tweaking and adjusting.  Had it two nights, now, and it&#x27;s better than the ResMed.  Assume it lasts as well unless I check back and add to this review.  Oh, and it arrived properly branded and packaged, too.  I joke about being the poster child in New Mexico for CPAP - living in a valley at 6300&#x27; altitude.  This new headgear doesn&#x27;t detract from that - and saved me a few buck$ as well.</li>
            <li> This is NOT OEM, but OEM &amp;#34;replacement&amp;#34;... not as good of quality as the OEM, but it&#x27;s functional.</li>
            <li> I had purchased in the past and it was as described, so I had no problem re-ordering. Not sure what has changed but now it&#x27;s definitely not OEM. The one I got has no logo on the back like the image, it is clearly some type of knock off reproduction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The material is not soft, it has no flexibility/elasticity. Unlike the OEM versions that can be slightly stretched (good for adjusting, or maybe scratching a quick itch under the mask), this one is firm, once you set it don&#x27;t expect to be able to move it. The rougher material also scratches your face a good  bit and is quite irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend looking elsewhere as I will be doing momentarily.</li>
            <li> Oh Yes! OE replacement. Fit, form and function as original. No playing games getting it to perform as expected. Great price, being only $1 more than a cheap aftermarket strap. Highly recommended and fast shipment.</li>
            <li> Cheap, Fast shipping and was able to use it right away.</li>
            <li> This is a well made and a good fit - the price seems to fluctuate wildly between $15 and $8.00. This was $7.95 It was shipped in a 10 X 7 X 3.75 box with a couple air pillows. Nice. The box could at hold at least 4 of them. The problem is - at this time - if you want to order 4 they will charge you about $5.00 shipping for each one in the same box that they used to ship 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t call it robbery, but (It&#x27;s Robbery!)</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because the price was so low, but, quality product and it fit perfectly!</li>
            <li> the headgear does not stick very well</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t the oem headgear and straps are very flemsy.</li>
            <li> Nicely done.  Fits nicely and good quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen mixed reviews on this. Mine was the same as factory original. I did not however order from the cheapest vendor and ordered from one of the medical supply companies. Good quality.</li>
            <li> Could be just a little sturdier.  Fits hood.</li>
            <li> It replaces the head gear I got from my CPAP supply company and costs slightly less without me having to mess with the supply company&#x27;s inane robo-calls. I&#x27;ll repurchase this when the one I have now wears out.</li>
            <li> Once upon a time, I had the perfect strap for my son&#x27;s nasal mask. It finally fell apart, and I haven&#x27;t been able to find another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this was it, but it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This strap is identical to the one you are given with your nasal mask.  Meaning, the Velcro works for a few weeks, and then begins coming undone by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this is the best I can find, besides the &amp;#34;once-upon-a-time&amp;#34; perfect strap for the nasal mask!</li>
            <li> it works OK, the material begins to stretch  pretty quickly I will need to replace the strap in a few months</li>
            <li> ++++++++++++++++  Exactly what I wanted, and arrived fast and in good condition.  A+ vendor.  +++++++++++++</li>
            <li> This is not the same at the original headgear. Does not have much &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; and is harder to get on and off.</li>
            <li> Cheap imitation.  Very poor copy with velcro that will not last.  I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> As other reviews have noted the headgear is not very durable.  The straps are two materials (elastic and felt for the Velcro) bound together.  After a couple of months the straps are coming apart and I will have to find another headgear before long.  You know, I have had to use a CPAP machine and head gear for over 15 years. You would think someone could come up with a reasonably priced durable hear gear.</li>
            <li> Is and excellent and cheaper option for use with the res-med mirage mask. This OEM headgear fully fill me expectations</li>
            <li> Fits my husband&#x27;s cpap mask perfectly and is comfy on his head. Would recommend and will buy again when it wears out.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Works great</li>
            <li> This is not OEM.  It&#x27;s thin and cheaply made.  It will do the job for a short time, nothing more.</li>
            <li> This is not OEM.  It is not like the one in the picture.  No logo and very thin cheap material compared to the original.  After just a few weeks it has stretched out and does not fit like the original.</li>
            <li> Velcro adjustments are not as great as expected.</li>
            <li> Do not buy based on the picture you see.  The product I received was of much lower grade than the OEM headgear.  The material is much thinner and no elasticity.</li>
            <li> cheep material and make, will work for a while</li>
            <li> Not the thickest material but works fine.</li>
            <li> Terrible.  Misrepresented product completely.  Elasticity is not as good as original nor is velcro.  It is not branded yet image clearly shows Respironics logo.</li>
            <li> Cheap replica, no good</li>
            <li> Cheap knock off.  Made out of what appeared to be felt.  I would be ashamed If I was Amazon to offer a product that is so deceptive about the product  you receive, I felt lied to,  I would not by this product of you are looking for the OEM on show in the photo and talked about in the description.</li>
            <li> This is not OEM, there is no Respironics logo on the strap. It is also cheaply made. Does not fit like the original, at all</li>
            <li> This was my second purchase of this item.  The material much lower quality than the previous purchase.  This strap will not last long.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t been able to use yet, because the gel part wasn&#x27;t shipped with mask.otherwise it&#x27;s ok I guess it will.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted - the OEM product is the best because of fit &amp; comfort and availability.  Nothing better</li>
            <li> Perfect in every way, price, fit , and comfort. Exact replacement for the piece i had to have replaced</li>
            <li> My husband likes it. Fits him well.</li>
            <li> My husband says this is very comfortable and he likes it because it is adjustable.</li>
            <li> Misrepresentation of product. Do not purchase from there folks</li>
            <li> They will work but not very comfortable. Very stuff not flexible as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> Fits well and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Good replacement for original headgear</li>
            <li> The quality is not as good as the original, there is less material, the straps are not as wide.</li>
            <li> THIS SELLER IS LYING!  They are intentionally misleading and DEFRAUDING customers by selling a cheap imitation product.  I have ordered this product TWICE now, and NEITHER TIME did I receive an OEM product!  There is no Respironics logo on the strap.  It is also cheaply made and has begun to show fatigue after just a few weeks.  Does not fit like the original, at all.  The material has zero flexibility.</li>
            <li> sturdy holds my mask firm and in place even when I turn to my side.</li>
            <li> Very flimsy. Looks like it should cost $2.99.</li>
            <li> Was not original OEM product.  Stretched out after about two weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Works well...exactly the same as original.</li>
            <li> great price, I usually order fron cpap.com but this was about 1/4 of  the price</li>
            <li> Best price I&#x27;ve found...quality...poor started falling apart within a week</li>
            <li> Have had a number of these over the years...this one is of marginal quality and not enough elasticity to stay in place, even as brand new.</li>
            <li> Brand-name product at an excellent price.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I ordered the correct headgear and it is working much better than the original one because the strap around the back of the neck is wider.</li>
            <li> Wore out too quickly...straps frayed to the point where they almost broke. Will order the OEM next time.</li>
            <li> I first tried &amp;#34;Headgear Replaces: Respironics. Deluxe Black Universal 4-Point Attachment Headgear, each&amp;#34;, bought from Amazon. Horrible, flimsy construction and material. The Velcro began to separate from the elastic material in about 3 weeks. The cheapest option - get what you pay for. This headgear is much sturdier, and has shown no signs of fatigue after 3 months. Will purchase again. It&#x27;s also cheaper now than the other one... go figure.</li>
            <li> Well, even though I read several reviews that said that this was NOT the same as the OEM headgear for Respironics  my wife really needed it so it was purchased. &amp;#34;They&amp;#34; were right! This is a cheap copy of the proper headgear. It is NOT like the photo which clearly shows the Resprironics logo. Thinner by far and of inferior materials than those of the original. Not even the same design though it does fit. I feel that I&#x27;ve been lied to and ripped off. The only reason it will not be returned is because it will work (just okay) and is sorely needed now. Given two stars because I don&#x27;t hate [it], just the untruthful sellers. However I do plan to lodge a formal complaint with Amazon. Be warned! This is NOT OEM Resprionics! And no where worth the high price. Shop elsewhere...</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.  This is NOT an OEM product or a Respironics product, as pictured.  It is a poor-quality knock-off version made by &amp;#34;LegendMD.&amp;#34;  The real thing is made from fabric-backed neoprene and lasts about six months.  This is made from, best guess, felt blanket material and is utterly useless after a month.  I bought two, I&#x27;m returning the one that I haven&#x27;t opened.</li>
            <li> Unlike the complaints from others, the headgear that I received is clearly branded Respironics and is very good quality.  It fit my older Respironics mask without issue.  This &amp;#34;same item&amp;#34; is available from several sellers, so maybe who you buy from (even if Amazon fulfills the order) determines if you get the true OEM version.  For what it&#x27;s worth, I bought from Health Store and More with a price of $9.89.  I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made. I will buy another type or brand next time.</li>
            <li> not similar in quality to the original headbands.  I will use it but suspect it will only last weeks.  I won&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
            <li> it god and thanks 4 u&lt;br /&gt;i love that&lt;br /&gt;Maybe buy again from the same Item&lt;br /&gt;Because it is the finest of the commodity in the states</li>
            <li> Was not OEM but works fine</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement as good and better than original.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Good quality. Husband likes it</li>
            <li> I own a ResMed Mirage (original) CPAP mask.  After 10 years in good storage, the headgear (the clip-on straps) basically rotted away.    While I found the headgear for the Mirage mask, I wanted something less expensive but just as good.  So I found this Phillips Respironics headgear instead.  It worked perfectly on my ResMed Mirage CPAP mask!    All I had to do was unwind the original headgear from the plastic clips.  I slipped the new Phillips Respironics into the clips and adjusted the Velcro for my head.    Very easy.  Inexpensive.  Comfortable,  Highly recommended.    This will likely work for most other full-face adult CPAP masks that use four strap points, two at forehead area and two at the lower face area.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t breathe when I sleep, apparently I will die.  This thing helps to ensure that doesn&#x27;t happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro Tip:  The mask goes on the FRONT of your face, and this thing goes on the BACK of your head.  Glad I found that out before it turned fatal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Breathing/10 - would survive the night with this again!</li>
            <li> This headgear seems less sturdy than others I have had, and the velcro doesn&#x27;t stick very well. It comes undone easily.</li>
            <li> The item that arrived was what I ordered and it works.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering again. a great product.</li>
            <li> So comfortable I don&#x27;t even know I have it on.</li>
            <li> My old headgear disintegrated and I needed a replacement--got this and am totally happy.</li>
            <li> Stretches more than I like but comfortable and soft.</li>
            <li> This is not the OEM Respironics. It has no logo and it is inferior quality. It will not last nearly as long as the Respironics version. I am upset because had I known this I would have purchased from someone else.</li>
            <li> Equivalent headgear at half the cost.  Works for me!</li>
            <li> This item fits my head properly and holds my cpap mask in correct position. I paid $10 for this item and it is an appropriate value at this price. The doctor&#x27;s office wants to overcharge grossly for this item so I&#x27;m thankful that it can be had for a reasonable price from this vendor at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Not an OEM replacement, nowhere near the build quality of the original,  the picture is misleading in that it shows the manufacturer logo.  This is not that product.  It works as a replacement,  but it is inferior to the original in every way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same as I get from my medical supply house.</li>
            <li> Even though I use another brand CPAP, I love this headgear.  I feel it keeps its shape longer.  The price here on Amazon was incredible!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, great price!  Very happy.</li>
            <li> Good product, fast shipping with pr8me</li>
            <li> This is a really good product because it doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg and it works.  In fact it works better, for me, that the headgear that game with the original equipment.  Most of the stuff you buy is pretty high priced.  This isn&#x27;t, it works well!</li>
            <li> Good stock replacement.</li>
            <li> Cheap and flimsy. The velcro part is larger than the straps so it comes loose very easily and also scratches your face. Do not buy this item!! Like others have said it shows the brand for Respironics but mine came blank with no markings at all.</li>
