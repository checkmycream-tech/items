            <li>Top Likes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you are looking for a pocket size comb that carries a sandal wood aroma you landed on the appropriate product.</li>
            <li>, I love this!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this comb.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>, it is so cute, I had another one from Teatree</li>
            <li>This comb is great for detangling hair when wet and feels great against your scalp.</li>
            <li>Omg I&#x27;m so in love with this...</li>
            <li>(sandalwood is one of my favorite scents).</li>
            <li>Therefore, getting the most good out of this comb depends on making sure you have the right hair for the tooth texture.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also very high quality, made of very nice sandalwood.</li>
            <li>Gone is that snap-crackle-pop sound that means more and more breakage to contend with.</li>
            <li>The teeth are spaced wide apart which is perfect for tangles.</li>
            <li>It does have a light sandalwood scent which isn&#x27;t overwhelming at all--</li>
            <li>best wide tooth combs I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This wide tooth sandal wood comb is absolutely perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>Would have gladly purchased for the $24.99 but at $5.99 plus free shipping, it&#x27;s a steal.</li>
            <li>I enjoy it a lot and can&#x27;t think of any meaningful critiques.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quality is really good, made with real wood.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s attractive, made of natural wood with the wood grain visible (but the surface is smooth with no flaws or defects), and lightweight.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It also did a good job as a scalp massager when combing, felt good in the hand, sturdy and enough weight to be well controlled, lovely natural wood grain can be seen, and just a nice comb all together.  </li>
            <li>The thickness and width of this 1.8 ounce comb makes it easy to hold, even for arthritic hands.  </li>
            <li>comb fits is my hand and is easy to hold as I pull it through my hair.</li>
            <li>Not that there is a strong scent of anything, but</li>
            <li>I think the scent is strong</li>
            <li>the comb, after all, is made of the wood, it isn&#x27;t supposed to smell as strong as the distilled scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell of the sandalwood is really pleasant too but not really noticeable unless you have a great nose or put you nose right up to the comb and smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All of the edges were nicely smoothed, and the tips of the teeth are fairly large - meaning that it isn&#x27;t going to scratch or gouge you.  </li>
            <li>the thought of a sandalwood comb blows my mind, and now I am definitely a huge adherent.</li>
            <li>now I produced finger flowing freely hair from it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like that it is sandalwood, and I enjoy the scent of sandalwood.</li>
            <li>comb is comfortable to hold and appears to be sturdy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, for $5.99 and free shipping,</li>
            <li>and it is so comfortable against my scalp.  </li>
            <li>Free product provided for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a fantastic comb for detangling which is all I wanted.</li>
            <li>This product is built of nice, aromatic sandalwood, a material often used for its preservative qualities, much like cedar.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels really smooth going across your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>: I was sent a free product sample for review.</li>
            <li>sweet sandalwood scent just permeates the wood, far more prevalent than my sandalwood Neko cat key fob, and I expect over time, my hair will pick up that awesome aura.  </li>
            <li>Somewhat too broad, may be good for others but not for my hair.</li>
            <li>Because it is a great comb for detangling long hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s attractive, and definitely a nice hard wood.</li>
            <li>Smooth, glossy surface, great for combing through wet wavy/curly hair without pulling.</li>
            <li>This comb is a great substitute because of its wide bristles.</li>
            <li>: I have received complimentary or free products for the purpose of this review.</li>
            <li>really yank it out more.  </li>
            <li>I found the aroma to be a bit strong at first and wouldn&#x27;t have recognized it then as sandalwood</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good detangler and a nice comb to use when you just want to spoil yourself a little.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I need...great for combing my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Both my wife and I liked this comb much better than expected.</li>
            <li>Also, it leaves a mild sandle-wood fragrance in my hair along with the shine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>enough, it works a lot better!</li>
            <li>It is a good size for loose and flowing styles.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, my friend loaned the comb to her mother, who has fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>Totally reasonable price along with free shipping, but I subtracted one star because it took almost a month to receive it from China.</li>
            <li>Complimentary product provided for evaluation, but</li>
            <li>More than likely the scent will fade, so I will just enjoy it until it&#x27;s gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good for brushing wet curly hair.</li>
            <li>go right on ahead.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;+Firm, but the wood moves just the right amount</li>
            <li>This comb just glides right thru the hairs with no problem whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Actually, it combs quite smoothly and gets through my hair just fine, AND THE BONUS is that it is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t yank out handfuls of hair!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a small comb in width, but that makes it great for targeting just the area of hair that you&#x27;re working on.</li>
            <li>I like how easy it was to use on my hair , no tangle&#x27;s developed</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually pretty sensitive to strong smells, but I don&#x27;t even notice this one until I have the comb close to my face while I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li>Plus, it didn&#x27;t pull out very much hair.  </li>
            <li>‚Äôs very gentle on my hair, and</li>
            <li>As I get older, I find that my hair is getting thinner and my scalp is getting more sensitive.  </li>
            <li>This Sandalwood comb has a fabulous, natural, woodsy smell that I adore.</li>
            <li>But I always have to use detangling spray and a detangling brush first.  </li>
            <li>So I was interested in seeing what this comb would do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>may just order a second one to keep in my truck.  :)</li>
            <li>This comes from directly from China and does take close to a full month to arrive but worth every day you have to wait.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I love how this comb instantly smooths my hair !</li>
            <li>I love the design of this comb and can‚Äôt imagine going back to using a plastic</li>
            <li>wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect, but I have a weakness for wooden things, and sandlewood, so I thought I‚Äôd check it</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>What a pretty comb this is, these Sandalwood combs are handmade giving each comb character, so no two are alike.</li>
            <li>I love this wooden detangled comb.</li>
            <li>Funny, it&#x27;s the simple items in life that make it better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use--at least as easy as any comb can be to use!--and runs smoothly through hair,</li>
            <li>A nice wooden comb with smooth edges is much gentler on the hair than a standard plastic brush, which means fewer frizzes and tangles.  </li>
            <li>This comb has a nice fragrance and doesn&#x27;t have any sharp edges on the teeth.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it is a nice item.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommend for anyone with long fine hair!</li>
            <li>was really not expecting much, but this comb turned out to be amazing.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much better than your usual cheap plastic</li>
            <li>Some fine-tooth combs can do that, but this one certainly won&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>the comb itself is a nice little comb.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a nice little comb, it doesn&#x27;t snag my longish hair</li>
            <li>I have a bottle of sandalwood essential oil that I add to my diffuser along with other oils because the scent is so pleasant.</li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t make up its mind whether it would like to be straight or wavy.  </li>
            <li>and this is so much softer</li>
            <li>And I really like that they didn‚Äôt paint or dye the wood.</li>
            <li>Is it really sandalwood?  </li>
            <li>One thing I like about natural wooden combs is that they make your hair shinier as you comb through it, plastic combs add static and make my hair frizzier.</li>
            <li>It is a nice heavy, dense wood.</li>
            <li>I have long straight fine hair</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair and this comb detangles it with NO hair breakage.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re needing this comb in a particular time frame, be aware that your shipping time may be wildly understated.  </li>
            <li>bought two pairs of this comb, the first one arrived very fast but the second one lost in transition.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it took the knots out easily, and she didn&#x27;t cry too much about them.</li>
            <li>Brushing my hair has been elevated to a whole new sensual level.   </li>
            <li>The comb you receive is about half the length of the one shown in the product image, but I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since this comb is made out of sandalwood, there is a slight sandalwood scent to it,... which I love.</li>
            <li>&amp; the fact that it is a great simplistic item that just works very well.  </li>
            <li>The price is very affordable, and the comb is durable, sure to last a long time.</li>
            <li>Sample provided and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I do highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The teeth on this comb are smooth, wide, and chunky.</li>
            <li>The natural look is very cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finely finished and solid, not fragile.</li>
            <li>he immediately resent me a new one without any charge.</li>
            <li>Thick wide bristles (great for massaging the scalp, not tangling up hair&lt;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s firm, but has a tiny bit of bend to it, which makes it feel soft and nice on your head.</li>
            <li>It has nice wide teeth and a slight curve that feels like a head massage when you are using it.  </li>
            <li>natural effects&#x27; size of it was at :</li>
            <li>I encourage you to Wikipedia the benefits of Sandal Wood and how this natural Comb can help. .</li>
            <li>My teenage daughter wants one now after she tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It reminds me somewhat of finger-combing as it makes my hair look neater and tamed but it doesn‚Äôt pull the natural wave</li>
            <li>I much prefer the Swissco Tortoise Wide-Tooth Perm Comb, which actually works, unlike this comb.</li>
            <li>So I solicited the help of a young woman</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>IMO, it&#x27;s well worth it if you want a wide tooth comb</li>
            <li>This Outop comb sails right through my hair after washing with absolutely no pulling or snagging, and that is quite an achievement.</li>
            <li>Item offered free in exchange for a review, I&#x27;am open to negative and positive comment&#x27;s</li>
            <li>(i don&#x27;t count mine as long as it&#x27;s not quite to mid back yet), and it&#x27;s compact enough to travel with easily.</li>
            <li>Well the most famous sandalwood is located in South India where production is heavily regulated (because the trees are endangered) and insanely expensive.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it became discolored after use on wet hair--no longer pretty.</li>
            <li>I thought this little comb might work better than her other one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure</li>
            <li>Holding the comb is comfortable, whether you have big or small hands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lovely comb which remind&#x27;s me of a cowboy western movie , those thought&#x27;s developed from it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if anyone else had the same experience, and it did come within the timeframe they gave me, but that was a long time to wait for a new comb.</li>
            <li>This comb is very pretty with the swirls and wood grain pattern, and is small enough to carry in a pocket or toss in</li>
            <li>and I normally use this comb to untangle my hair  when it is wet (after shower or gym).</li>
            <li>After she takes a shower, no matter how much she dries it with a towel and brushes it afterwards, her hair is still a tangled mess.</li>
            <li>get that there are a lot of things that you can buy for six dollars, but I&#x27;m a sucker for natural materials and really like well-made wood items, and I definitely recommend this comb if the style fits your needs.</li>

            <li> you are looking for a pocket size comb that carries a sandal wood aroma you landed on the appropriate product.</li>
            <li> , I love this!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this comb.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> , it is so cute, I had another one from Teatree</li>
            <li> This comb is great for detangling hair when wet and feels great against your scalp.</li>
            <li> Omg I&#x27;m so in love with this...</li>
            <li> (sandalwood is one of my favorite scents).</li>
            <li> Therefore, getting the most good out of this comb depends on making sure you have the right hair for the tooth texture.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also very high quality, made of very nice sandalwood.</li>
            <li> Gone is that snap-crackle-pop sound that means more and more breakage to contend with.</li>
            <li> The teeth are spaced wide apart which is perfect for tangles.</li>
            <li> It does have a light sandalwood scent which isn&#x27;t overwhelming at all--</li>
            <li> best wide tooth combs I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This wide tooth sandal wood comb is absolutely perfect for me.  </li>
            <li> Would have gladly purchased for the $24.99 but at $5.99 plus free shipping, it&#x27;s a steal.</li>
            <li> I enjoy it a lot and can&#x27;t think of any meaningful critiques.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quality is really good, made with real wood.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s attractive, made of natural wood with the wood grain visible (but the surface is smooth with no flaws or defects), and lightweight.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It also did a good job as a scalp massager when combing, felt good in the hand, sturdy and enough weight to be well controlled, lovely natural wood grain can be seen, and just a nice comb all together.  </li>
            <li> The thickness and width of this 1.8 ounce comb makes it easy to hold, even for arthritic hands.  </li>
            <li> comb fits is my hand and is easy to hold as I pull it through my hair.</li>
            <li> Not that there is a strong scent of anything, but</li>
            <li> I think the scent is strong</li>
            <li> the comb, after all, is made of the wood, it isn&#x27;t supposed to smell as strong as the distilled scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell of the sandalwood is really pleasant too but not really noticeable unless you have a great nose or put you nose right up to the comb and smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All of the edges were nicely smoothed, and the tips of the teeth are fairly large - meaning that it isn&#x27;t going to scratch or gouge you.  </li>
            <li> the thought of a sandalwood comb blows my mind, and now I am definitely a huge adherent.</li>
            <li> now I produced finger flowing freely hair from it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like that it is sandalwood, and I enjoy the scent of sandalwood.</li>
            <li> comb is comfortable to hold and appears to be sturdy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, for $5.99 and free shipping,</li>
            <li> and it is so comfortable against my scalp.  </li>
            <li> Free product provided for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a fantastic comb for detangling which is all I wanted.</li>
            <li> This product is built of nice, aromatic sandalwood, a material often used for its preservative qualities, much like cedar.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels really smooth going across your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> : I was sent a free product sample for review.</li>
            <li> sweet sandalwood scent just permeates the wood, far more prevalent than my sandalwood Neko cat key fob, and I expect over time, my hair will pick up that awesome aura.  </li>
            <li> Somewhat too broad, may be good for others but not for my hair.</li>
            <li> Because it is a great comb for detangling long hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s attractive, and definitely a nice hard wood.</li>
            <li> Smooth, glossy surface, great for combing through wet wavy/curly hair without pulling.</li>
            <li> This comb is a great substitute because of its wide bristles.</li>
            <li> : I have received complimentary or free products for the purpose of this review.</li>
            <li> really yank it out more.  </li>
            <li> I found the aroma to be a bit strong at first and wouldn&#x27;t have recognized it then as sandalwood</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good detangler and a nice comb to use when you just want to spoil yourself a little.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I need...great for combing my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Both my wife and I liked this comb much better than expected.</li>
            <li> Also, it leaves a mild sandle-wood fragrance in my hair along with the shine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> enough, it works a lot better!</li>
            <li> It is a good size for loose and flowing styles.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, my friend loaned the comb to her mother, who has fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li> Totally reasonable price along with free shipping, but I subtracted one star because it took almost a month to receive it from China.</li>
            <li> Complimentary product provided for evaluation, but</li>
            <li> More than likely the scent will fade, so I will just enjoy it until it&#x27;s gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good for brushing wet curly hair.</li>
            <li> go right on ahead.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;+Firm, but the wood moves just the right amount</li>
            <li> This comb just glides right thru the hairs with no problem whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Actually, it combs quite smoothly and gets through my hair just fine, AND THE BONUS is that it is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t yank out handfuls of hair!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a small comb in width, but that makes it great for targeting just the area of hair that you&#x27;re working on.</li>
            <li> I like how easy it was to use on my hair , no tangle&#x27;s developed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually pretty sensitive to strong smells, but I don&#x27;t even notice this one until I have the comb close to my face while I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li> Plus, it didn&#x27;t pull out very much hair.  </li>
            <li> ‚Äôs very gentle on my hair, and</li>
            <li> As I get older, I find that my hair is getting thinner and my scalp is getting more sensitive.  </li>
            <li> This Sandalwood comb has a fabulous, natural, woodsy smell that I adore.</li>
            <li> But I always have to use detangling spray and a detangling brush first.  </li>
            <li> So I was interested in seeing what this comb would do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> may just order a second one to keep in my truck.  :)</li>
            <li> This comes from directly from China and does take close to a full month to arrive but worth every day you have to wait.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I love how this comb instantly smooths my hair !</li>
            <li> I love the design of this comb and can‚Äôt imagine going back to using a plastic</li>
            <li> wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect, but I have a weakness for wooden things, and sandlewood, so I thought I‚Äôd check it</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> What a pretty comb this is, these Sandalwood combs are handmade giving each comb character, so no two are alike.</li>
            <li> I love this wooden detangled comb.</li>
            <li> Funny, it&#x27;s the simple items in life that make it better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use--at least as easy as any comb can be to use!--and runs smoothly through hair,</li>
            <li> A nice wooden comb with smooth edges is much gentler on the hair than a standard plastic brush, which means fewer frizzes and tangles.  </li>
            <li> This comb has a nice fragrance and doesn&#x27;t have any sharp edges on the teeth.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it is a nice item.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommend for anyone with long fine hair!</li>
            <li> was really not expecting much, but this comb turned out to be amazing.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much better than your usual cheap plastic</li>
            <li> Some fine-tooth combs can do that, but this one certainly won&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> the comb itself is a nice little comb.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice little comb, it doesn&#x27;t snag my longish hair</li>
            <li> I have a bottle of sandalwood essential oil that I add to my diffuser along with other oils because the scent is so pleasant.</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t make up its mind whether it would like to be straight or wavy.  </li>
            <li> and this is so much softer</li>
            <li> And I really like that they didn‚Äôt paint or dye the wood.</li>
            <li> Is it really sandalwood?  </li>
            <li> One thing I like about natural wooden combs is that they make your hair shinier as you comb through it, plastic combs add static and make my hair frizzier.</li>
            <li> It is a nice heavy, dense wood.</li>
            <li> I have long straight fine hair</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair and this comb detangles it with NO hair breakage.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re needing this comb in a particular time frame, be aware that your shipping time may be wildly understated.  </li>
            <li> bought two pairs of this comb, the first one arrived very fast but the second one lost in transition.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it took the knots out easily, and she didn&#x27;t cry too much about them.</li>
            <li> Brushing my hair has been elevated to a whole new sensual level.   </li>
            <li> The comb you receive is about half the length of the one shown in the product image, but I love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since this comb is made out of sandalwood, there is a slight sandalwood scent to it,... which I love.</li>
            <li> &amp; the fact that it is a great simplistic item that just works very well.  </li>
            <li> The price is very affordable, and the comb is durable, sure to last a long time.</li>
            <li> Sample provided and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I do highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The teeth on this comb are smooth, wide, and chunky.</li>
            <li> The natural look is very cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finely finished and solid, not fragile.</li>
            <li> he immediately resent me a new one without any charge.</li>
            <li> Thick wide bristles (great for massaging the scalp, not tangling up hair&lt;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s firm, but has a tiny bit of bend to it, which makes it feel soft and nice on your head.</li>
            <li> It has nice wide teeth and a slight curve that feels like a head massage when you are using it.  </li>
            <li> natural effects&#x27; size of it was at :</li>
            <li> I encourage you to Wikipedia the benefits of Sandal Wood and how this natural Comb can help. .</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter wants one now after she tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It reminds me somewhat of finger-combing as it makes my hair look neater and tamed but it doesn‚Äôt pull the natural wave</li>
            <li> I much prefer the Swissco Tortoise Wide-Tooth Perm Comb, which actually works, unlike this comb.</li>
            <li> So I solicited the help of a young woman</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> IMO, it&#x27;s well worth it if you want a wide tooth comb</li>
            <li> This Outop comb sails right through my hair after washing with absolutely no pulling or snagging, and that is quite an achievement.</li>
            <li> Item offered free in exchange for a review, I&#x27;am open to negative and positive comment&#x27;s</li>
            <li> (i don&#x27;t count mine as long as it&#x27;s not quite to mid back yet), and it&#x27;s compact enough to travel with easily.</li>
            <li> Well the most famous sandalwood is located in South India where production is heavily regulated (because the trees are endangered) and insanely expensive.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it became discolored after use on wet hair--no longer pretty.</li>
            <li> I thought this little comb might work better than her other one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure</li>
            <li> Holding the comb is comfortable, whether you have big or small hands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lovely comb which remind&#x27;s me of a cowboy western movie , those thought&#x27;s developed from it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if anyone else had the same experience, and it did come within the timeframe they gave me, but that was a long time to wait for a new comb.</li>
            <li> This comb is very pretty with the swirls and wood grain pattern, and is small enough to carry in a pocket or toss in</li>
            <li> and I normally use this comb to untangle my hair  when it is wet (after shower or gym).</li>
            <li> After she takes a shower, no matter how much she dries it with a towel and brushes it afterwards, her hair is still a tangled mess.</li>
            <li> get that there are a lot of things that you can buy for six dollars, but I&#x27;m a sucker for natural materials and really like well-made wood items, and I definitely recommend this comb if the style fits your needs.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a lost wooden comb I&#x27;d had since I was a teenager, and this one seems like it will last just as long.</li>
            <li> that the comb is only about 3.75&amp;#34; long and 2.75&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> even my wife&#x27;s long Asian hair which is a couple feet long.  </li>
            <li> Other plastic and wooden combs have not survived, especially when used by my kids.</li>

            <li> A lot bigger than I expected, also.</li>
            <li> And one other thing is that it&#x27;s not only made of sandalwood, but it smells like it too.</li>

            <li> comb is heavy and solid but small in size.</li>
            <li> The teeth of the comb are spaced very widely, which makes it so that your hair doesn&#x27;t break off, like it does with narrow toothed</li>
            <li> Teeth seem to be slightly longer and rounder at the tips than it appears in the picture</li>

            <li> Too small compared to what I expected.</li>

            <li> Unfortunately, when her hair goes wild as it&#x27;s wont to do, the grain of the wood tends to snag and pull at her curls.</li>

            <li> My oldest daughter has hair like mine- very thick and wavy as it gets longer.</li>
            <li> The detangling brush is a little painful and always pulls out a lot of hair.  </li>

            <li> This Sandalwood comb has a fabulous, natural, woodsy smell that I adore. I haven&#x27;t had a wooden comb for years, and now I remember what I have been missing. I have a selection of plastic wide-tooth combs to detangle my wet hair, which is curly/wavy and color-treated. This Outop comb sails right through my hair after washing with absolutely no pulling or snagging, and that is quite an achievement. Gone is that snap-crackle-pop sound that means more and more breakage to contend with. There is absolutely no comparison to this comb and the others I have been using.

            <li> Both my wife and I liked this comb much better than expected. It has nice wide teeth and a slight curve that feels like a head massage when you are using it.  It&#x27;s easy to use--at least as easy as any comb can be to use!--and runs smoothly through hair, even my wife&#x27;s long Asian hair which is a couple feet long.  I like that it is sandalwood, and I enjoy the scent of sandalwood. Not that there is a strong scent of anything, but just a little lingering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a wonderful comb! Glad to have this in our house!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample received for review.</li>
            <li> I have thick, waist-length hair.  It can&#x27;t make up its mind whether it would like to be straight or wavy.  I shower at night and let my hair air dry.  But I always have to use detangling spray and a detangling brush first.  The detangling brush is a little painful and always pulls out a lot of hair.  So I was interested in seeing what this comb would do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really not expecting much, but this comb turned out to be amazing.  It detangled my hair easily (I did use detangling spray) and it wasn&#x27;t painful at all.  Plus, it didn&#x27;t pull out very much hair.  I am totally switching out my detangling brush and using this instead, from here on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb is comfortable to hold and appears to be sturdy.  It&#x27;s attractive, made of natural wood with the wood grain visible (but the surface is smooth with no flaws or defects), and lightweight.  The teeth don&#x27;t move at all.  I love the faint sandalwood scent, too.  Definitely glad I got a chance to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:4eeb281b9c6feb348aa460222c0e1d07]] Please note: I received a free sample for an evaluation and honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, I know...\\&quot;A video for a comb?  Come on.\\&quot;  :D  I just wanted to show it off and give a sense for the size of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now, these cost about $6.  IMO, it&#x27;s well worth it if you want a wide tooth comb (and these teeth are widely spaced).  This comb has a substantial feel to it, and the fit and finish are great.  All of the edges were nicely smoothed, and the tips of the teeth are fairly large - meaning that it isn&#x27;t going to scratch or gouge you.  Some fine-tooth combs can do that, but this one certainly won&#x27;t.  It feels great running through my hair and over my scalp, and the smell is fantastic.  Well, if you like the smell of sandal wood, that is.  :)  The comb isn&#x27;t going to make your hair smell any different, as you need to hold the comb up to your nose to smell it - but it&#x27;s a very pleasant aroma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get that there are a lot of things that you can buy for six dollars, but I&#x27;m a sucker for natural materials and really like well-made wood items, and I definitely recommend this comb if the style fits your needs.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:63fbe9d1295a489f9abb8c998efabaad]]Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, I L O V E it.  Yes, I have longer hair (call it the Hippy in me), and this comb is just... dude, I grok this sandalwood comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sweet sandalwood scent just permeates the wood, far more prevalent than my sandalwood Neko cat key fob, and I expect over time, my hair will pick up that awesome aura.  And the wood grain is gorgeous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may just order a second one to keep in my truck.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Complimentary product provided for evaluation, but I am glad I accepted... the thought of a sandalwood comb blows my mind, and now I am definitely a huge adherent.</li>
            <li> THIS is a fantastic comb!! It&#x27;s perfect for combing out tangles for kids and adults alike. The comb has a glossy finish and it even smells wonderful!! This comes from directly from China and does take close to a full month to arrive but worth every day you have to wait.&lt;br /&gt;This comb is heavy and solid but small in size. The sandalwood weighs 1.9 ounces and is 4 inches long and 3 inches wide. The teeth are spaced wide apart which is perfect for tangles. It&#x27;s also perfect for not damaging my hair by tugging and pulling and breaking hair!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thrilled! This is truly the best comb I&#x27;ve ever owned!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I have received complimentary or free products for the purpose of this review. The opinions are 100% mine. I have not been influenced in any way.</li>
            <li> Smooth, glossy surface, great for combing through wet wavy/curly hair without pulling. It does have a light sandalwood scent which isn&#x27;t overwhelming at all--I&#x27;m usually pretty sensitive to strong smells, but I don&#x27;t even notice this one until I have the comb close to my face while I&#x27;m using it. I bought this to replace a lost wooden comb I&#x27;d had since I was a teenager, and this one seems like it will last just as long. Totally reasonable price along with free shipping, but I subtracted one star because it took almost a month to receive it from China. I don&#x27;t know if anyone else had the same experience, and it did come within the timeframe they gave me, but that was a long time to wait for a new comb.</li>
            <li> Top Likes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ Sandal Wood (These trees are known for their heavy, yellow and fine-grained appearance. They retain their fragrance for decades according to Wikipedia)&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ Thick wide bristles (great for massaging the scalp, not tangling up hair&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ Glossy finish&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ Aromatic sandal wood smell (contrary to others I think the scent is strong but it doesn‚Äôt bother me)&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ Small enough to stick in back pocket (it‚Äôs about 3.8 inches x 2.8 inches)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ I started getting into skin brushing a year ago and it‚Äôs a little harsh on my scalp. This comb is a great substitute because of its wide bristles. The bristles really do not flex at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a pocket size comb that carries a sandal wood aroma you landed on the appropriate product. I encourage you to Wikipedia the benefits of Sandal Wood and how this natural Comb can help. . I Hope this helps you make your decision.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided this product at a discount for my honest feedback. All of my reviews are comprised of my unbiased, honest opinions.</li>
            <li> Love this comb, absolutely gorgeous. It is so beautifully made. There are a couple things I&#x27;d like to point out though. The comb you receive is about half the length of the one shown in the product image, but I love it. It fits in your hand perfectly. And one other thing is that it&#x27;s not only made of sandalwood, but it smells like it too. I don&#x27;t think it smells bad at all though. If you have an aversion to scents though, I might think twice about getting this product. All around, it is a wonderful item. I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> the comb itself is a nice little comb.  it does its job well, it smells nice.  the one star is for the ship time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i had FORGOTTEN that i ordered this comb, which is no big deal (this was a second order, for traveling).  but when i looked up my orders, this was supposed to be delivered by february 17.  today is march 3.  if you&#x27;re needing this comb in a particular time frame, be aware that your shipping time may be wildly understated.  but if it&#x27;s not an issue?  go right on ahead.  it&#x27;s a nice little comb, it doesn&#x27;t snag my longish hair (i don&#x27;t count mine as long as it&#x27;s not quite to mid back yet), and it&#x27;s compact enough to travel with easily.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:294544b5a91a3f48c792a8eac9c05ba4]] This is an excellent comb. I&#x27;m bald and I haven&#x27;t used a comb in over twenty years, so I got all of these comments from my girlfriend, who loves this comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a small comb in width, but that makes it great for targeting just the area of hair that you&#x27;re working on. It&#x27;s firm, but has a tiny bit of bend to it, which makes it feel soft and nice on your head. The teeth of the comb are spaced very widely, which makes it so that your hair doesn&#x27;t break off, like it does with narrow toothed combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also very high quality, made of very nice sandalwood. My girlfriend recommends it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+High quality material&lt;br /&gt;+Firm, but the wood moves just the right amount&lt;br /&gt;+Wide tooth protects hair from damage&lt;br /&gt;+Small form allows for a lot of control when combing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Very hard for bald guys to review this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Outop gave me this comb to review*</li>
            <li> A simple SANDAL WOOD comb (even smells like sandal wood!) for everyday use that won&#x27;t kill your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was offered to sample this comb for an exchange of an honest review.  I&#x27;m 48, have thinning hair, and regular brushes and combs really yank it out more.  I had my doubts using this comb, as I didn&#x27;t think it would comb well.  I&#x27;m glad I was wrong!  Actually, it combs quite smoothly and gets through my hair just fine, AND THE BONUS is that it is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t yank out handfuls of hair!  I was quite surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also did a good job as a scalp massager when combing, felt good in the hand, sturdy and enough weight to be well controlled, lovely natural wood grain can be seen, and just a nice comb all together.  My teenage daughter wants one now after she tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for $5.99 and free shipping, &amp; the fact that it is a great simplistic item that just works very well.  I do highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love how this comb instantly smooths my hair !</li>
            <li> best wide tooth combs I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Somewhat too broad, may be good for others but not for my hair. Quality is really good, made with real wood.</li>
            <li> I just used this comb on my daughter&#x27;s hair. Maybe 10 stroke in, I noticed one of the teeth have split. So evey time I would comb through her hair, it would pull it, and clumps of hair would be pulled out. Other than that, it took the knots out easily, and she didn&#x27;t cry too much about them. This product would of been great if it didn&#x27;t splinter so easily.</li>
            <li> As I get older, I find that my hair is getting thinner and my scalp is getting more sensitive.  I had been using a wide tooth plastic comb on my wet hair to avoid breakage but the plastic was not gentle enough on my scalp.  This wide tooth sandal wood comb is absolutely perfect for me.  It glides through my hair whether wet or dry and it is so comfortable against my scalp.  The thickness and width of this 1.8 ounce comb makes it easy to hold, even for arthritic hands.  I love the design of this comb and can‚Äôt imagine going back to using a plastic comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:  The comb was sent to me for trial and honest evaluation and my opinion is based solely on my perception of the merits of the product.</li>
            <li> Free product provided for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I love this!&lt;br /&gt;I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect, but I have a weakness for wooden things, and sandlewood, so I thought I‚Äôd check it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s attractive, and definitely a nice hard wood. It looks, feels, and smells like sandalwood to me.  It&#x27;s not highly scented- the comb, after all, is made of the wood, it isn&#x27;t supposed to smell as strong as the distilled scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It‚Äôs great!  My hair is med-fine and very long.  This comb gets the tangles out and combs with without a lot of hair loss.  It reminds me somewhat of finger-combing as it makes my hair look neater and tamed but it doesn‚Äôt pull the natural wave out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It‚Äôs very gentle on my hair, and my scalp, and the shape of the comb makes it quite pleasurable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably buy another couple of these for my purse and work desk.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend for anyone with long fine hair!</li>
            <li> Ordered this comb to get rid of any tangles in my beard after a shower because the generic plastic combs are just really bad all around. This comb just glides right thru the hairs with no problem whatsoever. Very good quality. A lot bigger than I expected, also. Would have gladly purchased for the $24.99 but at $5.99 plus free shipping, it&#x27;s a steal.</li>
            <li> I have long straight fine hair and I normally use this comb to untangle my hair  when it is wet (after shower or gym). This is so far the best comb I have found for my hair type.&lt;br /&gt;I bought two pairs of this comb, the first one arrived very fast but the second one lost in transition. I notified the seller and she/he immediately resent me a new one without any charge.</li>
            <li> Teeth seem to be slightly longer and rounder at the tips than it appears in the picture but that is not a problem.  It is a fantastic comb for detangling which is all I wanted. Thanks!</li>
            <li> A nice wooden comb with smooth edges is much gentler on the hair than a standard plastic brush, which means fewer frizzes and tangles.  This comb has a nice fragrance and doesn&#x27;t have any sharp edges on the teeth.  It is a good size for loose and flowing styles.  I enjoy it a lot and can&#x27;t think of any meaningful critiques.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the company for a review unit.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I need...great for combing my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this comb. This is a little comb that conveniently fits in my little purse.&lt;br /&gt;De-tangles my hair very smoothly and painlessly. Also, it leaves a mild sandle-wood fragrance in my hair along with the shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Because it is a great comb for detangling long hair. Other plastic and wooden combs have not survived, especially when used by my kids. These are still doing the job for me and one child, so we bought a third. Yes, they tend to change color, but that does not affect how they work.</li>
            <li> Teeth are too thick and rounded to work well. Plus, it became discolored after use on wet hair--no longer pretty. Also, it is heavy to carry in a pocketbook. I much prefer the Swissco Tortoise Wide-Tooth Perm Comb, which actually works, unlike this comb.</li>
            <li> Have ordered a few wooden combs.&lt;br /&gt;Alas, misplaced this one and will order again.&lt;br /&gt;Superior to nylon.</li>
            <li> No sandalwood scent. I doubt it is actually sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;Has a small Chinese inscription on it</li>
            <li> Oh my God I love this, it is so cute, I had another one from Teatree and this is so much softer it is really smooth and good quality I use it to come out my hair before use the bar bristle brush but try not to use it when my hair is wet</li>
            <li> This product is built of nice, aromatic sandalwood, a material often used for its preservative qualities, much like cedar. It is a sensual pleasure to handle this comb and to run it through long, thick hair. Unfortunately, with middle age and male pattern baldness, I no longer have the long, thick hair of my twenties. So I solicited the help of a young woman I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend has coarse, wavy hair that tends toward frizz in the humidity. She informed me that combing her hair with this comb was an ease and a joy *if* her hair was already combed and detangled. Unfortunately, when her hair goes wild as it&#x27;s wont to do, the grain of the wood tends to snag and pull at her curls. (The actual comb doesn&#x27;t have the shiny finish shown in the product photograph.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my friend loaned the comb to her mother, who has fine, straight hair. My friend&#x27;s mother agreed that using this comb was a pleasure, both for the feel of its thick teeth in her hair, and for the sandalwood fragrance, which tends to transfer. Therefore, getting the most good out of this comb depends on making sure you have the right hair for the tooth texture.</li>
            <li> What a pretty comb this is, these Sandalwood combs are handmade giving each comb character, so no two are alike. The finish is smooth and glides through my hair very nicely. My hair is a bit below my shoulders and is very thick. This comb works great getting through my hair. The teeth on this comb are smooth, wide, and chunky. It feels very nice on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this comb is made out of sandalwood, there is a slight sandalwood scent to it,... which I love. I have a bottle of sandalwood essential oil that I add to my diffuser along with other oils because the scent is so pleasant. More than likely the scent will fade, so I will just enjoy it until it&#x27;s gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comb fits is my hand and is easy to hold as I pull it through my hair. One thing I like about natural wooden combs is that they make your hair shinier as you comb through it, plastic combs add static and make my hair frizzier. This comb is very pretty with the swirls and wood grain pattern, and is small enough to carry in a pocket or toss in your bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Free product sample received in exchange for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I love this wooden detangled comb. I keep it in my purse and use it everyday. I also like the feel of it on my hair. I recommend this comb.</li>
            <li> My oldest daughter has hair like mine- very thick and wavy as it gets longer. After she takes a shower, no matter how much she dries it with a towel and brushes it afterwards, her hair is still a tangled mess. I thought this little comb might work better than her other one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure enough, it works a lot better! This comb is great for detangling hair when wet and feels great against your scalp. The bristles (I guess that‚Äôs what you‚Äôd call them) have rounded tips so there‚Äôs nothing digging into your skin or any uncomfortable feelings. It may sport a basic design but that helps get the job done. Holding the comb is comfortable, whether you have big or small hands. And I really like that they didn‚Äôt paint or dye the wood. The natural look is very cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There‚Äôs not much else to say here. If you like combs of this variety, you can‚Äôt go wrong with this one. The price is very affordable, and the comb is durable, sure to last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair and this comb detangles it with NO hair breakage. Wow. I have never had a comb this good and I&#x27;ve tried other wood handled brushes.  Is it really sandalwood?  Well the most famous sandalwood is located in South India where production is heavily regulated (because the trees are endangered) and insanely expensive.  At this price I doubt this comb is Indian sandalwood. It could be Australian or another less endangered but really-fine-smelling member of the sandalwood family. Bottom line: this comb&#x27;s sandalwood scent fills my bathroom and I comb my hair just to smell it. Brushing my hair has been elevated to a whole new sensual level.   It is a nice heavy, dense wood. Omg I&#x27;m so in love with this... I&#x27;m going to buy another one.</li>
            <li> Too small compared to what I expected. Other than that it is a nice item.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice comb. It feels good in my hand and glides smoothly through my hair. I found the aroma to be a bit strong at first and wouldn&#x27;t have recognized it then as sandalwood but it has mellowed over time and now I find it very pleasant (sandalwood is one of my favorite scents). This is a pretty good detangler and a nice comb to use when you just want to spoil yourself a little.</li>
            <li> I found this to be a very nice comb. The smell of the sandalwood is really pleasant too but not really noticeable unless you have a great nose or put you nose right up to the comb and smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels really smooth going across your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that the comb is only about 3.75&amp;#34; long and 2.75&amp;#34; high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A comb like this would also make a nice gift... it&#x27;s much better than your usual cheap plastic comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I was sent a free product sample for review. I was not paid or told what to write.</li>
            <li> Good for brushing wet curly hair. The sandle wood has a pleasant sent.</li>
            <li> Finely finished and solid, not fragile. No discernible scent.</li>
            <li> This is super great for de-tangling after washing and in the morning.  Take it with me when I travel even.  Won&#x27;t do without it.  Funny, it&#x27;s the simple items in life that make it better.</li>
