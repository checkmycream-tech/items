            <li>Def. satisfied!</li>
            <li>I love all the brush heads that come with it!</li>
            <li>I did not think I would use the sponge, which helps apply face lotion, but it is probably my favorite!</li>
            <li>and I think I like the SonicDerm better!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>love the way this makes my face and body feel!</li>
            <li>This is primarily why I wanted to try the Sonicderm, so I am extremely happy.  </li>
            <li>The price is also amazing, compared to name brand brushes like Clairsonic for $100</li>
            <li>I enjoy the variety of brush heads as well.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, great value.</li>
            <li>The sponge head is AMAZING for rubbing moisturizer into your face</li>
            <li>Nice ergonomically and water proof.</li>
            <li>I rate it 5 stars since the product works well, it came in a nice package, convenient to place in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>Did not have to use the pumice since I already own a pedi  appliance.</li>
            <li>Until then, I really liked it.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a replacement because there are so many good reviews, I assumed I received a defective model, where the handle mechanism was just defective.</li>
            <li>Nice gift to give.</li>
            <li>Nice box too.</li>
            <li>Thank you SonicDerm, that was a nice way to make things right for me!!!</li>
            <li>This machine is my new best friend.  </li>
            <li>She also loved the box it came in as it keeps everything organized and easy to take with her.</li>
            <li>Kind of just ok.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say I am so glad I didn&#x27;t spend $100 for one of these.</li>
            <li>Definitely a good clean.</li>
            <li>This product works great with my own gentle cleanser (I use a Cetaphil cleanser)</li>
            <li>A good inexpensive alternative to get your skin really clean.</li>
            <li>Wish they sent more of that size and kept the others</li>
            <li>Love the interchangeable brushes.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the pedicure attachment.  </li>
            <li>So glad I did not spend $100</li>
            <li>I love it, love the brushes that comes with.</li>
            <li>My skin feels and looks a lot better.</li>
            <li>I bought them for my wife and my sister-in-law, they love them</li>
            <li>I love that I can scrub my face in the shower</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also decided to buy more for my girlfriends as a gift.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>I had an Oil of olay scrubbing brush before this one and this is 100% better.</li>
            <li>It spins faster and the brushes are much better quality.</li>
            <li>I love that it is waterproof and the brushes hold up and don&#x27;t fall apart like others</li>
            <li>Looks kind of cheap but works like a charm.  </li>
            <li>When I was done (I wanted to scrub and scrub but knew better)</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it every day, but more like twice a week.  </li>
            <li>He loves it and therefore is taking better care of his skin.  </li>
            <li>I love this unit.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love all the brushes/attachments included.</li>
            <li>I love the attachments that came with it and not a wimpy spin.  </li>
            <li>Love how my face feels after i use it.</li>
            <li>It runs on 2 AA batteries (which I find more convenient than rechargeable appliances).</li>
            <li>I love the SonicDerm.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this face brush.</li>
            <li>love the way they did it too, no excuses</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Love the feeling of my squeaky clean face!</li>
            <li>It feels very clean and looks a lot brighter.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good.</li>
            <li>Good quality and very well presented!</li>
            <li>Works pretty good.</li>
            <li>Comes in a handy case, but kind of large.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more powerful, it has a great selection of attachments, and the replacement heads are so reasonably priced!</li>
            <li>I recommend this if you want to fight acne or just want a better clean.</li>
            <li>The unit is easy to operate</li>
            <li>It is gentle,yet removes makeup easily.</li>
            <li>The sponge attachment removes easily.</li>
            <li>After working in the yard, being able to come in use the big brush in the shower is great.  </li>
            <li>a great product, have enjoyed using it on my face daily.</li>
            <li>It provides strong exfoliation without irritation.  </li>
            <li>Nice item, seen results within the first week.</li>
            <li>Which tells me these people certainly read their reviews and I stand corrected!!!</li>
            <li>Love the pumice stone attachment for quick feet touch-ups.</li>
            <li>It works great and all the different scrubber heads are cool!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also really easy to clean the brushes.</li>
            <li>My face feels really smooth after using this.</li>
            <li>Really great product that I actually caught my husband using!</li>
            <li>all my make-up was cleaned away and my face felt really smooth and</li>
            <li>I love all the different heads and the fact that it runs on batteries,especially good for traveling out of the country.</li>
            <li>so I have nothing to compare it to except good old washcloth.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So Far so good.  </li>
            <li>So far I have loved what I have seen.</li>
            <li>Looks good, so far.  </li>
            <li>Need to use it longer for a true review but so far, so good.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive the cleansing system and can&#x27;t wait to use it.  </li>
            <li>Great value, I would DEFINITELY buy again and LOVE that the price is much lower than the Clairsonic</li>
            <li>I also love using the pumice to get my feet ready for sandal season!</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend for anyone wanting the power and benefits of the popular brand but not wanting to pay the price!</li>
            <li>small bristle head is awesome for face cleansing.</li>
            <li>I had to replace original one because water got inside.  </li>
            <li>my skin was clean.</li>
            <li>My skin feels really clean and it does a thorough job removing all makeup.</li>
            <li>Dont feel like I will be using hands to clean my face ever again.</li>
            <li>Large brush is great for shoulders and back and standard brush is great for face and neck.</li>
            <li>Priced right!</li>
            <li>Fun quick easy spa for a pick me up</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t like how powerful this was compared to the oil of olay face brush, but now that I&#x27;ve gotten used to it, I like it better.</li>
            <li>I loved it until the motor went out after the third day.</li>
            <li>Love this product for deep cleaning and it erases fine lines!  </li>
            <li>It is NOT made to withstand dropping, the very first use in the shower I dropped it</li>
            <li>I bought it to help clear up some acne and to get a better clean.</li>
            <li>What really upsets me is, that I got the replacement brushes too and now I am out around $50.- and nothing to show for!!</li>
            <li>Great little machine.  </li>
            <li>Doesnt seem incredibly powerful</li>
            <li>the price, it is totally worth buying this product, but sometimes it hurts a bit if I have a pimple on my face, so I&#x27;d just wash my face without it and apply moisturizer with the sponge afterward.</li>
            <li>It actually tugs at your skin a bit which I liked,  </li>
            <li>The big brush was nice to use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>bristles a bit soft but ok.</li>
            <li>This is so much fun.</li>
            <li>Body scrubber is nice - but soft - so doesn&#x27;t really help exfoliate knees &amp; elbows.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and good for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Powerful like item...</li>
            <li>Love the price, love the gentle facial brush, leaves face smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Was hoping for some sonic action, but got the more mechanical fast spinning.</li>
            <li>, just sent the new unit and there you have it!!!</li>
            <li>worked very well!  </li>
            <li>Brushes really scrub!</li>
            <li>This is my first set of cleansing tools</li>
            <li>This is my first face brush</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like to sponge but love the big brush.</li>
            <li>I was able to put back together but the washer ring to ensure it is waterproof broke</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to do a fabulous job deep cleaning, but for the price, not a bad product.</li>
            <li>I would use the sponge attachment to apply my lotion on my face and it really helped moisturized!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the face brush and body brush so far, but I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>First, that it was defective - the heads would not stay on the handle.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush!</li>
            <li>The first time I used the SonicDerm -</li>
            <li>After the first use my skin already looked better; my skin was smoother and my pores were cleaned out which gave my face a fresher, dare I say younger look.</li>
            <li>Really love this for my face &amp; the big brush for my body.  </li>
            <li>My face felt so soft after every clean.</li>
            <li>, I think this is a wise choice if you have been thinking about buying the more expensive Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>The brush is the right size for my face, is gentle on my skin and the speed is just right..not too fast or aggressive.  </li>
            <li>The large brush for the body now flies off.  </li>
            <li>but my skin has cleared up really well.</li>
            <li>I do really like this set.</li>
            <li>The brush gently exfoliated my skin and it has been glowingand looking cleaner each passing day.</li>
            <li>My skin looks so much healthier for this item.  </li>
            <li>but I am not convinced that the pumice is doing much of anything.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too smooth and there&#x27;s not enough power in the tool for exfoliating tougher areas.  </li>
            <li>The pumice, not so much.    </li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use to pumice or the sponge.</li>
            <li>This makes it so much easier.</li>
            <li>My face is much clearer.</li>
            <li>The brush seems to be holding up really well also.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the facial scrub and it is not too abrasive on your skin.</li>
            <li>to you, I really appreciate the customer service!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Doesnt have as much power as I thought but still seems to do what its supposed to.</li>
            <li>I received the SonicDerm as a present, and it worked so well originally.</li>
            <li>Prior to using the Sonicderm Cleansing System I could not get my face completely clean.  </li>
            <li>, my sensitive skin hurt a little from using it all the time, but it&#x27;s still a good product for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Thank you SonicDerm for making a product that is not only good in construction but has several brushes for different uses.</li>
            <li>I have used only the face brush so far, but the other two also seem to be good and usable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t buy one of the $100 to $200 devices that are less</li>
            <li>Looks more sturdy than my previous cleanser.</li>
            <li>With the different attachments it is able to perform multiple function for skincare.  </li>
            <li>It packs a lot of power and instead of having to wait for it to recharge (like my old Clarisonic), I can just pop in new batteries and I am ready to go!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product to all.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>also love that this device was able to be completely submerged in the tub without any ill effects.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical, but decided to try it after reading the great reviews.  </li>
            <li>Waterp (New)  </li>
            <li>company responded to my brush flying off and sent me a package of new brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li>It is great though do not press hard and leave your skin wet when you use it.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have enough power to clean the soles of my feet and the bristles from the face brushes are kind of too scratchy and irritating, although i do not have a sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin is loving it despite the harsh weather where I am currently living.</li>
            <li>As I have gotten older, by skin has not shed dead skin on my face as easily as before.  </li>
            <li>I have very very sensitive skin and was nervous about buying a cleansing brush.</li>
            <li>Was good the first few tries, but after that it didn&#x27;t have the same juice.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t stop feeling how soft my heels were after using it!  </li>
            <li>but it works enough for me that I don&#x27;t feel the need to try the higher priced brush.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using such a divice,so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.</li>
            <li>Due to cancer, I had to have surgery on my face with a nose graft - the Sonic Derm is gentle and I&#x27;m not afraid to use it on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I feel like it definitely gives my face a deep clean.  </li>
            <li>have to edit the above review, the people at Sonic Derm just sent me a brand new unit, as well as a new set of replacement brushes!!</li>
            <li>i liked this product but it seams a bit weak compared to its competitors and also its advertised as water proof</li>
            <li>Also just sent an email to the website and really do not expect much!!</li>
            <li>The only thing I would change is to put a little texture on the handle so you can get a better soapy grip in the shower.</li>
            <li>My daughter has used it once so far.</li>
            <li>Not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to keep an eye on some problem areas to see if there is improvement as far as pores getting cleaned out and maybe shrinking.  </li>
            <li>The pumice is a joke though as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised batteries were not included.  </li>
            <li>…needs to go faster and feel seamless.</li>
            <li>Soft brush.</li>
            <li>The brushes are stiffer than my old brand that died again.  </li>
            <li>I still like my old one called Episonic</li>
            <li>high table next to the shower and</li>
            <li>It is waterproof, very functional, easy to use/simple and I&#x27;ve noticed after using the face one my face feels cleaner and looks less dark.</li>
            <li>The large bristle head I used almost as a dry brush before the bath</li>
            <li>This is a quality product, for much less than many of the other better-known brands.  </li>
            <li>Other than that I really like washing my face with it!</li>
            <li>Order was timely.item housed  In a beautiful black expensive looking box.</li>
            <li>This little brush is powerful.</li>
            <li>The only thing I dislike (and I don&#x27;t think can be fixed) is when I use it some soap and water sprays around.</li>
            <li>I bought the SonicDerm Professional SPA Cleansing System and have been using it daily for over a week.</li>
            <li>its no lightweight barely there cleanse,  it is a substantial cleaner.</li>
            <li>I bought a second one of these for my son who is 13 years old.  </li>
            <li>SonicDerm Professional Spa Cleansing System SD-201, Rotating Brush Head for Deep Cleansing and Exfoliation, 4 in 1 Brush,</li>
            <li>Cleans thoroughly but does not dry my skin.  </li>
            <li>Works as good as the other expensive brand.</li>
            <li>When I first got it I used it once everyday, but now I use it only twice a week</li>
            <li>My skin was also soft and smooth, but hasn&#x27;t typically been rough so the change was less dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> Def. satisfied!</li>
            <li> I love all the brush heads that come with it!</li>
            <li> I did not think I would use the sponge, which helps apply face lotion, but it is probably my favorite!</li>
            <li> and I think I like the SonicDerm better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and LOVE it!  </li>
            <li> love the way this makes my face and body feel!</li>
            <li> This is primarily why I wanted to try the Sonicderm, so I am extremely happy.  </li>
            <li> The price is also amazing, compared to name brand brushes like Clairsonic for $100</li>
            <li> I enjoy the variety of brush heads as well.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, great value.</li>
            <li> The sponge head is AMAZING for rubbing moisturizer into your face</li>
            <li> Nice ergonomically and water proof.</li>
            <li> I rate it 5 stars since the product works well, it came in a nice package, convenient to place in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Did not have to use the pumice since I already own a pedi  appliance.</li>
            <li> Until then, I really liked it.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a replacement because there are so many good reviews, I assumed I received a defective model, where the handle mechanism was just defective.</li>
            <li> Nice gift to give.</li>
            <li> Nice box too.</li>
            <li> Thank you SonicDerm, that was a nice way to make things right for me!!!</li>
            <li> This machine is my new best friend.  </li>
            <li> She also loved the box it came in as it keeps everything organized and easy to take with her.</li>
            <li> Kind of just ok.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say I am so glad I didn&#x27;t spend $100 for one of these.</li>
            <li> Definitely a good clean.</li>
            <li> This product works great with my own gentle cleanser (I use a Cetaphil cleanser)</li>
            <li> A good inexpensive alternative to get your skin really clean.</li>
            <li> Wish they sent more of that size and kept the others</li>
            <li> Love the interchangeable brushes.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the pedicure attachment.  </li>
            <li> So glad I did not spend $100</li>
            <li> I love it, love the brushes that comes with.</li>
            <li> My skin feels and looks a lot better.</li>
            <li> I bought them for my wife and my sister-in-law, they love them</li>
            <li> I love that I can scrub my face in the shower</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also decided to buy more for my girlfriends as a gift.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> I had an Oil of olay scrubbing brush before this one and this is 100% better.</li>
            <li> It spins faster and the brushes are much better quality.</li>
            <li> I love that it is waterproof and the brushes hold up and don&#x27;t fall apart like others</li>
            <li> Looks kind of cheap but works like a charm.  </li>
            <li> When I was done (I wanted to scrub and scrub but knew better)</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it every day, but more like twice a week.  </li>
            <li> He loves it and therefore is taking better care of his skin.  </li>
            <li> I love this unit.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love all the brushes/attachments included.</li>
            <li> I love the attachments that came with it and not a wimpy spin.  </li>
            <li> Love how my face feels after i use it.</li>
            <li> It runs on 2 AA batteries (which I find more convenient than rechargeable appliances).</li>
            <li> I love the SonicDerm.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this face brush.</li>
            <li> love the way they did it too, no excuses</li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Love the feeling of my squeaky clean face!</li>
            <li> It feels very clean and looks a lot brighter.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good.</li>
            <li> Good quality and very well presented!</li>
            <li> Works pretty good.</li>
            <li> Comes in a handy case, but kind of large.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more powerful, it has a great selection of attachments, and the replacement heads are so reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> I recommend this if you want to fight acne or just want a better clean.</li>
            <li> The unit is easy to operate</li>
            <li> It is gentle,yet removes makeup easily.</li>
            <li> The sponge attachment removes easily.</li>
            <li> After working in the yard, being able to come in use the big brush in the shower is great.  </li>
            <li> a great product, have enjoyed using it on my face daily.</li>
            <li> It provides strong exfoliation without irritation.  </li>
            <li> Nice item, seen results within the first week.</li>
            <li> Which tells me these people certainly read their reviews and I stand corrected!!!</li>
            <li> Love the pumice stone attachment for quick feet touch-ups.</li>
            <li> It works great and all the different scrubber heads are cool!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also really easy to clean the brushes.</li>
            <li> My face feels really smooth after using this.</li>
            <li> Really great product that I actually caught my husband using!</li>
            <li> all my make-up was cleaned away and my face felt really smooth and</li>
            <li> I love all the different heads and the fact that it runs on batteries,especially good for traveling out of the country.</li>
            <li> so I have nothing to compare it to except good old washcloth.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So Far so good.  </li>
            <li> So far I have loved what I have seen.</li>
            <li> Looks good, so far.  </li>
            <li> Need to use it longer for a true review but so far, so good.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive the cleansing system and can&#x27;t wait to use it.  </li>
            <li> Great value, I would DEFINITELY buy again and LOVE that the price is much lower than the Clairsonic</li>
            <li> I also love using the pumice to get my feet ready for sandal season!</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend for anyone wanting the power and benefits of the popular brand but not wanting to pay the price!</li>
            <li> small bristle head is awesome for face cleansing.</li>
            <li> I had to replace original one because water got inside.  </li>
            <li> my skin was clean.</li>
            <li> My skin feels really clean and it does a thorough job removing all makeup.</li>
            <li> Dont feel like I will be using hands to clean my face ever again.</li>
            <li> Large brush is great for shoulders and back and standard brush is great for face and neck.</li>
            <li> Priced right!</li>
            <li> Fun quick easy spa for a pick me up</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like how powerful this was compared to the oil of olay face brush, but now that I&#x27;ve gotten used to it, I like it better.</li>
            <li> I loved it until the motor went out after the third day.</li>
            <li> Love this product for deep cleaning and it erases fine lines!  </li>
            <li> It is NOT made to withstand dropping, the very first use in the shower I dropped it</li>
            <li> I bought it to help clear up some acne and to get a better clean.</li>
            <li> What really upsets me is, that I got the replacement brushes too and now I am out around $50.- and nothing to show for!!</li>
            <li> Great little machine.  </li>
            <li> Doesnt seem incredibly powerful</li>
            <li> the price, it is totally worth buying this product, but sometimes it hurts a bit if I have a pimple on my face, so I&#x27;d just wash my face without it and apply moisturizer with the sponge afterward.</li>
            <li> It actually tugs at your skin a bit which I liked,  </li>
            <li> The big brush was nice to use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> bristles a bit soft but ok.</li>
            <li> This is so much fun.</li>
            <li> Body scrubber is nice - but soft - so doesn&#x27;t really help exfoliate knees &amp; elbows.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and good for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Powerful like item...</li>
            <li> Love the price, love the gentle facial brush, leaves face smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Was hoping for some sonic action, but got the more mechanical fast spinning.</li>
            <li> , just sent the new unit and there you have it!!!</li>
            <li> worked very well!  </li>
            <li> Brushes really scrub!</li>
            <li> This is my first set of cleansing tools</li>
            <li> This is my first face brush</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like to sponge but love the big brush.</li>
            <li> I was able to put back together but the washer ring to ensure it is waterproof broke</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do a fabulous job deep cleaning, but for the price, not a bad product.</li>
            <li> I would use the sponge attachment to apply my lotion on my face and it really helped moisturized!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the face brush and body brush so far, but I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> First, that it was defective - the heads would not stay on the handle.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush!</li>
            <li> The first time I used the SonicDerm -</li>
            <li> After the first use my skin already looked better; my skin was smoother and my pores were cleaned out which gave my face a fresher, dare I say younger look.</li>
            <li> Really love this for my face &amp; the big brush for my body.  </li>
            <li> My face felt so soft after every clean.</li>
            <li> , I think this is a wise choice if you have been thinking about buying the more expensive Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> The brush is the right size for my face, is gentle on my skin and the speed is just right..not too fast or aggressive.  </li>
            <li> The large brush for the body now flies off.  </li>
            <li> but my skin has cleared up really well.</li>
            <li> I do really like this set.</li>
            <li> The brush gently exfoliated my skin and it has been glowingand looking cleaner each passing day.</li>
            <li> My skin looks so much healthier for this item.  </li>
            <li> but I am not convinced that the pumice is doing much of anything.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too smooth and there&#x27;s not enough power in the tool for exfoliating tougher areas.  </li>
            <li> The pumice, not so much.    </li>
            <li> Really like it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use to pumice or the sponge.</li>
            <li> This makes it so much easier.</li>
            <li> My face is much clearer.</li>
            <li> The brush seems to be holding up really well also.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the facial scrub and it is not too abrasive on your skin.</li>
            <li> to you, I really appreciate the customer service!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Doesnt have as much power as I thought but still seems to do what its supposed to.</li>
            <li> I received the SonicDerm as a present, and it worked so well originally.</li>
            <li> Prior to using the Sonicderm Cleansing System I could not get my face completely clean.  </li>
            <li> , my sensitive skin hurt a little from using it all the time, but it&#x27;s still a good product for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Thank you SonicDerm for making a product that is not only good in construction but has several brushes for different uses.</li>
            <li> I have used only the face brush so far, but the other two also seem to be good and usable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t buy one of the $100 to $200 devices that are less</li>
            <li> Looks more sturdy than my previous cleanser.</li>
            <li> With the different attachments it is able to perform multiple function for skincare.  </li>
            <li> It packs a lot of power and instead of having to wait for it to recharge (like my old Clarisonic), I can just pop in new batteries and I am ready to go!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the product to all.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> also love that this device was able to be completely submerged in the tub without any ill effects.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but decided to try it after reading the great reviews.  </li>
            <li> Waterp (New)  </li>
            <li> company responded to my brush flying off and sent me a package of new brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li> It is great though do not press hard and leave your skin wet when you use it.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have enough power to clean the soles of my feet and the bristles from the face brushes are kind of too scratchy and irritating, although i do not have a sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My skin is loving it despite the harsh weather where I am currently living.</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older, by skin has not shed dead skin on my face as easily as before.  </li>
            <li> I have very very sensitive skin and was nervous about buying a cleansing brush.</li>
            <li> Was good the first few tries, but after that it didn&#x27;t have the same juice.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stop feeling how soft my heels were after using it!  </li>
            <li> but it works enough for me that I don&#x27;t feel the need to try the higher priced brush.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using such a divice,so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.</li>
            <li> Due to cancer, I had to have surgery on my face with a nose graft - the Sonic Derm is gentle and I&#x27;m not afraid to use it on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I feel like it definitely gives my face a deep clean.  </li>
            <li> have to edit the above review, the people at Sonic Derm just sent me a brand new unit, as well as a new set of replacement brushes!!</li>
            <li> i liked this product but it seams a bit weak compared to its competitors and also its advertised as water proof</li>
            <li> Also just sent an email to the website and really do not expect much!!</li>
            <li> The only thing I would change is to put a little texture on the handle so you can get a better soapy grip in the shower.</li>
            <li> My daughter has used it once so far.</li>
            <li> Not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep an eye on some problem areas to see if there is improvement as far as pores getting cleaned out and maybe shrinking.  </li>
            <li> The pumice is a joke though as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised batteries were not included.  </li>
            <li> …needs to go faster and feel seamless.</li>
            <li> Soft brush.</li>
            <li> The brushes are stiffer than my old brand that died again.  </li>
            <li> I still like my old one called Episonic</li>
            <li> high table next to the shower and</li>
            <li> It is waterproof, very functional, easy to use/simple and I&#x27;ve noticed after using the face one my face feels cleaner and looks less dark.</li>
            <li> The large bristle head I used almost as a dry brush before the bath</li>
            <li> This is a quality product, for much less than many of the other better-known brands.  </li>
            <li> Other than that I really like washing my face with it!</li>
            <li> Order was timely.item housed  In a beautiful black expensive looking box.</li>
            <li> This little brush is powerful.</li>
            <li> The only thing I dislike (and I don&#x27;t think can be fixed) is when I use it some soap and water sprays around.</li>
            <li> I bought the SonicDerm Professional SPA Cleansing System and have been using it daily for over a week.</li>
            <li> its no lightweight barely there cleanse,  it is a substantial cleaner.</li>
            <li> I bought a second one of these for my son who is 13 years old.  </li>
            <li> SonicDerm Professional Spa Cleansing System SD-201, Rotating Brush Head for Deep Cleansing and Exfoliation, 4 in 1 Brush,</li>
            <li> Cleans thoroughly but does not dry my skin.  </li>
            <li> Works as good as the other expensive brand.</li>
            <li> When I first got it I used it once everyday, but now I use it only twice a week</li>
            <li> My skin was also soft and smooth, but hasn&#x27;t typically been rough so the change was less dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wanted to clear up some of my acne near my T-Zone area and applied Cetaphil facial cleanser and used the small brush.</li>
            <li> The little brush got worn out a little quick, but it does its job.</li>
            <li> I have high hopes and will update in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see how often you have to replace batteries.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that it can be used in the shower if need be, although I have been afraid to get it that wet.  </li>
            <li> It comes with multiple brush heads, but so far I have only used the small brush for the face.  </li>
            <li> but im not sure how powerful one of these typically is.</li>
            <li> is completely stopped working; water had gotten into it even though the end was tightly attached and never taken off after batteries were put in.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s see how long it survives.</li>
            <li> I never took it in the bath or submerged it in water, yet roughly 2 months later</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than expected but thats</li>
            <li> Only down side so far is that when the box arrived the black box that you store your brush in was damaged.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the larger body brush on my other parts of my body and I can feel the changes (softer and smoother).</li>
            <li> This thing leaves the more expensive, rechargeable one that I had in the dust!</li>
            <li> It really helps to remove any makeup, dirt, dead skin cells, etc that normal cleansing leaves behind.</li>
            <li> After rinsing I find no makeup on the towel I use to dry my face.  </li>
            <li> I used every single brush.</li>
            <li> I used the small brush and was pleasantly surprised at the scrubbing power.  </li>
            <li> it does the same job for a lot less.</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;ve been doing about that is putting a towel across my neck and chest when I use it so my clothes don&#x27;t get wet.</li>
            <li> and they were wet battery acid all over my hands and part of my forearm.</li>
            <li> It stopped working only a few weeks after started using it.</li>
            <li> it is that it catches my long hair on the sides of my face, even with a tight headband on, so</li>
            <li> Only use the small brush.</li>
            <li> and I use this for home, the other one for travel.</li>
            <li> The face sponge attachment was not included, but the other three were.</li>
            <li> just what I expected!</li>
            <li> (that is the small facial brush, haven&#x27;t used the body brush yet).</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried the other attachments yet</li>
            <li> Use once every other day.  </li>
            <li> I trusted some of the other reviews on this and still got a dud!!&lt;br /&gt;8/15/2015</li>
            <li> I use my brush every other day.  </li>
            <li> Be careful around your eyes, it sucks the skin almost like a vacuum.  </li>
            <li> Dark spots are fading, and my skin is smoother.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> The brush must be held with the head pointing down to get the head to spin at all.</li>
            <li> Not a very strong turning motion.</li>
            <li> I typically use the face brush and the body brush.</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d try a different one, but it is difficult to hold onto to scrub my back.</li>
            <li> What slightly concerns me is that the handle does not close tightly</li>
            <li> and there is always a little crack visible.</li>
            <li> I used it just a few times(fewer than i imagined).</li>
            <li> Otherwise, too harsh.</li>
            <li> and it worked a few times,</li>
            <li> I bought it because I have RA and my right hand is &amp;#34;curved&amp;#34; and I have been unable to follow my usual skin care routine as it is difficult to use my hand.</li>
            <li> It comes with a sponge head which seems useless, a big body brush attachment, the face brush and a pumice stone.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday since I got it!</li>
            <li> The replacement brushes are also much less expensive than the other brand….I</li>
            <li> mean MUCH MUCH LESS!!  </li>
            <li> and i didn&#x27;t push or scrub too hard, also i used a non foaming-non scrubbing face cleanser.</li>
            <li> The delivery was late.</li>
            <li> No power, turned slowly.</li>
            <li> total waste.  :(</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s dead!!!</li>
            <li> It is not abrasive or irritating to my skin.</li>
            <li> This is just like the expensive clairsonic at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I find the brush difficult to remove after I have used it.</li>
            <li> Too bad  Poor quality</li>
            <li> If I could give this product negative stars I would!!!</li>
            <li> My sonic dream just arrived how disappointing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second disappointment was with Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was so frustrated.</li>
            <li> Scrubs all the crap out of your face.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in workmanship.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this product instead of the one at sephora because this one was a lot cheaper. I love it! I bought it to help clear up some acne and to get a better clean. I use it at night before I go to bed so I can get all of my makeup off. I&#x27;ve only had it for a week but my skin has cleared up really well. The only thing I dislike (and I don&#x27;t think can be fixed) is when I use it some soap and water sprays around. What I&#x27;ve been doing about that is putting a towel across my neck and chest when I use it so my clothes don&#x27;t get wet. Besides that everything is great. It came in a nice package, it feels great and works well. I recommend this if you want to fight acne or just want a better clean.</li>
            <li> Only use the small brush. Wish they sent more of that size and kept the others</li>
            <li> Great value. Works well.</li>
            <li> Works well and feels good. Love the interchangeable brushes. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t buy one of the $100 to $200 devices that are less comprehensive.&lt;br /&gt;This worked very well!  I LOVE the pedicure attachment.  It smoothed away my callouses beautifully.  I couldn&#x27;t stop feeling how soft my heels were after using it!  My skin was also soft and smooth, but hasn&#x27;t typically been rough so the change was less dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;I also love that this device was able to be completely submerged in the tub without any ill effects.  I would definitely recommend this and I may be gifting it to others in the future.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t have enough power</li>
            <li> Works as good as the other expensive brand. I have both and I use this for home, the other one for travel.</li>
            <li> My daughter has used it once so far. It comes with a sponge head which seems useless, a big body brush attachment, the face brush and a pumice stone. Doesnt seem incredibly powerful but im not sure how powerful one of these typically is. Nice ergonomically and water proof.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have enough power to clean the soles of my feet and the bristles from the face brushes are kind of too scratchy and irritating, although i do not have a sensitive skin and i didn&#x27;t push or scrub too hard, also i used a non foaming-non scrubbing face cleanser. I used it just a few times(fewer than i imagined). So, wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> The delivery was late. And i only use the product twice and i dont know what happen it stops working.. I didnt drop it or anything but the brush stop rotating but i can hear the motor running. I end up returning it.. I was so frustrated.</li>
            <li> Love the price, love the gentle facial brush, leaves face smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Great value!  Why spend over a hundred?  Love the feeling of my squeaky clean face!</li>
            <li> Love this!  I use it 2-3 times a week on my face and it does a great job.  So glad I did not spend $100+ on another brand!!!</li>
            <li> Works pretty good. Only wish my kit came with all the attachments. The face sponge attachment was not included, but the other three were.</li>
            <li> I love it, love the brushes that comes with. My skin feels and looks a lot better.</li>
            <li> Not a lot of power in this unit, but it gets the job done well enough.</li>
            <li> Great product. All brushes do the job except for the pumice one. But I bought it for the face and body brushes and they work perfectly.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife, she loves it and uses it daily.</li>
            <li> Excellent multi use spa cleanser</li>
            <li> Perhaps my brush is defective, but it has almost no power. The brush must be held with the head pointing down to get the head to spin at all. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loves how good it has help make her skin look and feel.  With the different attachments it is able to perform multiple function for skincare.  She also loved the box it came in as it keeps everything organized and easy to take with her.</li>
            <li> Works great and is good quality.  Priced right!</li>
            <li> Not for sensitive skin. Brushes really scrub!</li>
            <li> Very nice! Good quality and very well presented!</li>
            <li> It is great though do not press hard and leave your skin wet when you use it.  Otherwise, too harsh.</li>
            <li> i ordered this in february and only just opened it now (saved for mother&#x27;s day).  the off/on toggle is ineffective.  the only way to turn the tool on and off is to open it up and take the batteries out.  i should have waited to order it (closer to mother&#x27;s day) bc now i am well beyond the return date&#x27;s expiration.  total waste.  :(</li>
            <li> Rusted out before 1st battery change. Also if pressed, like in your heal it stops</li>
            <li> Does not offer a lot of power when running. Kind of just ok.</li>
            <li> NOTE: This is my first set of cleansing tools so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it is totally worth buying this product, but sometimes it hurts a bit if I have a pimple on my face, so I&#x27;d just wash my face without it and apply moisturizer with the sponge afterward. Other than that I really like washing my face with it! It&#x27;s also really easy to clean the brushes. You just rinse it with water and let it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also for future buyers, this product does NOT vibrate. It only rotates.</li>
            <li> i liked this product but it seams a bit weak compared to its competitors and also its advertised as water proof it is not went to put in stronger batteries and they were wet battery acid all over my hands and part of my forearm.</li>
            <li> I bought them for my wife and my sister-in-law, they love them</li>
            <li> Great little machine.  Cleans thoroughly but does not dry my skin.  I se Cerave cleanser with it and I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> I do really like this set. I love that I can scrub my face in the shower</li>
            <li> Comes in a handy case, but kind of large.  Works well.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I bought the SonicDerm Professional SPA Cleansing System and have been using it daily for over a week. I wanted to clear up some of my acne near my T-Zone area and applied Cetaphil facial cleanser and used the small brush. The brush gently exfoliated my skin and it has been glowingand looking cleaner each passing day. The unit is easy to operate and I like that is it also waterproof so I can use it in the shower. I&#x27;ve used the larger body brush on my other parts of my body and I can feel the changes (softer and smoother). I&#x27;ve also decided to buy more for my girlfriends as a gift. I recommend the SonicDerm!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I had an Oil of olay scrubbing brush before this one and this is 100% better. It spins faster and the brushes are much better quality. The only thing I would change is to put a little texture on the handle so you can get a better soapy grip in the shower.</li>
            <li> This is just like the expensive clairsonic at a fraction of the cost. I only wish they would have put a rechargeable battery in it.</li>
            <li> just what I expected!</li>
            <li> my wife is very happy with it</li>
            <li> I am so happy with the way it cleans my face of all makeup.  After rinsing I find no makeup on the towel I use to dry my face.  Prior to using the Sonicderm Cleansing System I could not get my face completely clean.  This is primarily why I wanted to try the Sonicderm, so I am extremely happy.  I highly recommend the product to all.</li>
            <li> I rate it 5 stars since the product works well, it came in a nice package, convenient to place in the bathroom. I have used only the face brush so far, but the other two also seem to be good and usable. I think it&#x27;s a good value for the price I paid!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice price with high performance I like this product realy its wonderful. I advise people to buy it.</li>
            <li> My sonic dream just arrived how disappointing. No power, turned slowly. I should havespent the money a bought something that would do the job.  Mines going back.  Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Great product does everything it said it would. I love that it is waterproof and the brushes hold up and don&#x27;t fall apart like others</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I love all the different heads and the fact that it runs on batteries,especially good for traveling out of the country.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like how powerful this was compared to the oil of olay face brush, but now that I&#x27;ve gotten used to it, I like it better. Love the pumice stone attachment for quick feet touch-ups.</li>
            <li> My skin looks so much healthier for this item.  Looks kind of cheap but works like a charm.  I&#x27;ve been using this product now for about three months with no problems</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive the cleansing system and can&#x27;t wait to use it.  The transaction with the seller was excellent.</li>
            <li> I just received this today.  I added the batteries and one of my face cleansers and started scrubbing.  This is my first face brush so I have nothing to compare it to except good old washcloth.  I used the small brush and was pleasantly surprised at the scrubbing power.  It actually tugs at your skin a bit which I liked,  its no lightweight barely there cleanse,  it is a substantial cleaner. When I was done (I wanted to scrub and scrub but knew better) I rinsed then used a toner on a cotton pad.  There was no makeup residue on the pad,  my skin was clean. This machine is my new best friend.  I&#x27;m going to keep an eye on some problem areas to see if there is improvement as far as pores getting cleaned out and maybe shrinking.  I have high hopes and will update in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Love it! This thing leaves the more expensive, rechargeable one that I had in the dust! It&#x27;s more powerful, it has a great selection of attachments, and the replacement heads are so reasonably priced! I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product, for much less than many of the other better-known brands.  I was skeptical, but decided to try it after reading the great reviews.  It comes with multiple brush heads, but so far I have only used the small brush for the face.  It provides strong exfoliation without irritation.  I feel like it definitely gives my face a deep clean.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it every day, but more like twice a week.  It&#x27;s nice that it can be used in the shower if need be, although I have been afraid to get it that wet.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it catches my long hair on the sides of my face, even with a tight headband on, so you can&#x27;t get too close to the hairline with it.</li>
            <li> Need to use it longer for a true review but so far, so good.  Cleans well and I like the sponge to use on my face after the brush.  Be careful around your eyes, it sucks the skin almost like a vacuum.  I like this stimulation!  Feels good, doesn&#x27;t hurt.    The pumice is a joke though as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  I use it on my feet, elbows and knees because it&#x27;s there.  I figure it can&#x27;t do them any harm but I am not convinced that the pumice is doing much of anything.  It&#x27;s too smooth and there&#x27;s not enough power in the tool for exfoliating tougher areas.  The brushes and sponge however, give results that I can see and feel on my face and neck.  The pumice, not so much.    Great value, I would DEFINITELY buy again and LOVE that the price is much lower than the Clairsonic I was going to purchase.  I don&#x27;t know if it works as well but it works enough for me that I don&#x27;t feel the need to try the higher priced brush.</li>
            <li> I bought a second one of these for my son who is 13 years old.  He loves it and therefore is taking better care of his skin.  We use it with the X-out products.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using such a divice,so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to. For my needs it fits the bill.It is gentle,yet removes makeup easily. Really like it.</li>
            <li> So far so good. This little brush is powerful. Definitely a good clean.</li>
            <li> Looks more sturdy than my previous cleanser. Feels heavier thou. Don&#x27;t like to sponge but love the big brush. What slightly concerns me is that the handle does not close tightly and there is always a little crack visible. I doubt that it helps with water resistance. Let&#x27;s see how long it survives.</li>
            <li> I loved it until the motor went out after the third day. Will be returning</li>
            <li> It is NOT made to withstand dropping, the very first use in the shower I dropped it and it fell apart.  I was able to put back together but the washer ring to ensure it is waterproof broke so now I can no longer use in the shower which defeats the purpose of this purchase.  Very disappointed in workmanship.</li>
            <li> Great price for a very good product</li>
            <li> Love this! I use it everyday since I got it! I typically use the face brush and the body brush. I don&#x27;t really use to pumice or the sponge. The price is a great deal for what you get as well. Def. satisfied!</li>
            <li> I was surprised batteries were not included.  When I have a chance to pick up batteries I will try the product and let you know</li>
            <li> I love this unit. I bought it because I have RA and my right hand is &amp;#34;curved&amp;#34; and I have been unable to follow my usual skin care routine as it is difficult to use my hand. This makes it so much easier. I gave it 4 stars as the only problem I have is I find the brush difficult to remove after I have used it. I have to have my husband pull the brush off the head. (that is the small facial brush, haven&#x27;t used the body brush yet). The sponge attachment removes easily. I wish I had found this unit sooner.</li>
            <li> Works beautifully and is of good quality!</li>
            <li> People have been commenting on how good my skin looks.  I regularly go to the spa for a facial and since I started using SonicDerm i&#x27;ve not had any extractions.  Very satisfied with the product and the results.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do a fabulous job deep cleaning, but for the price, not a bad product.</li>
            <li> I have very very sensitive skin and was nervous about buying a cleansing brush. I wanted something to exfoliate my skin and this did the trick! When I first got it I used it once everyday, but now I use it only twice a week, my sensitive skin hurt a little from using it all the time, but it&#x27;s still a good product for those with sensitive skin. I love all the brush heads that come with it! I would use the sponge attachment to apply my lotion on my face and it really helped moisturized! The price is also amazing, compared to name brand brushes like Clairsonic for $100+ it does the same job for a lot less.</li>
            <li> very pleased. bought extra set of heads somy daughter and I can both use it</li>
            <li> My face feels really smooth after using this. Haven&#x27;t tried the other attachments yet but my gues is it will feel just as awesome.</li>
            <li> I used every single brush. I wassurprised by how much I loved the sponge. I use it to put on my face lotion now.</li>
            <li> I received the SonicDerm as a present, and it worked so well originally. My face felt so soft after every clean. I never took it in the bath or submerged it in water, yet roughly 2 months later is completely stopped working; water had gotten into it even though the end was tightly attached and never taken off after batteries were put in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the face brush and body brush so far, but I am very satisfied. Bought this in lieu of a Clarisonic Mia and I can honestly say I am so glad I didn&#x27;t spend $100 for one of these.</li>
            <li> Smooths my face and cleanses it good.</li>
            <li> Was hoping for some sonic action, but got the more mechanical fast spinning. Returned it.</li>
            <li> Works well and cleanses face well.  Did not have to use the pumice since I already own a pedi  appliance.</li>
            <li> A couple of disappointments here. First, that it was defective - the heads would not stay on the handle. They&#x27;d pop off while whirling. That started about a week into use. Until then, I really liked it. The big brush was nice to use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second disappointment was with Amazon. I was hoping for a replacement because there are so many good reviews, I assumed I received a defective model, where the handle mechanism was just defective. But Amazon only offered a refund. I&#x27;m wondering if they have had a lot of returns that the reviews don&#x27;t reflect. So refund is the only option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I guess I&#x27;ll have to look for a different model now.</li>
            <li> Works great!! My face is much clearer.</li>
            <li> Fun quick easy spa for a pick me up</li>
            <li> Thank you SonicDerm for making a product that is not only good in construction but has several brushes for different uses. This has the power I need.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love all the brushes/attachments included. Large brush is great for shoulders and back and standard brush is great for face and neck. I also love using the pumice to get my feet ready for sandal season! It packs a lot of power and instead of having to wait for it to recharge (like my old Clarisonic), I can just pop in new batteries and I am ready to go! The replacement brushes are also much less expensive than the other brand….I mean MUCH MUCH LESS!!  Definitely recommend for anyone wanting the power and benefits of the popular brand but not wanting to pay the price!</li>
            <li> Great product for the price.  I have worked in the skincare industry for over 10 years and have seen a lot of similar products. While this is no &amp;#34;Clarisonic,&amp;#34; one can feel the difference the SonicDerm makes on the skin. My skin feels really clean and it does a thorough job removing all makeup. I enjoy the variety of brush heads as well.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, great value.</li>
            <li> Received this for Christmas and couldn&#x27;t be happier! Everything about this brush tool is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small bristle head is awesome for face cleansing. The large bristle head I used almost as a dry brush before the bath and then to use body wash. The sponge head is AMAZING for rubbing moisturizer into your face (I dot the moisturizer around and then spread it with the sponge head. It&#x27;s like velvet). Haven&#x27;t used the pumice stone yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is happier and cleaner and clearer. It really helps to remove any makeup, dirt, dead skin cells, etc that normal cleansing leaves behind.</li>
            <li> It works great and all the different scrubber heads are cool!</li>
            <li> Nice item, seen results within the first week. Order was timely.item housed  In a beautiful black expensive looking box. Nice gift to give. Will odree again.</li>
            <li> Really great product that I actually caught my husband using! He loves it! Only down side so far is that when the box arrived the black box that you store your brush in was damaged. It looked as though someone possibly dropped something on it. Product inside was not damaged. Happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Love this product for deep cleaning and it erases fine lines!  DO NOT USE IN SHOWER!  I had to replace original one because water got inside.  Use once every other day.  Price is so great that I bought a couple more for gifts!</li>
            <li> I really like this brush! I use it with a dot of cleaner, and it removes all of my makeup. Dark spots are fading, and my skin is smoother.</li>
            <li> This system is very nice.  I love the attachments that came with it and not a wimpy spin.  I&#x27;ve use the facial brush every night and it has worked wonders on my pores. The brush seems to be holding up really well also.  After working in the yard, being able to come in use the big brush in the shower is great.  I have not used the pumice stone yet, but I know I will in the future.</li>
            <li> Have not used it yet but it should be good -- looks good in the box</li>
            <li> Product Image  *Introductory Price!* SonicDerm Professional Spa Cleansing System SD-201, Rotating Brush Head for Deep Cleansing and Exfoliation, 4 in 1 Brush, Waterp (New)  So Far so good.  It seems to have a good motor.  I the insides don&#x27;t rust like another brand I tried, it will be a great product.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day! I did not think I would use the sponge, which helps apply face lotion, but it is probably my favorite! My skin is loving it despite the harsh weather where I am currently living. Highly recommend. It is similar to the Olay Pro-X (my mother has that one) and I think I like the SonicDerm better!</li>
            <li> Good for my daughter, I prefer my Clarisonic so sticking with it!  Great for teens so you are not spending a bunch for them!!</li>
            <li> This cleaner works great and I have seen an improvement of my skin.  As I have gotten older, by skin has not shed dead skin on my face as easily as before.  This product works great with my own gentle cleanser (I use a Cetaphil cleanser) and I would recommend it for any age.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> bristles a bit soft but ok.</li>
            <li> This is so much fun. My kid likes the bigger brush on her back at bath time. I enjoy the facial scrub and it is not too abrasive on your skin.</li>
            <li> A good inexpensive alternative to get your skin really clean. Also great in the shower.</li>
            <li> a great product, have enjoyed using it on my face daily.</li>
            <li> Love how my face feels after i use it. It feels very clean and looks a lot brighter.</li>
            <li> headline says it all. wife loves it, thats all that needs to be said</li>
            <li> Not a quality product. Don&#x27;t spend the money.</li>
            <li> Great for feet. Wish it had multiple speeds &amp; different level of facial brushes. Body scrubber is nice - but soft - so doesn&#x27;t really help exfoliate knees &amp; elbows.</li>
            <li> Its very nice thank yoi</li>
            <li> So far I have loved what I have seen. My skin seems smoother, softer, and it is definitely cleaner, proof is on the cotton ball after I apply my toner-No dirt/makeup residue to be found. It is not abrasive or irritating to my skin. It runs on 2 AA batteries (which I find more convenient than rechargeable appliances). It is water proof, so it can be used in the shower. It comes with several different brushes so it can be used on your body, your face and even your feet. The replacement brushes are a fraction of the cost compared to the Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the $30 cost, I think this is a wise choice if you have been thinking about buying the more expensive Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I did not like the motor in this…needs to go faster and feel seamless.</li>
            <li> I was going to purchase a more expensive cleansing brush but saw this.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and LOVE it!  The brush is the right size for my face, is gentle on my skin and the speed is just right..not too fast or aggressive.  Due to cancer, I had to have surgery on my face with a nose graft - the Sonic Derm is gentle and I&#x27;m not afraid to use it on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;I was using a hand-held face brush before but it did not remove all my make-up.  The first time I used the SonicDerm - all my make-up was cleaned away and my face felt really smooth and clean.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT at a fraction of the cost of the much more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> I love the SonicDerm. After the first use my skin already looked better; my skin was smoother and my pores were cleaned out which gave my face a fresher, dare I say younger look.</li>
            <li> Have used this several times and it is alright.  I don&#x27;t see ANYTHING sonic about this cleansing brush just spins around.  It will do until it wears out then I&#x27;ll try another brand.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this face brush. Dont feel like I will be using hands to clean my face ever again.The bristles are soft and good for my sensitive skin. I use it twice a day. And the price suits me well!!</li>
            <li> love the way this makes my face and body feel!</li>
            <li> Looks good, so far.  My wife has not used it yet,</li>
            <li> Not worth it. The power isn&#x27;t great. Was good the first few tries, but after that it didn&#x27;t have the same juice.</li>
            <li> I bought this and the replacement brushes in Nov. 2014 and it worked a few times, but now it&#x27;s dead!!! I send emails to support@sonicderm.com and no answer!!! Also just sent an email to the website and really do not expect much!! What really upsets me is, that I got the replacement brushes too and now I am out around $50.- and nothing to show for!! If I could give this product negative stars I would!!! I trusted some of the other reviews on this and still got a dud!!&lt;br /&gt;8/15/2015&lt;br /&gt;I have to edit the above review, the people at Sonic Derm just sent me a brand new unit, as well as a new set of replacement brushes!! Which tells me these people certainly read their reviews and I stand corrected!!! I am therefore amending my one star to four!! Thank you SonicDerm, that was a nice way to make things right for me!!! Kudos to you, I really appreciate the customer service!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love the way they did it too, no excuses, just sent the new unit and there you have it!!! THANK YOU SONIC DERM!!!!</li>
            <li> I use my brush every other day.  Its okay.  The little brush got worn out a little quick, but it does its job.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good. Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see how often you have to replace batteries. Soft brush. Not a very strong turning motion. But works as promised. Update my review.... It stopped working only a few weeks after started using it. Replaced batteries and still doesn&#x27;t work.... Too bad  Poor quality</li>
            <li> Scrubs all the crap out of your face.</li>
            <li> Powerful like item... I was used to youthful essence .. This thing is a power pack</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than expected but thats okay. I thought all the brushes were for face but cause its all for different purposes makes it neat for the price. It is waterproof, very functional, easy to use/simple and I&#x27;ve noticed after using the face one my face feels cleaner and looks less dark. If you&#x27;re looking for a product that gets the job done this is it or even one to start out on. Nice box too.</li>
            <li> Really love this for my face &amp; the big brush for my body.  Great price</li>
            <li> The brushes are stiffer than my old brand that died again.  Thought I&#x27;d try a different one, but it is difficult to hold onto to scrub my back. The large brush for the body now flies off.  I still like my old one called Episonic but Amazon doesn&#x27;t carry it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company responded to my brush flying off and sent me a package of new brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  It fell off the 14&amp;quot; high table next to the shower and the head flew off. It hasn&#x27;t worked since.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I felt the softness of my face after the 1st use! Great price. Doesnt have as much power as I thought but still seems to do what its supposed to. I am satisfied with the purchase.</li>
