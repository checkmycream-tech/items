            <li> I didn&#x27;t try this yet, but did want to comment on the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;When I opened up the box, the dropper fell out on the floor, and I had to wash it, this should have been encased in plastic like other dropper meds I buy. Then I took off the plastic on the lid and it was greasy and got on my hands. So far not liking this product too much.  I will update after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updating on 8/15/13, gave it another star since it took away my pain very fast. Change the packaging and it gets 5 stars from me!</li>
            <li> This smells soooo good and it works so really well for aches and pains  and arthritis  just put it on the sore area and it will help. Love it love it</li>
            <li> Definitely a new approach to dealing with fibromyalgia pain.  It is difficult to find an effective product for fibromyalgia muscular pain.  The essential oils smell good and although it won&#x27;t cure everything it&#x27;s a nice alternative to other types of muscle rub.</li>
            <li> This item was introduced to me on the Dr. Oz show. Since I&#x27;m experiencing lower back and leg discomfort, I decided to give Frankincense &amp; Myrrh oil a try for the pain was not too severe. The oil did relieve the severity of the pain enough for me to get a good nights&#x27; sleep. The oil is a temporary relief for minor discomfort.</li>
            <li> Its worth the price.  Yes, there are cheaper products out there, but this one does not burn or sting and I love the smell.  My husband does not, so be warned not everyone will like the smell but I do and it works fast and lasts longer than the cheaper creams.  I buy this one exclusively now and have recommended it to my elderly parents.</li>
            <li> This oil does smell good. It really should be used if you are experiencing mild artheritis . Feels great on my knees. I do love trying new things. I do recommend this for mild artheritis.</li>
            <li> As a sufferer of many ailments this product works on the problem areas to provide much needed relief.  Have share with friends who may desire a bottle when I reorder.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this to my elder sister who often has fibro pain and knee pains. She says it actually has helped. Again, subjective and I&#x27;m passing along what she said. So, I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> This product is from the time of Christ&amp;#34;s birth and is a miracle. This oil When rubbed in fully on a daily basis takes away more body paid than 2 Vicodin. After rubbing in allow about 15minutes for it to soak in and dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huge relief for my husband</li>
            <li> This stuff works.  I have used bengay, penetrex and other medicated oils but they were useless.  I have very painful joint along the outer edge of my sole.  It is not completely cured but had improved.  I expect to be healed soonest.</li>
            <li> i have found almost instant relief to all my aches and pains. i would recommend to anyone who asks. works great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smell good,but don&#x27;t effect much for me, and pricy too.</li>
            <li> It might be my imagination but this stuff seems to help my neck and upper shoulder area from being tensed up all day. I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I just got this today and am already a believer......it&#x27;s amazing how I can rub this into my knees, calves and heels (fibromyalgia pain of the day) and within minutes, the pain has scaled down. I will be buying this again-smells nice, absorbs quickly and is not greasy/oily feeling at all.</li>
            <li> This oil is relaxing and does produce some what of a numbing affect. It seems to help with the pain and has a great relaxing scent. It&#x27;s expensive, but it goes a long way. The bottel last me about a month. This oil works best if you have some one masage it in to you so it can reach your nerve endings.</li>
            <li> helps with my arthritis takes the swelling down and pain</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, a small amount goes a long way and the fragrance is light and pleasant. There is no greasy or oily mess. The hands on massage creates a wonderful experience between two people and has a wonderful effect in suppressing my wife&#x27;s fibromyalgia symptoms. Very relaxing before sleep.</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells and I do think it helps sooth aches and pains.</li>
            <li> I have fibromyalgia and sciatica and this is part of my healing - it really works fast.  And it smells wonderful!  I use it along with magnesium oil and it&#x27;s amazing the results I get.  Stretching and these oils, with a high protein diet is my protocol and I&#x27;m finding so much relief.  Small bottle but it goes a long way, you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> My MIL has fibromyalgia and achey in general.  She liked it so much she had me order more.  My FIL and Tio &amp; Tia use it also.</li>
            <li> It is a lot different than I remember the scent to be.  I was hoping to help my aching feet.  It is very soothing and provides a lot of moisture.</li>
            <li> First the shipping was fast and it was exactly as described. First night my husband put less than the recommended dose on my legs, arms and back (the places that were hurting) and yes I have fibromyalgia. The smell was so strong that I couldn&#x27;t even think if it was working because the smell. It&#x27;s not a bad smell but it was just too much and I should&#x27;ve known from my sensitivity to perfume. I thought maybe if I relaxed and breathed in the aroma that would help? Not sure if it helped, I had a bad fibro night. 2nd night just rubbed it on feet....didn&#x27;t feel a difference :-/ I&#x27;m going to try putting it in my lotion and a few drops in the bath when I take one (for pain). Maybe after a period of time? Anyways, With fm it&#x27;s all hit or miss. I&#x27;m not saying the product is bad...just not sure if it works for me. I&#x27;ll give it some more time. For the price it was worth trying.</li>
            <li> I deal with FM and &amp;#34;local mechanical problems.&amp;#34;  Over the past 35 years I&#x27;ve developed quite a large bag of tricks for pain management.  This product is the best topical I&#x27;ve discovered and is safe compared with medications that numb the body, but the brain as well.  It&#x27;s a must-try if you are bearing pain.  It reduces my pain level from 8 or 9 to 4.  I use it before resorting to the opiates my doctor prescribes for the more difficult days.  I use far less of these medications and have fewer side effects from their use.  The scent is very pleasing to me and I&#x27;ve come to associate the aroma with pain relief--a powerful suggestion to the mind, where pain is most effectively reduced.  After I rub it in or have someone hit places I can&#x27;t reach, I take deep belly-breaths and focus on a recorded book or pray for my loved ones.  The combo of breathing, Frankincense and Myrrh Fibromyalgia and mental distraction is unbeatable.  One suggestion only:  a glass bottle and tightly fitted dropper so I can carry it in my purse!</li>
            <li> When my aches and pains are not severe then this stuff is amazingly good.  I will buy more, however,  I still like stop pain at walmart  cause I can carry it with me in the car , but this is a bit more powerful, longer lasting, and has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> This product is just a lot of smelly, oily hype.  It does nothing and it was a complete waste of money.</li>
