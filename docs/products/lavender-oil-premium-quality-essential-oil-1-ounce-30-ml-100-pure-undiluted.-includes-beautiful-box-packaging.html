            <li> This product was promptly shipped, arrived well-packaged, well-sealed. I am currently using the oil to fragrance my home by way of an oil burner. I have to say, the product smells amazing when burned, it is relaxing and I worry less about sending harsh chemicals into the air of my living space. The product burns quickly but the scent lasts long. It burns clean as well.  Will be purchasing more soon.</li>
            <li> I love this product for it&#x27;s versatility.My roommates and I use it in different ways&lt;br /&gt;so there is always a lingering scent of lavender oil in our house.&lt;br /&gt;Nice product and will order some more real soon.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment. Can be used for many different things but I usually use it to relax, I recommend putting it in the bathtub for a warm relaxing shower after a hard day or adding a drop on your pillow before bed.</li>
            <li> I loved this product. I bought an electric oil diffuser for my car. Just few drops of the oil go a long way. Having a car that smells like lavender going to and from work is very relaxing. It works so quickly. I can&#x27;t wait to explore more ways to use this product.</li>
            <li> Very aromatic and quality essential oil of lavender!  I would not hesitate to order more!  I put some on my candle (very nice) and even put some in my hair.  It smells so nice!  Thanks!</li>

            <li> This is a high quality product with an endless amount of uses, from freshening your home with a relaxing scent, to adding to your bath, to scented candles, adding a drop to your moisturizer to give you a beautiful fragrance throughout the day, relief of headaches and more!  I love keeping this around and I find this one in particular to be so rich, thick and pure with scent that lasts and lasts!  I highly recommend this lavender oil!</li>
            <li> The second I got the package in the mail I could already smell the calming scent. Sure enough, the oil smells divine. The oil is thick and rich. Each drop oozes with aroma! The second I got it I spread little droplets throughout my house. I&#x27;m satisfied to say my home smells wonderful now! Not to mention the premium lavender scent calms and soothes you. It relaxes me every time I walk through my home. I can&#x27;t recommend this bottle of liquid relaxation enough!</li>
            <li> When the package arrived I could smell the fragrance as soon as I opened the mailer! This is 100% pure, rich, quality, wonderful lavender oil. It has many different uses to so it is one of the most essential,essential oils to have around! :) I put a few drops in the heater vents of my car to keep it smelling nice.

            <li> A friend of mine got me hooked on this good stuff. I hope you try it too. It smells delicious. I rub it on my neck, the back of my ears, my inner writs, and the back of my hands. It is an alternative to perfume, if you want to smell good and save big bucks in your pocket. I have also noticed that I do sleep better and my mood is calmer than usual. Adding small drops to a bath makes me feel so much more relaxed at the end of my day.  I will also purchase the peppermint in a month or two.</li>
            <li> I like to add several drops of Lavender Oil to a hot bath.  This Lavender Oil is high quality and has a LOVELY SCENT.  It relaxes my mind, body and soul from fatigue.  Will reorder and definitely recommend!</li>

            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t even give this one star! Must be old &amp; they needed to get rid of it. Doesn&#x27;t smell like lavender at all. Not worth the sale.</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised.  The item is great.</li>

            <li> My apartment building has recently seen an increase in mice and I was feeling&lt;br /&gt;helpless about what to do. I have a baby that just learned how to crawl so a mouse trap&lt;br /&gt;wasn&#x27;t an option and I definitely don&#x27;t want to use anything with harsh chemicals. I was&lt;br /&gt;totally skeptical about using lavender oil but decided I had nothing to lose by trying it.I&lt;br /&gt;put a couple drops on a cotton ball and stuffed it into some of the openings. We haven&#x27;t seen&lt;br /&gt;any mice since! This stuff is amazing. I mean who would have thought? And it makes the&lt;br /&gt;house smell wonderful... as opposed to the &amp;#34;I obviously have a mice problem in my house&lt;br /&gt;because you can smell the chemical product&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> My product arrived via first class mail in bubble wraped envelope.I usually put&lt;br /&gt;a couple of drops in one of my unscented candles and let the scent take over the house.The&lt;br /&gt;Scent is wonderful and it&#x27;s really calming.Lovely!</li>
            <li> I tried this lavender oil after reading about the skin benefits of lavender oil on a&lt;br /&gt;beauty blog.I am prone to acne so I decided to mix the essential oil with my daily facial&lt;br /&gt;moisturixer.I noticed that the redness from my pimple goes down after I use itand I love the&lt;br /&gt;smell of it .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it worked so well,I read another tip that suggested putting some oil in your shampoo or&lt;br /&gt;conditioner.Wjat a great idea! I don&#x27;t know wheter it makes your hair grow because I&lt;br /&gt;have pretty thick hair but again I loved the smell and I swear my hair was shinier after!&lt;br /&gt;Placebo effect? Maybe but this product is offcially part of my beauty regime.</li>
            <li> great Lavender oil, i like to use it in my hair conditionner. I also use a few drops in my body lotion make me feel so relaxed .I love it!!</li>
            <li> Good enough essential oil to help me sleep.  Cheaper than DoTerra.</li>
            <li> This is quite strong lavender oil--I add it to moisturizer and it has an amazingly relaxing effect.  Very good for restless legs and neuropathy, the best help I have found.</li>
            <li> Very nice oil. My daughter is picky and liked it, too!</li>
