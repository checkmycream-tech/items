            <li>Love, Love, Love my razor.  </li>
            <li>Glad they carry this part.</li>
            <li>I had not been able to find this part in any store offering replacement parts (Walmart&#x27;s etc).</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s back to doing the great job it used to do!  </li>
            <li>Wife was pleased with the replacement parts</li>
            <li>The price was awesome as, I expected to pay a lot more than I did.</li>
            <li>They are easily changed in seconds.</li>
            <li>I now have a new shaver - but one that is as good as the ones sold 15 or 20 years ago.</li>
            <li>The new Remington Lady&#x27;s Shaver does not have good reviews.</li>
            <li>The blades worked fine.</li>
            <li>Its not quit as smooth as before.  </li>
            <li>An important bit of maintenance to remember if you have an electric razor--check the instructions to see how often you should replace these parts.</li>
            <li>I was so excited.  </li>
            <li>These pieces for my shaver which were new blades worked pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I love using my Remington smooth and silky in the shower, no nicks or cuts, just smooth and soft..</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Works good and no issues with it and it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li>How convenient by mail, and even cheaper than purchasing in a store, but first you have to find the product in a store!  </li>
            <li>The replacement cutter was as expected and at a good price compaired to finding it a store or specialty shaving online store.</li>
            <li>however charger and cutter and screen cost more than complete shaver package???</li>
            <li>Wife says it sure improved her old Model 5000 shaver.</li>
            <li>It was the right part I needed to replace.  </li>
            <li>The foil got holes in it right away.</li>
            <li>The product was exactly what I needed for my razor.  </li>
            <li>and I had no problems with it fitting my current shaver.</li>
            <li>I love my remington shaver, but I couldn&#x27;t find any cutters in my local stores for it.  </li>
            <li>Everything is the right size and brand new.  </li>
            <li>I had forgotten how great my shaver was, the replacement was long over due.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>They were sent in a reasonable time.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>so replaced the screen and cutters rather than replacing the whole thing.</li>
            <li>However, I think it is really overpriced.  </li>
            <li>The replacement blade &amp; screen make my Remington shaver work like new again!  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I am pleased with my new blades and they work extremely well.</li>
            <li>Have had my shaver for 4 years and after replacing the screen and cutter it is just like new!</li>
            <li>I checked numerous sites and most were double the price!  </li>
            <li>When it comes time to replace the screen and cutters again, maybe I will just pay a few dollars more and get a new razor.</li>
            <li>so I dont see any need to purchase a new one.  </li>
            <li>Once you purchase this replacement head for your shaver, it&#x27;s as if you bought a new shaver.  </li>
            <li>It does help to buy a new screen and cutter every once in awhile..</li>
            <li>I thought maybe I would have to buy a new electric razor, but once I bought this, it worked like it was brand new</li>
            <li>the new screen works like a champ.</li>
            <li>Makes my Remington razor like brand new.</li>
            <li>The Remington website sales them for the exact same price.</li>
            <li>They are not a bad price and the perform as expected.</li>
            <li>I used to order that part on-line directly from the remington store</li>
            <li>Old screen had holes in it, allowing cutters to chew up skin in the area to be shaved.</li>
            <li>so typing just any old thing.</li>
            <li>The sky is blue, the grass is green, needed four more words</li>
            <li>I was so pleased to find them at Amazon and the price was less than what the other cutters in stores charge.</li>
            <li>Still cheaper than a new razor and the replacement was simple.</li>
            <li>Brought the razor back to new.</li>
            <li>Shipping was much faster than expected.</li>
            <li>Although my original blades still worked, they were getting dull.</li>

            <li> The product was exactly what I needed for my razor.  I used to order that part on-line directly from the remington store but they discontinued it.  So, when I found it at amazon I was so excited.  My razor still works great so I dont see any need to purchase a new one.  I will continue to order this part from Amazon until my razor breaks!</li>

            <li> I was so happy to have been able to find the blade replacement and screen for my shaver. I have had my Remington since 2001 and was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get them replaced. The price was awesome as, I expected to pay a lot more than I did. Although my original blades still worked, they were getting dull. It does say you should replace them every six months and I laughed when I read that because it is now almost 14 years for me. I don&#x27;t use mine but twice a week. I guess it depends on the usage and the care of your shaver. Anyway, I am pleased with my new blades and they work extremely well.</li>
            <li> Once you purchase this replacement head for your shaver, it&#x27;s as if you bought a new shaver.  Works great!</li>

            <li> We&#x27;ve had this razor for about 5 years.  We replace the blades every year and we haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>

            <li> I order the Remington  replacement cutter and screen. It came on time and was just what I needed.</li>
            <li> It does not fit my razor and need to return it but I can&#x27;t find how to return it.  I asked for a call back but no recall.</li>
            <li> Sooo glad to have. Love, Love, Love my razor.  Its not quit as smooth as before.  Don&#x27;t know if its the cutters or razor it&#x27;s self. But...ecstatic about having razor again.  Thank you for having parts. Wonder if Remington will ever make another electric razor as well as this one!</li>
            <li> Great price, quick shipping</li>
            <li> The blades worked fine.</li>
            <li> The foil got holes in it right away.</li>
            <li> Came all the way from Ireland, but no problems receiving it. Makes my Remington razor like brand new. Glad they carry this part.</li>

            <li> Remington SP-118 Replacement Screen and Cutter for WDF-5000 Smooth &amp; Silky Body Contour Wet/Dry Shaver, came in original Remington packaging  and was rec&#x27;d in excellent condition. I had not been able to find this part in any store offering replacement parts (Walmart&#x27;s etc). I was very satisfied with the product and shipping of it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been getting unhappy with my razor&#x27;s performance, and then realized that I had *never* replaced the cutters in the 3 years I&#x27;d had it.  Now it&#x27;s back to doing the great job it used to do!  An important bit of maintenance to remember if you have an electric razor--check the instructions to see how often you should replace these parts.</li>
            <li> I love my remington shaver, but I couldn&#x27;t find any cutters in my local stores for it.  I was so pleased to find them at Amazon and the price was less than what the other cutters in stores charge.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work good at all.</li>
            <li> Works well. however charger and cutter and screen cost more than complete shaver package???</li>
            <li> Wife was pleased with the replacement parts</li>
            <li> Brought the razor back to new.</li>
            <li> I finally found a replacement screen and cutter for my older-model razor!  However, I think it is really overpriced.  When it comes time to replace the screen and cutters again, maybe I will just pay a few dollars more and get a new razor.</li>
            <li> Ordered through Amazon. Arrived in 10 days from Ireland even though estimated arrival was up to a month and a half. It is as pictured - and is the Remington product. Wife says it sure improved her old Model 5000 shaver. Looks like this is about the last source for these replacement blades as I believe Remington has stop making them.</li>
            <li> The item that I bought works just fine!  And it didn&#x27;t take a month to come from Ireland!  I had it in about a week!</li>
            <li> It works well and the parts rejuvenated my shaver</li>
            <li> The screen did not fit although make and model matched on packaging.  Seller refused to refund the money because package was opened.  The only way to insert the screen and cutter is to open the package.  I&#x27;m very unhappy with the product and seller.  I ended up buying a new shaver for less cost than the replacement parts.  I should have done that from the beginning.</li>
