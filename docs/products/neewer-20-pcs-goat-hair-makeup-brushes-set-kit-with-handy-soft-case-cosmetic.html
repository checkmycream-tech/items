            <li>I bought these brushes thinking they were a good value for the price.</li>
            <li>good for starters tho.</li>
            <li>but hey the case is gorgeous</li>
            <li>The brushes look rather good concidering price.</li>
            <li>and i got what i wanted for good price and good quality</li>
            <li>well atleast for the price i got a couple good brushes out of it</li>
            <li>I loved the packaging</li>
            <li>but i would have loved to have a foundation brush in this set.</li>
            <li>But good product.</li>
            <li>However they don&#x27;t do a good job when it comes to applying the makeup..</li>
            <li>I was fairly upset when this came in the mail..</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even bother using them, I donated them to good will.</li>
            <li>She loved it</li>
            <li>I loved the price of this brush set.</li>
            <li>and she loved it</li>
            <li>My granddaughter loved this gift in her stocking on christmas morning.  </li>
            <li>it  came on the day they said it would surprising</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m assuming that everyone who rated these brushes a 5 has never tried good brushes, no offense.</li>
            <li>I loved the price for this item</li>
            <li>The brush case was sturdy and the choice of brushes was good.</li>
            <li>Very impressed on how quickly these were here.</li>
            <li>Very nice an received it quick!!</li>
            <li>makes me a happy customer deffinetly buying from NEEWER again :).</li>
            <li>My experience was great, I love the set, the look is very appealing</li>
            <li>As a pro I need a tad more in quality but are great for my daughter.</li>
            <li>but these brushes are great and I love the price as well and on another note</li>
            <li>I was VERY pleased with that.</li>
            <li>i would absolutley recommend them might even buy a couple more because they would make great stocking stuffers for christmas.</li>
            <li>very handy and stylish.</li>
            <li>I love the brushes &amp; everything about it !</li>
            <li>packaging is adorable, but the brushes themselves shed alot!</li>
            <li>absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Case is cute but don&#x27;t bother!</li>
            <li>spend more and get brushes that WON&#x27;T fall apart when you use or wash them!</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied and happy because the product arrived just in time, attention and speed was great, I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>eye brushes are amazing though</li>
            <li>this product is amazing...</li>
            <li>They also make nice gifts for some one who loves to apply makeup.</li>
            <li>These brushes were really nice</li>
            <li>Fast shipping was great!</li>
            <li>the eye brushes are nice.</li>
            <li>However, since I bought the kit for the eye and lip brushes (which don&#x27;t shed that I can tell) and the cute case - the product is still good.  </li>
            <li>Case is nice, but the fan brush was bent upon arrival as it was packaged in the crease</li>
            <li>Nice case and brushes.</li>
            <li>I liked all of them except the blush brush, for some reason it doesn&#x27;t hold the color</li>
            <li>Smelled funny and fallout, but after i washed them they are amazing!!</li>
            <li>For the price it is absolutely worth it !!!</li>
            <li>Most of the brushes worked great but the powder brushes fell apart too easily.</li>
            <li>I love it, they are supper easy to take and use, efficient and look great.</li>
            <li>I love this whole sent and am very happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li>When they arrived, I LOVED the cute case, so adorable</li>
            <li>So wonderful very professional quality.</li>
            <li>They do have a very strong plastic smell that I hope wears off eventually</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know what most of these brush&#x27;s intended use is, but i have plenty to use for my makeup and more!</li>
            <li>Very good quality, and you get so much for your money.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t pick up product very good at all, and they shed so much.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>looks like a clutch purse and makes it easy to just put it in your purse or travel bag!</li>
            <li>I love these brushes although I wish they did come with a better variety of the types of brushes included, they work well and the case is cute as well!</li>
            <li>I love  them soft and give a flawless finish</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick and also good packaging.</li>
            <li>The brush bag is probably the most used item out of them all.</li>
            <li>there are better brushes out there for this price.</li>
            <li>These are very well made brushes and are a great buy.</li>
            <li>Am sure to purchase again when these wear out.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>Love my brushes!:-D</li>
            <li>if they didn&#x27;t shed so much they would be great as starter brush kits</li>

            <li>Okay the biggest brushes shed a LOT.</li>
            <li>Love the adorable case, love the brush selection.  </li>
            <li>This has to be my favorite set out of all the sets I have bought.</li>
            <li>I washed the brushes and the hair came out more never again</li>

            <li>Love the case.</li>
            <li>I have purchased cheaper brushes from Target that work much better than these.</li>
            <li>Love the case.</li>
            <li>She is in colorguard and has to be able to apply show make up.  </li>
            <li>She seems to love them.</li>

            <li>I love the brushes.</li>
            <li>I also love the bag it came in</li>
            <li>These brushes are lovely.</li>
            <li>Most brush sets cost way more than these did.</li>

            <li>but i love these.</li>
            <li>and  that goes for most any beauty product you would buy on here..</li>
            <li>I loved the Brushes thankk you very much.</li>
            <li>I was excited when I came across these set of brushes and for the price it was being sold for!</li>
            <li>Great to practice :) (I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist)</li>
            <li>Love the item I found that this item is perfect for what I wanted it for and did not find that they shed very much which is a plus this ten also came on time :)</li>
            <li>They would be great brushes if these things got fixed.</li>
            <li>I cannot honestly say whether or not these are good quality brushes ( mine obviously weren&#x27;t), but maybe you&#x27;ll have better luck than I did.</li>
            <li>pretty brushes love love love</li>
            <li>I love these brushes to death, I am so excited about how well they apply my makeups been and</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>They came very quickly in the mail.  </li>
            <li>They hair falls off easily too.</li>
            <li>RELATIVELY EASY</li>
            <li>They smelled strongly when they came in</li>
            <li>Soft, nice for makeup applications and with its carrying case, it has a nice selection of sizes to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I got this brushes because of the selection and because it was so affordable, but honestly it is best to spend the extra money in a good set or individual ones.</li>
            <li>It smells strongly of gasoline or something of the sort and looks cheap.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They are sturdy, soft and easy to clean!!!</li>
            <li>These are goat hair and fantastic.</li>
            <li>They are a great gift for somebody starting out wearing makeup</li>
            <li>These are a great affordable starter set for a teen.</li>
            <li>have went through cheap brushes and remnants would still be on my face after using blush...</li>
            <li>the hair is soooo soft and everything was in good conditions.</li>
            <li>The brushes were really soft and of good quality.</li>
            <li>love these brushes they are the right size to fit your hand</li>
            <li>I was so excited to see such a great deal on these brushes.</li>
            <li>i was really excited to get these brushes in the mail</li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>So impressed with the various brushes for the novice or the professional makeup artist on the road.  </li>
            <li>As I get older I am finding that it is much more important to put your make-up on with brushes and as a nurse I realized that all the bacteria on my hands are being placed onto my face.</li>
            <li>When they came i was super excited.</li>
            <li>Great wide variety of brushes ....</li>
            <li>For what i spent, this product is great, I have yet to notice shedding.</li>
            <li>Good for the price, but definitely starter brushes</li>
            <li>I bought these thinking that there really couldn&#x27;t be &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; brushes and because the case was so cute.</li>
            <li>All of the people I have used these on love them as much as I do.</li>
            <li>It losses the hair as when utilized, you get full of this hair on your face when applying the makeup&lt;</li>
            <li>The brushes were good quality they shed a little at first but uf you shampoo and condition them they are really nice brushes.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>the smell is just about gone now, and did i mention im 9 months pregnant and have the nose of a blood hound?</li>
            <li>And the other brushes were very nice as well.</li>
            <li>mine didnt shed alot and the entire package is very easy to clean...</li>
            <li>The tiny brush is amazing for cat eyes.</li>
            <li>it isnt worth the money.</li>
            <li>it is worth buying</li>
            <li>This is a nice set but some of the larger brushes do shed a lot.</li>
            <li>I tried a variety of things to improve them:  - washed them several times with Master&#x27;s Brush Cleaner and Preserver (the kind artist use on paint brushes)  - soaked them in olive oil (hoping to soften them)  </li>
            <li>but over all these were some really nice brushes I will recommend this set to anyone who is now starting their make up kit.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>not even worth the price</li>
            <li>My sister is a 30 year old make-up master and daughter is a 13 year old up and comer and both loved these as Xmas presents!&lt;br</li>
            <li>but they are good for a teen who wants to play make up with friends.</li>
            <li>I do makeup professionally and thought they would be great especially for the price!</li>
            <li>Other than that good product, don&#x27;t be misled.</li>
            <li>I love how soft all of the brushes are and it&#x27;s in a handy pink carrying case.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend spending the 10 dollars more for a little better quality!!</li>
            <li>Package arrived super fast.    </li>
            <li>It arrived super fast.</li>
            <li>Love using them, soft and holds color (from eye shadow to blush and bronzer) very well.</li>
            <li>I went back through the seller&#x27;s feedback on ebay to see if anyone else had the same problem, but almost 100% of the people that bought this set were talking about how great it was.</li>
            <li>Great brush set, however the bristles are very stiff.</li>
            <li>Very fast shiptment.</li>
            <li>Thank u ;)</li>
            <li>I ordered them, they came pretty fast, but, the quality of the brushes aren&#x27;t even worth $12.</li>
            <li>if this is your first set of brushes they will get the job done.</li>
            <li>I love the case that they come in and the fact that they are a pearly white</li>
            <li>Being that this is the first time ive ordered from amazon</li>
            <li>Extremely INEXPENSIVE and more than the bang for your buck!</li>
            <li>but they are very practical and useful.</li>
            <li>it is exactly what I wanted and exactly how it looks in the item description.</li>
            <li>exactly wht i saw online</li>
            <li>And now, my toddler can play with the big brushes while I use the rest :)</li>
            <li>The smaller brushes are ok.</li>
            <li>THESE ARE GREAT AS LONG AS YOU ARE NOT USING THE GOATS HAIR BRUSHES WHICH IS ALL OF THE LARGER BRUSHES.</li>
            <li>I have been meaning to write a review since I first received these brushes.</li>
            <li>I would not purchase these and do not recommend them when there are better similarly priced brushes out there.</li>
            <li>This was received exactly like advertised...</li>
            <li>The face brushes smelled funny even after I washed them,and they shed EVERY WHERE.</li>
            <li>the carrying case is cute enough that i&#x27;ve considered keeping the brushes elsewhere and using it as a clutch.</li>
            <li>overall i give this product a b+ :)</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t super high quality</li>
            <li>One more thing, is that the case doesn&#x27;t come with a flat foundation brush</li>
            <li>I finally got to use them and was so excited... until I used them!</li>
            <li>Obviously they aren&#x27;t perfect, I mean look at the price and the amount that you&#x27;re getting.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my second buy, another was for a gift and my friend enjoy it too as me, I recomend very much</li>
            <li>I would strongly suggest choosing a different product and not wasting your money.</li>
            <li>i think u can do a lot better if u re willing to pay a few extra bucks :)</li>
            <li>The smaller brushes are fine.</li>
            <li>All the little brushes are amazing</li>
            <li>so if your buying this item for the big brushes i recommend spending a little more money for better quality .</li>
            <li>I really like the case and variety of brushes.</li>
            <li>Came fast and ready to use.  </li>
            <li>not so much that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving them 3 stars.</li>
            <li>The brushes do shed a bit but not so much to be worried about, they also smelled like vinyl thats because they arrived in a vinyl case, and one of the heads on my brush came off</li>
            <li>I actually really like these brushes...</li>
            <li>High quality brushes!</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like the material of the brushes , some seemed used</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although shipping was fast and I&#x27;d buy from this seller again, the product itself was trash.</li>
            <li>This set is better then i had expected.</li>
            <li>it doesnt bother me much but yea.</li>
            <li>Thanks again</li>
            <li>The case is really convenient for travel.</li>
            <li>I was very displeased with them.</li>
            <li>I guess you can&#x27;t expect too much considering the price, but my god.</li>
            <li>and I really didn&#x27;t like that.</li>
            <li>I opened the package and the case was very sturdy,  will be using it for traveling.</li>
            <li>Absolutely unbearable.</li>
            <li>shopping inside of a store before i really have no complaints about my set.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I use my brushes daily many times and have had no problem with these so far.</li>
            <li>After spending the weekend trying to salvage these brushes I almost decided to keep them with the hope that hopefully the would get better with more washing and conditioning, but in actuality these brushes are way to thin to be of any use.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
            <li>DO NOT waste your money on these!!!</li>
            <li>When i first bought it i thought \\&quot;its new</li>
            <li>I used a few of the brushes and was pretty pleased with the results,,I certainly don&#x27;t regret the purchase</li>
            <li>I have other brushes that work better that I bought at Walmart</li>
            <li>But the other brushes were OK.</li>
            <li>the eye brushes are extremely soft and i guess they re pretty decent, but i cant believe they didn&#x27;t gave me a crease brush?!</li>
            <li>but one complaint i do have is it doesnt come with a foundation brush which is okay because its not a bad set at all.</li>
            <li>but, overall i enjoy my brushes especially for such a cheap price!</li>
            <li>But, the product is not so good as I though, the bristles is too hard, isn&#x27;t soft at all!</li>
            <li>The big brushes and the fan brush SHED sooooooooo much i tryed washing them but that only made them shed more .</li>
            <li>The eye liner smudger brush did break on first use, easily fixed though</li>
            <li>They shipped fast, and they were in new condition.</li>
            <li>Decent brush set for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a big makeup geek for a while, and I&#x27;ve tried many different brushes.</li>
            <li>Although, you would think its a good price for the sheer number of brushes; it is a waste.  </li>
            <li>I have still saved a lot of money compared to high end department stores.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these brushes to any one that has owned high end brushes or even elf brushes.</li>
            <li>The set is fine, the quality is just not what I expected.</li>
            <li>I am in beauty school and hoped for a little bit better quality.</li>
            <li>was not expecting a high quality set, but something that holds normal usage.</li>
            <li>With that being said, the eye brushes were already really soft (although they also shed a ton) straight out of the package.</li>
            <li>and i have to take them off slowly as to not remove my makeup.</li>
            <li>The thing is I love the smaller brushes they&#x27;re great and work amazingly well, but the bigger brushes are absolutely terrible.</li>
            <li>Brushes like this normally sell for 10- 15 dollars per brush.  </li>
            <li>the hair started to come out a bit on a few but still lovely quality and for the price you cant beat it</li>
            <li>my first impression of the brushes was how soft they were even the eyeliner brush was soft, softer than any ive used before.</li>
            <li>Not great, but good for the price</li>
            <li>I used them everyday and they still look great and hair is not coming out like stated on previous reviews.</li>
            <li>The bristels fall out left and right</li>
            <li>I probably will be giving these to my niece and purchase new ones</li>
            <li>The brushes still new so maybe they will grow on me..</li>
            <li>taking it out of the package, there was a plastic-y paint smell, to me it smelled new in my opinion, like new plastic, my guess from the case</li>
            <li>it reuse over and over again it is very soft</li>
            <li>A very complete set of brushes for her every need.</li>
            <li>..my first impression were that when i open the case and remove the face brushes to look at them,  the face brushes were shedding a lot!!</li>
            <li>I honestly wanted to like these brushes, but they just were not good.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li>smelled funny bigger brushes feel apart and got ruined when cleaned.</li>
            <li>These brushes came nicely, but the case it was in sucks!</li>
            <li>i really bought this to help me with my eyeshadows and blending them so most of the smaller shadow brushes and blending ones are good not to hard and dont really shed the bigger powder and blush brushes shed so much there useless</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really give feedback other than it did arrive in a timely fashion and it looks exactly like the product I saw online when I ordered it.</li>
            <li>True, at first the larger brushes shed a little</li>
            <li>The brushes are really soft.</li>
            <li>all my brushes fell apart and where to soft</li>
            <li>All natural goat hair make it an ease for eye shadow.</li>
            <li>When I opened the package my first opinion of the brushes were that: 1) they were NOT soft 2)</li>
            <li>I ordered these brushes because I wanted a complete set.</li>
            <li>The brushes are really soft.</li>
            <li>I took one of the powder brushes out and they were so SOFT.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re natural hair brushes, there&#x27;s going to be some shedding until you wash them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s complete garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;these face brushes weren&#x27;t soft and when you wash them the bristles bend and fall</li>
            <li>they are all really soft</li>
            <li>I bought these because they were natural hairs and not synthetic.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend purchasing a couple different sizes of bigger brushes because I really don&#x27;t like them.</li>
            <li>The goat hair is soooo soft.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not MAC or anything like that, but I pleasantly surprised when I had the brushes in my hand.</li>
            <li>Not all that soft</li>
            <li>i plucked literally like 3 or 4 stragglers and that was it so far, remember these are goat hair</li>
            <li>i like watching people use them in action</li>
            <li>A few of the brushes are actually good but the overall package is not worth it</li>
            <li>I think overall for what you pay for them, they&#x27;re decent brushes.</li>
            <li>First I was afraid, because let&#x27;s be honest</li>
            <li>On the first, second, and third use I would end up with goat hairs all over my face and in my foundation.  </li>
            <li>Other than that for the most part the other brushes get the job done.</li>
            <li>They are soft and I have had no other problem besides just the shedding.</li>
            <li>its not very heavy duty, and its kinda flimsy.</li>
            <li>They shed way too much, and they were not soft at all.</li>
            <li>after they got dry it didn&#x27;t shed as much but some.</li>
            <li>no funny smell pretty case</li>
            <li>that much of an expert on brushes but some really smaller brushes are super hard</li>
            <li>but when i got them some of the brush hair was sticking out of all my big brushes and they aren&#x27;t that soft either.</li>
            <li>the brushes had rips and tears on parts of it and the face brush is too small for all over powder,3 brushes are exactly the same and 4eyebrushes are exactly the same..</li>
            <li>So far these brushes has been shedding only 3 brushes works well for me.</li>
            <li>Very few of the brushes are stiff enough to accomplish anything, but it&#x27;s a good starter set for someone who has a basic makeup routine.</li>
            <li>the es case is very goog quality,  the brushes are perferct diferente one each other.</li>
            <li>The smell I read in a few comments is just the normal smell of new plastic, nothing major.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft, hairs staying in the brush, and give enough diversity to be used for the entire face instead of just the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>only 2 or 3 were rough out of the whole set.</li>
            <li>so they might shed a little at first but its nothing 1 wash cant fix..</li>
            <li>They were exactly the ones that I was missing in my makeup collection.</li>

            <li> But good product.</li>

            <li> but these brushes are great and I love the price as well and on another note</li>
            <li> I was VERY pleased with that.</li>
            <li> i would absolutley recommend them might even buy a couple more because they would make great stocking stuffers for christmas.</li>
            <li> very handy and stylish.</li>
            <li> I love the brushes &amp; everything about it !</li>
            <li> packaging is adorable, but the brushes themselves shed alot!</li>
            <li> absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Case is cute but don&#x27;t bother!</li>
            <li> spend more and get brushes that WON&#x27;T fall apart when you use or wash them!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied and happy because the product arrived just in time, attention and speed was great, I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> eye brushes are amazing though</li>
            <li> this product is amazing...</li>
            <li> They also make nice gifts for some one who loves to apply makeup.</li>
            <li> These brushes were really nice</li>
            <li> Fast shipping was great!</li>
            <li> the eye brushes are nice.</li>
            <li> However, since I bought the kit for the eye and lip brushes (which don&#x27;t shed that I can tell) and the cute case - the product is still good.  </li>
            <li> Case is nice, but the fan brush was bent upon arrival as it was packaged in the crease</li>
            <li> Nice case and brushes.</li>
            <li> I liked all of them except the blush brush, for some reason it doesn&#x27;t hold the color</li>
            <li> Smelled funny and fallout, but after i washed them they are amazing!!</li>
            <li> For the price it is absolutely worth it !!!</li>
            <li> Most of the brushes worked great but the powder brushes fell apart too easily.</li>
            <li> I love it, they are supper easy to take and use, efficient and look great.</li>
            <li> I love this whole sent and am very happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li> When they arrived, I LOVED the cute case, so adorable</li>
            <li> So wonderful very professional quality.</li>
            <li> They do have a very strong plastic smell that I hope wears off eventually</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know what most of these brush&#x27;s intended use is, but i have plenty to use for my makeup and more!</li>
            <li> Very good quality, and you get so much for your money.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t pick up product very good at all, and they shed so much.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> looks like a clutch purse and makes it easy to just put it in your purse or travel bag!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes although I wish they did come with a better variety of the types of brushes included, they work well and the case is cute as well!</li>
            <li> I love  them soft and give a flawless finish</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick and also good packaging.</li>
            <li> The brush bag is probably the most used item out of them all.</li>
            <li> there are better brushes out there for this price.</li>
            <li> These are very well made brushes and are a great buy.</li>
            <li> Am sure to purchase again when these wear out.</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> Love my brushes!:-D</li>

            <li> lose a bit of hair to start, but overall are excellent for the price.</li>
            <li> So many people ask where i got it.</li>
            <li> the smaller things in this pack are awesome</li>
            <li> i love them.</li>
            <li> and I have tried washing them many times and they don&#x27;t get any softer.</li>
            <li> and she says they are much better than the ones she had.</li>
            <li> Love the case.</li>
            <li> I have purchased cheaper brushes from Target that work much better than these.</li>
            <li> Love the case.</li>
            <li> She is in colorguard and has to be able to apply show make up.  </li>
            <li> She seems to love them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many times I&#x27;ve hit myself in the face while doing someones makeup.</li>
            <li> I love the brushes.</li>
            <li> I also love the bag it came in</li>
            <li> These brushes are lovely.</li>
            <li> Most brush sets cost way more than these did.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure</li>

            <li> I loved the Brushes thankk you very much.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I came across these set of brushes and for the price it was being sold for!</li>
            <li> Great to practice :) (I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist)</li>
            <li> Love the item I found that this item is perfect for what I wanted it for and did not find that they shed very much which is a plus this ten also came on time :)</li>
            <li> They would be great brushes if these things got fixed.</li>
            <li> I cannot honestly say whether or not these are good quality brushes ( mine obviously weren&#x27;t), but maybe you&#x27;ll have better luck than I did.</li>
            <li> pretty brushes love love love</li>
            <li> I love these brushes to death, I am so excited about how well they apply my makeups been and</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> They came very quickly in the mail.  </li>
            <li> They hair falls off easily too.</li>
            <li> RELATIVELY EASY</li>
            <li> They smelled strongly when they came in</li>
            <li> Soft, nice for makeup applications and with its carrying case, it has a nice selection of sizes to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I got this brushes because of the selection and because it was so affordable, but honestly it is best to spend the extra money in a good set or individual ones.</li>
            <li> It smells strongly of gasoline or something of the sort and looks cheap.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They are sturdy, soft and easy to clean!!!</li>
            <li> These are goat hair and fantastic.</li>
            <li> They are a great gift for somebody starting out wearing makeup</li>
            <li> These are a great affordable starter set for a teen.</li>
            <li> have went through cheap brushes and remnants would still be on my face after using blush...</li>
            <li> the hair is soooo soft and everything was in good conditions.</li>
            <li> The brushes were really soft and of good quality.</li>
            <li> love these brushes they are the right size to fit your hand</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see such a great deal on these brushes.</li>
            <li> i was really excited to get these brushes in the mail</li>
            <li> Well worth it!</li>
            <li> So impressed with the various brushes for the novice or the professional makeup artist on the road.  </li>
            <li> As I get older I am finding that it is much more important to put your make-up on with brushes and as a nurse I realized that all the bacteria on my hands are being placed onto my face.</li>
            <li> When they came i was super excited.</li>
            <li> Great wide variety of brushes ....</li>
            <li> For what i spent, this product is great, I have yet to notice shedding.</li>
            <li> Good for the price, but definitely starter brushes</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking that there really couldn&#x27;t be &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; brushes and because the case was so cute.</li>
            <li> All of the people I have used these on love them as much as I do.</li>
            <li> It losses the hair as when utilized, you get full of this hair on your face when applying the makeup&lt;</li>
            <li> The brushes were good quality they shed a little at first but uf you shampoo and condition them they are really nice brushes.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> the smell is just about gone now, and did i mention im 9 months pregnant and have the nose of a blood hound?</li>
            <li> And the other brushes were very nice as well.</li>
            <li> mine didnt shed alot and the entire package is very easy to clean...</li>
            <li> The tiny brush is amazing for cat eyes.</li>
            <li> it isnt worth the money.</li>
            <li> it is worth buying</li>
            <li> This is a nice set but some of the larger brushes do shed a lot.</li>
            <li> I tried a variety of things to improve them:  - washed them several times with Master&#x27;s Brush Cleaner and Preserver (the kind artist use on paint brushes)  - soaked them in olive oil (hoping to soften them)  </li>
            <li> but over all these were some really nice brushes I will recommend this set to anyone who is now starting their make up kit.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> not even worth the price</li>
            <li> My sister is a 30 year old make-up master and daughter is a 13 year old up and comer and both loved these as Xmas presents!&lt;br</li>
            <li> but they are good for a teen who wants to play make up with friends.</li>
            <li> I do makeup professionally and thought they would be great especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Other than that good product, don&#x27;t be misled.</li>
            <li> I love how soft all of the brushes are and it&#x27;s in a handy pink carrying case.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend spending the 10 dollars more for a little better quality!!</li>
            <li> Package arrived super fast.    </li>
            <li> It arrived super fast.</li>
            <li> Love using them, soft and holds color (from eye shadow to blush and bronzer) very well.</li>
            <li> I went back through the seller&#x27;s feedback on ebay to see if anyone else had the same problem, but almost 100% of the people that bought this set were talking about how great it was.</li>
            <li> Great brush set, however the bristles are very stiff.</li>
            <li> Very fast shiptment.</li>
            <li> Thank u ;)</li>
            <li> I ordered them, they came pretty fast, but, the quality of the brushes aren&#x27;t even worth $12.</li>
            <li> if this is your first set of brushes they will get the job done.</li>
            <li> I love the case that they come in and the fact that they are a pearly white</li>
            <li> Being that this is the first time ive ordered from amazon</li>
            <li> Extremely INEXPENSIVE and more than the bang for your buck!</li>
            <li> but they are very practical and useful.</li>
            <li> it is exactly what I wanted and exactly how it looks in the item description.</li>
            <li> exactly wht i saw online</li>
            <li> And now, my toddler can play with the big brushes while I use the rest :)</li>
            <li> The smaller brushes are ok.</li>
            <li> THESE ARE GREAT AS LONG AS YOU ARE NOT USING THE GOATS HAIR BRUSHES WHICH IS ALL OF THE LARGER BRUSHES.</li>
            <li> I have been meaning to write a review since I first received these brushes.</li>
            <li> I would not purchase these and do not recommend them when there are better similarly priced brushes out there.</li>
            <li> This was received exactly like advertised...</li>
            <li> The face brushes smelled funny even after I washed them,and they shed EVERY WHERE.</li>
            <li> the carrying case is cute enough that i&#x27;ve considered keeping the brushes elsewhere and using it as a clutch.</li>
            <li> overall i give this product a b+ :)</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t super high quality</li>
            <li> One more thing, is that the case doesn&#x27;t come with a flat foundation brush</li>
            <li> I finally got to use them and was so excited... until I used them!</li>
            <li> Obviously they aren&#x27;t perfect, I mean look at the price and the amount that you&#x27;re getting.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my second buy, another was for a gift and my friend enjoy it too as me, I recomend very much</li>
            <li> I would strongly suggest choosing a different product and not wasting your money.</li>
            <li> i think u can do a lot better if u re willing to pay a few extra bucks :)</li>
            <li> The smaller brushes are fine.</li>
            <li> All the little brushes are amazing</li>
            <li> so if your buying this item for the big brushes i recommend spending a little more money for better quality .</li>
            <li> I really like the case and variety of brushes.</li>
            <li> Came fast and ready to use.  </li>
            <li> not so much that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving them 3 stars.</li>
            <li> The brushes do shed a bit but not so much to be worried about, they also smelled like vinyl thats because they arrived in a vinyl case, and one of the heads on my brush came off</li>
            <li> I actually really like these brushes...</li>
            <li> High quality brushes!</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like the material of the brushes , some seemed used</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although shipping was fast and I&#x27;d buy from this seller again, the product itself was trash.</li>
            <li> This set is better then i had expected.</li>
            <li> it doesnt bother me much but yea.</li>
            <li> Thanks again</li>
            <li> The case is really convenient for travel.</li>
            <li> I was very displeased with them.</li>
            <li> I guess you can&#x27;t expect too much considering the price, but my god.</li>
            <li> and I really didn&#x27;t like that.</li>
            <li> I opened the package and the case was very sturdy,  will be using it for traveling.</li>
            <li> Absolutely unbearable.</li>
            <li> shopping inside of a store before i really have no complaints about my set.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I use my brushes daily many times and have had no problem with these so far.</li>
            <li> After spending the weekend trying to salvage these brushes I almost decided to keep them with the hope that hopefully the would get better with more washing and conditioning, but in actuality these brushes are way to thin to be of any use.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> DO NOT waste your money on these!!!</li>
            <li> When i first bought it i thought \\&quot;its new</li>
            <li> I used a few of the brushes and was pretty pleased with the results,,I certainly don&#x27;t regret the purchase</li>
            <li> I have other brushes that work better that I bought at Walmart</li>
            <li> But the other brushes were OK.</li>
            <li> the eye brushes are extremely soft and i guess they re pretty decent, but i cant believe they didn&#x27;t gave me a crease brush?!</li>
            <li> but one complaint i do have is it doesnt come with a foundation brush which is okay because its not a bad set at all.</li>
            <li> but, overall i enjoy my brushes especially for such a cheap price!</li>
            <li> But, the product is not so good as I though, the bristles is too hard, isn&#x27;t soft at all!</li>
            <li> The big brushes and the fan brush SHED sooooooooo much i tryed washing them but that only made them shed more .</li>
            <li> The eye liner smudger brush did break on first use, easily fixed though</li>
            <li> They shipped fast, and they were in new condition.</li>
            <li> Decent brush set for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a big makeup geek for a while, and I&#x27;ve tried many different brushes.</li>
            <li> Although, you would think its a good price for the sheer number of brushes; it is a waste.  </li>
            <li> I have still saved a lot of money compared to high end department stores.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these brushes to any one that has owned high end brushes or even elf brushes.</li>
            <li> The set is fine, the quality is just not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I am in beauty school and hoped for a little bit better quality.</li>
            <li> was not expecting a high quality set, but something that holds normal usage.</li>
            <li> With that being said, the eye brushes were already really soft (although they also shed a ton) straight out of the package.</li>
            <li> and i have to take them off slowly as to not remove my makeup.</li>
            <li> The thing is I love the smaller brushes they&#x27;re great and work amazingly well, but the bigger brushes are absolutely terrible.</li>
            <li> Brushes like this normally sell for 10- 15 dollars per brush.  </li>
            <li> the hair started to come out a bit on a few but still lovely quality and for the price you cant beat it</li>
            <li> my first impression of the brushes was how soft they were even the eyeliner brush was soft, softer than any ive used before.</li>
            <li> Not great, but good for the price</li>
            <li> I used them everyday and they still look great and hair is not coming out like stated on previous reviews.</li>
            <li> The bristels fall out left and right</li>
            <li> I probably will be giving these to my niece and purchase new ones</li>
            <li> The brushes still new so maybe they will grow on me..</li>
            <li> taking it out of the package, there was a plastic-y paint smell, to me it smelled new in my opinion, like new plastic, my guess from the case</li>
            <li> it reuse over and over again it is very soft</li>
            <li> A very complete set of brushes for her every need.</li>
            <li> ..my first impression were that when i open the case and remove the face brushes to look at them,  the face brushes were shedding a lot!!</li>
            <li> I honestly wanted to like these brushes, but they just were not good.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> smelled funny bigger brushes feel apart and got ruined when cleaned.</li>
            <li> These brushes came nicely, but the case it was in sucks!</li>
            <li> i really bought this to help me with my eyeshadows and blending them so most of the smaller shadow brushes and blending ones are good not to hard and dont really shed the bigger powder and blush brushes shed so much there useless</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really give feedback other than it did arrive in a timely fashion and it looks exactly like the product I saw online when I ordered it.</li>
            <li> True, at first the larger brushes shed a little</li>
            <li> The brushes are really soft.</li>
            <li> all my brushes fell apart and where to soft</li>
            <li> All natural goat hair make it an ease for eye shadow.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package my first opinion of the brushes were that: 1) they were NOT soft 2)</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes because I wanted a complete set.</li>
            <li> The brushes are really soft.</li>
            <li> I took one of the powder brushes out and they were so SOFT.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re natural hair brushes, there&#x27;s going to be some shedding until you wash them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s complete garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;these face brushes weren&#x27;t soft and when you wash them the bristles bend and fall</li>
            <li> they are all really soft</li>
            <li> I bought these because they were natural hairs and not synthetic.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend purchasing a couple different sizes of bigger brushes because I really don&#x27;t like them.</li>
            <li> The goat hair is soooo soft.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not MAC or anything like that, but I pleasantly surprised when I had the brushes in my hand.</li>
            <li> Not all that soft</li>
            <li> i plucked literally like 3 or 4 stragglers and that was it so far, remember these are goat hair</li>
            <li> i like watching people use them in action</li>
            <li> A few of the brushes are actually good but the overall package is not worth it</li>
            <li> I think overall for what you pay for them, they&#x27;re decent brushes.</li>
            <li> First I was afraid, because let&#x27;s be honest</li>
            <li> On the first, second, and third use I would end up with goat hairs all over my face and in my foundation.  </li>
            <li> Other than that for the most part the other brushes get the job done.</li>
            <li> They are soft and I have had no other problem besides just the shedding.</li>
            <li> its not very heavy duty, and its kinda flimsy.</li>
            <li> They shed way too much, and they were not soft at all.</li>
            <li> after they got dry it didn&#x27;t shed as much but some.</li>
            <li> no funny smell pretty case</li>
            <li> that much of an expert on brushes but some really smaller brushes are super hard</li>
            <li> but when i got them some of the brush hair was sticking out of all my big brushes and they aren&#x27;t that soft either.</li>
            <li> the brushes had rips and tears on parts of it and the face brush is too small for all over powder,3 brushes are exactly the same and 4eyebrushes are exactly the same..</li>
            <li> So far these brushes has been shedding only 3 brushes works well for me.</li>
            <li> Very few of the brushes are stiff enough to accomplish anything, but it&#x27;s a good starter set for someone who has a basic makeup routine.</li>
            <li> the es case is very goog quality,  the brushes are perferct diferente one each other.</li>
            <li> The smell I read in a few comments is just the normal smell of new plastic, nothing major.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft, hairs staying in the brush, and give enough diversity to be used for the entire face instead of just the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> only 2 or 3 were rough out of the whole set.</li>
            <li> so they might shed a little at first but its nothing 1 wash cant fix..</li>
            <li> They were exactly the ones that I was missing in my makeup collection.</li>
            <li> The hairs are a little loose when the brushes first come, I thought they were extremely soft compared to the ones I have had in the past, the only thing that smells is the case, just smells like new plastic</li>
            <li> After all that I will admit that they were finally softer, but not as soft as some of my other brushes.</li>
            <li> Very confused as to why people are saying they love this product.</li>
            <li> The case was very unappealing, and the one case wouldn&#x27;t close due to the magnetic snap on top being over too far to close with the bottom one.</li>
            <li> but other thenthat they are really soft.</li>
            <li> I guess you can say they were too floppy or flat.</li>
            <li> They are very flimsy, but for the price I definitely thought I was going to get decent product, but was wrong.</li>
            <li> I went back on amazon and spent the same price + shipping to receive BH Cosmetic brushes.</li>
            <li> They are rough, too rough to use on sensitive faces.  </li>
            <li> Only thing I don&#x27;t really care for are how the hairs on my brushes are slowly falling out.</li>
            <li> ive bought worse and paid more (for less than 20 brushes!)</li>
            <li> The small brushes work great but the 3 big one are crappie the shed really bad</li>
            <li> people are saying that the brushes are not very soft and the hairs fall out and that they smell.  </li>
            <li> but if you wash them and knock loose the extra hairs, you wont get hairs on your face.</li>
            <li> I liked these brushes as seen in the product picture but when I got them the fan brush had hairs going fifteenth directions and the brushes smelled very weird not a new smell</li>
            <li> Shipping didnt take long at all, and once i recieved the package i immediately started using it.</li>
            <li> Plus the are not soft at all.</li>
            <li> I rated it four stars instead of five because the handles are REALLY LONG.</li>
            <li> I compared these brushes price to other brushes of the same quality at a beauty store</li>
            <li> Just soap and water and let them dry on a towel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The larger brushes are a but rough on the face, and the &amp;#34;hair loss&amp;#34; was extremely minimal.</li>
            <li> it still fell apart, and it was loose too.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because the big brush should be a little bit fuller than it is; other than that no complains.</li>
            <li> I have brushes from &amp;#34;Bella&amp;#34; brand and this brushes are very similar for a lot less than Bella brushes.</li>
            <li> the brushes are way to soft and some are hard..</li>
            <li> Also, the tools loose bristles a lot!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the larger powder brushes do a LOT of SHEDDING!!!</li>
            <li> And the case is pictured pink, but the case I received was like a greenish color..</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t hold eye shadow the way i expected.</li>
            <li> The larger fluffy brushes aren&#x27;t as dense as I would prefer.</li>
            <li> It was the three face brushes, and the fan brush that were rough and scratchy.</li>
            <li> The bristles are rough.  </li>
            <li> The brushes came before I expected them...</li>
            <li> Shipping also went wayyyy faster then expected.</li>
            <li> The only reason it has 2 stars is because there are a few brushes that do there jobs and do them well.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and is just what I expected...</li>
            <li> And they are a tad rough.</li>
            <li> Brushes are rough and don&#x27;t hold product well.</li>
            <li> Also, the spouley, that looks like a mascara wand for blending out the harsh lines when you fill your eyebrows in, the entire thing just broke off the brush.</li>
            <li> the brushes where very small, not fluffy.</li>
            <li> my only complaint is that it took a long time to get to me...</li>
            <li> Not happy Very thin brushes and the hairs come out very easily .</li>
            <li> Im pretty sad</li>
            <li> To start off the big brushes do shed a lot, the small ones</li>
            <li> Please read other reviews before buying.</li>
            <li> Overall I was not pleased with my purchase...</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes because of the amount of brushes and for such a small price.</li>
            <li> But other than that I&#x27;m going to test them out and see how I like them.</li>
            <li> The brushes were not great they have like the same concealer brushes but in different sizes.</li>
            <li> They do not smell as badly as some of these women claim the case smells only for a few days because of the material it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li> The bristles are to hard and fall out when using the bigger brushes.</li>
            <li> The bigger brushes were hard and the bristles fall out.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money</li>
            <li> The majority of the reviews on these brushes are negative simply because the brushes shed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> Not worth it all.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just not worth my money..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ridiculous how many people will hate a product simply because they don&#x27;t know how to use it.  </li>
            <li> The face brushes shed, the hairs are uneven, and the are a little rough to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for months on myself and other people in everyday situations and for stage makeup.</li>
            <li> i was honestly a little skeptical about these because of some of the negative or mixed reviews here on amazon but saw alot of decent ones on youtube</li>
            <li> and I got these brushes for over half off.</li>
            <li> The case was torn black marks everywhere</li>
            <li> and the brushes SHED every single time!!!!</li>
            <li> The hair on the bigger brushes shed , and they are not good for blending or applying makeup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, they are a little scratchy and the bristles fall out.</li>
            <li> Sheds a little, but work well.</li>
            <li> I was a little upset about that</li>
            <li> They are not dense and fluffy the way they should be.  </li>
            <li> and I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> this is a waste, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> ive paid more for really cruddy synthetic sets in stores before..</li>
            <li> Purchase these brushes and they have a strong bad smell!</li>
            <li> These do smell like really bad at first</li>
            <li> The fluffy brushes have a lot of fall out of hair, but the tiny brushes actually aren&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> there was very very little shedding with mine.</li>
            <li> Really I wonder if you had to make the brushes, and they are bad quality.</li>
            <li> Price is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> The small brushes for the eyes are grate</li>
            <li> As for its quality I&#x27;m not sure since it hasn&#x27;t been used yet.</li>
            <li> I love the packaging, but the SMELL, was horrible.</li>
            <li> they are very firm, fluffy and holds alot of product!</li>
            <li> I hate them cheap quality n weak</li>
            <li> I read a few reviews that said it was no good.</li>
            <li> they aren&#x27;t hard brushes that will hurt your face</li>
            <li> brushes are hard to face and looses hairs.</li>
            <li> even the eyeliner brush i think is alittle to hard</li>
            <li> I did like the smaller brushes as they didn&#x27;t shed like crazy and were usable.</li>
            <li> The larger brushes shed like crazy, even after washing and conditioning.</li>
            <li> the goat hair sucks.</li>
            <li> At least put some quality into the brushes.</li>
            <li> It sucks.</li>
            <li> I mean who wouldn&#x27;t?</li>
            <li> The amount that they shed is just ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Overall not too bad.</li>
            <li> This was not a good product.</li>
            <li> not a good product.</li>
            <li> Not good for applying makeup...</li>
            <li> They are not good at all</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened them, some were broken.</li>
            <li> it was worse.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is it has a bad scent</li>
            <li> My face was covered in little hairs which is simply annoying.</li>
            <li> And the case smells horrible and my brushes had a weird white powder on the hairs when they arrived.</li>
            <li> I was completely wrong.</li>
            <li> The powder brush is the only one I used and even that was terrible.</li>
            <li> so im not too sad with the brushes</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes with the idea that well, they aren&#x27;t that expensive and there are a lot in there</li>
            <li> but ill guess i will figure it out soon</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the set.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately when i actually started to use the brushes, they were AWFUL.</li>
            <li> it was even worse!</li>
            <li> /&gt;They got all over my face when I used it.&lt;br /&gt;So sad.</li>
            <li> The eye brushes are completely terrible but they&#x27;re not high end either.</li>
            <li> Well, some of the softer blending brushes lose hair like crazy, the stiffer brushes don&#x27;t have this problem.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.. the shedding is awful</li>
            <li> The brushes shed like crazy.</li>
            <li> There was also a very wrong odor to the case, but after removing and washing the brushes, the smell didn&#x27;t stay on the brushes.</li>
            <li> This makes me think that I was just unlucky and received a bad batch of brushes.</li>
            <li> Every time I use it the hairs on the brush fall out bad quality</li>
            <li> BAD QUALITY..</li>
            <li> and they were not even bad.</li>
            <li> The hairs fall out all over the place, if you try to put something on you&#x27;ll just have hairs from the brush stuck on your face as well as badly blended make up.</li>
            <li> OMG BAD BAD</li>
            <li> The case that came with it smells like paint and also bad quality.</li>
            <li> anybody who complains must be a prude or maybe got a bad batch of brushes??</li>

            <li> These brushes shedded like no tomorrow and that was before I even attempted to wash them. They are very flimsy, but for the price I definitely thought I was going to get decent product, but was wrong. The brush bag is probably the most used item out of them all. I did like the smaller brushes as they didn&#x27;t shed like crazy and were usable. Not worth the money there are better brushes out there for this price.</li>
            <li> These brushes are adorable.&lt;br /&gt;If your just starting out I think this is a great inexpensive choice.&lt;br /&gt;However, they are a little scratchy and the bristles fall out.</li>
            <li> These brushes are crappy. The larger brushes shed like crazy, even after washing and conditioning. And the case smells horrible and my brushes had a weird white powder on the hairs when they arrived. And the case is pictured pink, but the case I received was like a greenish color.. I don&#x27;t recommend them at all. I would rather spend the money and get a good quality set.</li>
            <li> The brushes were good quality they shed a little at first but uf you shampoo and condition them they are really nice brushes.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes thinking they were a good value for the price. I was completely wrong. The face brushes shed, the hairs are uneven, and the are a little rough to use. The eye brushes are completely terrible but they&#x27;re not high end either. A few of the brushes are actually good but the overall package is not worth it</li>
            <li> I love the brushes &amp; everything about it ! The only bad thing is it has a bad scent but it goes away</li>
            <li> The set is fine, the quality is just not what I expected. I am in beauty school and hoped for a little bit better quality.</li>
            <li> All the brushes are great! I just don&#x27;t like how the hair comes out of the blush &amp; powder brushes!</li>
            <li> I really like the case and variety of brushes. Most of the brushes worked great but the powder brushes fell apart too easily.</li>
            <li> the big brushes fall apart and they dont put on make up well. it isnt worth the money. the goat hair sucks.</li>
            <li> As I get older I am finding that it is much more important to put your make-up on with brushes and as a nurse I realized that all the bacteria on my hands are being placed onto my face. These are very well made brushes and are a great buy. I compared these brushes price to other brushes of the same quality at a beauty store and I got these brushes for over half off. They also make nice gifts for some one who loves to apply makeup.</li>
            <li> I can deal with the smell of the brushes, I know that it will dissipate but I don&#x27;t like that they are shedding. I&#x27;ve done cheaper brushes before and it hasn&#x27;t been an issue.</li>
            <li> Loves it.  Came fast and ready to use.  Brushes like this normally sell for 10- 15 dollars per brush.  Great deal.  Great quality.  Thank u ;)</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE brushes. I ordered them, they came pretty fast, but, the quality of the brushes aren&#x27;t even worth $12. The powder brush is the only one I used and even that was terrible. The hair got all over my face. It was so gross.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Great brushes for the price. Am sure to purchase again when these wear out. Sheds a little, but work well. I use my brushes daily many times and have had no problem with these so far.</li>
            <li> ..my first impression were that when i open the case and remove the face brushes to look at them,  the face brushes were shedding a lot!! and i meant a lot! I immediately take them all out of the case and wash them..after they got dry it didn&#x27;t shed as much but some. the eye brushes are extremely soft and i guess they re pretty decent, but i cant believe they didn&#x27;t gave me a crease brush?! 20 brushes and no blending brush? that&#x27;s very disappointing! face brushes are crap! I don&#x27;t recommend them i think u can do a lot better if u re willing to pay a few extra bucks :) good for starters tho. the brushes are way to soft and some are hard..</li>
            <li> Ok let me start off by saying i AM DISAPOINTED !!! i was really excited to get these brushes in the mail &amp; they just arrived . The SMELL is HORRIBLE !! wash brushes !! . The big brushes and the fan brush SHED sooooooooo much i tryed washing them but that only made them shed more . All the little brushes are amazing so im not too sad with the brushes so if your buying this item for the big brushes i recommend spending a little more money for better quality . Brushes shed awfully ... Im pretty sad but hey the case is gorgeous (: hope this helped being 100% honest  !</li>
            <li> So I purchased these brushes to add to my collection. To start off the big brushes do shed a lot, the small ones not so much that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving them 3 stars. I have other brushes that work better that I bought at Walmart but these brushes do the job. They do have a smell,even after you wash them but, over all if this is your first set of brushes they will get the job done. They are soft and I have had no other problem besides just the shedding. I love the case that they come in and the fact that they are a pearly white I like a lot. I probably will be giving these to my niece and purchase new ones but I don&#x27;t know yet might just keep them for spares.</li>
            <li> The brushes are wonderful and of good quality BUT the case is not. It smells strongly of gasoline or something of the sort and looks cheap.  LOVE The brushes, HATE the case.  Package arrived super fast.    Love my brushes!:-D</li>
            <li> The quality of the brushes were horrible. The hairs in all of the brushes come out when you use them and leaves hair all over your face.The brushes are really soft. It arrived super fast.</li>
            <li> The brushes do shed a bit but not so much to be worried about, they also smelled like vinyl thats because they arrived in a vinyl case, and one of the heads on my brush came off I was a little upset about that but, overall i enjoy my brushes especially for such a cheap price!</li>
            <li> packaging is adorable, but the brushes themselves shed alot! if they didn&#x27;t shed so much they would be great as starter brush kits</li>
            <li> The case was very unappealing, and the one case wouldn&#x27;t close due to the magnetic snap on top being over too far to close with the bottom one. The brushes look rather good concidering price. Overall not too bad.</li>
            <li> all my brushes fell apart and where to soft didn&#x27;t hold eye shadow the way i expected. wish i never had it.</li>
            <li> Poor product, brushes shed everywhere!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Good set of brushes!  Some of the brushes are goat hair and I believe some are pony hair.  The case is vinyl and not leather, the case did not smell like gas it smells like vinyl.  I do recommend this set and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> This product is very good it is worth buying you can travel with it and you can rinse it off after you us it reuse over and over again it is very soft they aren&#x27;t hard brushes that will hurt your face</li>
            <li> I will never buy this product again... brushes are hard to face and looses hairs. Please read other reviews before buying.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. All natural goat hair make it an ease for eye shadow. Designer looking case. Price is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I JUST GOT MY 20 PIECE NEEWER GOAT HAIR make up brush set and i love it the hair is soooo soft and everything was in good conditions. Being that this is the first time ive ordered from amazon and i got what i wanted for good price and good quality makes me a happy customer deffinetly buying from NEEWER again :). THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> The brushes were not great they have like the same concealer brushes but in different sizes. and the brushes SHED every single time!!!!</li>
            <li> i really bought this to help me with my eyeshadows and blending them so most of the smaller shadow brushes and blending ones are good not to hard and dont really shed the bigger powder and blush brushes shed so much there useless im not that much of an expert on brushes but some really smaller brushes are super hard even the eyeliner brush i think is alittle to hard well atleast for the price i got a couple good brushes out of it</li>
            <li> They came very quickly in the mail.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to try them out. Well, some of the softer blending brushes lose hair like crazy, the stiffer brushes don&#x27;t have this problem. The larger fluffy brushes aren&#x27;t as dense as I would prefer. There was also a very wrong odor to the case, but after removing and washing the brushes, the smell didn&#x27;t stay on the brushes.</li>
            <li> This is a great starter brush set. The brushes are soft, hairs staying in the brush, and give enough diversity to be used for the entire face instead of just the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;The carrying case is plastic but it fills its purpose of keeping the brushes in their set spot. Extremely INEXPENSIVE and more than the bang for your buck!</li>
            <li> This is a nice set but some of the larger brushes do shed a lot. So I&#x27;ve avoided using them. I prefer just to use this set for the smaller brushes for eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> Variety of brushes still don&#x27;t know which ones to use for what but happy with the purchase. Love using them, soft and holds color (from eye shadow to blush and bronzer) very well.</li>
            <li> The quality of the brushes were horrible.  The hairs in all of the brushes come out when you use them and leaves hair all over your face.</li>
            <li> Let me start this review with a disclaimer: I purchased these brushes via ebay,not amazon...so this review is strictly about the brushes themselves and not the seller.  I honestly wanted to like these brushes, but they just were not good. When I opened the package my first opinion of the brushes were that: 1) they were NOT soft 2) The bristles were already bent and 3) they shed ALOT!!! I tried a variety of things to improve them:  - washed them several times with Master&#x27;s Brush Cleaner and Preserver (the kind artist use on paint brushes)  - soaked them in olive oil (hoping to soften them)  - DEEP conditioned them(again hoping to soften them)  After all that I will admit that they were finally softer, but not as soft as some of my other brushes. With that being said, the eye brushes were already really soft (although they also shed a ton) straight out of the package. It was the three face brushes, and the fan brush that were rough and scratchy. After spending the weekend trying to salvage these brushes I almost decided to keep them with the hope that hopefully the would get better with more washing and conditioning, but in actuality these brushes are way to thin to be of any use. They are not dense and fluffy the way they should be.  Overall I was not pleased with my purchase... I went back through the seller&#x27;s feedback on ebay to see if anyone else had the same problem, but almost 100% of the people that bought this set were talking about how great it was. This makes me think that I was just unlucky and received a bad batch of brushes. I contacted the seller and told them this and attached pictures(the same ones I uploaded on amazon) and they agreed to let me return the item. I cannot honestly say whether or not these are good quality brushes ( mine obviously weren&#x27;t), but maybe you&#x27;ll have better luck than I did.</li>
            <li> These brushes were really nice I loved the packaging the smell on vinyl bothered me a bit but I guess it will go away in time, but over all these were some really nice brushes I will recommend this set to anyone who is now starting their make up kit. I love these brushes &lt;3</li>
            <li> The small brushes for the eyes are grate but the bigger lashes don&#x27;t work. Every time I use it the hairs on the brush fall out bad quality I regret buying this.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and was extremely satisfied. Shipping didnt take long at all, and once i recieved the package i immediately started using it. Great wide variety of brushes ....you wont be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are horrible they fell apart as soon as I got them the hair comes apart they broke I do not recommend these brushes</li>
            <li> Good for the price, but definitely starter brushes</li>
            <li> I order these brushes Dec 20th and it arrived jan 17th... Really I wonder if you had to make the brushes, and they are bad quality. Wal-mart will do better. I promise you i don&#x27;t recommend this seller NO ONE.. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! PLEASE... BAD QUALITY.. TIME CONSUMING!!! NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes with the idea that well, they aren&#x27;t that expensive and there are a lot in there so even if I don&#x27;t use them all or don&#x27;t like them at all I have still saved a lot of money compared to high end department stores. My experience was great, I love the set, the look is very appealing and I use it everyday. They aren&#x27;t super high quality but they are very practical and useful. The brushes are soft and I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I actually really like these brushes...has all brushes you could need...perfect...</li>
            <li> Fast shipping was great! Great amount of brushes for the price I paid, case is wicked cute! The eye liner smudger brush did break on first use, easily fixed though, I would still buy it again, because the price is amazing!!</li>
            <li> So impressed with the various brushes for the novice or the professional makeup artist on the road.  You can create thousands of looks with the choices of brushes in this set.  Great quality brush set! You won&#x27;t be disappointed. Excellent!</li>
            <li> The bristles are to hard and fall out when using the bigger brushes. I wish they were softer</li>
            <li> I was excited when I came across these set of brushes and for the price it was being sold for! I was extremely disappointed on the quality of the brushes, as the hairs of the brushes would literally come out. The quality of the case is horrible as well; I would NOT recommend this product, please believe me when I say, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. it is exactly what I wanted and exactly how it looks in the item description. Love the case. very handy and stylish. looks like a clutch purse and makes it easy to just put it in your purse or travel bag! absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I love it, they are supper easy to take and use, efficient and look great. They are great and I recommended.</li>
            <li> Good brushes for a good price as well ! Work great !</li>
            <li> Bought this item as a Christmas present for my son&#x27;s girlfriend who is a teenager. High quality brushes! Great price!! I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my daughter so I can&#x27;t really give feedback other than it did arrive in a timely fashion and it looks exactly like the product I saw online when I ordered it. As for its quality I&#x27;m not sure since it hasn&#x27;t been used yet.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my sister and she was very happy it has all the size that she needed to makeup</li>
            <li> The brushes just fell out of the handle when i had tried to put on my make up with them</li>
            <li> These are goat hair and fantastic. Lots of brushes to choose from and wash with shampoo. I ordered 3 more as stocking stuffers for the women in my family.</li>
            <li> i have no complaints about these make up brushes themselves. they are very firm, fluffy and holds alot of product! but one complaint i do have is it doesnt come with a foundation brush which is okay because its not a bad set at all. but i would have loved to have a foundation brush in this set.</li>
            <li> Great brush set, however the bristles are very stiff.</li>
            <li> love these brushes they are the right size to fit your hand no funny smell pretty case pretty brushes love love love will recommend to friends will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Its ok.  The bristles are rough.  Could have used something softer.  But good product.</li>
            <li> All the brushes are great to use and if makes a perfect gift for beginners and i would buy this again</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.. the shedding is awful</li>
            <li> What you see is what you get. For what i spent, this product is great, I have yet to notice shedding. These are great for someone that has just begun to do makeup.</li>
            <li> My dougther love this brushes.... the es case is very goog quality,  the brushes are perferct diferente one each other.</li>
            <li> it was alright but when i got them some of the brush hair was sticking out of all my big brushes and they aren&#x27;t that soft either.</li>
            <li> This seller is really great and responsable, my package arrived in time and perfect. But, the product is not so good as I though, the bristles is too hard, isn&#x27;t soft at all! Also, the tools loose bristles a lot! I would not buy again, if i have a chance. Although, is a excelent price for 20 brushes.</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes because I wanted a complete set. The price can&#x27;t be beat for starters. I&#x27;ve seen reviews about the smell but mine doesn&#x27;t smell.. The brushes came before I expected them... However they don&#x27;t do a good job when it comes to applying the makeup.. I bought brushes by ELF from the dollar tree that did great.. The brushes still new so maybe they will grow on me.. As of now they&#x27;re okay  they aren&#x27;t horrible products.. They are a great gift for somebody starting out wearing makeup</li>
            <li> For the price, this is PERFECT. I am a makeup artist so I always need/want brushes and these are perfect for my kit or myself. The larger brushes are a but rough on the face, and the &amp;#34;hair loss&amp;#34; was extremely minimal. Shipping also went wayyyy faster then expected. Thank you! I would buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> Not great, but good for the price</li>
            <li> All of the brushes are amazing and put your makeup on perfect. The tiny brush is amazing for cat eyes.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like the material of the brushes , some seemed used but overall I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it at all</li>
            <li> Love the case the brushes came in,it arrived on time, was packaged in bubble wrap,all d brushes was there, exactly wht i saw online</li>
            <li> The small brushes work great but the 3 big one are crappie the shed really bad</li>
            <li> the eye brushes are nice. smelled funny bigger brushes feel apart and got ruined when cleaned.</li>
            <li> Purchase these brushes and they have a strong bad smell! Plus the are not soft at all. They hair falls off easily too.</li>
            <li> I loved the Brushes thankk you very much. &amp;&amp; for a convinent price. ♥ They were exactly the ones that I was missing in my makeup collection. (:</li>
            <li> I love my brushes. I used them everyday and they still look great and hair is not coming out like stated on previous reviews. The smell I read in a few comments is just the normal smell of new plastic, nothing major. That smell actually went away after a week of using them daily. For the price it is absolutely worth it !!! I have brushes from &amp;#34;Bella&amp;#34; brand and this brushes are very similar for a lot less than Bella brushes. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because the big brush should be a little bit fuller than it is; other than that no complains.</li>
            <li> These where bought for my daughter and she loves them. Very good quality, and you get so much for your money.</li>
            <li> The brushes are really soft. They shed a lil&#x27; bit but nothing to worry. Great to practice :) (I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist)</li>
            <li> El product tomo poco tiempo en llegar tanto a miami como a vzla... en muy buen estado, muy buena calidad...</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes because of the amount of brushes and for such a small price. I mean who wouldn&#x27;t? When they came i was super excited. I took one of the powder brushes out and they were so SOFT. But then i looked at my hand and there was hairs all over the place! It wasnt too horrible so i used them anyway. The smaller brushes dont shed at all but the big ones do. When i used the foundation brush i noticed that there was hairs on my face and i have to take them off slowly as to not remove my makeup. Another thing about these brushes it that they smell HORRIBLE! When i use them i hold my breath because of the smell. I have washed them 3 times and they still smell bed. Another thing is the mascara wand is starting to come off and i haven&#x27;t even had these brushes for a month. They would be great brushes if these things got fixed.</li>
            <li> The hair on the bigger brushes shed , and they are not good for blending or applying makeup.</li>
            <li> A year later, some of them have started losing their tips.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product some time ago and absolutely hated these brushes. As soon as you use them they start to fall apart and never got any better. My face was covered in little hairs which is simply annoying. Once you get all the hairs off your face all your make-up has been rubbed off. I would strongly suggest choosing a different product and not wasting your money.</li>
            <li> Okay the biggest brushes shed a LOT. I&#x27;ve washed them and they still shed.  However, since I bought the kit for the eye and lip brushes (which don&#x27;t shed that I can tell) and the cute case - the product is still good.  Love the adorable case, love the brush selection.  And now, my toddler can play with the big brushes while I use the rest :)</li>
            <li> I love these brushes to death, I am so excited about how well they apply my makeups been and any products I use for my face. This has to be my favorite set out of all the sets I have bought.</li>
            <li> the hair started to come out a bit on a few but still lovely quality and for the price you cant beat it</li>
            <li> Horrible brushes. Feels like I&#x27;m poking my face with branches</li>
            <li> The majority of the reviews on these brushes are negative simply because the brushes shed. They&#x27;re natural hair brushes, there&#x27;s going to be some shedding until you wash them. It&#x27;s ridiculous how many people will hate a product simply because they don&#x27;t know how to use it.  Obviously they aren&#x27;t perfect, I mean look at the price and the amount that you&#x27;re getting.  I think overall for what you pay for them, they&#x27;re decent brushes. Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I was fairly upset when this came in the mail.. I didn&#x27;t even bother using them, I donated them to good will. I went back on amazon and spent the same price + shipping to receive BH Cosmetic brushes. this is a waste, don&#x27;t bother. not even worth the price, I wouldn&#x27;t pay 2$ for this. It&#x27;s complete garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although shipping was fast and I&#x27;d buy from this seller again, the product itself was trash.</li>
            <li> So wonderful very professional quality.</li>
            <li> theses brushes are great i need to know what they are all used for but ill guess i will figure it out soon</li>
            <li> people are saying that the brushes are not very soft and the hairs fall out and that they smell.  The hairs are a little loose when the brushes first come, I thought they were extremely soft compared to the ones I have had in the past, the only thing that smells is the case, just smells like new plastic and it goes away.  I love this whole sent and am very happy with the purchase! I wold recommend them for any one!</li>
            <li> Very fast shiptment. I love how soft all of the brushes are and it&#x27;s in a handy pink carrying case.</li>
            <li> the brushes fell apart within the week of getting them. I don&#x27;t recommend at all! The bristels fall out left and right</li>
            <li> This set is better then i had expected. I read a few reviews that said it was no good. but when i got it i went over the brushes. only 2 or 3 were rough out of the whole set. and they were not even bad. they hold the make up perfectly. i am so happy with this. The only thing i dislike is the case. its not very heavy duty, and its kinda flimsy.</li>
            <li> Decent brush set for the price. It gets the job done but it does shed alot. I dont know how to fix this problem it doesnt bother me much but yea.</li>
            <li> Love the item I found that this item is perfect for what I wanted it for and did not find that they shed very much which is a plus this ten also came on time :)</li>
            <li> I love  them soft and give a flawless finish</li>
            <li> Smelled funny and fallout, but after i washed them they are amazing!!</li>
            <li> DO NOT PURCHASE&lt;br /&gt;these face brushes weren&#x27;t soft and when you wash them the bristles bend and fall out.&lt;br /&gt;The eye brushes are amazing though</li>
            <li> 100% recommended excellent product</li>
            <li> The hairs fall out all over the place, if you try to put something on you&#x27;ll just have hairs from the brush stuck on your face as well as badly blended make up. The only reason it has 2 stars is because there are a few brushes that do there jobs and do them well.</li>
            <li> The bushes suck the hair in the brushes comes out with ease I washed the brushes and the hair came out more never again will I spend my money with this company again</li>
            <li> My Daughter LOVES IT !  It arrived on time and is just what I expected... I would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> the brushes had rips and tears on parts of it and the face brush is too small for all over powder,3 brushes are exactly the same and 4eyebrushes are exactly the same.. but other thenthat they are really soft.</li>
            <li> My sister is a 30 year old make-up master and daughter is a 13 year old up and comer and both loved these as Xmas presents!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They lose a bit of hair to start, but overall are excellent for the price.</li>
            <li> These brushes came nicely, but the case it was in sucks! The case was torn black marks everywhere and it&#x27;s just horrible.</li>
            <li> Thank you, It was just what I was looking for. So many people ask where i got it. Thanks again</li>
            <li> Was a gift for my sister. She loved it</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the set. The brushes shed like crazy. The smaller brushes are ok. I don&#x27;t recommend them.</li>
            <li> get it as a gift for someone, she was happy with the softness of the brush.  So as of now, we are happy</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see such a great deal on these brushes. When they arrived, I LOVED the cute case, so adorable and it keeps them well protected. Unfortunately when i actually started to use the brushes, they were AWFUL. Also, there was no foundation brush, which i was extremely disappointed about. I definitely recommend spending the 10 dollars more for a little better quality!!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes no shedding and they feel great on my skin!!!! Will definently buy again!!!!</li>
            <li> the hairs fall out of the brushes and stick in make-up. the smaller things in this pack are awesome i love them. they are all really soft and i think that is why they fall out.</li>
            <li> I ordered this makeup brush set for my daughter and she loves it!! It would be helpful however if there was a list of which brushes should be used for what. Other than that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> THESE ARE GREAT AS LONG AS YOU ARE NOT USING THE GOATS HAIR BRUSHES WHICH IS ALL OF THE LARGER BRUSHES. THE GOATS HAIR KEEPS  FALLING OUT RELATIVELY EASY</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking that there really couldn&#x27;t be &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; brushes and because the case was so cute. The brushes hurt my face the scratch my face and I have tried washing them many times and they don&#x27;t get any softer. The goat hair in them constantly falls out of the brushes. This was not a good product.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves them. Bought them as a Christmas gift and she says they are much better than the ones she had. Case is nice, but the fan brush was bent upon arrival as it was packaged in the crease so I moved it to another spot. It didnt straighten out though :-(</li>
            <li> Love the case. the brushes where very small, not fluffy. the bristle keep falling out of the brush.  not a good product.</li>
            <li> When i first bought it i thought \\&quot;its new so hairs are going to come out. But All of the hairs in my brushes came out\\&quot;. PLEASE DO NOT BUY!!!! It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> Very impressed on how quickly these were here. They work great. Great value. They do have a very strong plastic smell that I hope wears off eventually</li>
            <li> Very few of the brushes are stiff enough to accomplish anything, but it&#x27;s a good starter set for someone who has a basic makeup routine. The case is really convenient for travel.</li>
            <li> I have been meaning to write a review since I first received these brushes. I was very displeased with them. As soon as I opened them, some were broken. The amount that they shed is just ridiculous. And they are a tad rough. I have purchased cheaper brushes from Target that work much better than these. All in all, I do not recommend anyone getting these.</li>
            <li> I liked these brushes as seen in the product picture but when I got them the fan brush had hairs going fifteenth directions and the brushes smelled very weird not a new smell it was worse. But other than that I&#x27;m going to test them out and see how I like them.</li>
            <li> I wish I knew how coarse the bigger brushes were before purchasing. They are coarse goat hair and irritate my face. The smaller brushes are fine.</li>
            <li> I loved the price of this brush set. Love the case. Only thing I don&#x27;t really care for are how the hairs on my brushes are slowly falling out. I use them often and when I do use them, the hairs are left on my face.</li>
            <li> Unsatisfied with these brushes.  They are rough, too rough to use on sensitive faces.  The hairs fall off of them when using them too, which is extremely annoying.  I would not purchase these and do not recommend them when there are better similarly priced brushes out there.</li>
            <li> it was perfect I thought I wouldn&#x27;t like them but they are great and a great price deff going to give as presents</li>
            <li> I chose this product for the excellent rating it received.  I would recommend this purchase to several of my friends because of the style.</li>
            <li> Brushes are rough and don&#x27;t hold product well.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes although I wish they did come with a better variety of the types of brushes included, they work well and the case is cute as well!</li>
            <li> Great set for the price it! does the job! got it for my sister in law and she loved it</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my daughter. She is in colorguard and has to be able to apply show make up.  This brush set comes with everything she needed.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my teen daughter. She seems to love them. They smelled strongly when they came in and we are still working to wash the smell out. They are not the best quality but they are good for a teen who wants to play make up with friends.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush roll to replace my crap Kmart brushes that were plastic fibers. I bought these because they were natural hairs and not synthetic. I&#x27;ve been using them for months on myself and other people in everyday situations and for stage makeup. True, at first the larger brushes shed a little but if you wash them and knock loose the extra hairs, you wont get hairs on your face. All of the people I have used these on love them as much as I do. I rated it four stars instead of five because the handles are REALLY LONG. I don&#x27;t know how many times I&#x27;ve hit myself in the face while doing someones makeup.</li>
            <li> I love the brushes. I was very impressed by them when they arrived in the mail. I also love the bag it came in</li>
            <li> This was received exactly like advertised...I used a few of the brushes and was pretty pleased with the results,,I certainly don&#x27;t regret the purchase</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loved this gift in her stocking on christmas morning.  A very complete set of brushes for her every need.</li>
            <li> These are a great affordable starter set for a teen. My daughter loves them and is experimenting with the assortment. As a pro I need a tad more in quality but are great for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Great set.  Even though I&#x27;m a begginer with using a lot of makeup products, this set helped with everything.  I love it!</li>
            <li> These brushes are lovely. They do not smell as badly as some of these women claim the case smells only for a few days because of the material it&#x27;s not bad at all. The brushes were really soft and of good quality. The only issue is they shed sometimes. Other than that good product, don&#x27;t be misled.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very nice. They shipped fast, and they were in new condition. Most brush sets cost way more than these did. These brushes at the price  I bought them for was a steal.</li>
            <li> These brushes are HORRIBLE! They shed way too much, and they were not soft at all. I guess you can&#x27;t expect too much considering the price, but my god. At least put some quality into the brushes. The brushes weren&#x27;t dense enough to get makeup on the brushes to apply to your face. I guess you can say they were too floppy or flat. Not good for applying makeup...which is what I thought makeup brushes were for. Very confused as to why people are saying they love this product. It sucks. Save your money for eco tools or something. Not worth it all. I curse 16 y/o me when I bought these.</li>
            <li> I GOT THESE BRUSH AFTER A MONTH OF WAITING OMG OMG BAD BAD&lt;br /&gt;DONT BUy this product i threw mine in the trash after 2 mins of&lt;br /&gt;them . and i dont wont my money back they suck!</li>
            <li> The thing is I love the smaller brushes they&#x27;re great and work amazingly well, but the bigger brushes are absolutely terrible. They feel scratchy against my skin and irritated it, and the brush hairs keep falling out. They are TERRIBLE. I absolutely recommend purchasing a couple different sizes of bigger brushes because I really don&#x27;t like them. Also, the spouley, that looks like a mascara wand for blending out the harsh lines when you fill your eyebrows in, the entire thing just broke off the brush. I also tried super-gluing it and it didn&#x27;t work it still fell apart, and it was loose too. Lastly, the case that they came in smelled something like gasoline and I really didn&#x27;t like that. One more thing, is that the case doesn&#x27;t come with a flat foundation brush so I recommend buying one of those too if you thought it would have. Your welcome!</li>
            <li> OMG.... this set of brush was the worst ever... the hairs were falling of  and got all over my face... it&#x27;s just not worth my money..</li>
            <li> These do smell like really bad at first but I&#x27;m sure when I wash them it will go away but these brushes are great and I love the price as well and on another note it  came on the day they said it would surprising</li>
            <li> Great product! The goat hair is soooo soft. First I was afraid, because let&#x27;s be honest it&#x27;s not MAC or anything like that, but I pleasantly surprised when I had the brushes in my hand. I can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li> Love this product...It&#x27;s my second buy, another was for a gift and my friend enjoy it too as me, I recomend very much</li>
            <li> They are not good at all I hate them cheap quality n weak</li>
            <li> Love love love....great brushes! Well worth it! I use Younique make up and I will only use quality brushes with my make up</li>
            <li> Not happy Very thin brushes and the hairs come out very easily . I&#x27;m very disappointed. The case is ugly too.</li>
            <li> Love this brushes I&#x27;ve had them for over a years and they still work great. Im about to put in another order for them.</li>
            <li> Love all the brushes, ty</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a big makeup geek for a while, and I&#x27;ve tried many different brushes. These are terrible! They&#x27;re not dense at all. They don&#x27;t pick up product very good at all, and they shed so much. I&#x27;m assuming that everyone who rated these brushes a 5 has never tried good brushes, no offense.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these brushes to any one that has owned high end brushes or even elf brushes. The fluffy brushes have a lot of fall out of hair, but the tiny brushes actually aren&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> I got this brushes because of the selection and because it was so affordable, but honestly it is best to spend the extra money in a good set or individual ones. These brushes shed, I felt like I was applying makeup with my cat&#x27;s hairy tail. DO NOT waste your money on these!!!</li>
            <li> So far these brushes has been shedding only 3 brushes works well for me. Next time I will go out to the actual stores rather than buy brushes online.</li>
            <li> This product showed up before the estimated delivery date. I was VERY pleased with that. I opened the package and the case was very sturdy,  will be using it for traveling. The face brushes smelled funny even after I washed them,and they shed EVERY WHERE. As for the lip brushes, there was I think 4 of them, all very nice. And the other brushes were very nice as well. As for this set, I think I am going to stick to my elf brushes. I would recommend these for someone who is just staring off though. There is every basic brush you need!</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know what most of these brush&#x27;s intended use is, but i have plenty to use for my makeup and more! the carrying case is cute enough that i&#x27;ve considered keeping the brushes elsewhere and using it as a clutch. the plastic sleeves keep the brushes from splaying out and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I bought this set a while back as a back up set. I do makeup professionally and thought they would be great especially for the price! When they came, I just placed them in my makeup bag and never touched them. I finally got to use them and was so excited... until I used them! The bristles were EVERYWHERE! My clients needed a lint roller to get them all off!! THEN when I washed them.... it was even worse! Case is cute but don&#x27;t bother! spend more and get brushes that WON&#x27;T fall apart when you use or wash them!</li>
            <li> Nice case and brushes. Not all that soft and they had a smell that hasn&#x27;t gone away.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend these brushes.  Although, you would think its a good price for the sheer number of brushes; it is a waste.  These brushes shed horribly.  On the first, second, and third use I would end up with goat hairs all over my face and in my foundation.  Gross...</li>
            <li> Soft, nice for makeup applications and with its carrying case, it has a nice selection of sizes to use.&lt;br /&gt;I have went through cheap brushes and remnants would still be on my face after using blush...these don&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;They are sturdy, soft and easy to clean!!! Just soap and water and let them dry on a towel.&lt;br /&gt;Works great for me!!!</li>
            <li> I loved the price for this item so I bought two and gave one to my girlfriend. The brush case was sturdy and the choice of brushes was good. My only complaint is that the larger powder brushes do a LOT of SHEDDING!!! Other than that for the most part the other brushes get the job done.</li>
            <li> Love the brushes. I like the variety of the different size brushes. I liked all of them except the blush brush, for some reason it doesn&#x27;t hold the color</li>
            <li> this product is amazing...my only complaint is that it took a long time to get to me...mine didnt shed alot and the entire package is very easy to clean...overall i give this product a b+ :)</li>
            <li> It losses the hair as when utilized, you get full of this hair on your face when applying the makeup&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not expecting a high quality set, but something that holds normal usage.</li>
            <li> My daughter in law is a make-up artist and she loves these brushes!</li>
            <li> I love the packaging, but the SMELL, was horrible. Absolutely unbearable. I&#x27;ve tried soaking them, and washing them but the smell doesn&#x27;t seem to fade.</li>
            <li> The bigger brushes were hard and the bristles fall out. But the other brushes were OK.</li>
            <li> Very nice an received it quick!!</li>
            <li> Nice set of makeup brushes!</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick and also good packaging. Now, the quality of the brushes are horrible. Getting them out of the plastic they were already shedding all of them. The case that came with it smells like paint and also bad quality.</li>
            <li> i bought this on september 19 and just received them today oct 2. i was honestly a little skeptical about these because of some of the negative or mixed reviews here on amazon but saw alot of decent ones on youtube so i decided to give thema try because the price was unbeatable ive paid more for really cruddy synthetic sets in stores before..and i figured if i didnt like them i could pawn them off on my sister lol. WELL I LOVE LOVE LUUURRRRVVVEEE them. taking it out of the package, there was a plastic-y paint smell, to me it smelled new in my opinion, like new plastic, my guess from the case it was in. i personally didnt find it that offensive, its been out of the package for maybe close to an hour now and the smell is just about gone now, and did i mention im 9 months pregnant and have the nose of a blood hound? lol anyways so i washed my hands, and opened it for inspection. my first impression of the brushes was how soft they were even the eyeliner brush was soft, softer than any ive used before. there was very very little shedding with mine. i plucked literally like 3 or 4 stragglers and that was it so far, remember these are goat hair so they might shed a little at first but its nothing 1 wash cant fix..you should wash them before you use them anywayyysss. ive bought worse and paid more (for less than 20 brushes!) shopping inside of a store before i really have no complaints about my set. anybody who complains must be a prude or maybe got a bad batch of brushes?? idk but i love these. i would absolutley recommend them might even buy a couple more because they would make great stocking stuffers for christmas. if youre still unsure about this set after reading the amazon reviews, i would take a peek on youtube..and  that goes for most any beauty product you would buy on here..i like watching people use them in action ya know lol hope this helped</li>
            <li> Excellent product and services!</li>
            <li> It´s a set of beautiful brushes. The case is practical ans nice.&lt;br /&gt;The problem was the goat hais fell off from the stick.&lt;br /&gt;They got all over my face when I used it.&lt;br /&gt;So sad.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied and happy because the product arrived just in time, attention and speed was great, I highly recommend them. thanks</li>
