            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>So glad that i did!</li>
            <li>If you have to do your own nails, this is a must.  </li>
            <li>I read good reviews about this top coat, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>It dries fast and has awesome shine.</li>
            <li>Nice work.</li>
            <li>So worth the money!!!</li>
            <li>More bang for your buck, and a great top coat to boot. :)</li>
            <li>The best fast drying top coat.</li>
            <li>The absolute best TOP Coat ever made!&lt;br /&gt;Simply put a must buy!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My favorite too coat, and I&#x27;ve tried Many!</li>
            <li>Excellent for a quick way to brighten your nails and go, makes them look freshly done</li>
            <li>This one dries quickly and is nice and shiny!</li>
            <li>Happy to have found a great price on the big bottle on Amazon.</li>
            <li>If your nail color can&#x27;t adhere well to the nail, then a good top coat wont do a whole lot of good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better luck with cheaper drug store brands, so I&#x27;d skip this.</li>
            <li>- there&#x27;s nothing better. :)</li>
            <li>I have been using &amp;#34;out the door&amp;#34; top coat for over 15 years.  </li>
            <li>It is another one of my favorite nail products.</li>
            <li>As most know, creating nail designs can be a multi layer project....</li>
            <li>Why do I love this stuff?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it really dries well and is a great top coat</li>
            <li>Within 10 minutes, I feel confident to grab my keys and run out the door.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>It dries my nails very rapidly and does a great top coat.  </li>
            <li>This top coat didn&#x27;t blow me away at all.</li>
            <li>look that I love.</li>
            <li>However, I find it works better on some polishes and doesn&#x27;t make them chip.</li>
            <li>I was able to put a coat on and literally walk out the door.</li>
            <li>Finishes with a nice shine and a smooth feel.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion INM Out the Door is better than both.</li>
            <li>think I should invest in stock for this nail drying product because I love that it works and it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So glad.</li>
            <li>As Wraps, Beauty Secrets top coat and Nutra Nail Mineral Rock Hardener.  </li>
            <li>Nothing holds up better than Out The Door</li>
            <li>When I use this top coat on my mom&#x27;s manicures she can literally grow the polish halfway up her nail before it falls off because she works at a desk.  </li>
            <li>Out The door bottle I use to apply the top coat.  </li>
            <li>My favorite topcoat.</li>
            <li>excellent especially for the price.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>favorite top coat.</li>
            <li>I have tried many, many top coats in my search for the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; one.</li>
            <li>I have never tried a quicker drying top coat as this one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s my favorite at the moment.</li>
            <li>I love this topcoat l, I&#x27;ve use so many brands</li>
            <li>shine top coat on over it.</li>
            <li>This topcoat has been my favorite for over 5 years.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how nice it is to have a product that dries the top of the  nails quickly.  </li>
            <li>this is a pretty good product.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s a good deal larger, volume wise, than at the salon.</li>
            <li>Loved it so much I bought this refill.</li>
            <li>It dries super fast, looks great.</li>
            <li>Dries super fast and has a great shine.</li>
            <li>I love this product, best quick dry ever.</li>
            <li>Other than that the product is GREAT!!!</li>
            <li>It is also so great to top coat before your polish is fully dry and be able to use your hands within seconds.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best top cost I have tried especially when it comes to extending the life of a manicure.  </li>
            <li>Love the size of the bottle and the cool shape.</li>
            <li>Excellent quick dry, helps prevent nails from breaking.</li>
            <li>This is definitely the best fast drying top coat available.</li>
            <li>Best quick dry I&#x27;ve used yet!</li>
            <li>just wish it was thicker more like sallys instdri clearly quick.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as a top coat in general, the best I can say about</li>
            <li>BEST PRODUCT, HANDS DOWN!</li>
            <li>Huge.</li>
            <li>And it tends to diffuse the color you&#x27;ve already painted on; you have to use a LOT of top coat just to protect your fresh polish from the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d heard such good things about this top coat I wanted to try it out.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m good about remembering to reapply this top coat the same day I&#x27;m climbing, it holds up quite well against the rock walls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a good clear coat, so I&#x27;ll use it a bunch.</li>
            <li>It is quick drying, great protection with no noticeable shrinkage and it has a nice, smooth application compared to Seche that always seems to goop up on me half way through the bottle.</li>
            <li>I first started using this product 4 years ago when I had newborn twins!!  </li>
            <li>, the brush picks up a good deal of your polish color as you paint it on, which will eventually taint the bottle with a mix of colors and shimmers, a major irritant of mine.</li>
            <li>Out of the two, OPI chipped first and chipped more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried different products over the years, but Out The Door is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>it is &#x27;meh, nothing special.&#x27;</li>
            <li>So, this could easily become my new stand by top coat.</li>
            <li>Great Shine and Does dry quick.</li>
            <li>After reading the rave reviews I was super excited to try this out.</li>
            <li>and it kind of transferred a little onto the top coat, but not a lot to ruin the top coat polish.</li>
            <li>Works great with every brand nail polish and dries in seconds, doesn&#x27;t smear or drag color or polish either.</li>
            <li>I tried this on my own, natural nails.</li>
            <li>This top coat really works.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re usually full.</li>
            <li>I find this a good trade-off for lasting power.  </li>
            <li>Inexpensive fast drying top coat.</li>
            <li>Size of polish was great but did not dry as fast as I hoped.</li>
            <li>It truly is a great hard drying top coat.</li>
            <li>It dries fairly quickly;</li>
            <li>It dries as quickly as the name implies.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to doing my nails before bed and even though I wait for what I think is an adequate time, my nails are always ruined in the morning.</li>
            <li>and it also doesn&#x27;t give that super shiny</li>
            <li>but I recommend seche vite quick drying topcoat instead.</li>
            <li>Had definitely become my favorite in top coats.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Super</li>
            <li>I prefer this super size bottle cause</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this top coat if you need something that lasts.  </li>
            <li>Of the three fast-drying top coats I&#x27;ve tried: Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat, Sally Hansen Insta-Dri Anti-Chip Top Coat and INM Out The Door</li>
            <li>It was the least shiny of them all (most polishes had more of a shine on their own than they did with a coat of OtD over them), not to mention that the finish felt almost rubbery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product and  I live by it.</li>
            <li>I think this isa pretty good topcoat especially for the price.i</li>
            <li>The top coat gives it an excellent shine and I can paint my nails and they are drive in less than two minutes - fully dry.</li>
            <li>Two pretty manicured thumbs up!</li>
            <li>My nails always looked freshly done.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a top coat that holds up to a woman with a busy schedule.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I can do my nails right before bedtime.</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;ve painted my nails and gone right to bed</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the following is true for acrylic or gel nails, though I&#x27;m sure it is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>keeps mani looking fresh and dries super fast</li>
            <li>I had gone through a couple of the little bottles of this top coat that you can find in the stores, and had established it as my favourite top coat.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s marketed as super fast drying</li>
            <li>This polish while it does what the name suggests it dries super fast</li>
            <li>Dries super fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very fast drying; 2min, and glossy finish.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hard to find this size, and this is a great price for it.</li>
            <li>I usually buy pretty high end nail polish and have tried a lot of nice top coats (opi, sephora, julep) ....</li>
            <li>Have tried many other similar products, but none can compare...  Try it, you will love it too!</li>
            <li>You apply it and in seconds your nails are ready to go out!</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase this larger bottle, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s cheaper online with shipping, funny thing...</li>
            <li>&quot; Top Coat, OTD comes in last place.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m aware of the dangers of using Seche Vite, which is why I continue to look for alternatives, but it appears that I might have mistaken what Out the Door is supposed to do for your nails, because a replacement for Seche Vite, it is not.</li>
            <li>It absolutely extends the life of your manicure!</li>
            <li>bought my first bottle at CVS just to try it out.</li>
            <li>I was not aware when I ordered but this bottle is HUGE and will last me a good while.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d try this top coat just for kicks, especially since it&#x27;s so much cheaper than Seche Vite.</li>
            <li>Finally a walk out the door product that REALLY works,  Love it.  </li>
            <li>This does help your polish dry more quickly, however it still doesn&#x27;t completely protect your fresh nails.  </li>
            <li>The quick dry aspect of the top coat is nice, but it doesn&#x27;t have the mirror shine that I like from other products, and it ships faster than the one I normally use.  </li>
            <li>The top coat itself may dry quickly on already dry nails if you&#x27;re looking to finish or \\&quot;freshen up\\&quot; your already completely dry manicure, but this does NOT dry ALL of the layers of nail polish in a reasonable amount of time the way Seche Vite does FLAWLESSLY and Insta-Dri does VERY well -</li>
            <li>I read the positive reviews and took the plunge in buying this.</li>
            <li>dries my nail polish pretty fast.</li>
            <li>So I have to wait for my layers of nail polish to dry and wear this on top.</li>
            <li>Someone reccommended this to me and I love it - who has the patience to wait until their nails are dry?</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, not my fave, and I certainly won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li>Surprise just how large it is....very shiny just what I was looking for</li>
            <li>I bought the large 4oz bottle</li>
            <li>Dries fast, large bottle</li>
            <li>It is a quick dry formula but it will not dry as fast as Seche Vite or have quite the smooth, super glossy finish you get from Seche.  </li>
            <li>holy roller, it is HUGE, it will last me forever.</li>
            <li>It dries very thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You also get so much for what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>Dries so fast.</li>
            <li>It dries really fast.</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t tried it.</li>
            <li>I really suggest this.</li>
            <li>and it dries FAST.  </li>
            <li>Which is what I expect a fast drying polish to do.</li>
            <li>Fast Drying\\</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>best results I suggest reapplying every other day or so as well as using with a good base coat.</li>
            <li>When I bought it i thought it was a normal size, like a nail polish size!</li>
            <li>It goes on so well and dries faster than any other top coat I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>smearing is only really sort of useful for blending when doing ombre nail designs, but you&#x27;ll need to do multiple coats to smooth out the roughness sponging the colors on does to the surface of your nails.</li>
            <li>dries fast, super shiny but peels off of my actual nail within 24 hours</li>
            <li>I used to use Seche Vite Fast Drying Top Coat, and although it leaves your nails extra glossy, it doesn&#x27;t dry as fast as this!</li>
            <li>The product is quite an advancement from previous top coats I have used.</li>
            <li>I actually bought it with OPI&#x27;s top coat at the same time.</li>
            <li>This top coat dries pretty fast, but you have to apply a thick coat, otherwise it gets streaks through your colour.</li>
            <li>Like many other people I&#x27;ve tried every quick dry that comes in a bottle or spray can and nothing compares to this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Sinful Colors on the low end and Seche Vite on the high end of top coats in comparison both dry faster and with as much</li>
            <li>One coat and your polish is dry super fast.  </li>
            <li>will give it a few stars as I love the bottle size,</li>
            <li>My nail polish last twice as long without chipping with this top coat on.</li>
            <li>this makes ur nail design , dried and ready to wear very quickly.</li>
            <li>It came quickly, faster than expected and it also dries really fast, in seconds.</li>
            <li>Also doesn&#x27;t seem to thicken up as fast as some other fast dry top coats I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>A new staple on my nail polish obsession.</li>
            <li>Allows my manicure and pedicure to dry quickly without smears.</li>
            <li>I ordered this because a salon recommended it and used it on my mani-pedi to quick dry.  </li>
            <li>but it adds great shine that lasts a long time and probably cuts dry time in half.  </li>
            <li>so i just used it, it really is quick dry, smooth application, not thick or chunky, although i didnt let my color coat dry entirely</li>
            <li>I usually give it about 15 minutes before I do something more involved like wearing gloves or doing the dishes.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>Bought it first in a beauty shop and never looked back.</li>
            <li>I can tell that this is going to last me a good long while, but it still has all the quality of the little bottles.</li>
            <li>It dries in about a minute, which i think is pretty fast, especially consider i put 2 coats of my regular nail polish on below it.</li>
            <li>How i use it; base coat, then a top coat, then 2-3 coats of my nail polish and then top coat, it dries in 45 seconds!</li>
            <li>I feel a little cheap</li>
            <li>i would definately recommend this to anyone will soft brittle nails.</li>
            <li>Outs Seche Vite completely in my book.</li>
            <li>Leaves behind a nice gloss that lasts.</li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars because it did live up to the Fast drying claim, but it wasn&#x27;t long wearing from my experience.</li>
            <li>I have another brand that I like a bit better, but this is a larger size for the same amount as the other brand.  </li>
            <li>All the other products I have used in the past were wore  off in two days, this product has held on for up to four or more days!  </li>
            <li>The only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t have a high gloss look.</li>
            <li>the long brush, the price tag, and shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s not the worst top coat I&#x27;ve used it only keeps my polish on for two days before it starts chipping, which isn&#x27;t that great if you ask me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will say that it does dry fast, though I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s any faster than SV or Poshé.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some side notes, the brush that is included is very course and because of its length harder to keep under control, I have an old .5 ounce</li>
            <li>I am pretty rough on my nails too!  </li>
            <li>Seems to resist major polish chippage.</li>
            <li>It dries your nails super fast and prevents chipping for at least a solid week.</li>
            <li>My nails last at least 1-2 days longer than my other top coats and it truly dries fast.  </li>
            <li>like OTD because it dries fast, isn&#x27;t thick like seche vite, and my nails don&#x27;t chip as easily as they did with all the other things</li>
            <li>I use OPI polish, put the top coat of Out the Door on, and my nails last at least a week without any chipping or wearing off of the edges, and I only apply one coat!  </li>
            <li>It did dry fast, but my nail polish started to chip the same day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a variety of topcoats &amp; had been going back and forth between Zoya and Seche fast Dry.</li>
            <li>When it got to the point a couple of years ago that it became much more difficult to keep up the &#x27;fill&#x27; every two weeks, I decided to go natural and have the coating taken off.  </li>
            <li>I have gone through two .5 ounce bottles of Out The Door, three .5 once bottles of Seche Vite, and numerous other top coats including Sally Hansen Hard</li>
            <li>Other products that dry fast don&#x27;t protect the polish like this does!</li>
            <li>I found if I put a little bit too much</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> So glad that i did!</li>
            <li> If you have to do your own nails, this is a must.  </li>
            <li> I read good reviews about this top coat, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> It dries fast and has awesome shine.</li>
            <li> Nice work.</li>
            <li> So worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> More bang for your buck, and a great top coat to boot. :)</li>
            <li> The best fast drying top coat.</li>
            <li> The absolute best TOP Coat ever made!&lt;br /&gt;Simply put a must buy!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My favorite too coat, and I&#x27;ve tried Many!</li>
            <li> Excellent for a quick way to brighten your nails and go, makes them look freshly done</li>
            <li> This one dries quickly and is nice and shiny!</li>
            <li> Happy to have found a great price on the big bottle on Amazon.</li>
            <li> If your nail color can&#x27;t adhere well to the nail, then a good top coat wont do a whole lot of good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better luck with cheaper drug store brands, so I&#x27;d skip this.</li>
            <li> - there&#x27;s nothing better. :)</li>
            <li> I have been using &amp;#34;out the door&amp;#34; top coat for over 15 years.  </li>
            <li> It is another one of my favorite nail products.</li>
            <li> As most know, creating nail designs can be a multi layer project....</li>
            <li> Why do I love this stuff?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it really dries well and is a great top coat</li>
            <li> Within 10 minutes, I feel confident to grab my keys and run out the door.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> It dries my nails very rapidly and does a great top coat.  </li>
            <li> This top coat didn&#x27;t blow me away at all.</li>
            <li> look that I love.</li>
            <li> However, I find it works better on some polishes and doesn&#x27;t make them chip.</li>
            <li> I was able to put a coat on and literally walk out the door.</li>
            <li> Finishes with a nice shine and a smooth feel.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion INM Out the Door is better than both.</li>
            <li> think I should invest in stock for this nail drying product because I love that it works and it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So glad.</li>
            <li> As Wraps, Beauty Secrets top coat and Nutra Nail Mineral Rock Hardener.  </li>
            <li> Nothing holds up better than Out The Door</li>
            <li> When I use this top coat on my mom&#x27;s manicures she can literally grow the polish halfway up her nail before it falls off because she works at a desk.  </li>
            <li> Out The door bottle I use to apply the top coat.  </li>
            <li> My favorite topcoat.</li>
            <li> excellent especially for the price.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> favorite top coat.</li>
            <li> I have tried many, many top coats in my search for the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; one.</li>
            <li> I have never tried a quicker drying top coat as this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s my favorite at the moment.</li>
            <li> I love this topcoat l, I&#x27;ve use so many brands</li>
            <li> shine top coat on over it.</li>
            <li> This topcoat has been my favorite for over 5 years.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how nice it is to have a product that dries the top of the  nails quickly.  </li>
            <li> this is a pretty good product.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s a good deal larger, volume wise, than at the salon.</li>
            <li> Loved it so much I bought this refill.</li>
            <li> It dries super fast, looks great.</li>
            <li> Dries super fast and has a great shine.</li>
            <li> I love this product, best quick dry ever.</li>
            <li> Other than that the product is GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> It is also so great to top coat before your polish is fully dry and be able to use your hands within seconds.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best top cost I have tried especially when it comes to extending the life of a manicure.  </li>
            <li> Love the size of the bottle and the cool shape.</li>
            <li> Excellent quick dry, helps prevent nails from breaking.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best fast drying top coat available.</li>
            <li> Best quick dry I&#x27;ve used yet!</li>
            <li> just wish it was thicker more like sallys instdri clearly quick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as a top coat in general, the best I can say about</li>
            <li> BEST PRODUCT, HANDS DOWN!</li>
            <li> Huge.</li>
            <li> And it tends to diffuse the color you&#x27;ve already painted on; you have to use a LOT of top coat just to protect your fresh polish from the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d heard such good things about this top coat I wanted to try it out.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m good about remembering to reapply this top coat the same day I&#x27;m climbing, it holds up quite well against the rock walls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a good clear coat, so I&#x27;ll use it a bunch.</li>
            <li> It is quick drying, great protection with no noticeable shrinkage and it has a nice, smooth application compared to Seche that always seems to goop up on me half way through the bottle.</li>
            <li> I first started using this product 4 years ago when I had newborn twins!!  </li>
            <li> , the brush picks up a good deal of your polish color as you paint it on, which will eventually taint the bottle with a mix of colors and shimmers, a major irritant of mine.</li>
            <li> Out of the two, OPI chipped first and chipped more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different products over the years, but Out The Door is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> it is &#x27;meh, nothing special.&#x27;</li>
            <li> So, this could easily become my new stand by top coat.</li>
            <li> Great Shine and Does dry quick.</li>
            <li> After reading the rave reviews I was super excited to try this out.</li>
            <li> and it kind of transferred a little onto the top coat, but not a lot to ruin the top coat polish.</li>
            <li> Works great with every brand nail polish and dries in seconds, doesn&#x27;t smear or drag color or polish either.</li>
            <li> I tried this on my own, natural nails.</li>
            <li> This top coat really works.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re usually full.</li>
            <li> I find this a good trade-off for lasting power.  </li>
            <li> Inexpensive fast drying top coat.</li>
            <li> Size of polish was great but did not dry as fast as I hoped.</li>
            <li> It truly is a great hard drying top coat.</li>
            <li> It dries fairly quickly;</li>
            <li> It dries as quickly as the name implies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to doing my nails before bed and even though I wait for what I think is an adequate time, my nails are always ruined in the morning.</li>
            <li> and it also doesn&#x27;t give that super shiny</li>
            <li> but I recommend seche vite quick drying topcoat instead.</li>
            <li> Had definitely become my favorite in top coats.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Super</li>
            <li> I prefer this super size bottle cause</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this top coat if you need something that lasts.  </li>
            <li> Of the three fast-drying top coats I&#x27;ve tried: Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat, Sally Hansen Insta-Dri Anti-Chip Top Coat and INM Out The Door</li>
            <li> It was the least shiny of them all (most polishes had more of a shine on their own than they did with a coat of OtD over them), not to mention that the finish felt almost rubbery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product and  I live by it.</li>
            <li> I think this isa pretty good topcoat especially for the price.i</li>
            <li> The top coat gives it an excellent shine and I can paint my nails and they are drive in less than two minutes - fully dry.</li>
            <li> Two pretty manicured thumbs up!</li>
            <li> My nails always looked freshly done.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a top coat that holds up to a woman with a busy schedule.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I can do my nails right before bedtime.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;ve painted my nails and gone right to bed</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the following is true for acrylic or gel nails, though I&#x27;m sure it is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> keeps mani looking fresh and dries super fast</li>
            <li> I had gone through a couple of the little bottles of this top coat that you can find in the stores, and had established it as my favourite top coat.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s marketed as super fast drying</li>
            <li> This polish while it does what the name suggests it dries super fast</li>
            <li> Dries super fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very fast drying; 2min, and glossy finish.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hard to find this size, and this is a great price for it.</li>
            <li> I usually buy pretty high end nail polish and have tried a lot of nice top coats (opi, sephora, julep) ....</li>
            <li> Have tried many other similar products, but none can compare...  Try it, you will love it too!</li>
            <li> You apply it and in seconds your nails are ready to go out!</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this larger bottle, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s cheaper online with shipping, funny thing...</li>
            <li> &quot; Top Coat, OTD comes in last place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m aware of the dangers of using Seche Vite, which is why I continue to look for alternatives, but it appears that I might have mistaken what Out the Door is supposed to do for your nails, because a replacement for Seche Vite, it is not.</li>
            <li> It absolutely extends the life of your manicure!</li>
            <li> bought my first bottle at CVS just to try it out.</li>
            <li> I was not aware when I ordered but this bottle is HUGE and will last me a good while.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try this top coat just for kicks, especially since it&#x27;s so much cheaper than Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> Finally a walk out the door product that REALLY works,  Love it.  </li>
            <li> This does help your polish dry more quickly, however it still doesn&#x27;t completely protect your fresh nails.  </li>
            <li> The quick dry aspect of the top coat is nice, but it doesn&#x27;t have the mirror shine that I like from other products, and it ships faster than the one I normally use.  </li>
            <li> The top coat itself may dry quickly on already dry nails if you&#x27;re looking to finish or \\&quot;freshen up\\&quot; your already completely dry manicure, but this does NOT dry ALL of the layers of nail polish in a reasonable amount of time the way Seche Vite does FLAWLESSLY and Insta-Dri does VERY well -</li>
            <li> I read the positive reviews and took the plunge in buying this.</li>
            <li> dries my nail polish pretty fast.</li>
            <li> So I have to wait for my layers of nail polish to dry and wear this on top.</li>
            <li> Someone reccommended this to me and I love it - who has the patience to wait until their nails are dry?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, not my fave, and I certainly won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Surprise just how large it is....very shiny just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I bought the large 4oz bottle</li>
            <li> Dries fast, large bottle</li>
            <li> It is a quick dry formula but it will not dry as fast as Seche Vite or have quite the smooth, super glossy finish you get from Seche.  </li>
            <li> holy roller, it is HUGE, it will last me forever.</li>
            <li> It dries very thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You also get so much for what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> Dries so fast.</li>
            <li> It dries really fast.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t tried it.</li>
            <li> I really suggest this.</li>
            <li> and it dries FAST.  </li>
            <li> Which is what I expect a fast drying polish to do.</li>
            <li> Fast Drying\\</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> best results I suggest reapplying every other day or so as well as using with a good base coat.</li>
            <li> When I bought it i thought it was a normal size, like a nail polish size!</li>
            <li> It goes on so well and dries faster than any other top coat I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> smearing is only really sort of useful for blending when doing ombre nail designs, but you&#x27;ll need to do multiple coats to smooth out the roughness sponging the colors on does to the surface of your nails.</li>
            <li> dries fast, super shiny but peels off of my actual nail within 24 hours</li>
            <li> I used to use Seche Vite Fast Drying Top Coat, and although it leaves your nails extra glossy, it doesn&#x27;t dry as fast as this!</li>
            <li> The product is quite an advancement from previous top coats I have used.</li>
            <li> I actually bought it with OPI&#x27;s top coat at the same time.</li>
            <li> This top coat dries pretty fast, but you have to apply a thick coat, otherwise it gets streaks through your colour.</li>
            <li> Like many other people I&#x27;ve tried every quick dry that comes in a bottle or spray can and nothing compares to this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Sinful Colors on the low end and Seche Vite on the high end of top coats in comparison both dry faster and with as much</li>
            <li> One coat and your polish is dry super fast.  </li>
            <li> will give it a few stars as I love the bottle size,</li>
            <li> My nail polish last twice as long without chipping with this top coat on.</li>
            <li> this makes ur nail design , dried and ready to wear very quickly.</li>
            <li> It came quickly, faster than expected and it also dries really fast, in seconds.</li>
            <li> Also doesn&#x27;t seem to thicken up as fast as some other fast dry top coats I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> A new staple on my nail polish obsession.</li>
            <li> Allows my manicure and pedicure to dry quickly without smears.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because a salon recommended it and used it on my mani-pedi to quick dry.  </li>
            <li> but it adds great shine that lasts a long time and probably cuts dry time in half.  </li>
            <li> so i just used it, it really is quick dry, smooth application, not thick or chunky, although i didnt let my color coat dry entirely</li>
            <li> I usually give it about 15 minutes before I do something more involved like wearing gloves or doing the dishes.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Bought it first in a beauty shop and never looked back.</li>
            <li> I can tell that this is going to last me a good long while, but it still has all the quality of the little bottles.</li>
            <li> It dries in about a minute, which i think is pretty fast, especially consider i put 2 coats of my regular nail polish on below it.</li>
            <li> How i use it; base coat, then a top coat, then 2-3 coats of my nail polish and then top coat, it dries in 45 seconds!</li>
            <li> I feel a little cheap</li>
            <li> i would definately recommend this to anyone will soft brittle nails.</li>
            <li> Outs Seche Vite completely in my book.</li>
            <li> Leaves behind a nice gloss that lasts.</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because it did live up to the Fast drying claim, but it wasn&#x27;t long wearing from my experience.</li>
            <li> I have another brand that I like a bit better, but this is a larger size for the same amount as the other brand.  </li>
            <li> All the other products I have used in the past were wore  off in two days, this product has held on for up to four or more days!  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t have a high gloss look.</li>
            <li> the long brush, the price tag, and shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not the worst top coat I&#x27;ve used it only keeps my polish on for two days before it starts chipping, which isn&#x27;t that great if you ask me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will say that it does dry fast, though I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s any faster than SV or Poshé.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some side notes, the brush that is included is very course and because of its length harder to keep under control, I have an old .5 ounce</li>
            <li> I am pretty rough on my nails too!  </li>
            <li> Seems to resist major polish chippage.</li>
            <li> It dries your nails super fast and prevents chipping for at least a solid week.</li>
            <li> My nails last at least 1-2 days longer than my other top coats and it truly dries fast.  </li>
            <li> like OTD because it dries fast, isn&#x27;t thick like seche vite, and my nails don&#x27;t chip as easily as they did with all the other things</li>
            <li> I use OPI polish, put the top coat of Out the Door on, and my nails last at least a week without any chipping or wearing off of the edges, and I only apply one coat!  </li>
            <li> It did dry fast, but my nail polish started to chip the same day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a variety of topcoats &amp; had been going back and forth between Zoya and Seche fast Dry.</li>
            <li> When it got to the point a couple of years ago that it became much more difficult to keep up the &#x27;fill&#x27; every two weeks, I decided to go natural and have the coating taken off.  </li>
            <li> I have gone through two .5 ounce bottles of Out The Door, three .5 once bottles of Seche Vite, and numerous other top coats including Sally Hansen Hard</li>
            <li> Other products that dry fast don&#x27;t protect the polish like this does!</li>
            <li> I found if I put a little bit too much</li>
            <li> I only use this one when I am in a hurry, and then I go back later and put my long lasting mirror</li>
            <li> I then do about 2 thick coats of OTD, I prefer to do it this way with most polishes, it seems to make for a much smoother result and application when working with thin coats as well as extending the life of the manicure by letting it dry between coats.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not as glossy as Seche Vite and doesn&#x27;t last AS long as Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> I used to have an issue when doing my nails before going to bed and then having them be ruined the next morning with sheet lines and smudging, even if i gave them 30 minutes to dry.</li>
            <li> I was a bit annoyed when I removed the packaging, the seller had wrapped the bottle in an adhesive strip of bubble wrap, which I am glad it was protected but when I peeled it off half of the printing on the bottle came off with it, now it already looks old and worn, hope there were no important warning labels I missed too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shiny, dries quick, and isn&#x27;t too thin but doesn&#x27;t get gloopy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I painted my nails on Saturday and didn&#x27;t have a single chip in the polish until the following Wednesday.</li>
            <li> My only disappointment was that the bottle came more than 1/3 empty.</li>
            <li> bring this product to all my the nail salon appointments.&lt;br /&gt;Quick drying and long lasting!!&lt;br /&gt;Recommend</li>
            <li> much larger than I expected and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Is thinner than Seche Vite and doesn&#x27;t dry the layers of polish.</li>
            <li> to get my nail to dry quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dry and Out the Door!  </li>
            <li> You still need to be careful</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve purchased it I&#x27;ve seen other places selling this product for a lot less.</li>
            <li> I waited for the polishes to dry and applied it as a glob then smoothed it down the &amp;#34;nail&amp;#34; instead of applying it like any other polish, and while it didn&#x27;t smear as much, it still was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I accidently bought a huge bottle of this and was afraid I wasted my money, but then I tried it and changed my mind!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have time to paint my nails every other day!</li>
            <li> This leaves your nails shinny and dry in a few minutes!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, a slightly odd note is that it tends to alter lighter colors, so I&#x27;d avoid using it with pastels.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easier to cover with less brushing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was delivered in less than a week.</li>
            <li> I also prefer to thin it down a bit when transferring it to the smaller bottle (3 parts OTD to 1 part Nail Polish Thinner, NOT ACETONE!)</li>
            <li> Dries crazy fast.</li>
            <li> This method is not for the impatient.  </li>
            <li> it dried in less than a minute after application!</li>
            <li> Only down side, I think its too expensive.</li>
            <li> Very little to no shrinkage of the polish beneath.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also seen very little tip wear with some</li>
            <li> if not more shine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The reason i put a lot of nail polish coats is b/c i have fragile nails from wearing acrylic fake nails, if I apply lots of coats then my nail polish will chip not may nails.</li>
            <li> The bottle is hard to hold while painting but</li>
            <li> It provides a shiny hard topcoat that is durable.</li>
            <li> After about a year of growing my nails out and having them strengthened, I wanted to do something other than have natural nails, but I hated the chipped polish.  </li>
            <li> I even tried Essie&#x27;s expensive top coat, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously disappointed with it and thought I&#x27;d warn anyone else into nail stamping--this stuff will smear whatever polish you use to stamp designs onto your nails; I&#x27;ve tried Sally Hansons, Wet and Wild, Sinful Colors, Color Club, China Glaze, etc--Out the Door smears it all like crazy, so</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical</li>
            <li> I use it in concert with the CND Sticky Base Coat and together my manicures last 3 times longer.</li>
            <li> and I hated waiting around for them to dry, with out the door</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> Very weird.</li>
            <li> My nails were weakened from the years of having the acrylic applied, but didn&#x27;t look as bad as I thought they would.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This  stuff is great!  my color stays on for more than a week!</li>
            <li> Note: I tried this on my own, natural nails. I don&#x27;t know if the following is true for acrylic or gel nails, though I&#x27;m sure it is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d heard such good things about this top coat I wanted to try it out. I&#x27;m seriously disappointed with it and thought I&#x27;d warn anyone else into nail stamping--this stuff will smear whatever polish you use to stamp designs onto your nails; I&#x27;ve tried Sally Hansons, Wet and Wild, Sinful Colors, Color Club, China Glaze, etc--Out the Door smears it all like crazy, so it&#x27;s a definite do not use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smearing is only really sort of useful for blending when doing ombre nail designs, but you&#x27;ll need to do multiple coats to smooth out the roughness sponging the colors on does to the surface of your nails. It dries very thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the brush picks up a good deal of your polish color as you paint it on, which will eventually taint the bottle with a mix of colors and shimmers, a major irritant of mine. And it tends to diffuse the color you&#x27;ve already painted on; you have to use a LOT of top coat just to protect your fresh polish from the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as a top coat in general, the best I can say about it is &#x27;meh, nothing special.&#x27; It dries fairly quickly; Sinful Colors on the low end and Seche Vite on the high end of top coats in comparison both dry faster and with as much if not more shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will give it a few stars as I love the bottle size, the long brush, the price tag, and shipping was fast.  But I plan on sticking with Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> After reading the rave reviews I was super excited to try this out. I&#x27;m really disappointed though. While it&#x27;s not the worst top coat I&#x27;ve used it only keeps my polish on for two days before it starts chipping, which isn&#x27;t that great if you ask me. I don&#x27;t have time to paint my nails every other day! I&#x27;ve had better luck with cheaper drug store brands, so I&#x27;d skip this.</li>
            <li> I accidently bought a huge bottle of this and was afraid I wasted my money, but then I tried it and changed my mind! I actually bought it with OPI&#x27;s top coat at the same time. Out of the two, OPI chipped first and chipped more. It dries super fast, looks great.</li>
            <li> I simply love this stuff!  If you have to do your own nails, this is a must.  I bring it to the salon when I get a manicure - there&#x27;s nothing better. :)</li>
            <li> I have been using &amp;#34;out the door&amp;#34; top coat for over 15 years.  It is another one of my favorite nail products. It has superior even coverage with one coat. It dries as quickly as the name implies. Also, a speedy delivery and product properly fits sellers description of it.</li>
            <li> Perfect....fast shipping and packaged excellently! This is the best product EVERRRRRR!! This is a heaven sent product. As most know, creating nail designs can be a multi layer project....which makes the drying time longer....this makes ur nail design , dried and ready to wear very quickly. BEST PRODUCT, HANDS DOWN!</li>
            <li> Honestly the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.  I usually buy pretty high end nail polish and have tried a lot of nice top coats (opi, sephora, julep) ....I was a little skeptical but I was very impressed.  My nails last at least 1-2 days longer than my other top coats and it truly dries fast.  You also get so much for what you pay for.  I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
            <li> Dries so fast. Makes me a happy lady.</li>
            <li> Why do I love this stuff?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It dries really fast. Only minutes are needed for me to use my hands again without worry of smudging. I usually give it about 15 minutes before I do something more involved like wearing gloves or doing the dishes.&lt;br /&gt;2. I can do my nails right before bedtime. I used to have an issue when doing my nails before going to bed and then having them be ruined the next morning with sheet lines and smudging, even if i gave them 30 minutes to dry. This stuff probably only needs about 15 minutes to become rock hard.&lt;br /&gt;3. It holds up to rock climbing. When I&#x27;m good about remembering to reapply this top coat the same day I&#x27;m climbing, it holds up quite well against the rock walls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best results I suggest reapplying every other day or so as well as using with a good base coat. If your nail color can&#x27;t adhere well to the nail, then a good top coat wont do a whole lot of good.</li>
            <li> One of the things that made me hesitate to take off the acrylic coating on my nails (which I had been getting for over 25 years) was the fact that the coating kept my polish intact.  My nails always looked freshly done.  When it got to the point a couple of years ago that it became much more difficult to keep up the &#x27;fill&#x27; every two weeks, I decided to go natural and have the coating taken off.  Soaked my nails myself in acetone until the coating dissolved. My nails were weakened from the years of having the acrylic applied, but didn&#x27;t look as bad as I thought they would.  But polish didn&#x27;t stay on.  After about a year of growing my nails out and having them strengthened, I wanted to do something other than have natural nails, but I hated the chipped polish.  One day one of my younger friends told me about Out the Door.  She raved about it.  So I read the reviews from Amazon (by the way, Amazon is my bible in terms of reviews) and decided to buy.  It is PHENOMENAL!!!!  I use OPI polish, put the top coat of Out the Door on, and my nails last at least a week without any chipping or wearing off of the edges, and I only apply one coat!  I swear by this stuff now and will always use it!!!</li>
            <li> I am impressed with is product.  All the other products I have used in the past were wore  off in two days, this product has held on for up to four or more days!  I am pretty rough on my nails too!  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a top coat that holds up to a woman with a busy schedule.</li>
            <li> This top coat has continued to amaze me! My regular nail polish (not gel) stays on for a week without chipping! And it doesn&#x27;t streak your nail polish when being applied.&lt;br /&gt;I have to mention, i didn&#x27;t realize how big the 2.5oz was going to be... this will last me for years!</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best fast drying top coat available. Hard to find this size, and this is a great price for it.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift because I knew my mother in law will love it! I really haven&#x27;t tried it. When I bought it i thought it was a normal size, like a nail polish size! But when I oppened it it was really big!</li>
            <li> Best quick dry I&#x27;ve used yet!</li>
            <li> This top coat really works. It dries your nails super fast and prevents chipping for at least a solid week.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try this top coat just for kicks, especially since it&#x27;s so much cheaper than Seche Vite. Huge. Mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the name is Out the Door and it&#x27;s marketed as super fast drying, I figured I could whip out a mani and be done with it. Wrong. I applied OtD to a still-damp mani and it left a striped texture on the surface of the polish and smeared outright at the initial spot where it was applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also did a comparison on a swatch wheel between it, Poshé, and Seche Vite. I waited for the polishes to dry and applied it as a glob then smoothed it down the &amp;#34;nail&amp;#34; instead of applying it like any other polish, and while it didn&#x27;t smear as much, it still was a disappointment. It was the least shiny of them all (most polishes had more of a shine on their own than they did with a coat of OtD over them), not to mention that the finish felt almost rubbery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest gripe was that it smears nail art something fierce. This would be great for a sponged gradient, but not for something like a dotticure or stripes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, a slightly odd note is that it tends to alter lighter colors, so I&#x27;d avoid using it with pastels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it does dry fast, though I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s any faster than SV or Poshé.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not my fave, and I certainly won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different products over the years, but Out The Door is by far the best.  Dries within a minute or two and my polish lasts for days chip-free.  Plus has superior shine compared to others I&#x27;ve tried... Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> this top coat is the best!!! I used to use Seche Vite Fast Drying Top Coat, and although it leaves your nails extra glossy, it doesn&#x27;t dry as fast as this! How i use it; base coat, then a top coat, then 2-3 coats of my nail polish and then top coat, it dries in 45 seconds! The reason i put a lot of nail polish coats is b/c i have fragile nails from wearing acrylic fake nails, if I apply lots of coats then my nail polish will chip not may nails. I highly recommend this. The only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t have a high gloss look. I really suggest this.</li>
            <li> I didnt realise how big it was gonna be. I&#x27;ve never seen a nail polish bottle so big. But it&#x27;s a good clear coat, so I&#x27;ll use it a bunch.</li>
            <li> i got the 2.5 oz. holy roller, it is HUGE, it will last me forever. i can attest to how well it works with chips but it really dries well and is a great top coat</li>
            <li> Size of polish was great but did not dry as fast as I hoped.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used. It goes on so well and dries faster than any other top coat I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m used to doing my nails before bed and even though I wait for what I think is an adequate time, my nails are always ruined in the morning. With this one, however, I don&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  It makes my polish stay on and look ultra shiny and it dries FAST.  Within 10 minutes, I feel confident to grab my keys and run out the door.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of others, but I keep going back to this brand.</li>
            <li> Dries super fast and has a great shine. The bottle is a great size for the price. The best fast drying top coat.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  It lives up to it&#x27;s name.  One coat and your polish is dry super fast.  Have tried many other similar products, but none can compare...  Try it, you will love it too!</li>
            <li> just simply loved it. dries my nail polish pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Fantastic. Best clear/top coat I&#x27;ve used yet</li>
            <li> Finally a walk out the door product that REALLY works,  Love it.  I use it in concert with the CND Sticky Base Coat and together my manicures last 3 times longer.</li>
            <li> I first started using this product 4 years ago when I had newborn twins!!  This product works and I still use it today!!  It dries my nails in a hurry and the polish lasts underneath!!  I only paint my nails about every 2 weeks (and I won&#x27;t wear chipped polish!).  I would recommend this to anyone!  I have tried just about everything out there.  Other products that dry fast don&#x27;t protect the polish like this does!</li>
            <li> This does help your polish dry more quickly, however it still doesn&#x27;t completely protect your fresh nails.  You still need to be careful but it adds great shine that lasts a long time and probably cuts dry time in half.  I used to never paint my fingernails because it always got smudged and I hated waiting around for them to dry, with out the door I can paint them an hour before bed and not wake up to smudged nails.</li>
            <li> Good quality and it dries in seconds!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is a MUST for any nail polish lover out there. Bought it first in a beauty shop and never looked back. Happy to have found a great price on the big bottle on Amazon. You apply it and in seconds your nails are ready to go out! A new staple on my nail polish obsession. Two pretty manicured thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Surprise just how large it is....very shiny just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> this is a pretty good product.  It dries my nails very rapidly and does a great top coat.  I have another brand that I like a bit better, but this is a larger size for the same amount as the other brand.  So, this could easily become my new stand by top coat.</li>
            <li> I love this product, best quick dry ever. My only disappointment was that the bottle came more than 1/3 empty. I feel a little cheap I&#x27;ve bought this before and they&#x27;re usually full.</li>
            <li> Recommended by friends, I cannot imagine how I managed without it. Allows my manicure and pedicure to dry quickly without smears. Just a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Best top coat nail polish Ive ever used, lasted 3 weeks with minimum chipping</li>
            <li> Loved this so much!&lt;br /&gt;Have already had two of my gals buy!</li>
            <li> The absolute best TOP Coat ever made!&lt;br /&gt;Simply put a must buy!&lt;br /&gt;I bring this product to all my the nail salon appointments.&lt;br /&gt;Quick drying and long lasting!!&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this product to all my friends!!</li>
            <li> I think this isa pretty good topcoat especially for the price.i just wish it was thicker more like sallys instdri clearly quick. The bottle is hard to hold while painting but nothing I can&#x27;t handle</li>
            <li> It does what it says... Dry and Out the Door!  I would recommend this for do it yourself nail gals like myself!</li>
            <li> This top coat didn&#x27;t blow me away at all. It did dry fast, but my nail polish started to chip the same day. I picked this up because I don&#x27;t like the ingredients in seche vite and wanted something safer with similar performance. I read good reviews about this top coat, so I decided to give it a try. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll re purchase because it just didn&#x27;t perform the way I wanted it to. I gave it 3 stars because it did live up to the Fast drying claim, but it wasn&#x27;t long wearing from my experience.</li>
            <li> This polish while it does what the name suggests it dries super fast I found if I put a little bit too much it peels off and it also doesn&#x27;t give that super shiny just got out of the salon shellac look that I love. It does the trick but I recommend seche vite quick drying topcoat instead.</li>
            <li> I had gone through a couple of the little bottles of this top coat that you can find in the stores, and had established it as my favourite top coat. It&#x27;s shiny, dries quick, and isn&#x27;t too thin but doesn&#x27;t get gloopy.&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to purchase this larger bottle, and I&#x27;m glad I did. I can tell that this is going to last me a good long while, but it still has all the quality of the little bottles. More bang for your buck, and a great top coat to boot. :)</li>
            <li> Is thinner than Seche Vite and doesn&#x27;t dry the layers of polish. Which is what I expect a fast drying polish to do. So I have to wait for my layers of nail polish to dry and wear this on top. Which takes a lot of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not as glossy as Seche Vite and doesn&#x27;t last AS long as Seche Vite. However, I find it works better on some polishes and doesn&#x27;t make them chip. I switch between this and Seche Vite because SV doesn&#x27;t work on all my polishes. But I definitely prefer SV.</li>
            <li> my fav nail polish. keeps mani looking fresh and dries super fast</li>
            <li> It truly is a great hard drying top coat. I was able to put a coat on and literally walk out the door. Finishes with a nice shine and a smooth feel. The bottle is actually a very nice size. I love this!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  They use it at the nail salon and I was so happy to see that I can purchase it on Amazon.  Plus, it&#x27;s a good deal larger, volume wise, than at the salon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a variety of topcoats &amp; had been going back and forth between Zoya and Seche fast Dry. In my opinion INM Out the Door is better than both. It is quick drying, great protection with no noticeable shrinkage and it has a nice, smooth application compared to Seche that always seems to goop up on me half way through the bottle. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> My favorite too coat, and I&#x27;ve tried Many! I even tried Essie&#x27;s expensive top coat, very disappointed. This one dries quickly and is nice and shiny! Will never try another!</li>
            <li> Excellent quick dry, helps prevent nails from breaking. i would definately recommend this to anyone will soft brittle nails. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This leaves your nails shinny and dry in a few minutes! Love it!!! It can be used in between manicures to give your nails that fresh&lt;br /&gt;shinny look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used OPI drying drops, Sally Hansen Insta-Dri, seche vite, ice, fans, etc. to get my nail to dry quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best item I had in my arsenal was OPI RapiDry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then came along out the door (OTD)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like OTD because it dries fast, isn&#x27;t thick like seche vite, and my nails don&#x27;t chip as easily as they did with all the other things I tried.&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine at CVS but it&#x27;s cheaper online with shipping, funny thing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I should invest in stock for this nail drying product because I love that it works and it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Had definitely become my favorite in top coats. Outs Seche Vite completely in my book. Keeps polish on longer and find that chipping in polish is to a minimum (and I tend to OVER layer polish LOL). Bottle is definitely holding out. So glad.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this product and  I live by it. Best top coat ever. It dries fast and has awesome shine. Only down side, I think its too expensive. Since I&#x27;ve purchased it I&#x27;ve seen other places selling this product for a lot less.</li>
            <li> Of the three fast-drying top coats I&#x27;ve tried: Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat, Sally Hansen Insta-Dri Anti-Chip Top Coat and INM Out The Door \\&quot;Super Fast Drying\\&quot; Top Coat, OTD comes in last place. I&#x27;m aware of the dangers of using Seche Vite, which is why I continue to look for alternatives, but it appears that I might have mistaken what Out the Door is supposed to do for your nails, because a replacement for Seche Vite, it is not. The top coat itself may dry quickly on already dry nails if you&#x27;re looking to finish or \\&quot;freshen up\\&quot; your already completely dry manicure, but this does NOT dry ALL of the layers of nail polish in a reasonable amount of time the way Seche Vite does FLAWLESSLY and Insta-Dri does VERY well - and this is a MUST for someone like me who likes to change up polish once or twice a week, but doesn&#x27;t have the time, or desire to spend hours to do it. I guess I will have to keep alternating my Seche Vite and Insta-Dri when I actually do my nails and use OTD to freshen up my mani every once in a while. Bummer.</li>
            <li> Dries fast, large bottle</li>
            <li> MY Daughter told ..me about this product so I said why not well it is the BEST EVER!!!! You wont be dissapointed. I bought the large 4oz bottle but I didn&#x27;t know that size bottle was a refill size and doesnt come with a brush!  I think that something we need to know. Other than that the product is GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> Great Shine and Does dry quick.</li>
            <li> Someone reccommended this to me and I love it - who has the patience to wait until their nails are dry? Not me! The top coat gives it an excellent shine and I can paint my nails and they are drive in less than two minutes - fully dry. Now, I&#x27;ve painted my nails and gone right to bed and they are perfect. I do add a topcoat every 2-3 days and that keeps them from chipping. It absolutely extends the life of your manicure!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best top cost I have tried especially when it comes to extending the life of a manicure.  I have gone through two .5 ounce bottles of Out The Door, three .5 once bottles of Seche Vite, and numerous other top coats including Sally Hansen Hard As Wraps, Beauty Secrets top coat and Nutra Nail Mineral Rock Hardener.  Nothing holds up better than Out The Door and I bake for a living (meaning I scrub a lot of pans every day.) It is a quick dry formula but it will not dry as fast as Seche Vite or have quite the smooth, super glossy finish you get from Seche.  I find this a good trade-off for lasting power.  I do my nails probably twice a week but it could last longer especially if you don&#x27;t do a lot of nail damaging activities.  When I use this top coat on my mom&#x27;s manicures she can literally grow the polish halfway up her nail before it falls off because she works at a desk.  I highly recommend this top coat if you need something that lasts.  Some side notes, the brush that is included is very course and because of its length harder to keep under control, I have an old .5 ounce Out The door bottle I use to apply the top coat.  I also prefer to thin it down a bit when transferring it to the smaller bottle (3 parts OTD to 1 part Nail Polish Thinner, NOT ACETONE!) I then do about 2 thick coats of OTD, I prefer to do it this way with most polishes, it seems to make for a much smoother result and application when working with thin coats as well as extending the life of the manicure by letting it dry between coats.  This method is not for the impatient.  I was a bit annoyed when I removed the packaging, the seller had wrapped the bottle in an adhesive strip of bubble wrap, which I am glad it was protected but when I peeled it off half of the printing on the bottle came off with it, now it already looks old and worn, hope there were no important warning labels I missed too.</li>
            <li> so i just used it, it really is quick dry, smooth application, not thick or chunky, although i didnt let my color coat dry entirely and it kind of transferred a little onto the top coat, but not a lot to ruin the top coat polish. it dried in less than a minute after application!</li>
            <li> My favorite topcoat. Helps keep nails shiny and from chipping. Best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> This top coat dries pretty fast, but you have to apply a thick coat, otherwise it gets streaks through your colour. Also, depending on the nail polish underneath, the colour actually gets foggy/milky. Very weird.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how nice it is to have a product that dries the top of the  nails quickly.  The product is quite an advancement from previous top coats I have used.</li>
            <li> much larger than I expected and works like a charm. excellent especially for the price.</li>
            <li> dries fast, super shiny but peels off of my actual nail within 24 hours</li>
            <li> Excellent for a quick way to brighten your nails and go, makes them look freshly done</li>
            <li> LOVE this product. Like many other people I&#x27;ve tried every quick dry that comes in a bottle or spray can and nothing compares to this. Works great with every brand nail polish and dries in seconds, doesn&#x27;t smear or drag color or polish either. Would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I prefer this super size bottle cause it&#x27;s easier to cover with less brushing.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very fast drying; 2min, and glossy finish.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite top coat.</li>
            <li> Love it! Would recommend to anyone!!</li>
            <li> I have tried many, many top coats in my search for the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; one. Different formulas work different on every person. Luckily this one works perfectly for me. I have never tried a quicker drying top coat as this one. I was not aware when I ordered but this bottle is HUGE and will last me a good while. Definitely a good buy for me. I will never have to go hunting again.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive fast drying top coat. Leaves behind a nice gloss that lasts. Very little to no shrinkage of the polish beneath. Dries crazy fast. Seems to resist major polish chippage. I&#x27;ve also seen very little tip wear with some polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my first bottle at CVS just to try it out. Loved it so much I bought this refill. Great price. I&#x27;ve read the ingredients and it does not appear to have any of  the big 3 in it. Also doesn&#x27;t seem to thicken up as fast as some other fast dry top coats I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my favorite at the moment.</li>
            <li> Wahoo! Nice work. Loved the product. Dries super fast. Love the size of the bottle and the cool shape. Win.</li>
            <li> It came quickly, faster than expected and it also dries really fast, in seconds. I love this topcoat l, I&#x27;ve use so many brands and i think this one is the best.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat!! My nail polish last twice as long without chipping with this top coat on. It is also so great to top coat before your polish is fully dry and be able to use your hands within seconds. So worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> I read the positive reviews and took the plunge in buying this. So glad that i did! This top coat works great! It dries in about a minute, which i think is pretty fast, especially consider i put 2 coats of my regular nail polish on below it. I painted my nails on Saturday and didn&#x27;t have a single chip in the polish until the following Wednesday. The price is great! It was delivered in less than a week.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because a salon recommended it and used it on my mani-pedi to quick dry.  The quick dry aspect of the top coat is nice, but it doesn&#x27;t have the mirror shine that I like from other products, and it ships faster than the one I normally use.  I only use this one when I am in a hurry, and then I go back later and put my long lasting mirror shine top coat on over it.</li>
            <li> This topcoat has been my favorite for over 5 years. It provides a shiny hard topcoat that is durable. Love this.</li>
