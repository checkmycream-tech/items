            <li>It is great; absorbs fast.  </li>
            <li>My face is nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>The vanicream lite was recommended to me by a family member when my favorite face lotion was discontinued.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to love it, but there is nothing Lite about it, nor has it done anything for my skin.</li>
            <li>Our son has never had any more skin problems after he used this product.</li>
            <li>So many moisturizers irritate my eyes, and this one doesn&#x27;t do that at all.  </li>
            <li>So that means, i need more water than oil in my skin.</li>
            <li>so i put that on top.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant when I ordered Vanicream Lite, I&#x27;ve tried so many face creams and felt I was wasting my money.  </li>
            <li>And glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>so doesn&#x27;t give my skin that sticky feeling like so many lotions do.</li>
            <li>It was good to see how reviews on most sites seem to be overwhelmingly positive.</li>
            <li>For those who are sensitive to dyes and scents this lotion is great.</li>
            <li>This lotion is great for anyone with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Texture : lightweight, light cream, not too watery, more gel like, absorbs fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is great for my hands and feet but feels a tad greasy on my face until it absorbs completely.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s the most important thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best moisturizer to wear for someone with skin problems due to allergens.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly and has no scent at all</li>
            <li>This lotion absorbs in quickly and very smoothly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fragrance free, dye free, paraben free, and causes no irritation.  </li>
            <li>It is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Fantastic item.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and disappears.  </li>
            <li>it makes my skin smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is truly a light unscented lotion.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is too light for his condition.</li>
            <li>La mer gel cream is too light for winter.</li>
            <li>Not oily at all-very light and smooth.</li>
            <li>My husband actually told me my face was looking great</li>
            <li>This is a great smaller size of the lite lotion.  </li>
            <li>make your skin smooth, no oily feeling after appling</li>
            <li>Nice gentle product.  </li>
            <li>I think it was good for my friend who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Vanicream is a great brand, especially for mildly cleansing soap.</li>
            <li>and I could use Prime and Smile!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth buying; you won&#x27;t regret this purchase!</li>
            <li>No scent, just a clean lotion.  </li>
            <li>On top of that, it&#x27;s price is so reasonable</li>
            <li>I like it better than Cetaphil, which leaves my face very greasy.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is perfect for my complex skin.</li>
            <li>at first, it kind of &#x27;sits&#x27; on your skin, but it quickly soaks in, leaves your skin feeling soft and fresh ------ and Healthy</li>
            <li>Works great on new and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Vanicream Lite is the mildest of the mild.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this a try and it absorbs quickly and lasts for the day, which is what we needed.</li>
            <li>product arrived quickly and was as described</li>
            <li>My face doesn&#x27;t have any dry spots, and feels good to touch</li>
            <li>This stuff soaks in rearly quick and feels nice on my entire face.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight and smooth, it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>I have used many other department store cosmetic brand moisturizers that cost 3-4 times as much as Vanicream, but none of them work better than Vanicream does!</li>
            <li>The dermatologist sells it, and naturally wanted much more than I get it on Amazon</li>
            <li>- what more could a mature woman ask for.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to love it because it really smooth your skin but not moistursizing enough</li>
            <li>This light version is much thinner than their thicker moisturizing cream, so it goes on smoothly, dries quickly, is very moisturizing, and not greasy.</li>
            <li>At first it was not bad, after using it for awhile it started drying up my skin and leaving it with flakes...</li>
            <li>I guessed right.</li>
            <li>It makes the winter months much more enjoyable for my little girl.  </li>
            <li>This formulation is new and is milder than than the original.     </li>
            <li>In fact, it is much better than even the regular Vanicream lotion.</li>
            <li>It is better than Lubriderm, cottonseed oil, vaseline, not to mention all the types of lotion with added perfumes and such.    </li>
            <li>I noticed improvement after the first week.  </li>
            <li>If you have allergic skin reactions, you may want to give this lotion a try, my wife switched over to Vanicream soap, lotion along with Free and Clear shampoo and conditioner, and now the majority of her skin irritations have gone away.</li>
            <li>I first tried Vanicream when I suffered from wind burn on my face.</li>
            <li>and this really works!</li>
            <li>I tried the lite cream first to see how he would react and his skin didn&#x27;t get irritated at all.  </li>
            <li>(they also make a regular that I haven&#x27;t tried yet) but love it for the warmer months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty picky about stuff I put on my body</li>
            <li>I put essential oils in it and have been pleased.  </li>
            <li>would recommend this to anyone because its a great product and does last a very long time.</li>
            <li>I know that the original Vanicream was developed by two pharmacists at Mayo Clinic years ago.</li>
            <li>It seems just as effective as other lotions I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Few ingredients, no parabens, no fragrance, and no shea butter makes it great for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have dealt with allergies to various products on my skin and hair for years and this product works better then lotions that I have paid twice as much for.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough on my face and love that the lotion does not contain some of the &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; ingredients.</li>
            <li>Lite, clean,  odor free, really hydrates dry skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and does a good job keeping my skin from getting dry -- and I live in dry Colorado.</li>
            <li>My face is extremely dry and breaks out with most lotions.</li>
            <li>This product is mild for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This lotion works to remove the dry patches, conditioned my skin, not triggering any more redness.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to perfumes so it took me a while to find the right moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Great alternative to the heavy cream from this same company.</li>
            <li>After patch testing confirmed allergies to a number of common skin care product ingredients I wondered what I would be able to use.</li>
            <li>This is still very creamy even though the description states it&#x27;s lite and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>you really should give it a try.</li>
            <li>Our doctor recommended it to us and we are very thankful</li>
            <li>Light enough for my face without breaking me out.</li>
            <li>really really like this cream.....</li>
            <li>I tried many other lotions and everything irritated my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rate it 5 stars, but &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34; seems a bit extreme for hand lotion.</li>
            <li>Too light for dry body skin.</li>
            <li>The three lotions recommended to me by my dermatologist were Lubriderm, Free and Clear, and Vanicream (regular).</li>
            <li>I have recently developed a sensitivity to a whole range of beauty and cleaning products, and this product really helped me with this allergy.</li>
            <li>This product, along with the Free &amp; Clear cleanser are the only changes I&#x27;ve made.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The reason i try this product is because i want to add a little more hydration to my skin.</li>
            <li>Some things would keep it at bay bUT nothing really would clear it up.  </li>
            <li>However, my sensitive skin and dryness loves it so much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always trying to find products that are free of paraben, phthalates, and synthetic fragrance, which makes it harder to find something that suits my skin.  </li>
            <li>This lotion worked wonders for my eczema breakouts and is pretty much the only moisturizer I can trust.</li>
            <li>Worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>Her doctor recommended it when she was a new born.  </li>
            <li>Product is new and package is completed.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>It is light and not at all sticky and has no annoying and irritating scent.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It was recommended to me by my doctor for my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>A must-have for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>It is not heavy, does not cause any break outs and feels very natural.</li>
            <li>I have patches of dry skin thanks to the winter chill, but I&#x27;m still VERY acne prone.</li>
            <li>I tried countless natural remedies and nothing really worked.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 3 weeks in and my face is 90% clear.  </li>
            <li>In fact, it helped clear up the eczema.</li>
            <li>While I believe the only thing that is really clearing up the dermatitis is the antibiotics I do feel</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>Works well for our daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use this brand, as it has nearly cured my chronic urticaria.</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I have scaly croco skin after i take a long hot shower.</li>
            <li>I have battled with atopic dermatitis and eczema since I was a young child and this lotion has been the gentlest I can remember.  </li>
            <li>it is the only thing that is very compatiable with server allergy.</li>
            <li>It does seem to meet my sensitive skin needs.  </li>
            <li>I tried a few products that would seem to make the area more red immediately after,  etc.</li>
            <li>The 8 ounce bottle lasts a very long time and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>The lotion is light, free from all the nasty stuff that&#x27;s put in other lotion, and fairly inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>So hard to find a good lotion without heavy shea butter in the stores.  </li>
            <li>Not so much for dry skin on the the rest of the body.</li>
            <li>my skin : i have a yellow based, asian skin that tends to be oily / very oily.</li>
            <li>After having clear skin my entire life at 27 I developed perioral dermatitis shortly after weaning my daughter from nursing.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and am prone to developing occasional but stubborn rashes.</li>
            <li>So many lotions that are &#x27;unscented&#x27; (meaning they&#x27;re not scented with a perfume) still have an odor that can be unappealing.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant as I was certain that the more expensive face and eye lotions would be better, but I was wrong -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good lotion, though a little thin for my skin.</li>
            <li>The cream is very light, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, and I have to use very little.  </li>
            <li>I have dry mature skin</li>
            <li>It works very well on my dry sensitive skin without being too heavy.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Really good for my son&#x27;s mild eczema.</li>
            <li> Am certain its great for all age groups.  </li>
            <li> Glad I found this here, and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li> It is great; absorbs fast.  </li>
            <li> My face is nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> The vanicream lite was recommended to me by a family member when my favorite face lotion was discontinued.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to love it, but there is nothing Lite about it, nor has it done anything for my skin.</li>
            <li> Our son has never had any more skin problems after he used this product.</li>
            <li> So many moisturizers irritate my eyes, and this one doesn&#x27;t do that at all.  </li>
            <li> So that means, i need more water than oil in my skin.</li>
            <li> so i put that on top.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant when I ordered Vanicream Lite, I&#x27;ve tried so many face creams and felt I was wasting my money.  </li>
            <li> And glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I really love it.</li>
            <li> so doesn&#x27;t give my skin that sticky feeling like so many lotions do.</li>
            <li> It was good to see how reviews on most sites seem to be overwhelmingly positive.</li>
            <li> For those who are sensitive to dyes and scents this lotion is great.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great for anyone with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Texture : lightweight, light cream, not too watery, more gel like, absorbs fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is great for my hands and feet but feels a tad greasy on my face until it absorbs completely.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s the most important thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer to wear for someone with skin problems due to allergens.</li>
            <li> It absorbs into the skin very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film.</li>
            <li> It absorbs very quickly and has no scent at all</li>
            <li> This lotion absorbs in quickly and very smoothly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fragrance free, dye free, paraben free, and causes no irritation.  </li>
            <li> It is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Fantastic item.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and disappears.  </li>
            <li> it makes my skin smooth.  </li>
            <li> This is truly a light unscented lotion.  </li>
            <li> The lotion is too light for his condition.</li>
            <li> La mer gel cream is too light for winter.</li>
            <li> Not oily at all-very light and smooth.</li>
            <li> My husband actually told me my face was looking great</li>
            <li> This is a great smaller size of the lite lotion.  </li>
            <li> make your skin smooth, no oily feeling after appling</li>
            <li> Nice gentle product.  </li>
            <li> I think it was good for my friend who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Vanicream is a great brand, especially for mildly cleansing soap.</li>
            <li> and I could use Prime and Smile!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth buying; you won&#x27;t regret this purchase!</li>
            <li> No scent, just a clean lotion.  </li>
            <li> On top of that, it&#x27;s price is so reasonable</li>
            <li> I like it better than Cetaphil, which leaves my face very greasy.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is perfect for my complex skin.</li>
            <li> at first, it kind of &#x27;sits&#x27; on your skin, but it quickly soaks in, leaves your skin feeling soft and fresh ------ and Healthy</li>
            <li> Works great on new and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Vanicream Lite is the mildest of the mild.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try and it absorbs quickly and lasts for the day, which is what we needed.</li>
            <li> product arrived quickly and was as described</li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t have any dry spots, and feels good to touch</li>
            <li> This stuff soaks in rearly quick and feels nice on my entire face.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight and smooth, it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> I have used many other department store cosmetic brand moisturizers that cost 3-4 times as much as Vanicream, but none of them work better than Vanicream does!</li>
            <li> The dermatologist sells it, and naturally wanted much more than I get it on Amazon</li>
            <li> - what more could a mature woman ask for.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to love it because it really smooth your skin but not moistursizing enough</li>
            <li> This light version is much thinner than their thicker moisturizing cream, so it goes on smoothly, dries quickly, is very moisturizing, and not greasy.</li>
            <li> At first it was not bad, after using it for awhile it started drying up my skin and leaving it with flakes...</li>
            <li> I guessed right.</li>
            <li> It makes the winter months much more enjoyable for my little girl.  </li>
            <li> This formulation is new and is milder than than the original.     </li>
            <li> In fact, it is much better than even the regular Vanicream lotion.</li>
            <li> It is better than Lubriderm, cottonseed oil, vaseline, not to mention all the types of lotion with added perfumes and such.    </li>
            <li> I noticed improvement after the first week.  </li>
            <li> If you have allergic skin reactions, you may want to give this lotion a try, my wife switched over to Vanicream soap, lotion along with Free and Clear shampoo and conditioner, and now the majority of her skin irritations have gone away.</li>
            <li> I first tried Vanicream when I suffered from wind burn on my face.</li>
            <li> and this really works!</li>
            <li> I tried the lite cream first to see how he would react and his skin didn&#x27;t get irritated at all.  </li>
            <li> (they also make a regular that I haven&#x27;t tried yet) but love it for the warmer months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky about stuff I put on my body</li>
            <li> I put essential oils in it and have been pleased.  </li>
            <li> would recommend this to anyone because its a great product and does last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I know that the original Vanicream was developed by two pharmacists at Mayo Clinic years ago.</li>
            <li> It seems just as effective as other lotions I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Few ingredients, no parabens, no fragrance, and no shea butter makes it great for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have dealt with allergies to various products on my skin and hair for years and this product works better then lotions that I have paid twice as much for.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough on my face and love that the lotion does not contain some of the &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; ingredients.</li>
            <li> Lite, clean,  odor free, really hydrates dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and does a good job keeping my skin from getting dry -- and I live in dry Colorado.</li>
            <li> My face is extremely dry and breaks out with most lotions.</li>
            <li> This product is mild for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion works to remove the dry patches, conditioned my skin, not triggering any more redness.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to perfumes so it took me a while to find the right moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Great alternative to the heavy cream from this same company.</li>
            <li> After patch testing confirmed allergies to a number of common skin care product ingredients I wondered what I would be able to use.</li>
            <li> This is still very creamy even though the description states it&#x27;s lite and non-greasy.</li>
            <li> you really should give it a try.</li>
            <li> Our doctor recommended it to us and we are very thankful</li>
            <li> Light enough for my face without breaking me out.</li>
            <li> really really like this cream.....</li>
            <li> I tried many other lotions and everything irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rate it 5 stars, but &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34; seems a bit extreme for hand lotion.</li>
            <li> Too light for dry body skin.</li>
            <li> The three lotions recommended to me by my dermatologist were Lubriderm, Free and Clear, and Vanicream (regular).</li>
            <li> I have recently developed a sensitivity to a whole range of beauty and cleaning products, and this product really helped me with this allergy.</li>
            <li> This product, along with the Free &amp; Clear cleanser are the only changes I&#x27;ve made.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The reason i try this product is because i want to add a little more hydration to my skin.</li>
            <li> Some things would keep it at bay bUT nothing really would clear it up.  </li>
            <li> However, my sensitive skin and dryness loves it so much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always trying to find products that are free of paraben, phthalates, and synthetic fragrance, which makes it harder to find something that suits my skin.  </li>
            <li> This lotion worked wonders for my eczema breakouts and is pretty much the only moisturizer I can trust.</li>
            <li> Worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> Her doctor recommended it when she was a new born.  </li>
            <li> Product is new and package is completed.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> It is light and not at all sticky and has no annoying and irritating scent.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me by my doctor for my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> A must-have for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> It is not heavy, does not cause any break outs and feels very natural.</li>
            <li> I have patches of dry skin thanks to the winter chill, but I&#x27;m still VERY acne prone.</li>
            <li> I tried countless natural remedies and nothing really worked.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 3 weeks in and my face is 90% clear.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it helped clear up the eczema.</li>
            <li> While I believe the only thing that is really clearing up the dermatitis is the antibiotics I do feel</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> Works well for our daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this brand, as it has nearly cured my chronic urticaria.</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I have scaly croco skin after i take a long hot shower.</li>
            <li> I have battled with atopic dermatitis and eczema since I was a young child and this lotion has been the gentlest I can remember.  </li>
            <li> it is the only thing that is very compatiable with server allergy.</li>
            <li> It does seem to meet my sensitive skin needs.  </li>
            <li> I tried a few products that would seem to make the area more red immediately after,  etc.</li>
            <li> The 8 ounce bottle lasts a very long time and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> The lotion is light, free from all the nasty stuff that&#x27;s put in other lotion, and fairly inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> So hard to find a good lotion without heavy shea butter in the stores.  </li>
            <li> Not so much for dry skin on the the rest of the body.</li>
            <li> my skin : i have a yellow based, asian skin that tends to be oily / very oily.</li>
            <li> After having clear skin my entire life at 27 I developed perioral dermatitis shortly after weaning my daughter from nursing.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and am prone to developing occasional but stubborn rashes.</li>
            <li> So many lotions that are &#x27;unscented&#x27; (meaning they&#x27;re not scented with a perfume) still have an odor that can be unappealing.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant as I was certain that the more expensive face and eye lotions would be better, but I was wrong -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good lotion, though a little thin for my skin.</li>
            <li> The cream is very light, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, and I have to use very little.  </li>
            <li> I have dry mature skin</li>
            <li> It works very well on my dry sensitive skin without being too heavy.  </li>
            <li> online compared to other natural products I&#x27;ve tried which are often pricey.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;I will definitely purchase again, and only wish I had all the money back that I spent on the more expensive creams.</li>
            <li> My skin is back to normal now, but I continue to use Vanicream as an everyday moisturizer.</li>
            <li> For really dry environments, like the winters here in Ohio, then I mix this one with the cream for that extra protection needed.</li>
            <li> Not hydrating enough for dry feet either.</li>
            <li> I use it every morning, light, no perfumes or strange ingredients, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and in expensive.  </li>
            <li> I just started using it, and I especially like that it&#x27;s minimally greasy.</li>
            <li> but strangely i have dry patches.</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;ve used it as night cream that kept me from having a dry flaky face in the morning.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my sister, as I have really dry skin.  </li>
            <li> For extremely dry areas, like my heels, I also use the Vanicream Cream.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone, but especially if you have delicate and/or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy and works wonders on my hands which get very dry and cracked in the winter months.</li>
            <li> I have a few dry patches especially in the winter and with the use of this lotion</li>
            <li> It only tingles a little.</li>
            <li> I have allergies really bad and most lotions make my eyes swell up.  </li>
            <li> I use Vanicream Lite Lotion for my delicate and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If i buy the regular cream, it is too heavy</li>
            <li> After it absorbs it makes a nice base for my mineral makeup.</li>
            <li> I also use it as a mixing base when I create my own creams.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that it doesn&#x27;t include a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Sure is a lot less expensive than buying the expensive face and eye lotions I was purchasing.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients : way less chemicals, way</li>
            <li> Has fewer chemicals in it- way less.</li>
            <li> This stuff is some of the lightest lotion out there and absorbs well, so you don&#x27;t feel like a slimy mess after applying.</li>
            <li> I made a little basket of products that she could use.</li>
            <li> I can feel and see results after just a few days.</li>
            <li> and this is one of the few things I can use that doesn&#x27;t break out my skin.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy lotion with water base like vanicream light.</li>
            <li> The creams would either be:  too heavy ---</li>
            <li> It has no or very little glycerine</li>
            <li> My son has really bad eczema and this lotion really helped.  </li>
            <li> I brought this for my gf who has eczema kinda bad , and she said it made her feel very soft .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and creamy.  </li>
            <li> It is quite thick.</li>
            <li> I was recently hospitalized for a severe skin eczema that led to a staph infection and burn-like, painful blistering on my face, hands and arms.</li>
            <li> My daughter had such severe and painful looking excema, people (even strangers) started coming up and offering unsolicited suggestions about remedies.  </li>
            <li> For somone with chronic oily skin; its tough to find something with balance that won&#x27;t make your skin break out.  </li>
            <li> After having it 3 months it spread and got worse</li>
            <li> I was confused.</li>
            <li> less bad guys like : fragrance, parabens, formadehyde, etc.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by one of my in-laws who lives in Wisconsin, so he knows how cold weather can do a number on your hands.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this lotion did just that!</li>
            <li> And this includes some Very Expensive creams recommended by skin</li>
            <li> Even the hospital&#x27;s formulation was painful to apply.    </li>
            <li> All of these were painful to apply.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My Dermatologist recommended</li>
            <li> Great price! Great Quality!</li>
            <li> I was recently hospitalized for a severe skin eczema that led to a staph infection and burn-like, painful blistering on my face, hands and arms. Even the hospital&#x27;s formulation was painful to apply.    After I got home, I had my husband get several different kinds of lotion. This is the only one that was not excruciating to apply. In fact, it is much better than even the regular Vanicream lotion. It is better than Lubriderm, cottonseed oil, vaseline, not to mention all the types of lotion with added perfumes and such.    I know that the original Vanicream was developed by two pharmacists at Mayo Clinic years ago. This formulation is new and is milder than than the original.     The three lotions recommended to me by my dermatologist were Lubriderm, Free and Clear, and Vanicream (regular). All of these were painful to apply. Vanicream Lite is the mildest of the mild. I highly recommend it. It only tingles a little. I don&#x27;t know what I would have done if I had not finally found this stuff. It is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer to wear for someone with skin problems due to allergens. Fantastic item. My allergist recommended and I started seeing results within a week.</li>
            <li> After having clear skin my entire life at 27 I developed perioral dermatitis shortly after weaning my daughter from nursing.  I tried countless natural remedies and nothing really worked.  Some things would keep it at bay bUT nothing really would clear it up.  After having it 3 months it spread and got worse so I gave in and took the oral antibiotics.  I&#x27;m 3 weeks in and my face is 90% clear.  I noticed improvement after the first week.  Anyway,  the dermatologist also suggested using this lite lotion. I actually started using this prior to taking the antibiotics so I&#x27;ve been using it well over a month now.  While I believe the only thing that is really clearing up the dermatitis is the antibiotics I do feel this lotion is one thing that works well and doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate the dermatitis.  I tried a few products that would seem to make the area more red immediately after,  etc. This stuff soaks in rearly quick and feels nice on my entire face. And like I said it definitely doesn&#x27;t irritate the dermatitis.  I started with samples from the dermatologist but went ahead and ordered this bottle because it seems to keeping the problem under control.  I&#x27;m currently using burt bees soap bark face wash and then witch hazel with aloe as a toner.  As I said before after having it 3 months,  thone products along with the antibiotics seem to be kicking it.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best lotion I have ever used. I have sensitive skin and am prone to developing occasional but stubborn rashes. I have tried everything over the counter and have used prescription products as well. This lotion came to my rescue. It serves as an excellent \\&quot;shield\\&quot; for areas in the folds of the skin that might be prone to developing a rash. It is light and not at all sticky and has no annoying and irritating scent. I am switching to Vanicream products exclusively.</li>
            <li> My daughter had such severe and painful looking excema, people (even strangers) started coming up and offering unsolicited suggestions about remedies.  Not wanting to resort to using steroid creams, I took a suggestion we&#x27;d heard from a couple sources and tried Vanicream.  I LOVE this lotion!  It makes the winter months much more enjoyable for my little girl.  The lotion is light, free from all the nasty stuff that&#x27;s put in other lotion, and fairly inexpensive.  Note: I&#x27;ve been using this for my daughter for 4 years now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of creamy lotion. This is still very creamy even though the description states it&#x27;s lite and non-greasy. However, my sensitive skin and dryness loves it so much. I will definitely buy this again but I will only use it on my face. It&#x27;s the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve used before putting on make up. Also I&#x27;ve used it as night cream that kept me from having a dry flaky face in the morning.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my sister, as I have really dry skin.  The thing I like best is it doesn&#x27;t leave greasy residue to get on my clothes.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this last year and I have been using it ever since.  It works very well on my dry sensitive skin without being too heavy.  For extremely dry areas, like my heels, I also use the Vanicream Cream.  I recommend both products.</li>
            <li> If you have allergic skin reactions, you may want to give this lotion a try, my wife switched over to Vanicream soap, lotion along with Free and Clear shampoo and conditioner, and now the majority of her skin irritations have gone away.</li>
            <li> Really loved this lotion !!!  Few ingredients, no parabens, no fragrance, and no shea butter makes it great for sensitive skin.  Soaks in quickly, not heavy, but hydrates wonderfully.  So hard to find a good lotion without heavy shea butter in the stores.  Glad I found this here, and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I first tried Vanicream when I suffered from wind burn on my face. I tried many other lotions and everything irritated my skin. Then, my mother, a nurse, recommended Vanicream and it healed the wind burn and gave instant relief to the irritation. My skin is back to normal now, but I continue to use Vanicream as an everyday moisturizer. I recommend it to anybody who will listen. I have used many other department store cosmetic brand moisturizers that cost 3-4 times as much as Vanicream, but none of them work better than Vanicream does!</li>
            <li> My skin is combination type and breaks out very easily. This cream provides sufficient amount of moisture for my skin and doesn&#x27;t cause any break out. I can feel and see results after just a few days. I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended it.  I&#x27;ve been buying it from him, and it just occurred to me to look up on line.  Turns out I can get it online for a third of the price he sells it for!    My face is extremely dry and breaks out with most lotions. I&#x27;m always trying to find products that are free of paraben, phthalates, and synthetic fragrance, which makes it harder to find something that suits my skin.  The cream is very light, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, and I have to use very little.  I use it mostly for my face, but it&#x27;s also been great for body.    It&#x27;s worked so well.  On top of that, it&#x27;s price is so reasonable online compared to other natural products I&#x27;ve tried which are often pricey.    It was good to see how reviews on most sites seem to be overwhelmingly positive.</li>
            <li> I have allergies really bad and most lotions make my eyes swell up.  this was just the ticket I needed, along with the vani soap what a blessing! I have dry mature skin and this really works!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  It&#x27;s thick and creamy.  It leaves my skin soft.  For those who are sensitive to dyes and scents this lotion is great.</li>
            <li> Good - not greasy. No sunscreen protection in it though! Wish there was</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to perfumes so it took me a while to find the right moisturizer.  This is my go-to one!!  It is great; absorbs fast.  Non-greasy; does not block the pores.  For really dry environments, like the winters here in Ohio, then I mix this one with the cream for that extra protection needed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good lotion, though a little thin for my skin. Vanicream is a great brand, especially for mildly cleansing soap.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended as I was having issues with my eyes.  My hair dresser uses and loves it. The dermatologist sells it, and naturally wanted much more than I get it on Amazon and I could use Prime and Smile!  I have sensitive skin and have always had to be careful that what I was using didn&#x27;t have a lot of fragrance in it.  My dermatologist said I could use it all over.  So I use the Lite on my face, and the heavier Vanicream regular on my body.  Sure is a lot less expensive than buying the expensive face and eye lotions I was purchasing.  It goes on smoothly and disappears.  My face doesn&#x27;t have any dry spots, and feels good to touch and my eyes haven&#x27;t been red and itchy - what more could a mature woman ask for.  Am certain its great for all age groups.  I was hesitant as I was certain that the more expensive face and eye lotions would be better, but I was wrong - you really should give it a try.</li>
            <li> Works great. My face is nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> My son has really bad eczema and this lotion really helped.  I tried the lite cream first to see how he would react and his skin didn&#x27;t get irritated at all.  In fact, it helped clear up the eczema.</li>
            <li> The vanicream lite was recommended to me by a family member when my favorite face lotion was discontinued.  I tried several lotions and they all either felt too greasy or made me break out.  I have combination skin and this lotion makes my skin feel very smooth and doesn&#x27;t break me out.  I have a few dry patches especially in the winter and with the use of this lotion it makes my skin smooth.  This goes good under my makeup and allows for smooth application.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone because its a great product and does last a very long time.</li>
            <li> This is truly a light unscented lotion.  So many lotions that are &#x27;unscented&#x27; (meaning they&#x27;re not scented with a perfume) still have an odor that can be unappealing.  This has no appreciable odor.  And I do consider it &amp;#34;light,&amp;#34; unlike another review I saw before purchasing.  Good stuff!  Glad to have found it!</li>
            <li> For somone with chronic oily skin; its tough to find something with balance that won&#x27;t make your skin break out.  Unfortunately this lotion did just that!</li>
            <li> Non-greasy and works wonders on my hands which get very dry and cracked in the winter months. This product is a god-send.</li>
            <li> I use this creme all the time.  I have very sensitive skin and this is one of the few things I can use that doesn&#x27;t break out my skin. It absorbs into the skin very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film. My dermatologist recommended it years ago because it doesn&#x27;t have any perfumes or irritants in it and I have been using it ever since.  They also have a lotion with SPF that I use during the day.</li>
            <li> Vanicream Lite Lotion is quite satisfactory.  I am allergic to fragrances and Quaternium 15, a formaldehyde releasing product.  The Vanicream products are made without fragrances, etc. yet seem to work quite well.  Amazon&#x27;s price was quite good.</li>
            <li> Really good for my son&#x27;s mild eczema. However, I prefer the cream. The lotion is too light for his condition.</li>
            <li> This lotion worked wonders for my eczema breakouts and is pretty much the only moisturizer I can trust. It absorbs very quickly and has no scent at all so it doesn&#x27;t compete with my body sprays or perfume. I use the heavier cream for body and use only this on my face. Will buy over and over again.</li>
            <li> It is quite thick. I wanted to love it, but there is nothing Lite about it, nor has it done anything for my skin.</li>
            <li> the best, most effective lotion anywhere. Lite, clean,  odor free, really hydrates dry skin. Worth the extra cost. My derm recommended it.</li>
            <li> At first it was not bad, after using it for awhile it started drying up my skin and leaving it with flakes...I wanted to love it because it really smooth your skin but not moistursizing enough</li>
            <li> This is the perfect face lotion for sensitive skin. This light version is much thinner than their thicker moisturizing cream, so it goes on smoothly, dries quickly, is very moisturizing, and not greasy. I use this lite lotion in the morning after showering and the cream at night. I like it better than Cetaphil, which leaves my face very greasy. My dermatologist recommended this brand and I&#x27;ve started using all their products.  I&#x27;ve got my boyfriend hooked on this too, he says this lite lotion feels great on his beard when it&#x27;s itchy. A must-have for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Great alternative to the heavy cream from this same company. We were prescribed a tub of cream for my daughters eczema. I was getting a bit fed up with having my hands be greasy forever after applying the cream. I decided to give this a try and it absorbs quickly and lasts for the day, which is what we needed.</li>
            <li> This was a gift.  I think it was good for my friend who has sensitive skin. I made a little basket of products that she could use.</li>
            <li> My OBGYN gave me a sample of the Vanicream to use as a personal lubricant.  It&#x27;s the best ever!  Non-irritating, and so discreet!</li>
            <li> Excellent cream for those with allergies and/or sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Good pricing and delivery time.</li>
            <li> Our son has never had any more skin problems after he used this product.Our doctor recommended it to us and we are very thankful</li>
            <li> This was recommended by one of my in-laws who lives in Wisconsin, so he knows how cold weather can do a number on your hands. I just started using it, and I especially like that it&#x27;s minimally greasy. It seems just as effective as other lotions I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;d rate it 5 stars, but &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34; seems a bit extreme for hand lotion. Still, I&#x27;m very happy to have discovered it.</li>
            <li> Works well for our daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin.  Her doctor recommended it when she was a new born.  We have been happy with it but she does try to eat/lick it...</li>
            <li> product arrived quickly and was as described</li>
            <li> I have recently developed a sensitivity to a whole range of beauty and cleaning products, and this product really helped me with this allergy. I will continue to use this brand, as it has nearly cured my chronic urticaria. Great value for a great product! Thank you for the relief! A must have!</li>
            <li> I like this lotion for all over body lotion. No scent, just a clean lotion.  This lotion absorbs in quickly and very smoothly.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is perfect for my complex skin. I have patches of dry skin thanks to the winter chill, but I&#x27;m still VERY acne prone. This super lite lotion was recommended by my dermatologist and has proven to be just perfect.</li>
            <li> Vanicream is the best cream I have ever used because it&#x27;s light and not oily! I use it in the morning and again in the evening and I get a lot of compliments on my skin! Sometimes I combine vanicream with Oil of Olay. The thing that makes vsnicream the best for me is how it feels on my face. It&#x27;s worth buying; you won&#x27;t regret this purchase!</li>
            <li> Light enough for my face without breaking me out. Doesn&#x27;t bother my skin and everything bothers my skin. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> So many moisturizers irritate my eyes, and this one doesn&#x27;t do that at all.  It&#x27;s light and does a good job keeping my skin from getting dry -- and I live in dry Colorado.</li>
            <li> Started using this lotion to finish off someone else&#x27;s bottle but found it to be a really nice lite lotion.  It feels so light on the skin, smells good, and seems to nourish the skin.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for the winter though (they also make a regular that I haven&#x27;t tried yet) but love it for the warmer months.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great for anyone with sensitive skin.  It&#x27;s fragrance free, dye free, paraben free, and causes no irritation.  Very lightweight and smooth, it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy at all.  I use it every day, including on my face.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky about stuff I put on my body and I have sensitive skin.  This stuff is some of the lightest lotion out there and absorbs well, so you don&#x27;t feel like a slimy mess after applying.</li>
            <li> This product is mild for my sensitive skin. It was recommended to me by my doctor for my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> 1. The bottle : good packaging.&lt;br /&gt;2. The ingredients : way less chemicals, way less bad guys like : fragrance, parabens, formadehyde, etc.&lt;br /&gt;3. Texture : lightweight, light cream, not too watery, more gel like, absorbs fast.&lt;br /&gt;4. Color : white.&lt;br /&gt;About my skin : i have a yellow based, asian skin that tends to be oily / very oily. No acne. Some redness.&lt;br /&gt;So now is winter time and my skin gets kind of oily but strangely i have dry patches. I was confused. So that means, i need more water than oil in my skin. I decided to buy lotion with water base like vanicream light. I guessed right. This lotion works to remove the dry patches, conditioned my skin, not triggering any more redness. I warm the lotion by rubbing it between my palms and press it onto my skin. Works for day time. Not so hydrating for night time. I feel like i need to put something else. I have some of my La Mer gel cream so i put that on top. It feels perfect to go night night. The reason i try this product is because i want to add a little more hydration to my skin. La mer gel cream is too light for winter. If i buy the regular cream, it is too heavy so i decided to give this a try. Works harmoniously with my La Mer gel cream at night. For day time, the vanicream light is just perfect by itself. It says on the label that i can use this for body too? Wow. Thats a plus. I have scaly croco skin after i take a long hot shower. I put the lotion onto my skin but then again, not moisturizing enough so i go back and put on some coconut oil on. Too light for dry body skin. Not hydrating enough for dry feet either. Good for hands. I dont have that oily palms feeling after i put it on. Best for face and hands. Not so much for dry skin on the the rest of the body.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  I use it under my foundation and without foundation and it feels good without any irritation to my skin.  The only complaint I have is that it doesn&#x27;t include a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> After patch testing confirmed allergies to a number of common skin care product ingredients I wondered what I would be able to use. The literature I received from my dermatologist recommended products from this line so I decided to give them a try. This moisturizer is great for my hands and feet but feels a tad greasy on my face until it absorbs completely. I have oily skin though. After it absorbs it makes a nice base for my mineral makeup.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years and it meets all expectations recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant when I ordered Vanicream Lite, I&#x27;ve tried so many face creams and felt I was wasting my money.  The creams would either be:  too heavy --- would not &#x27;sink in&#x27; --- leave a coating.......just did not do the trick.  And this includes some Very Expensive creams recommended by skin specialist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a friend told me about Vanicream, which her dermatologist recommended.  I decided to try it.  And glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really really like this cream.....at first, it kind of &#x27;sits&#x27; on your skin, but it quickly soaks in, leaves your skin feeling soft and fresh ------ and Healthy, that&#x27;s the most important thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely purchase again, and only wish I had all the money back that I spent on the more expensive creams.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist and is awesome.  Works great on new and sensitive skin. Not oily at all-very light and smooth.</li>
            <li> I use Vanicream Lite Lotion for my delicate and sensitive skin. I love it. It is not heavy, does not cause any break outs and feels very natural. The 8 ounce bottle lasts a very long time and the price is very reasonable. I would recommend this product to anyone, but especially if you have delicate and/or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My husband actually told me my face was looking great - what was I doing differently!  This product, along with the Free &amp; Clear cleanser are the only changes I&#x27;ve made.  I have skin that is prone to breakouts - even though I&#x27;m over 40.</li>
            <li> I use bottle after bottle of this lotion.  Soothes the skin and never irritates. If one has skin sensitivities, this is a good product to use.</li>
            <li> I brought this for my gf who has eczema kinda bad , and she said it made her feel very soft . So I would advise buying this product .</li>
            <li> I have been using this skin care lotion for over a month now and I have NO COMPLAINTS and if you knew me you would know that that&#x27;s saying something.  I have dealt with allergies to various products on my skin and hair for years and this product works better then lotions that I have paid twice as much for.  Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great smaller size of the lite lotion.  I also have these in the larger pump size.  I have battled with atopic dermatitis and eczema since I was a young child and this lotion has been the gentlest I can remember.  No irritation and I feel a sense of instant relief when I apply it to my skin.  It&#x27;s gentle enough on my face and love that the lotion does not contain some of the &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; ingredients.</li>
            <li> works and never cause irritation for poeople with sensetive skin...................it is the only thing that is very compatiable with server allergy.</li>
            <li> GREAT CREAM FOR SUPER SENTIVE SKIN OR FOR PEOPLE GOING THRU MEDICAL TREATMENTS</li>
            <li> Product is new and package is completed.&lt;br /&gt;No harm, no damage when I received it.&lt;br /&gt;So I really love it.</li>
            <li> very good because it has NO parabens or junk in it. make your skin smooth, no oily feeling after appling</li>
            <li> A dream for someone with eczma/psoriasis.</li>
            <li> The product was recommended by my allergist.  It does seem to meet my sensitive skin needs.  Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion moisturizer! It has no or very little glycerine so doesn&#x27;t give my skin that sticky feeling like so many lotions do. Has fewer chemicals in it- way less. And it feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> I use it every morning, light, no perfumes or strange ingredients, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and in expensive.  A good deal!</li>
            <li> Nice gentle product.  I put essential oils in it and have been pleased.  I also use it as a mixing base when I create my own creams.</li>
