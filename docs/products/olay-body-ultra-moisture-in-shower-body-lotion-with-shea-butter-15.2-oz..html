            <li>Does a great job at moisturizing.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>so it softens my skin overnight, great winter product.</li>
            <li>Product works great on my skin - however the scent is so overpowering I can&#x27;t bring myself to use it again.</li>
            <li>Great for swimmers as well.</li>
            <li>this stuff is AMAZING :) I have been using for a week now and my skin feels AWESOME, it&#x27;s the softest and looks the best it has in a while.</li>
            <li>It also works best when used in conjunction with your favorite Olay body wash.</li>
            <li>The product is amazing for the skin and smells great.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion!</li>
            <li>Also nice that it doesn&#x27;t have a sent</li>
            <li>I am beyond thrilled with this body lotion.</li>
            <li>This is great to put on just before getting out of the shower,  for the best results pat your skin dry, do not rub with a towel or you will rub it off.</li>
            <li>Ok first I must say I love this lotion!!!</li>
            <li>Pure    corruption , and it&#x27;s a shame because this is a very good product .</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the way most will leave a tacky or greasy residue.          </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the way that most of them smell - perfumy smells on my hands?</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I just love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try this and sooooo glad I did.</li>
            <li>I LOVE that the scent stays with you all day and isn&#x27;t too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Hope this helped :).</li>
            <li>love this product and can&#x27;t find in stores here</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t find it any more in stores.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad she did.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do the best job of moisturizing and not a big fan of the scent.</li>
            <li>Glad I just bought one bottle, my skin felt sticky all day, I will probably toss this bottle and just use my skin oil</li>
            <li>I bought this after seeing the Nivea commercials, but purchased Olay because it had better reviews.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product that eliminates the need to apply lotion after the shower &amp; wait forever for it to dry so you can get dressed.</li>
            <li>Perfect for in the winter dry weather.</li>
            <li>Perfect for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>but I should say - skin is soft and smell is great</li>
            <li>Summer is just easy with this product.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, any excess rinses easily, and my skin is neither tacky or greasy.  </li>
            <li>and it dries out easily.</li>
            <li>It is applied in the shower making it easy to cover the body.</li>
            <li>I love how it goes on quick and easy, and rinses off to not leave any residue.  </li>
            <li>As a black man who needs lotion, this stuff is awesome.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised because it is very light and is rinsed off in the shower, so I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be effective.</li>
            <li>You skin feels absolutely fabulous.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the scent because its warm,inviting, and light.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the Shea butter scent and have decided to marry this lotion.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and leaves my skin feeling so silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This stuff, used after a shave, really helps diminish bumps (along with my Nature&#x27;s Gate Tea Tree Oil Lotion, which you should also try, because it is amazing).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great in the winter when your skin is dry and makes it easy to moisturize in the summer because your not sweating it off as your putting it on</li>
            <li>Super easy and convenient when in a rush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy to slather this on at the end of my shower and then rinse it off.  </li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s clean, but I worry).</li>
            <li>Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve had for my lower leg skin condition, the Body Wash has some soap in it and is more irritating.</li>
            <li>, it has a very calming and refreshing scent.</li>
            <li>Scent is nice and lingers ever so softly in the skin.</li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference just after the first day of using it.  </li>
            <li>Quick and easy to use, moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li>Unbelievably happy with both the description and previous reviews, I ordered a bottle immediately</li>
            <li>Super soft smooth skin!</li>
            <li>This product wins in both counts.  </li>
            <li>Maybe customer demand will bring it back and make it more readily available.</li>
            <li>Finally I discovered it on AMAZON and was very pleased to order a large quantity and have it shipped to my home.</li>
            <li>Very nice product , one of the few products that really work .</li>
            <li>I would even go as far as saying after a couple days you still will be fine.  </li>
            <li>I still love to use my coconut oil for lotion and will continue to rotate between the two but in the summer months, coconut oil just doesn&#x27;t dry as quickly on my skin.</li>
            <li>I am very busy with my career that I need fast easy solutions to problems.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and is light enough not to interfere with any other scents you may wear.    </li>
            <li>I use it in the summer to keep my skin hydrated when it&#x27;s too hot to put on lotion.</li>
            <li>I wish more stores sold it, I can only find at Target some of the time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall my girlfriend and I both love this.. will definitely keep ordering</li>
            <li>I love it and want to get the second one.</li>
            <li>You will feel smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>It smells so nice and leaves my skin feeling soft the entire day!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more as I think I found a new daily routine for my showers.</li>
            <li>and Olay really helps to keep the moisture in my skin and sure reduces the itchy feeling one gets from dry skin.</li>
            <li>ok, not for very dry skin</li>
            <li>I was using the Nivea In-Shower Lotion, but it was very sticky and I ended up throwing it away.  </li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t sticky at all, unless you use too much.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Olay shower lotion for about 4 years and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>So much cheaper there.</li>
            <li>It really seems to be doing the trick.</li>
            <li>And so much quicker and easier than moisturizing after you are out of the shower.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I came very close to ordering an overpriced lotion warmer before I searched for \\&quot;in-shower</li>
            <li>The bath doesn&#x27;t get oily as I thought - probably because I don&#x27;t use too much of it at once.</li>
            <li>I am very suspicious about body lotions.</li>
            <li>after I shower...or any time, really.</li>
            <li>My winter rough spots are softer, and my skin doesn&#x27;t have that dry flaking-off feeling after a good hot shower.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply, put on after showering while still showering which I LOVE and washes off just as easy with no residue feeling left behind.</li>
            <li>Of course, in the past I rarely put lotion on my feet due to my own issues with how clean I think my floor is after I get out of the shower</li>
            <li>I check Amazon (since we recently got Amazon prime for free shipping on items like this) and was surprised to find it.</li>
            <li>I saw this years ago when I was in high school and never tried it.</li>
            <li>Importantly, this lotion has not made MY shower more slippery; you may see different results, but other users agree that this doesn&#x27;t actually increase the slip factor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as excessively perfumed as many lotions I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>No need to lotion after you get out the shower and your skin feels soft and silky.</li>
            <li>There is no oily or tacky feeling afterwards and it does leave your skin feeling soft and hydrated throughout the day.</li>
            <li>leaves your skin soft and silky</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft and doesn&#x27;t leave a film on my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier and faster than putting lotion on after the shower when your skin is dry.</li>
            <li>For whatever reason, I hate putting on body lotion outside of the shower even if it&#x27;s in beautiful packaging and is a high end product.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and could not find it anymore at my local Walmart, I even searched Walmarts that were far out of my area.</li>
            <li>22 year old male writing this...</li>
            <li>and i tend to get wet and wash my hands alot in my line of work and the grease just doesn&#x27;t really work out.</li>
            <li>In my late 40s I became acquainted with severe dry skin that itched all winter.  </li>
            <li>The shower floor also does get a bit sticky and slippery, but I think this small drawback is definitely worth it.  </li>

            <li> Importantly, this lotion has not made MY shower more slippery; you may see different results, but other users agree that this doesn&#x27;t actually increase the slip factor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as excessively perfumed as many lotions I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> No need to lotion after you get out the shower and your skin feels soft and silky.</li>
            <li> There is no oily or tacky feeling afterwards and it does leave your skin feeling soft and hydrated throughout the day.</li>
            <li> leaves your skin soft and silky</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft and doesn&#x27;t leave a film on my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier and faster than putting lotion on after the shower when your skin is dry.</li>
            <li> For whatever reason, I hate putting on body lotion outside of the shower even if it&#x27;s in beautiful packaging and is a high end product.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and could not find it anymore at my local Walmart, I even searched Walmarts that were far out of my area.</li>
            <li> 22 year old male writing this...</li>
            <li> and i tend to get wet and wash my hands alot in my line of work and the grease just doesn&#x27;t really work out.</li>
            <li> In my late 40s I became acquainted with severe dry skin that itched all winter.  </li>
            <li> The shower floor also does get a bit sticky and slippery, but I think this small drawback is definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li> It takes less than a minute to apply and rinse, and my skin feels very soft and not dry at all afterward.  </li>
            <li> the very first use -- no more dry, itchy skin, even on elbows and legs!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;this completely moisturizes my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave any film like other lotions i have tried.</li>
            <li> to the point where certain fabrics are hard to touch</li>
            <li> Anything that is made in    America that is somewhat decent , which are very few things , never lasts .</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much if any perfume - or at least, nothing that bothers me.  </li>
            <li> When I come home from work or any occasion I take off my pants and my legs are GREY.</li>
            <li> So I will be sticking to my in shower body lotion for life or as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> However, in my case, my dry skin went beyond itchy, extending into cracking and bleeding.      </li>
            <li> I started to notice that my skin was so dry and itchy after I moved.</li>
            <li> Then I rinse it off and when I dry off it feels just like I&#x27;d put lotion on before getting dressed.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely dry and itchy skin, and this product relieves all of my symptoms.</li>
            <li> take your shower; turn off shower, apply the Olay In-Shower Lotion liberally, rinse, and pat dry and&lt;br /&gt;from</li>

            <li> This will NOT replace your lotion, but if you skip a day of putting on lotion on the hidden parts of your body you will not wake up ashy the next day.  </li>
            <li> I do notice a bit of a stickiness on my skin after patting dry, but this soon disappears as the lotion sinks in.  </li>
            <li> I think you could get a similar result for much less money with baby oil, but the Olay doesn&#x27;t gum up my bathtub like baby oil does.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> My skin stays soft at least half the day where I can actually feel the difference and moistened all day.</li>

            <li> This was recommended to me by visiting nurses for my extreme dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had improvements in skin moisture since using it during the current harsh winter.  </li>
            <li> With regular use, during this winder past, my heals never cracked, even once.  </li>
            <li> I still have to use other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried almost every other one that comes on the market, but nothing even comes close.  </li>
            <li> Proctor &amp; Gamble, please ask other stores to stock this product.</li>
            <li> so I can put on other perfumes and not worry about clashing scents.</li>
            <li> Even my usually dry feet became softer after using this lotion for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I think of Olay products as being expensive, but at the sale price this seems quite reasonable for the quality.</li>
            <li> I also use it in the morning because I am chronically late, and putting on lotion after my morning shower would make me even later.</li>
            <li> It also lasts quite a long while, at least a few days, and for once my legs and arms aren&#x27;t dry.  </li>
            <li> I put a little in my hands and rub them together then apply.  </li>
            <li> It is also impossible to find in stores around here, but that&#x27;s what the internet is for, right?</li>
            <li> it made my skin somewhat softer but not a huge difference.</li>
            <li> This leaves none of that and takes no time to apply and hardly leave any residue in my bathtub compared to other shower lotions i have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even that painful tight, dry feeling on your back is gone!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The only down side is that it will make the floor of your shower slippery, but extra cleaning is a small price to pay for not having horrible dry skin in the winter!</li>
            <li> A fairly small amount seems to cover me well, and the bottle lasts for months.  </li>
            <li> No more winter itchy skin.</li>
            <li> No more waiting to get dressed or going out in a rush with scaly skin.</li>
            <li> Part of this is because I get horrible razor bumps for no reason, even in the summer, even if I use a new razor, even if I use sensitive shaving lotion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i wear sandals everyday and and am i guy so needless to say i have dry skin.</li>
            <li> tell everyone about it; hard to keep it on the shelves at stores!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I find it hard to wear lotion because of the film i find it leaves on me</li>
            <li> It is extremely hard to find in stores and when I do they often sell out and don&#x27;t re-stock.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it is impossible to find in stores in my area.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, as the other reviews have said, it&#x27;s very hard to find.</li>
            <li> It does leave the tub slippery, but it is absolutely worth it to not be miserable all winter.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so hard to find in stores!</li>
            <li> Winter is brutal on my skin, I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this stuff.</li>
            <li> I got tired of running around town looking for it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately    it has been discontinued , which doesn&#x27;t suprise me .</li>
            <li> Too bad</li>
            <li> I have to confess, I am so bad about remembering to put lotion or moisturizer on</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Great product.  Summer is just easy with this product.</li>
            <li> In my late 40s I became acquainted with severe dry skin that itched all winter.  However, in my case, my dry skin went beyond itchy, extending into cracking and bleeding.      Besides the pain, I worried about infection.  I imagined headlines like, &#x27;woman dies of sepisis contracted when painful cracked feet became infected.&#x27;    Like another reviewer, I hate to apply lotion -         1) I don&#x27;t like the way most will leave a tacky or greasy residue.          2) I don&#x27;t like the way that most of them smell - perfumy smells on my hands? - blech.    This product wins in both counts.  It goes on easily, any excess rinses easily, and my skin is neither tacky or greasy.  It doesn&#x27;t have much if any perfume - or at least, nothing that bothers me.  And it works!  With regular use, during this winder past, my heals never cracked, even once.  And I&#x27;ve been spared that awful itching on the rest of my body.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with a product.    Too bad it&#x27;s so hard to find in stores!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend used this product for months and then it disappeared from the shelves of several local retailers. I check Amazon (since we recently got Amazon prime for free shipping on items like this) and was surprised to find it. She is now happy that she has her Olay lotion once again; and when she is happy, I am happy.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Only down side is that it makes the shower floor slippery when your done.  It&#x27;s great in the winter when your skin is dry and makes it easy to moisturize in the summer because your not sweating it off as your putting it on</li>
            <li> I just love this product. You skin feels absolutely fabulous. No need to lotion after you get out the shower and your skin feels soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Recently moved from Houston to San Antonio. I started to notice that my skin was so dry and itchy after I moved. It&#x27;s a lot dryer in San Antonio. I am very busy with my career that I need fast easy solutions to problems. I am addicted to this stuff. I shower and then at the end I use this product. My skin has improved in softness and appearance. I will continue to buy this product. I was bummed that I could not find it in a retail store around here. So my sister suggested to buy it from Amazon.com. I&#x27;ll continue to use Amazon.com to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Walmart, but I wanted to do a review here.  I love this stuff.  I was using the Nivea In-Shower Lotion, but it was very sticky and I ended up throwing it away.  This product isn&#x27;t sticky at all, unless you use too much.  I put a little in my hands and rub them together then apply.  Then I rinse it off and when I dry off it feels just like I&#x27;d put lotion on before getting dressed.  It also lasts quite a long while, at least a few days, and for once my legs and arms aren&#x27;t dry.  Woo hoo!</li>
            <li> O.M. effin&#x27;.G. this stuff is AMAZING :) I have been using for a week now and my skin feels AWESOME, it&#x27;s the softest and looks the best it has in a while. Winter is brutal on my skin, I have sensitive skin and it dries out easily. I decided to try this and sooooo glad I did. I LOVE that the scent stays with you all day and isn&#x27;t too overwhelming. There is no oily or tacky feeling afterwards and it does leave your skin feeling soft and hydrated throughout the day. Again it smells GREAT, it has a very calming and refreshing scent. Easy to apply, put on after showering while still showering which I LOVE and washes off just as easy with no residue feeling left behind. I&#x27;ll be ordering more as I think I found a new daily routine for my showers.</li>
            <li> I HATE to put on lotion, mostly because of the time it takes when my skin is dry and the greasy feeling left on my hands afterward.  Olay has addressed both of those issues with this product.  It takes less than a minute to apply and rinse, and my skin feels very soft and not dry at all afterward.  The only downside is that it is impossible to find in stores in my area.</li>
            <li> Ok first I must say I love this lotion!!! Seriously love this lotion!!! It moisturizes my skin wonderfully, has a good amount of product(usually lasts me about 2 months), wonderful price (I purchase mine from Walmart), and smells so divine and delicious ( I get tons of compliments). I really enjoy the scent because its warm,inviting, and light. I&#x27;m a weirdo when it comes to this...I don&#x27;t use it in the shower...I just use it as regular lotion. I enjoy the Shea butter scent and have decided to marry this lotion. The scent is also intensified with the olay Shea butter soap. I recently broke up with my ex-Bath and body works...just because this lotion is just that good!</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry and itchy skin, and this product relieves all of my symptoms. I have been using it for a couple of years now, and nothing else comes close. It works great. The smell is pleasant and is light enough not to interfere with any other scents you may wear.    It does leave the tub slippery, but it is absolutely worth it to not be miserable all winter. It is also impossible to find in stores around here, but that&#x27;s what the internet is for, right?</li>
            <li> This is a great product !  Quick and easy to use, moisturizes very well. Unfortunately, as the other reviews have said, it&#x27;s very hard to find. Maybe customer demand will bring it back and make it more readily available.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this actually works!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Will not disappoint.</li>
            <li> I have been using Olay shower lotion for about 4 years and it works very well.  I have very dry skin and Olay really helps to keep the moisture in my skin and sure reduces the itchy feeling one gets from dry skin.</li>
            <li> leaves your skin soft and silky</li>
            <li> This stuff is really good!  I use it in combo with the Olay 7 body wash.  It does leave a film on your tub.  As an AA female I have a problem with wearing pants.  When I come home from work or any occasion I take off my pants and my legs are GREY.</li>
            <li> I cannot take a shower without this stuff anymore.  As a black man who needs lotion, this stuff is awesome.  This will NOT replace your lotion, but if you skip a day of putting on lotion on the hidden parts of your body you will not wake up ashy the next day.  I would even go as far as saying after a couple days you still will be fine.  But you will definitely still need to put regular lotion on your hands and face even after using this stuff.</li>
            <li> This stuff is like using nothing. I have tried different amounts and followed the directions. I still have to use other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Great for in the winter</li>
            <li> This is my fav in shower body lotion. I saw this years ago when I was in high school and never tried it. I believe they may have discontinued this in shower body lotion for awhile and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in stores until I came across it at Walmart for only $5.97 recently! Check it out at your local Walmart. So much cheaper there. I picked some up recently and will never go back to regular lotion. It makes my skin so soft and doesn&#x27;t leave a film on my skin. Feels like I just applied regular lotion except in a shorter amount of time. Super easy and convenient when in a rush. I still love to use my coconut oil for lotion and will continue to rotate between the two but in the summer months, coconut oil just doesn&#x27;t dry as quickly on my skin. So I will be sticking to my in shower body lotion for life or as long as they make it. I hope they never ever discontinue this product. It also works best when used in conjunction with your favorite Olay body wash. Super soft smooth skin! Hope this helped :).</li>
            <li> Excellent product that eliminates the need to apply lotion after the shower &amp; wait forever for it to dry so you can get dressed. Does a great job at moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by visiting nurses for my extreme dry skin.  It really seems to be doing the trick.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It smells fantastic and leaves my skin feeling so silky smooth.  I use it in the summer to keep my skin hydrated when it&#x27;s too hot to put on lotion.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST!  And so much quicker and easier than moisturizing after you are out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Just take your shower; turn off shower, apply the Olay In-Shower Lotion liberally, rinse, and pat dry and&lt;br /&gt;from the very first use -- no more dry, itchy skin, even on elbows and legs!  Even that painful tight, dry feeling on your back is gone!&lt;br /&gt;I tell everyone about it; hard to keep it on the shelves at stores!&lt;br /&gt;This is the solution to dry skin!</li>
            <li> we&#x27;ve used this for years.  We&#x27;ve tried almost every other one that comes on the market, but nothing even comes close.  In the winter it&#x27;s truly a Godsend!</li>
            <li> This product is the only thing that helps save my skin in the winter.  I&#x27;ve tried all different kinds of lotions, but nothing works as well.  The only down side is that it will make the floor of your shower slippery, but extra cleaning is a small price to pay for not having horrible dry skin in the winter!</li>
            <li> Very nice product , one of the few products that really work . Unfortunately    it has been discontinued , which doesn&#x27;t suprise me . Anything that is made in    America that is somewhat decent , which are very few things , never lasts . Pure    corruption , and it&#x27;s a shame because this is a very good product .</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and could not find it anymore at my local Walmart, I even searched Walmarts that were far out of my area. Finally I discovered it on AMAZON and was very pleased to order a large quantity and have it shipped to my home. This is great to put on just before getting out of the shower,  for the best results pat your skin dry, do not rub with a towel or you will rub it off. I choose to use it at the end of the day so it softens my skin overnight, great winter product.</li>
            <li> I live in the dessert and this is a necessity in a city with hard water.  I wish more stores sold it, I can only find at Target some of the time.  Proctor &amp; Gamble, please ask other stores to stock this product.</li>
            <li> I discovered this while staying with a friend and wondered where it had been all my life.  It&#x27;s quick and easy to slather this on at the end of my shower and then rinse it off.  My winter rough spots are softer, and my skin doesn&#x27;t have that dry flaking-off feeling after a good hot shower.  A fairly small amount seems to cover me well, and the bottle lasts for months.  It&#x27;s not as excessively perfumed as many lotions I&#x27;ve tried.  I think of Olay products as being expensive, but at the sale price this seems quite reasonable for the quality.</li>
            <li> love this product and can&#x27;t find in stores here</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a solution for cold post-shower lotion forever!  I came very close to ordering an overpriced lotion warmer before I searched for \\&quot;in-shower lotion,\\&quot; although I didn&#x27;t expect anything to come up.  Unbelievably happy with both the description and previous reviews, I ordered a bottle immediately and I&#x27;m so happy that I did!  The product is amazing for the skin and smells great.  I do notice a bit of a stickiness on my skin after patting dry, but this soon disappears as the lotion sinks in.  The shower floor also does get a bit sticky and slippery, but I think this small drawback is definitely worth it.  I noticed a huge difference just after the first day of using it.  Just wonderful!</li>
            <li> ok, not for very dry skin</li>
            <li> This product leaves a silky softness that stays for hours. I think you could get a similar result for much less money with baby oil, but the Olay doesn&#x27;t gum up my bathtub like baby oil does. I recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> Great product! I would buy again. Perfect for in the winter dry weather.</li>
            <li> Product works great on my skin - however the scent is so overpowering I can&#x27;t bring myself to use it again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and I can&#x27;t find it any more in stores. It&#x27;s so much easier and faster than putting lotion on after the shower when your skin is dry. It smells wonderful too. I also use Olay&#x27;s Quench In-Shower Body Lotion.</li>
            <li> 22 year old male writing this...&lt;br /&gt;i wear sandals everyday and and am i guy so needless to say i have dry skin. to the point where certain fabrics are hard to touch&lt;br /&gt;this completely moisturizes my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave any film like other lotions i have tried. I find it hard to wear lotion because of the film i find it leaves on me and i tend to get wet and wash my hands alot in my line of work and the grease just doesn&#x27;t really work out. This leaves none of that and takes no time to apply and hardly leave any residue in my bathtub compared to other shower lotions i have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall my girlfriend and I both love this.. will definitely keep ordering</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It is applied in the shower making it easy to cover the body. My skin stays soft at least half the day where I can actually feel the difference and moistened all day. It is extremely hard to find in stores and when I do they often sell out and don&#x27;t re-stock. I got tired of running around town looking for it.</li>
            <li> it made my skin somewhat softer but not a huge difference. Makes the shower slippery</li>
            <li> No more winter itchy skin.</li>
            <li> Although it seems to moisturize well enough.</li>
            <li> I have been using the shower lotion for 5 days now. Without a doubt I see and feel the difference in my skin. I am recovering from cancer so I don&#x27;t always have the energy to put on lotion after showering and my friend suggested the In Shower Lotion and I am so glad she did.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do the best job of moisturizing and not a big fan of the scent.</li>
            <li> Glad I just bought one bottle, my skin felt sticky all day, I will probably toss this bottle and just use my skin oil</li>
            <li> My husband and I are very happy with this lotion. I read some reviews but I should say - skin is soft and smell is great (my husband loves it). The bath doesn&#x27;t get oily as I thought - probably because I don&#x27;t use too much of it at once. I love it and want to get the second one.</li>
            <li> Perfect for dry skin.  Just dab it one before you leave the shower.  Easiest way to moisturize your entire body and especially your feet.  You will feel smooth and soft.  Great for swimmers as well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.  For whatever reason, I hate putting on body lotion outside of the shower even if it&#x27;s in beautiful packaging and is a high end product.  It just doesn&#x27;t spread well and it&#x27;s always greasy.  I bought this after seeing the Nivea commercials, but purchased Olay because it had better reviews.  I love how it goes on quick and easy, and rinses off to not leave any residue.  I&#x27;ve had improvements in skin moisture since using it during the current harsh winter.  Also nice that it doesn&#x27;t have a sent so I can put on other perfumes and not worry about clashing scents.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this lotion. I am very suspicious about body lotions. Part of this is because I get horrible razor bumps for no reason, even in the summer, even if I use a new razor, even if I use sensitive shaving lotion. This stuff, used after a shave, really helps diminish bumps (along with my Nature&#x27;s Gate Tea Tree Oil Lotion, which you should also try, because it is amazing). I also use it in the morning because I am chronically late, and putting on lotion after my morning shower would make me even later. Even my usually dry feet became softer after using this lotion for a few weeks. I was surprised because it is very light and is rinsed off in the shower, so I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be effective. Of course, in the past I rarely put lotion on my feet due to my own issues with how clean I think my floor is after I get out of the shower (it&#x27;s clean, but I worry). Importantly, this lotion has not made MY shower more slippery; you may see different results, but other users agree that this doesn&#x27;t actually increase the slip factor. Note that I have a plastic base to my shower, and it has some grips.</li>
            <li> I have to confess, I am so bad about remembering to put lotion or moisturizer on after I shower...or any time, really. So, this in shower lotion is perfect for me! It smells so nice and leaves my skin feeling soft the entire day!</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve had for my lower leg skin condition, the Body Wash has some soap in it and is more irritating.</li>
            <li> Best product ever! No more waiting to get dressed or going out in a rush with scaly skin. I am beyond thrilled with this body lotion. Scent is nice and lingers ever so softly in the skin.</li>
