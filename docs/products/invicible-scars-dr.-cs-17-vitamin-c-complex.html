            <li>The pump works perfectly and I have begun using product!!  </li>
            <li>Thank you for the replacement and am very impressed with your customer service!!</li>
            <li>Invicible is  great scar treatment cream, but also a perfect skin care cream.</li>
            <li>My surgeon recommended it and it was great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great to have it around the house just in case...</li>
            <li>The cream was great</li>
            <li>It has been 8 weeks since my surgery, I am happy with the progress to date.</li>
            <li>texture and consistency of the cr&amp;egrave;me is great and absorbs into the skin immediately with no greasy residue.</li>
            <li>Amazing Product!</li>
            <li>The surgery was successful.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 1 month now and the difference is remarkable.</li>
            <li>and it smells good.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m very satisfied w/ the way my scar looks after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best product of its kind!  </li>
            <li>and my skin almost kind of glows.</li>
            <li>This item is not cost effective.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product 3 times a day for over a month and must say that it has been incredibly effective at diminishing the marks I&#x27;ve been trying to fade.</li>
            <li>The texture of it is very smooth and silky, which I like</li>
            <li>It rubs in easily and has a nice feel.  </li>
            <li>I love this productI</li>
            <li>Whoever developed this is brilliant.</li>
            <li>After faithfully using this product for many months I guess there has been some progress in fading my chin scar.</li>
            <li>For the most part, the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; scars seemed to heal&lt;br /&gt;nicely</li>
            <li>it definately would not hurt to give this a try, I did and I love my result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And although my card was charged 3 additional times I never recieved any more product.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product despite it costing more</li>
            <li>I think to see any more improvements</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a surgical nurse and my patients who had used the product were extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>Since this scar is on my face I am going to order one more to see if I can even out the tone.</li>
            <li>I thought this product was promising because of all the great reviews and the before and after pictures.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend this product and I am still on the search for a great scar cream that really works.</li>
            <li>Many people love it; I guess there&#x27;s always an exception.</li>
            <li>but I was expecting a lot more improvement based on the pictures on their website.</li>
            <li>better than any hydroquinone product in that it doesn&#x27;t lighten the area around the scar -</li>
            <li>I love how you don&#x27;t have to fuss with twisting a cap on an off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have finished the whole battle and my scar did not fade at all!!!!</li>
            <li>This smells good and it feels very silky on my skin, but it has not done anything for my issues.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product and received it very quickly.</li>
            <li>I came across InviCible Scars and was impressed by the information available online, the fact that it was developed by an actual plastic surgeon and the use of Vitamin C. I&#x27;ve been using it as is indicated and have so far seen great results!!</li>
            <li>Moisturizers but nothing special, better off putting silicone strips or bio oil.</li>
            <li>The cream itself seems nice, but I did not notice any difference in two weeks of using it exactly as directed.  </li>
            <li>My scars are now significantly lighter and more smooth than before.</li>
            <li>In my medicine cabinet it is fine, but when I have had to travel, I end up putting it in a container</li>
            <li>Pros: it goes on smoothly and does not have a strong smell.</li>
            <li>I have seen a huge difference.</li>
            <li>leaving a smooth feel and not keloid.  </li>
            <li>But the product was smooth ,lightweight,&amp; did not stain clothes.</li>
            <li>The product has no scent and is smooth going on.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this one to those who looking for something to treat their acne scars!!!!  </li>
            <li>Even after the first 3 days of using it twice a day as directed, I was able to see results.</li>
            <li>The first 6 months is when I saw the most improvement.</li>
            <li>but they arent as noticeable as they were originally.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive this item</li>
            <li>I must add that the cream works significantly faster on newer scars</li>
            <li>I have used several products for scar reduction, and this one is the best by far.  </li>
            <li>I use it every day in the morning before I apply make up and in the evening after I clean my face.  </li>
            <li>Was so happy and scar looked pretty dern good for those first few weeks</li>
            <li>You dont need a lot - not even a full pump for it to cover the area.    </li>
            <li>br /&gt;and want to share the good news with anyone who may possibly benefit from it.</li>
            <li>all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump dispenser is very well designed (functionally + aesthetically)  and dispenses even the smallest amount quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li>At that point my credit card company cancelled my card in order to prevent any more charges and it was a hassle waiting 7 to 10 business days to recieve a new card in the mail and then update my information in all of the differnt places where the info is saved.....</li>
            <li>Thanks Dr. C!!</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed!!</li>
            <li>I only used one bottle, and then let it heal on its own over time.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the investment, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li>The scar change from red, to rose to inviCible...</li>
            <li>Its worth trying a bottle if its&lt;br /&gt;your</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars only because its kind of greasy.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I believe it&#x27;s effectiveness and consistency is worth it.</li>
            <li>The only room for improvement I can see is that I wish it came with some kind of cap or lid so it would be easier to travel with.</li>
            <li>and it makes most of my old acne scars go away.  </li>
            <li>I have treated them with contractubex at one point, but then gave up because it wouldn&#x27;t get absorbed immediately</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have an odor, and it gets absorbed pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Am so excited about this product because it really works and</li>
            <li>I began to use it right away.</li>
            <li>I purchased InviCible after my recent surgery because I&#x27;d seen first hand the amazing results.</li>
            <li>best results so far have been plain hyaluronic acid and Bio-Oil for working on my scars, which i&#x27;ve bought here on amazon!</li>
            <li>I have used many scar removal products in the past and Invicible is hands down the best.</li>
            <li>did a lot of research online, with doctors, friends and have tried other products, and found that Invicible is better - easy to use and apply, and not greasy or fragrant, and does not irritate.</li>
            <li>Found someone who was able to open it and managed to get the rest out.  </li>
            <li>first time.  </li>
            <li>Expensive product, but not the best out there.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully I am one of those people who consistently checks my bank account.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I started using it about four weeks after surgery, and in the three weeks of using it as directed (twice daily) I am OK with the results -</li>
            <li>it has been another 8 weeks since I first posted my review</li>
            <li>New skin irritations will heal VERY quickly with this product, and older scars and discolorations will take longer.  </li>
            <li>The container looks big but the actual content of&lt;br /&gt;Product won&#x27;t last more than 2 weeks!!!</li>
            <li>Ten months later, the scar looks pretty good.</li>
            <li>Either that or the fancy dispenser stopped working, but I am almost positive I just used up all of the product.  </li>
            <li>Well, first off he said it wasn&#x27;t the easiest stuff to dispense from the container and there wasn&#x27;t all that much for the price either.  </li>
            <li>but I am very optimistic that with continued + consistent use even the stubborn marks will continue to fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It felt nice, it seemed like it was making a difference on the scar the first few nights, but then it stopped.</li>
            <li>I have a large scar can&#x27;t tell you if it worked or not ,ran out of it before a week was up.(per</li>
            <li>I would keep trying for a few more months!</li>
            <li>Brand new item (right out of the box)</li>
            <li>Is it hype or the real deal?</li>
            <li>HIghly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Really don&#x27;t know that it has made much difference in the scars.  </li>
            <li>Worked very well.</li>
            <li>It also feels very silky going on.  </li>
            <li>In eight days I couldn&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
            <li>If not, there is no telling how much money they would have stolen from me by now.</li>
            <li>Scar Away silicone sheets, Kelo-Cote etc and hadnt really seen much difference.</li>
            <li>I plan to take another photo tomorrow morning in the same light and will post both, then give monthly updates.    </li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t seen any difference at all</li>
            <li>If you are very concerned with how your scar looks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very prone to scarring.</li>
            <li>Do I really want to spend over $40 a month on this product??</li>
            <li>I used as directed and finished the whole container.</li>
            <li>Also a very greasy product.</li>
            <li>and I have to report that since then absolutely nothing has changed with my scar whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I have not seen much change on my scar.</li>
            <li>After my ex saw my post-surgical scars and gave me a really weirded out</li>
            <li>It has a nice consistency but if you have alot of scars or if you have large scars the product does not last long.  </li>
            <li>My original call was for them to actually send me the product since my card had already been charged twice.</li>
            <li>Not worth the money, mederma is better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m realistic about the healing outcome of a scar and realize that it will never be 100% gone</li>
            <li>would highly recommend it to anyone for use on newer hyper-pigmented areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used other products such as Scarfade and Mederma and while they work, they aren&#x27;t as effective as Invicible.</li>
            <li>instructions apply atleast 2 times a day.)I would expect a little more for the price you&#x27;re paying .</li>
            <li>I am able to use it alone for daytime use or with my night cream without it feeling heavy.</li>
            <li>My recommendation is to search for another product because at 40.00 dollars a day you will have to pay for 200.00 dollars worth for it to last 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Has helped fresh scars from deep cuts fill in and begin to fade over 2 months of use.</li>
            <li>I am very lucky to have heard about Invicible Scars on T.V.only a couple months before I had blepharoplasty - a surgical procedure which takes a bit of extra skin off the upper eyelid-.</li>
            <li>I had a car accident and had to do a surgery which left a very large hypertrophic scar.</li>
            <li>I have used Invicible Scar Cream multiple times over the past few years, and I have always been impressed with its results.  </li>
            <li>I tried it for acne scars and it ended up clogging my pores and causing a new blemishes.  </li>
            <li>I will save it for some new scar and will update my review at that time.</li>
            <li>I live in Rio de Janeiro,</li>
            <li>I have never left such an excited review about a product.</li>
            <li>The first month I contacted invicible scars and they told me that someone would call me back.</li>
            <li>was not oily or greasy and didn&#x27;t sit on top of the skin all white like other products .</li>
            <li>I had some pretty recent scars and it did nothing for them.</li>
            <li>I have old acne scars and a new one pops up whenever I get a zit.</li>
            <li>The cream has an easy absorption and the smell is almost imperceptible.</li>
            <li>It did a great job of making the scar less noticeable, I hardly can see it.</li>
            <li>I would definitely not recommend this, and I certainly won&#x27;t be buing it again.</li>
            <li>Followed as directed, however it did not last long and very surprised at how quickly it ran out.</li>
            <li>Now my skin is just as clear as it was before the IUD.</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s forehead scar is completely faded.</li>
            <li>I was actually pleasantly surprised with the results.  </li>
            <li>they&#x27;re definitely old scars, but i&#x27;ve been using a 2.5mm microneedle</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t enough time to see any real difference.</li>
            <li>do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>They were 4 months old by the time I discovered this product.</li>
            <li>I took a photo then and was very hopeful for future improvement.</li>
            <li>I dont think I have noticed much improvements in the last 3 months.</li>
            <li>Used as directed for 8 weeks, three times a day, didn&#x27;t work on old scars.</li>
            <li>Self conscious about how it will heal and look, my dermatologist recommended Invicible.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far this product has not worked well.</li>
            <li>I am trying to give this product a few more weeks to see if there are lasting results for me.</li>
            <li>So far, I have seen the scar settle quickly, and the redness go down, which gives me much hope for how it will look long term.</li>
            <li>But there is definitely improvement in the older ones.  </li>
            <li>I am still on my first bottle and use it twice a day religiously on 2 areas on my inner arms that are about 3 x 2.5\\&quot; in area.</li>
            <li>I am an African American woman of a medium to darker brown complexion and have been burdened with dealing with hyperpigmentation from little scrapes and scars mostly on my lower legs that take forever to go away or just don&#x27;t go away at all.</li>
            <li>Not happy with the price, or product, packaging is attractive, however for the actual contents were minimal in compairison to the container.</li>
            <li>the redness has gone down significantly, and on some, you can see where the red is turning to white/silver.    </li>
            <li>I have been using this on new plastic surgery scars and haven&#x27;t noticed an improvement whatsoever after starting to use it.</li>
            <li>I started using Invisible Scars every night and after 4 weeks the visibility of it was so faint that my own surgeon was surprised of how well my skin was healing.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice a big difference because I only used one bottle.  </li>
            <li>First of all, excuse me for my English because I&#x27;m Brazilian.</li>
            <li>It was barely visible.</li>
            <li>I was concerned about the the scar that would be left and started doing some research online for products with natural ingredients that could help heal and reduce the appearance of scars.</li>
            <li>So far it has only reduced the redness.</li>
            <li>Also, if your scars are as old as mine are, try using this cream with a personal microderm.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine but very small</li>
            <li>this product alone is not going to cut it for the large and deep scar that I have on my upper arm, maybe someone w/ a fresh small scar that even Neosporin can handle but not for deep hypertrophic.</li>
            <li>for how expensive this is, i&#x27;d DEFINITELY prefer a tube, because I can better gauge how much i have left, etc.</li>
            <li>Not sure it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Works well, but not sure it&#x27;s worth ~$39.</li>
            <li>In certain lights you can detect some slight indentation.  </li>
            <li>I have other scar creams that I have tried that appear to work better (even in the same relatively short period of time) and that last longer, even when the tube is very small.  </li>
            <li>Also good for covering up bad scars as they heal.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have finished the whole battle and my scar did not fade at all!!!!</li>
            <li> This smells good and it feels very silky on my skin, but it has not done anything for my issues.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and received it very quickly.</li>
            <li> I came across InviCible Scars and was impressed by the information available online, the fact that it was developed by an actual plastic surgeon and the use of Vitamin C. I&#x27;ve been using it as is indicated and have so far seen great results!!</li>
            <li> Moisturizers but nothing special, better off putting silicone strips or bio oil.</li>
            <li> The cream itself seems nice, but I did not notice any difference in two weeks of using it exactly as directed.  </li>
            <li> My scars are now significantly lighter and more smooth than before.</li>
            <li> In my medicine cabinet it is fine, but when I have had to travel, I end up putting it in a container</li>
            <li> Pros: it goes on smoothly and does not have a strong smell.</li>
            <li> I have seen a huge difference.</li>
            <li> leaving a smooth feel and not keloid.  </li>
            <li> But the product was smooth ,lightweight,&amp; did not stain clothes.</li>
            <li> The product has no scent and is smooth going on.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this one to those who looking for something to treat their acne scars!!!!  </li>
            <li> Even after the first 3 days of using it twice a day as directed, I was able to see results.</li>
            <li> The first 6 months is when I saw the most improvement.</li>
            <li> but they arent as noticeable as they were originally.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this item</li>
            <li> I must add that the cream works significantly faster on newer scars</li>
            <li> I have used several products for scar reduction, and this one is the best by far.  </li>
            <li> I use it every day in the morning before I apply make up and in the evening after I clean my face.  </li>
            <li> Was so happy and scar looked pretty dern good for those first few weeks</li>
            <li> You dont need a lot - not even a full pump for it to cover the area.    </li>
            <li> br /&gt;and want to share the good news with anyone who may possibly benefit from it.</li>
            <li> all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump dispenser is very well designed (functionally + aesthetically)  and dispenses even the smallest amount quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li> At that point my credit card company cancelled my card in order to prevent any more charges and it was a hassle waiting 7 to 10 business days to recieve a new card in the mail and then update my information in all of the differnt places where the info is saved.....</li>
            <li> Thanks Dr. C!!</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed!!</li>
            <li> I only used one bottle, and then let it heal on its own over time.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the investment, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> The scar change from red, to rose to inviCible...</li>
            <li> Its worth trying a bottle if its&lt;br /&gt;your</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars only because its kind of greasy.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I believe it&#x27;s effectiveness and consistency is worth it.</li>
            <li> The only room for improvement I can see is that I wish it came with some kind of cap or lid so it would be easier to travel with.</li>
            <li> and it makes most of my old acne scars go away.  </li>
            <li> I have treated them with contractubex at one point, but then gave up because it wouldn&#x27;t get absorbed immediately</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have an odor, and it gets absorbed pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Am so excited about this product because it really works and</li>
            <li> I began to use it right away.</li>
            <li> I purchased InviCible after my recent surgery because I&#x27;d seen first hand the amazing results.</li>
            <li> best results so far have been plain hyaluronic acid and Bio-Oil for working on my scars, which i&#x27;ve bought here on amazon!</li>
            <li> I have used many scar removal products in the past and Invicible is hands down the best.</li>
            <li> did a lot of research online, with doctors, friends and have tried other products, and found that Invicible is better - easy to use and apply, and not greasy or fragrant, and does not irritate.</li>
            <li> Found someone who was able to open it and managed to get the rest out.  </li>
            <li> first time.  </li>
            <li> Expensive product, but not the best out there.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully I am one of those people who consistently checks my bank account.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I started using it about four weeks after surgery, and in the three weeks of using it as directed (twice daily) I am OK with the results -</li>
            <li> it has been another 8 weeks since I first posted my review</li>
            <li> New skin irritations will heal VERY quickly with this product, and older scars and discolorations will take longer.  </li>
            <li> The container looks big but the actual content of&lt;br /&gt;Product won&#x27;t last more than 2 weeks!!!</li>
            <li> Ten months later, the scar looks pretty good.</li>
            <li> Either that or the fancy dispenser stopped working, but I am almost positive I just used up all of the product.  </li>
            <li> Well, first off he said it wasn&#x27;t the easiest stuff to dispense from the container and there wasn&#x27;t all that much for the price either.  </li>
            <li> but I am very optimistic that with continued + consistent use even the stubborn marks will continue to fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It felt nice, it seemed like it was making a difference on the scar the first few nights, but then it stopped.</li>
            <li> I have a large scar can&#x27;t tell you if it worked or not ,ran out of it before a week was up.(per</li>
            <li> I would keep trying for a few more months!</li>
            <li> Brand new item (right out of the box)</li>
            <li> Is it hype or the real deal?</li>
            <li> HIghly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Really don&#x27;t know that it has made much difference in the scars.  </li>
            <li> Worked very well.</li>
            <li> It also feels very silky going on.  </li>
            <li> In eight days I couldn&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
            <li> If not, there is no telling how much money they would have stolen from me by now.</li>
            <li> Scar Away silicone sheets, Kelo-Cote etc and hadnt really seen much difference.</li>
            <li> I plan to take another photo tomorrow morning in the same light and will post both, then give monthly updates.    </li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t seen any difference at all</li>
            <li> If you are very concerned with how your scar looks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very prone to scarring.</li>
            <li> Do I really want to spend over $40 a month on this product??</li>
            <li> I used as directed and finished the whole container.</li>
            <li> Also a very greasy product.</li>
            <li> and I have to report that since then absolutely nothing has changed with my scar whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I have not seen much change on my scar.</li>
            <li> After my ex saw my post-surgical scars and gave me a really weirded out</li>
            <li> It has a nice consistency but if you have alot of scars or if you have large scars the product does not last long.  </li>
            <li> My original call was for them to actually send me the product since my card had already been charged twice.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money, mederma is better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m realistic about the healing outcome of a scar and realize that it will never be 100% gone</li>
            <li> would highly recommend it to anyone for use on newer hyper-pigmented areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used other products such as Scarfade and Mederma and while they work, they aren&#x27;t as effective as Invicible.</li>
            <li> instructions apply atleast 2 times a day.)I would expect a little more for the price you&#x27;re paying .</li>
            <li> I am able to use it alone for daytime use or with my night cream without it feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> My recommendation is to search for another product because at 40.00 dollars a day you will have to pay for 200.00 dollars worth for it to last 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Has helped fresh scars from deep cuts fill in and begin to fade over 2 months of use.</li>
            <li> I am very lucky to have heard about Invicible Scars on T.V.only a couple months before I had blepharoplasty - a surgical procedure which takes a bit of extra skin off the upper eyelid-.</li>
            <li> I had a car accident and had to do a surgery which left a very large hypertrophic scar.</li>
            <li> I have used Invicible Scar Cream multiple times over the past few years, and I have always been impressed with its results.  </li>
            <li> I tried it for acne scars and it ended up clogging my pores and causing a new blemishes.  </li>
            <li> I will save it for some new scar and will update my review at that time.</li>
            <li> I live in Rio de Janeiro,</li>
            <li> I have never left such an excited review about a product.</li>
            <li> The first month I contacted invicible scars and they told me that someone would call me back.</li>
            <li> was not oily or greasy and didn&#x27;t sit on top of the skin all white like other products .</li>
            <li> I had some pretty recent scars and it did nothing for them.</li>
            <li> I have old acne scars and a new one pops up whenever I get a zit.</li>
            <li> The cream has an easy absorption and the smell is almost imperceptible.</li>
            <li> It did a great job of making the scar less noticeable, I hardly can see it.</li>
            <li> I would definitely not recommend this, and I certainly won&#x27;t be buing it again.</li>
            <li> Followed as directed, however it did not last long and very surprised at how quickly it ran out.</li>
            <li> Now my skin is just as clear as it was before the IUD.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s forehead scar is completely faded.</li>
            <li> I was actually pleasantly surprised with the results.  </li>
            <li> they&#x27;re definitely old scars, but i&#x27;ve been using a 2.5mm microneedle</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t enough time to see any real difference.</li>
            <li> do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> They were 4 months old by the time I discovered this product.</li>
            <li> I took a photo then and was very hopeful for future improvement.</li>
            <li> I dont think I have noticed much improvements in the last 3 months.</li>
            <li> Used as directed for 8 weeks, three times a day, didn&#x27;t work on old scars.</li>
            <li> Self conscious about how it will heal and look, my dermatologist recommended Invicible.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far this product has not worked well.</li>
            <li> I am trying to give this product a few more weeks to see if there are lasting results for me.</li>
            <li> So far, I have seen the scar settle quickly, and the redness go down, which gives me much hope for how it will look long term.</li>
            <li> But there is definitely improvement in the older ones.  </li>
            <li> I am still on my first bottle and use it twice a day religiously on 2 areas on my inner arms that are about 3 x 2.5\\&quot; in area.</li>
            <li> I am an African American woman of a medium to darker brown complexion and have been burdened with dealing with hyperpigmentation from little scrapes and scars mostly on my lower legs that take forever to go away or just don&#x27;t go away at all.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the price, or product, packaging is attractive, however for the actual contents were minimal in compairison to the container.</li>
            <li> the redness has gone down significantly, and on some, you can see where the red is turning to white/silver.    </li>
            <li> I have been using this on new plastic surgery scars and haven&#x27;t noticed an improvement whatsoever after starting to use it.</li>
            <li> I started using Invisible Scars every night and after 4 weeks the visibility of it was so faint that my own surgeon was surprised of how well my skin was healing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice a big difference because I only used one bottle.  </li>
            <li> First of all, excuse me for my English because I&#x27;m Brazilian.</li>
            <li> It was barely visible.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about the the scar that would be left and started doing some research online for products with natural ingredients that could help heal and reduce the appearance of scars.</li>
            <li> So far it has only reduced the redness.</li>
            <li> Also, if your scars are as old as mine are, try using this cream with a personal microderm.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine but very small</li>
            <li> this product alone is not going to cut it for the large and deep scar that I have on my upper arm, maybe someone w/ a fresh small scar that even Neosporin can handle but not for deep hypertrophic.</li>
            <li> for how expensive this is, i&#x27;d DEFINITELY prefer a tube, because I can better gauge how much i have left, etc.</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Works well, but not sure it&#x27;s worth ~$39.</li>
            <li> In certain lights you can detect some slight indentation.  </li>
            <li> I have other scar creams that I have tried that appear to work better (even in the same relatively short period of time) and that last longer, even when the tube is very small.  </li>
            <li> Also good for covering up bad scars as they heal.</li>
            <li> My husband had a potentially dangerous mole cut out of his back by a dermatologist, and that scar is the size of a quarter and doesn&#x27;t look good, still has some pink.</li>
            <li> I have several scars on my body, one of them is 3 yo, and the other two scars - one year old.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost entirely flat, and the redness has faded.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seven weeks post abdominal surgery that left me with a long scar.</li>
            <li> The product might be good, although I have been disappointed with it.  </li>
            <li> Due to this being a high tension area I was afraid the scar would widen again and be very obvious; fortunately, within about four weeks of excision once the scabbing was gone I started using invicible along w/ daily silicone sheeting (from circa</li>
            <li> I had scar excision surgery on my upper arm close to my shoulder due to a car accident back in 10&#x27;.</li>
            <li> and I think I waited too long to try this product, one year post op.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping this was the cure I&#x27;ve been searching for, for so long.</li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not clear as to whether or not the scars will return if you stop using it???&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Faded down the scar, and barely visible.</li>
            <li> I bought this when my skin burned due to over application of a chemical peel &amp; left scars on my face.</li>
            <li> I had this weird, huge hard bump near my belly button on my laparoscopy scar.</li>
            <li> I had a bad accident that caused a huge cut above my lip last FEB..</li>
            <li> and I must say that after only a week and a half my skin is clearer.</li>
            <li> I am religiously putting it on twice a day as directed and the tissue is definitely less dense.  </li>
            <li> Besides applying this ointment, then only other thing Im doing is being very careful about keeping the area covered and away from sun so as not to let the scars darken.    </li>
            <li> They were still very red with little or no fading.</li>
            <li> I went through both the smaller and larger bottle, applying at least twice a day with no noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> In fact, it acts like it&#x27;s empty well before the product is gone.  </li>
            <li> Going to buy a second round because it looks like it will keep fading</li>
            <li> it was too heavy, and I can&#x27;t access the last bit inside of the gigantic fortress of a pump</li>
            <li> No real visible scar reduction even after three weeks.</li>
            <li> but all I can say is...if you have an untreated scar that you&#x27;ve already spent hundreds maybe thousands on to treat w/ unsatisfactory results..</li>
            <li> and it was empty</li>
            <li> It was gone in only a few days.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s by no means a miracle cure, and I know the scar will never really vanish, but it does help.</li>
            <li> Now my scar is not very noticeable, and covers well with makeup if needed.</li>
            <li> If not, I would not mess with this product since they hardly give you any</li>
            <li> and I can see only a very, very, very slight improvement in the reduction of color in my scar</li>
            <li> Like one of the other reviewers said there is not much product in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I was very generous with application and had a thick layer covering the scar though - not sure if that mattered.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s very little product especially at this price.  </li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with the other products for scarring I got from Amazon.</li>
            <li> My other scars did not change and did not even lighten the slightest bit.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the results were pretty insignificant.</li>
            <li> My dark spots are still there.</li>
            <li> I am dark skin women who have been using this product for two month.</li>
            <li> However, no matter how good it works, its not worth the HORRIBLE customer service.  </li>
            <li> been using for a month and bottle almost empty but scar still here!!</li>
            <li> The most frustrating thing is the design of the small container, which makes it difficult to remove all of the cream.  </li>
            <li> Within almost a week and a half my scars are almost gone.</li>
            <li> My keloid scars are now flattened and there is a slight discoloration</li>
            <li> I saw few results, but at least it kept the scars from getting too red.</li>
            <li> The scars are still slightly raised and again, silver/white in color</li>
            <li> The 3 yo scar is getting less noticeable, and the edges are getting smoother.</li>
            <li> I purchased Invicible Scars to treat acne scars/ small surgery scars (1/4 of an inch long) and the small dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT THE BOTTLE IS TOO SMALL</li>
            <li> The product is slightly expensive, but it will last a long time if used sparingly.  </li>
            <li> A little goes</li>
            <li> Within a week, the contrast between the scar tissue and my regular skin has decreased, making the scar less visible.  </li>
            <li> Expensive, but helped clear scars that the copper IUD birth control had caused me and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> The dispenser is heavy for what could just be a tube or bottle of the cream.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try the Invicible on my brown spots and write a follow-up in a few months.</li>
            <li> : my scar still widened a bit and became noticeable again within a few weeks of excision and radiation.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 months everyday</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this posting once I&#x27;ve used this system for a few months and let you know how it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> It definately flattened and leveled off my scar/surrounding tissue in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> After 2.5 months unfortunately this product has not made any difference on a 8 month old scar (at the time I started the use of this product).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the slight improvement I&#x27;m seeing is enough to make me want to purchase another bottle because it is expensive and the amount of cream you get is so little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very little in the bottle.</li>
            <li> My surgeon has a 2.5 inch scar on the front of his neck from surgery and said he has been wearing the scar tape for the past 6 months.</li>
            <li> It faded some  of my small scars on my legs, and they are not as noticeable as before.</li>
            <li> used a small amount for twice a day for 2 weeks</li>
            <li> My scar is small and I was veryyy conservative with the product and it has already run out.</li>
            <li> Very upset and disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying it twice a day for the past 3 weeks and have noticed a subtle difference.</li>
            <li> Also, the packaging is horrible, a lot of it definitely goes to waste because you cannot open the container.</li>
            <li> absolute crap.</li>
            <li> money wasted!!</li>
            <li> It also comes in a small container with a weak pump.</li>
            <li> I recently had a bad fall and was left with a horrible scar on my hand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll update my review periodically as I use the product for a longer period of time to see if anything dramatic changes in my scar.</li>
            <li> I used this in combination with Creme de la Mer concentrate on a cyst excision scar (after I no longer had to wear the medi tape), so it&#x27;s difficult to say which product worked.</li>
            <li> Ill keep using it till I hit the 12 month mark though just to see all it can do.</li>
            <li> an the pump is broken!!  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say this is a bad product as nothing else worked for me.</li>
            <li> Might help people who don&#x27;t keloid bad.</li>
            <li> so nothing I can do but get frustrated with the quality of the packaging.</li>
            <li> Holy crap</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this.  </li>
            <li> Wont buy again, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed given the cost of the product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The product might be good, although I have been disappointed with it.  The dispenser is heavy for what could just be a tube or bottle of the cream.  The cream itself seems nice, but I did not notice any difference in two weeks of using it exactly as directed.  However, I did run out of the cream after two weeks.  Either that or the fancy dispenser stopped working, but I am almost positive I just used up all of the product.  That&#x27;s very little product especially at this price.  I have other scar creams that I have tried that appear to work better (even in the same relatively short period of time) and that last longer, even when the tube is very small.  I would definitely not recommend this, and I certainly won&#x27;t be buing it again.</li>
            <li> It doesnt work on my Keloid and raised scar neither does it lighten any discoloration. Very upset and disappointed.</li>
            <li> I used this in combination with Creme de la Mer concentrate on a cyst excision scar (after I no longer had to wear the medi tape), so it&#x27;s difficult to say which product worked. I only used one bottle, and then let it heal on its own over time. Ten months later, the scar looks pretty good. It&#x27;s almost entirely flat, and the redness has faded. I do have to say that this product will leave your skin feeling silky, so I think it&#x27;s worth a try at least once.</li>
            <li> I love this productI My surgeon recommended it and it was great.  I did have problems with the bottle not dispensing and the company personally phoned and told me how to correct it.</li>
            <li> I have used many scar removal products in the past and Invicible is hands down the best. I have used other products such as Scarfade and Mederma and while they work, they aren&#x27;t as effective as Invicible. I was introduced to the product by a friend, who uses it often and am very happy that I decided to give it a try. Within almost a week and a half my scars are almost gone. The texture of it is very smooth and silky, which I like and it smells good. Definitely worth the investment, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. I used up the hole bottle already and not even the slightest changes have appeared on my scar.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work on my scars</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taking some time to work but it is actually helping to &#x27;lighten&#x27; injury scars. I would keep trying for a few more months!</li>
            <li> I have toddler girl and she is in the stage where she likes to run, climb, fall and she bruces herself or get cuts on her knees now and then... I like using inviCible scars on occasions like this ones! It&#x27;s also great to have it around the house just in case... Just an example my husband loves playing basketball and while playing he got a cut followed by a purple eye and he had to go to Urgent Care to get stitches, anyways he did not wanted to get a scar from it. So when the stitches came off, he used the cream and about four weeks you could see the healing. The scar change from red, to rose to inviCible... Believe me this cream WORKS!!!!</li>
            <li> Holy crap I have never left such an excited review about a product. Whoever developed this is brilliant. I had this weird, huge hard bump near my belly button on my laparoscopy scar. It looked gross and wart like. After just 2 applications (1 last night and 2 today) that bump has shrieked by 80%!!!! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I was very generous with application and had a thick layer covering the scar though - not sure if that mattered. Will test out using this on my face just out of curiosity.</li>
            <li> Is it hype or the real deal? After faithfully using this product for many months I guess there has been some progress in fading my chin scar.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and received it very quickly. I Started using it and would recommend it to anyone trying to get rid of a scar.</li>
            <li> Invicible is  great scar treatment cream, but also a perfect skin care cream. My skin was smoother and brighter after only a couple of weeks of using it. I am able to use it alone for daytime use or with my night cream without it feeling heavy. HIghly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I am very lucky to have heard about Invicible Scars on T.V.only a couple months before I had blepharoplasty - a surgical procedure which takes a bit of extra skin off the upper eyelid-. The surgery was successful. But there is always a scar left after the procedure. I started using Invisible Scars every night and after 4 weeks the visibility of it was so faint that my own surgeon was surprised of how well my skin was healing. I kept using Invisible Scars all over my face because I noticed that my brown spots, from sun damage started fading \\&quot;voila\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;m a believer I recommend Invisible Scars to anyone seeking to improve their skin.</li>
            <li> Really don&#x27;t know that it has made much difference in the scars.  The most frustrating thing is the design of the small container, which makes it difficult to remove all of the cream.  In fact, it acts like it&#x27;s empty well before the product is gone.  Found someone who was able to open it and managed to get the rest out.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d order again.</li>
            <li> Worked very well. Faded down the scar, and barely visible. Going to buy a second round because it looks like it will keep fading</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice a big difference because I only used one bottle.  For the most part, the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; scars seemed to heal&lt;br /&gt;nicely leaving a smooth feel and not keloid.  It also feels very silky going on.  Its worth trying a bottle if its&lt;br /&gt;your first time.  Every one heals differently.</li>
            <li> I have 5-inch z-shaped scar on my upper arm from melanoma surgery on August 18, 2013. I began using Invicible about 8 days ago. In eight days I couldn&#x27;t really see a difference. I saw my surgeon today for a 6-week checkup. I told him I had been using Invicible about 8 days. He recommended that I keep scar tape on the scar 24/7 for 6 months to a  year. My surgeon has a 2.5 inch scar on the front of his neck from surgery and said he has been wearing the scar tape for the past 6 months. His nurse showed me a 2-inch scar on the front of her neck from surgery. It was barely visible. The nurse said she wore the scar tape for a year. Last example: this same surgeon removed a lypoma from my husband&#x27;s head, upper front forehead. My husband did nothing to the scar - no tape, no treatments. My husband&#x27;s forehead scar is completely faded. In certain lights you can detect some slight indentation.  If you follow my surgeon&#x27;s advice, I don&#x27;t see how you could possibly use Invicible. I think a lot depends on the surgeon. My husband had a potentially dangerous mole cut out of his back by a dermatologist, and that scar is the size of a quarter and doesn&#x27;t look good, still has some pink. I&#x27;ll try the Invicible on my brown spots and write a follow-up in a few months.</li>
            <li> BEEN USING IT RELIGIOUSLY WOULD DEFF BUY AGAIN I THINK I CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE. ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT THE BOTTLE IS TOO SMALL</li>
            <li> Amazing Product! I recently had a bad fall and was left with a horrible scar on my hand. I was concerned about the the scar that would be left and started doing some research online for products with natural ingredients that could help heal and reduce the appearance of scars. I came across InviCible Scars and was impressed by the information available online, the fact that it was developed by an actual plastic surgeon and the use of Vitamin C. I&#x27;ve been using it as is indicated and have so far seen great results!! Am so excited about this product because it really works and I can&#x27;t wait to tell all my friends and family about it!! Thanks Dr. C!!</li>
            <li> There were literally maybe 10 pumps of product in this container.  Very disappointed in this.  Would not recommend wasting your money on this.</li>
            <li> No obvious evidence that any improvements to my skin were noticeable. Not happy with the price, or product, packaging is attractive, however for the actual contents were minimal in compairison to the container. Followed as directed, however it did not last long and very surprised at how quickly it ran out. Wont buy again, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very little in the bottle. I have a large scar can&#x27;t tell you if it worked or not ,ran out of it before a week was up.(per instructions apply atleast 2 times a day.)I would expect a little more for the price you&#x27;re paying . But the product was smooth ,lightweight,&amp; did not stain clothes.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband in the hopes it would help fade a reddish/purple scar on his leg.  I read the PR about it and thought it sounded like something that might work.  Well, first off he said it wasn&#x27;t the easiest stuff to dispense from the container and there wasn&#x27;t all that much for the price either.  He applied it faithfully, but  it did not do a thing for reducing the red/purple of his scar. Too pricey for a product that did not do anything. Possibly it works for some, but not my husband&#x27;s scar.-RK</li>
            <li> What a rip&lt;br /&gt;Off!! It lasted 2 weeks. The container looks big but the actual content of&lt;br /&gt;Product won&#x27;t last more than 2 weeks!!! Very dissapointed!!</li>
            <li> This works on keloid scars and helps to flatten them out.  I was actually pleasantly surprised with the results.  You have to be persistent and put it on every day.  My keloid scars are now flattened and there is a slight discoloration and I&#x27;m using my Genes Vitamin E Cream on that.</li>
            <li> I had skin cancer and had 21 stitches and I think I waited too long to try this product, one year post op.  It&#x27;s been almost one month of using this product twice daily  and I see no results...yet.</li>
            <li> not to be the lone dissenter, but this had no effect on my acne scars. they&#x27;re definitely old scars, but i&#x27;ve been using a 2.5mm microneedle and i don&#x27;t think this cream improved anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i didn&#x27;t like the pump dispenser either. for how expensive this is, i&#x27;d DEFINITELY prefer a tube, because I can better gauge how much i have left, etc. it was too heavy, and I can&#x27;t access the last bit inside of the gigantic fortress of a pump thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my best results so far have been plain hyaluronic acid and Bio-Oil for working on my scars, which i&#x27;ve bought here on amazon!</li>
            <li> Expensive product, but not the best out there.  I saw few results, but at least it kept the scars from getting too red. No real visible scar reduction even after three weeks.</li>
            <li> I like it. It faded some  of my small scars on my legs, and they are not as noticeable as before.</li>
            <li> I had scar excision surgery on my upper arm close to my shoulder due to a car accident back in 10&#x27;. Due to this being a high tension area I was afraid the scar would widen again and be very obvious; fortunately, within about four weeks of excision once the scabbing was gone I started using invicible along w/ daily silicone sheeting (from circa I believe) and this scar is almost unnoticable. I&#x27;m realistic about the healing outcome of a scar and realize that it will never be 100% gone but I&#x27;m very satisfied w/ the way my scar looks after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish this review would let me add a pic because I know how it is to read reviews about scars w/ no visuals but all I can say is...if you have an untreated scar that you&#x27;ve already spent hundreds maybe thousands on to treat w/ unsatisfactory results..it definately would not hurt to give this a try, I did and I love my result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8 MO UPDATE: my scar still widened a bit and became noticeable again within a few weeks of excision and radiation. Was so happy and scar looked pretty dern good for those first few weeks but lemme tell ya...this product alone is not going to cut it for the large and deep scar that I have on my upper arm, maybe someone w/ a fresh small scar that even Neosporin can handle but not for deep hypertrophic. Had a consultation w/ another doctor last wk and he informed me the radiation i had which basically stops the growth tissue weakened my surrounding skin and helped w/ the widening instead of hindering the widening.</li>
            <li> Sooo I have not tried this on any actual &amp;#34;scars&amp;#34; except for the acne &amp;#34;scars&amp;#34; on my face and chest and I must say that after only a week and a half my skin is clearer. I use it after i wash my face which is like 3 times a day. I havent had any pimples pop up or anything and my skin almost kind of glows. I gave it 4 stars only because its kind of greasy.</li>
            <li> DO NOT ENROLL IN THE AUTO SHIP Program. I purchased the trial size from the invicible scar website and never recieved it. I contacted the company and the immediately shipped another one. I began to use it right away. Like one of the other reviewers said there is not much product in the bottle. It has a nice consistency but if you have alot of scars or if you have large scars the product does not last long.  I have now stopped using invicible scars because month after month I recieved charges to my credit card without recieving any product. The first month I contacted invicible scars and they told me that someone would call me back. That was in July and it is now September and I still have not recieved a return call. My original call was for them to actually send me the product since my card had already been charged twice. After no return call I contacted my bank and filed a dispute. The next month my card was charged again and I still had not received a shipment. I contacted them once again in August and I still have not received a return call. I again contacted my credit card company and filed a dispute. In September I AGAIN recieved a charge to my card without receiving the product.... and still no return call from the company. At that point my credit card company cancelled my card in order to prevent any more charges and it was a hassle waiting 7 to 10 business days to recieve a new card in the mail and then update my information in all of the differnt places where the info is saved..... I cant tell you if the cream works or not because the trial bottle only lasted two weeks and it wasn&#x27;t enough time to see any real difference. And although my card was charged 3 additional times I never recieved any more product.  However, no matter how good it works, its not worth the HORRIBLE customer service.  Thankfully I am one of those people who consistently checks my bank account. If not, there is no telling how much money they would have stolen from me by now.</li>
            <li> used a small amount for twice a day for 2 weeks and it was empty do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best product of its kind!  I have used several products for scar reduction, and this one is the best by far.  New skin irritations will heal VERY quickly with this product, and older scars and discolorations will take longer.  But there is definitely improvement in the older ones.  The product is slightly expensive, but it will last a long time if used sparingly.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The cream was great it soaked into the skin was not oily or greasy and didn&#x27;t sit on top of the skin all white like other products . I&#x27;ve only used one bottle and I believe it&#x27;s working but they say it takes 3 months to fade scars. I do notice a difference even though I have a way to go. Delivery was immediate I would recommend this product despite it costing more I believe it&#x27;s effectiveness and consistency is worth it. I will order a second bottle others were inferior.</li>
            <li> I had several deep lacerations on my inner arms and hands from an accident. They were 4 months old by the time I discovered this product. Before Invicible Scars, I had been using Neosporin, Mederma, Scar Away silicone sheets, Kelo-Cote etc and hadnt really seen much difference. They were still very red with little or no fading. I have been using this product for 1 month now and the difference is remarkable. Even after the first 3 days of using it twice a day as directed, I was able to see results. I took a photo then and was very hopeful for future improvement. I plan to take another photo tomorrow morning in the same light and will post both, then give monthly updates.    Besides applying this ointment, then only other thing Im doing is being very careful about keeping the area covered and away from sun so as not to let the scars darken.    Some of the smaller scars/cuts have already faded and are no longer visible, on others the redness has gone down significantly, and on some, you can see where the red is turning to white/silver.    I am still on my first bottle and use it twice a day religiously on 2 areas on my inner arms that are about 3 x 2.5\\&quot; in area. You dont need a lot - not even a full pump for it to cover the area.    The only room for improvement I can see is that I wish it came with some kind of cap or lid so it would be easier to travel with. In my medicine cabinet it is fine, but when I have had to travel, I end up putting it in a container so the pump doesn&#x27;t accidentally get depressed when in my cosmetics bag.    Update Dec 2014: So all my scars are now a silver color. I dont think I have noticed much improvements in the last 3 months. The first 6 months is when I saw the most improvement. The scars are still slightly raised and again, silver/white in color but they arent as noticeable as they were originally. Actually, no one comments on them at all anymore. I think to see any more improvements, Im going to have to look at laser scar therapy froma doctor. Ill keep using it till I hit the 12 month mark though just to see all it can do.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my scars.</li>
            <li> been using for a month and bottle almost empty but scar still here!! money wasted!!</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t seen any difference at all and I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 months everyday</li>
            <li> Used as directed for 8 weeks, three times a day, didn&#x27;t work on old scars. Very disappointed given the cost of the product.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but helped clear scars that the copper IUD birth control had caused me and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Now my skin is just as clear as it was before the IUD. Thanks!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine but very small</li>
            <li> It seems to work, and so why did I give it 1 star.  Well, the bottle is over 50 percent larger than it&#x27;s actual contents.  The solution probably only fills only 25% of the  bottle.  So as you see for 40.00 dollars, you don&#x27;t get enough product.  It was gone in only a few days.  My recommendation is to search for another product because at 40.00 dollars a day you will have to pay for 200.00 dollars worth for it to last 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seven weeks post abdominal surgery that left me with a long scar. Self conscious about how it will heal and look, my dermatologist recommended Invicible. So far, I have seen the scar settle quickly, and the redness go down, which gives me much hope for how it will look long term. I started using it about four weeks after surgery, and in the three weeks of using it as directed (twice daily) I am OK with the results - but I know it&#x27;s going to take time no matter what I do. It&#x27;s by no means a miracle cure, and I know the scar will never really vanish, but it does help. And, unlike others, I did not have a problem with the fancy bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a lot of research online, with doctors, friends and have tried other products, and found that Invicible is better - easy to use and apply, and not greasy or fragrant, and does not irritate. I tried Bio Oil but it left the scar irritated and redder than before. I also tried Scar Away silicone strips for a week, and found that if I used it as recommended (20-24 hours but removing and washing or replacing every 10-12 hours) it also created some irritation, but I also noticed that it reduced overall color and raising just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;ve settled on both Invicible and Scar Away silicone strips. I use Invicible in the morning and afternoon/evening, and wear the Scar Away strips overnight. So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this posting once I&#x27;ve used this system for a few months and let you know how it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> I purchased InviCible after my recent surgery because I&#x27;d seen first hand the amazing results. I&#x27;m a surgical nurse and my patients who had used the product were extremely pleased. I started massaging it into my scars twice a day at about three weeks after surgery. My scars are now significantly lighter and more smooth than before. I&#x27;ve recommended it to my friends and patients after surgery, and even to my brother for acne scars.</li>
            <li> Recently I suffered from multiple breakouts from hormone changes.  I&#x27;ve tried a couple different scar treatment cream and yet nothing compared to this one!!!  I can tell my acne scars started to fade away after a couple days of use.  I use it every day in the morning before I apply make up and in the evening after I clean my face.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and it makes most of my old acne scars go away.  I would highly recommend this one to those who looking for something to treat their acne scars!!!!  -----  J</li>
            <li> I used Invicible for about 3 weeks a couple times a day. It definately flattened and leveled off my scar/surrounding tissue in a few weeks. However, It has yet to reduce the redness so my scar is just as noticeable as before. My scar is small and I was veryyy conservative with the product and it has already run out. Since this scar is on my face I am going to order one more to see if I can even out the tone. If you are very concerned with how your scar looks I would give this a try. If not, I would not mess with this product since they hardly give you any (you will need multiple bottles).</li>
            <li> I purchased Invicible Scars based on the reviews here and elsewhere. I have old acne scars and a new one pops up whenever I get a zit. I&#x27;m very prone to scarring. I was hoping this was the cure I&#x27;ve been searching for, for so long. I&#x27;ve been applying it twice a day for the past 3 weeks and have noticed a subtle difference. They have faded a bit, but I am conflicted over this product. It&#x27;s $40 and only lasted 3 weeks! Not sure it&#x27;s worth the cost. Do I really want to spend over $40 a month on this product?? Still debating that.</li>
            <li> Save your money it dosent work. I had some pretty recent scars and it did nothing for them.</li>
            <li> I had a deep 2 inch cut on my thigh from glass. As soon as my wound healed, I dabbed on Invicible cream for maybe 3 months. It did a great job of making the scar less noticeable, I hardly can see it.</li>
            <li> This item is not cost effective.  The cream only lasts for one week. There was no noticeable change in one week.&lt;br /&gt;Refused to buy a second tube.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s recent surgical scar seems to be reducing in size and fading in color.  So far so good. I choose this product based on reviews I read, and my son thinks its working!</li>
            <li> This product combines silicone and vitamin C to reduce scar appearance. I use this in conjunction with the other products for scarring I got from Amazon. In additon my surgeon gave me vitamin E to apply to the scars as they heal.. I am seeing results, but it takes several months.. It has been 8 weeks since my surgery, I am happy with the progress to date.</li>
            <li> After 2.5 months unfortunately this product has not made any difference on a 8 month old scar (at the time I started the use of this product).</li>
            <li> I purchased Invicible Scars to treat acne scars/ small surgery scars (1/4 of an inch long) and the small dark spots on my face. I used as directed and finished the whole container. Nothing changed. It was a complete waste of money. I saw no improvement whatsoever. My dark spots are still there. My other scars did not change and did not even lighten the slightest bit. I thought this product was promising because of all the great reviews and the before and after pictures. I do not recommend this product and I am still on the search for a great scar cream that really works.</li>
            <li> It felt nice, it seemed like it was making a difference on the scar the first few nights, but then it stopped. Also, the packaging is horrible, a lot of it definitely goes to waste because you cannot open the container. Not worth the money, mederma is better.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this item but when i tried using it NOTHING came out of the pump!!  Brand new item (right out of the box) an the pump is broken!!  Now I&#x27;ll have to return it and wait for replacement.  SO DISAPPOINTED!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/26/12 UPDATE:  So I came back from vacation and a box was waiting for me with a replacement bottle of Invicible Scar.  The pump works perfectly and I have begun using product!!  Thank you for the replacement and am very impressed with your customer service!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this on new plastic surgery scars and haven&#x27;t noticed an improvement whatsoever after starting to use it. Moisturizers but nothing special, better off putting silicone strips or bio oil.</li>
            <li> I wanted to fade my acne scars, but this just did not work. They did not fade, and I actually think the cream caused me to break out. It also comes in a small container with a weak pump. Pros: it goes on smoothly and does not have a strong smell. Many people love it; I guess there&#x27;s always an exception.</li>
            <li> No difference what so ever....</li>
            <li> I bought this when my skin burned due to over application of a chemical peel &amp; left scars on my face. This cream has helped reduce the darkness. I have been using this just for three weeks &amp; scars have almost disappeared.</li>
            <li> Has helped fresh scars from deep cuts fill in and begin to fade over 2 months of use. Plan to keep using the product in hopes of continued improvement. Also good for covering up bad scars as they heal.</li>
            <li> I had a bad accident that caused a huge cut above my lip last FEB.. I used this product, as well as cared for the wound as my DR. suggested. Now my scar is not very noticeable, and covers well with makeup if needed.</li>
            <li> Works well, but not sure it&#x27;s worth ~$39.</li>
            <li> So far this product has not worked well. So far it has only reduced the redness. Also a very greasy product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I saw a difference. I tried it for acne scars and it ended up clogging my pores and causing a new blemishes.  I will save it for some new scar and will update my review at that time.</li>
            <li> I am dark skin women who have been using this product for two month. I have seen a huge difference. I use it three times a day as prescibed. Thank you Dr. C&#x27;s!!!</li>
            <li> I had some surgery on my face and I am using this every day.  It is helping the scar to heal and disappear!</li>
            <li> Not working.  I have finished the whole battle and my scar did not fade at all!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used Invicible Scar Cream multiple times over the past few years, and I have always been impressed with its results.  Within a week, the contrast between the scar tissue and my regular skin has decreased, making the scar less visible.  It rubs in easily and has a nice feel.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This smells good and it feels very silky on my skin, but it has not done anything for my issues.</li>
            <li> Used the entire bottle and didn&#x27;t notice any reduction. Tried mederma, bio-oil and vitamin E. Nothing worked. Had to get steroid injections. That worked. Can&#x27;t say this is a bad product as nothing else worked for me. Might help people who don&#x27;t keloid bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the cream 2-3 times a day for 10 weeks and I can see only a very, very, very slight improvement in the reduction of color in my scar but I was expecting a lot more improvement based on the pictures on their website. I&#x27;m not sure if the slight improvement I&#x27;m seeing is enough to make me want to purchase another bottle because it is expensive and the amount of cream you get is so little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I can order another bottle and if I don&#x27;t like it I can return it for a refund because their website says 100% satisfaction guaranteed or your money back. Maybe I&#x27;ll take them up on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update my review periodically as I use the product for a longer period of time to see if anything dramatic changes in my scar. Although I&#x27;m not too hopeful since I&#x27;m already 10 weeks in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 10-22-14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it has been another 8 weeks since I first posted my review and I have to report that since then absolutely nothing has changed with my scar whatsoever. I downgraded my rating from 2 stars to 1 star and do not plan on purchasing anymore of this product. However I will say that I had no problem returning the product and getting my money back since it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I have not seen much change on my scar. I am trying to give this product a few more weeks to see if there are lasting results for me.</li>
            <li> absolute crap. docent do anything.</li>
            <li> After my ex saw my post-surgical scars and gave me a really weirded out look, I decided to get rid of them by all means. I have several scars on my body, one of them is 3 yo, and the other two scars - one year old. I have treated them with contractubex at one point, but then gave up because it wouldn&#x27;t get absorbed immediately (it did work though). I have used invicible scar cream for only a week, but I&#x27;ve already noticed improvement. It doesn&#x27;t have an odor, and it gets absorbed pretty quickly. The 3 yo scar is getting less noticeable, and the edges are getting smoother. Definitely give this product a try! It works wonders. Also, if your scars are as old as mine are, try using this cream with a personal microderm.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> I only write reviews when I am totally over the moon about a product&lt;br /&gt;and want to share the good news with anyone who may possibly benefit from it. I am an African American woman of a medium to darker brown complexion and have been burdened with dealing with hyperpigmentation from little scrapes and scars mostly on my lower legs that take forever to go away or just don&#x27;t go away at all. I have been using this product 3 times a day for over a month and must say that it has been incredibly effective at diminishing the marks I&#x27;ve been trying to fade. I must add that the cream works significantly faster on newer scars but I am very optimistic that with continued + consistent use even the stubborn marks will continue to fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much better than any hydroquinone product in that it doesn&#x27;t lighten the area around the scar - just the scar itself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture and consistency of the cr&amp;egrave;me is great and absorbs into the skin immediately with no greasy residue. A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No smell at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump dispenser is very well designed (functionally + aesthetically)  and dispenses even the smallest amount quickly and easily.  I love how you don&#x27;t have to fuss with twisting a cap on an off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not clear as to whether or not the scars will return if you stop using it???&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it to anyone for use on newer hyper-pigmented areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will give an update in another month or two...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE Feb 25, 2013:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have modified my five star rating (if there were half stars I&#x27;d give it a 3.5) along with the content of my review to reflect the lack of effectiveness the ointment has shown on my older scars. Unfortunately the results were pretty insignificant. I went through both the smaller and larger bottle, applying at least twice a day with no noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> First of all, excuse me for my English because I&#x27;m Brazilian. I had a car accident and had to do a surgery which left a very large hypertrophic scar. I went to a plastic surgeon specialize in scars and he told me to use Kelo Cote and do others things. While not believing that Invicible Scars would work, I decided to try because of the others reviews. The cream has an easy absorption and the smell is almost imperceptible. However, after 3 days of use, the dispenser stopped working. So I could not even prove the efficiency of the product. I live in Rio de Janeiro, so nothing I can do but get frustrated with the quality of the packaging.</li>
            <li> My scar seems to be getting lighter.  Is it a result of the cream and massage or just time?  I will never know.  The product has no scent and is smooth going on. I am religiously putting it on twice a day as directed and the tissue is definitely less dense.  Because of massage or cream?  Recommended by surgeon as the ONLY product that works at reducing scars.</li>
