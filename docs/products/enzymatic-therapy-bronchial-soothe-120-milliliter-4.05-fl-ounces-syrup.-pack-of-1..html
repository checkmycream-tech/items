            <li>Best stuff ever!</li>
            <li>, when the Ivy Leaf got here I gave it to my son and I kid you not - he was better with that one dose!!!</li>
            <li>Very good.</li>
            <li>IT works great.  </li>
            <li>Great product for helping ease asthma symptoms without steroids</li>
            <li>Great</li>
            <li>This syrup works great.</li>
            <li>Bronchial soothe has been a great solution to stopping the cough before it has a chance to become something requiring stronger prescription</li>
            <li>Worked well in my acute case.</li>
            <li>Used to be, when I had an acute attack, I would break out into a panic.</li>
            <li>This product took over a week to get here so the acute phase was passed by the time I got it, but my lungs still were hurting a lot</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had asthma for over 50 years, and this is the most effective I&#x27;ve found when I have throat irritation and coughing.</li>
            <li>It really worked great and they liked it</li>
            <li>Much better than the pills.</li>
            <li>I love - love - love this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not fully healed, but I do feel so much better after one use of this</li>
            <li>(This isn&#x27;t a substitute for medication, but more a preventative or</li>
            <li>once you know it works for you be sure to order your refill ahead of time.</li>
            <li>Great Item Shipped fast works</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve asthma &amp;</li>
            <li>I had bronchitis a couple of years ago and have heard that once you have it, you&#x27;re more susceptible to getting it again.</li>
            <li>But for me I need more &#x27;help&amp;#34; when I get a cold/sick.</li>
            <li>An excellent product to relieve minor coughs.</li>
            <li>This seems to work pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful, natural product that really helps my breathing issues!!</li>
            <li>More effective if taken at first sign if distress.</li>
            <li>It works great with our 5 year old if he starts to get a cough.</li>
            <li>It works great with our 5 year old if he starts to get a cough.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and product was in good condition.</li>
            <li>This one is easy on the palate.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful and works for high altitude breathing issues as well as a natural reprieve for asthma or colds.</li>
            <li>The flavor is fine.</li>
            <li>After 3 days I can see a huge difference in the coughing.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the narcotic in months because I had such a great result with this.  </li>
            <li>It was recommended to me and I have found this natural remedy more helpful than most cough syrups.</li>
            <li>Worked better than prescription cough medicine and love that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Based on my first experience with Bronchial Soothe and the relief I have already experienced, I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li>and I really feel that I was able to keep my cough from settling into my lungs with this product.</li>
            <li>but WHAT it did sound exactly like was Croup.</li>
            <li>This medicine was really helpful in bronchial cough, in any irritation in throat at home, in traveling, works very quick.</li>
            <li>Beyond impressed, kind of shocked.</li>
            <li>And I love that it&#x27;s natural and not chemical.</li>
            <li>and she said we could put it right in the milk of the baby&#x27;s bottle and that worked well also.</li>
            <li>so I went online right away to compare the cough to whooping cough and</li>
            <li>I had an almost constant, deep cough that did not respond to the most popular OTC cough suppressant.  </li>
            <li>After taking Bronchial Soothe for the first time just a couple hours ago, right away the pain in my lungs began to subside and within minutes I hurled up a mass of frothy mucous from my lungs.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very much like COPD would be for humans.  </li>
            <li>I learned to keep some on hand.&lt;br /&gt;I am still using this at the first signs of congestion</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think oregano oil works better and is more lasting than Bronchial Soothe, but your experience might be different.</li>
            <li>My son first tried this syrup when living over seas and it worked well.</li>
            <li>It lasted almost exactly 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Next day, I felt quite a bit better</li>
            <li>so I use an Advair inhaler daily and Ventolin inhaler when my problems are more acute.&lt;br</li>
            <li>At the first sign of a cough, I give my daughter about 1/2 tsp of the bronchial soothe.</li>
            <li>I have been giving him a narcotic cough syrup for most of that time and the last 6-9 months it didn&#x27;t seem to be helping much.  </li>
            <li>Reviews, even on WebMD, were positive as to its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>Really seems to help in loosening chest congestion and enabling me to expectorate, with no ill effects.  </li>
            <li>This stuff worked as quickly and completely as you could imagine.</li>
            <li>Even though it only lasts an hour, I would still give it 5 stars because it&#x27;s effective for that hour and because it is a much more natural product than other cough medicines.</li>
            <li>This product really helped more than prescription medicines when I had two very long bouts with bronchitis and asthma.</li>
            <li>This product worked well for the whole family.  </li>
            <li>It is very calming.</li>
            <li>It just allows you the much needed break from the coughing, that prevents you from getting the rest you need.  </li>
            <li>Really like this product and will always keep it on hand.</li>
            <li>This product worked really well for me as an asthma patient , It helped me get the mucous out , you have to eat before you take it</li>
            <li>This really helps calm calm my coughs and open up my airways with out leaving me wired on steroids.</li>
            <li>Without taking any other cough medications, I was able to sleep through the night.  </li>
            <li>My lungs calmed down very quickly after the first dose.  </li>
            <li>, I wish the bottle was larger ..but other than that great product , will try the pills next time</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you try this product.</li>
            <li>Works Very well to clear breathing</li>
            <li>This is the only thing that will calm her cough long enough for her to be able to get some sleep.  </li>
            <li>so skip the red dye,extra sugar and the days/ hours of doses and get straight to the point with the real deal!</li>
            <li>bottle doesn&#x27;t last long, so you can go through it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>First heard of English Ivy from my flight surgeon.  </li>
            <li>It is ok for a very mild cough and cold symptoms.  </li>
            <li>It soothed my cough and my chest felt clear, as well as my nose.</li>
            <li>I have a 14 year old Yorkie that has had Chronic Bronchitis for 6 years.</li>
            <li>Both my 6 year old son and</li>
            <li>My 85 year old mother was taking antibiotics for pneumonia and her chest was not clearing up and the meds made her out of it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was during the hyped up whooping cough outbreak and like any mother I was in a complete panic.</li>
            <li>but it really wasn&#x27;t necessary.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural product for coughs and all my research led me to Enzymatic Therapy.</li>
            <li>We discovered that with my daughter that if we caught her cough early enough, it didn&#x27;t have a chance to develop into something more serious.</li>
            <li>, I took it 3 times a day as instructed on the bottle ( I&#x27;m 30 year old)  &amp; the bottle only lasted me 3 days</li>
            <li>It works good for soothing a cough after the congestion of a chest cold.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last very long, and that can be a problem if you don&#x27;t want to drag the bottle to work with you when pulling a full 8-hour shift.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He said there was some reports in the medical journals saying how it helps clear up bronchial fluid.  </li>
            <li>It really works and got me to the other end of walking Pneumonia last winter.</li>
            <li>It helps with mild bronchial inflamation from a mild cold and minimizes the throat secretions when having severe allergies.</li>
            <li>I find that this product does not eliminate a cough, but it does settle it down so it doesn&#x27;t cause spasm as much.  </li>

            <li> Bought more this year seems breathing the cold northern air makes my lungs hurt, this soothes them.</li>
            <li> I have a minor case of silicosis [which is by no means minor to me] that came on after one incident of breathing diamotaceous earth.  </li>
            <li> Never just a runny nose and minor symptoms.  </li>
            <li> taste and smell are not great, but my daughter is willing to take it</li>
            <li> It is expensive but worth it.  </li>
            <li> Use it in small dozes throughout the day, (intervals of 1 to 2 hours if possible) and your cough will cease.</li>
            <li> After two day of taking this, the tickle in my throat is gone and I can breathe without endlessly hacking.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bronchial soothe did not work when my daughter had allergies and was coughing due to the hay fever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My colds tend to quickly travel to my chest and I cough like crazy.</li>
            <li> So, last week, I really started to worry when the cold that I had turned into a cough and started moving to my chest.</li>
            <li> She gets the most horrible coughing spasms, causing a lot of lost sleep (for everyone) and major frustration for her.  </li>
            <li> &amp;that&#x27;s the only complaint I have</li>
            <li> Bronchial Soothe Provides some relief when your chest begins to feel tight.</li>
            <li> I was not able to sleep due to cough and asthma but after taking this syrup I can sleep well.</li>
            <li> I tried a little just to see what it tasted like and it reminded me of the Vick&#x27;s 44 my dad used to give me when I had a cough.</li>
            <li> the dosage is so little.</li>
            <li> It beats Robitussin hands down!</li>
            <li> I still coughed, but the cough was much less frequent, productive, not as deep and less violent.  </li>
            <li> I usually take a dose as soon as I get up and another at bed time.  </li>
            <li> I have a history of having a cold settle into my lungs for the long haul.</li>
            <li> I was using cough drops constantly as well as Mucinex when the cough got too bad.  </li>
            <li> This started after I had to begin taking heart medications and a bad case of pneumonia a little over a year ago</li>
            <li> Normally, natural remedies taste nasty.  </li>
            <li> My daughter gets wasted every time she gets sick.  </li>
            <li> I get a serious chest cold.  </li>
            <li> and it is not  overly expensive.</li>
            <li> A friend had given me some last year, tastes terrible but works, just hold your nose.</li>
            <li> So, I took probably 6 or 7 doses throughout the day, but I was at home, so this wasn&#x27;t inconvenient for me.</li>
            <li> I ended up taking a night time cold medicine to get some sleep.</li>

            <li> Sounds disgusting, but it felt like heaven.  </li>

            <li> An excellent product to relieve minor coughs.</li>
            <li> Worked well in my acute case.</li>
            <li> This is not a miracle product but it has given me  periodic relief to naturally open the breathing  passage. I have been a repeat buyer of this product.  It does indeed \\&quot;soothe\\&quot; the throat and it is not  overly expensive. I buy it to soothe, not to deal  with a chronic ailment.</li>
            <li> I battle with chronic asthma. Used to be, when I had an acute attack, I would break out into a panic. My herbalist turned me on to this product when I was in dire straits. It took one dose for me to start breathing well again. Now I keep it in my herb cabinet at all times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had asthma for over 50 years, and this is the most effective I&#x27;ve found when I have throat irritation and coughing.</li>
            <li> This is the best cough medicine I have ever used.  It beats Robitussin hands down!</li>
            <li> Much better than the pills.</li>
            <li> I love - love - love this. Works everytime.</li>
            <li> This product worked well for the whole family.  It seemed to reduce symptoms and speed the healing process.  Normally, natural remedies taste nasty.  This one is easy on the palate.</li>
            <li> I had an almost constant, deep cough that did not respond to the most popular OTC cough suppressant.  English Ivy extract was suggested by a knowledgeable friend and I bought this product immediately.  My lungs calmed down very quickly after the first dose.  I still coughed, but the cough was much less frequent, productive, not as deep and less violent.  I was amazed.  Without taking any other cough medications, I was able to sleep through the night.  I did research English Ivy extract before purchasing.  Reviews, even on WebMD, were positive as to its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I have a 14 year old Yorkie that has had Chronic Bronchitis for 6 years. It&#x27;s very much like COPD would be for humans.  I have been giving him a narcotic cough syrup for most of that time and the last 6-9 months it didn&#x27;t seem to be helping much.  After some research I found Ivy leaf syrup.  It was supposed to be helpful for coughs and I decided to try it. I couldn&#x27;t believe the results we got with it.  His cough stopped within 5-10 minutes and stayed gone for 3-4 hours. I haven&#x27;t used the narcotic in months because I had such a great result with this.  I won&#x27;t be without it in the house.</li>
            <li> I have a minor case of silicosis [which is by no means minor to me] that came on after one incident of breathing diamotaceous earth.  The pain in my lungs was terrible. This product took over a week to get here so the acute phase was passed by the time I got it, but my lungs still were hurting a lot and I just gave it a try.  After taking Bronchial Soothe for the first time just a couple hours ago, right away the pain in my lungs began to subside and within minutes I hurled up a mass of frothy mucous from my lungs.  Sounds disgusting, but it felt like heaven.  I&#x27;m not fully healed, but I do feel so much better after one use of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on my first experience with Bronchial Soothe and the relief I have already experienced, I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, natural product that really helps my breathing issues!!</li>
            <li> This product really helped more than prescription medicines when I had two very long bouts with bronchitis and asthma. (I used it in conjunction with prescriptions.)  I learned to keep some on hand.&lt;br /&gt;I am still using this at the first signs of congestion and/or if I have strep throat, just as needed. (This isn&#x27;t a substitute for medication, but more a preventative or supplement.)&lt;br /&gt;A bottle doesn&#x27;t last long, so you can go through it pretty quickly. Also one delivery took around 10 days, so once you know it works for you be sure to order your refill ahead of time.</li>
            <li> Bronchial Soothe Provides some relief when your chest begins to feel tight. More effective if taken at first sign if distress. It doesn&#x27;t last very long, and that can be a problem if you don&#x27;t want to drag the bottle to work with you when pulling a full 8-hour shift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think oregano oil works better and is more lasting than Bronchial Soothe, but your experience might be different.</li>
            <li> Works Very well to clear breathing</li>
            <li> This product gets the mucus out of your lungs and helps your cough. It really works and got me to the other end of walking Pneumonia last winter. I am stocking up. Anytime you have a sniffle that leaks into your lungs for any reason it works wonders.  It is very calming.</li>
            <li> My daughter gets wasted every time she gets sick.  She gets the most horrible coughing spasms, causing a lot of lost sleep (for everyone) and major frustration for her.  This is the only thing that will calm her cough long enough for her to be able to get some sleep.  Like another one said, it&#x27;s not a miracle product, in that it will cure your ailment.  It just allows you the much needed break from the coughing, that prevents you from getting the rest you need.  Not even regular cough medicine helps like this does.  And I love that it&#x27;s natural and not chemical.</li>
            <li> First heard of English Ivy from my flight surgeon.  He said there was some reports in the medical journals saying how it helps clear up bronchial fluid.  SO I tried this.  IT works great.  Took about 5 days.  Both my 6 year old son and I are cleared up.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by someone whose cough was helped. However, it did not help in my case with bronchial problems.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over two years after doing intensive research on a homeopathic syrup from Germany - which I used prior to finding this one in the United States.  Use it in small dozes throughout the day, (intervals of 1 to 2 hours if possible) and your cough will cease.</li>
            <li> Great product for helping ease asthma symptoms without steroids</li>
            <li> My naturopath prescribed this for my grandchildren to soothe the cough and get the mucous up. It really worked great and they liked it and she said we could put it right in the milk of the baby&#x27;s bottle and that worked well also. Really like this product and will always keep it on hand.</li>
            <li> I find that this product does not eliminate a cough, but it does settle it down so it doesn&#x27;t cause spasm as much.  If you&#x27;ve got recurrent respiratory cough, I&#x27;d recommend you talk to your doctor about adding this product to your medicine cabinet.  It was recommended to me and I have found this natural remedy more helpful than most cough syrups.</li>
            <li> Very good.I was not able to sleep due to cough and asthma but after taking this syrup I can sleep well.</li>
            <li> Great Item Shipped fast works Great</li>
            <li> This product worked really well for me as an asthma patient , It helped me get the mucous out , you have to eat before you take it or you will get nauseous , I took it 3 times a day as instructed on the bottle ( I&#x27;m 30 year old)  &amp; the bottle only lasted me 3 days &amp;that&#x27;s the only complaint I have , I wish the bottle was larger ..but other than that great product , will try the pills next time</li>
            <li> I have a history of having a cold settle into my lungs for the long haul. This stuff worked as quickly and completely as you could imagine. Beyond impressed, kind of shocked.</li>
            <li> This syrup works great. My colds tend to quickly travel to my chest and I cough like crazy. After two day of taking this, the tickle in my throat is gone and I can breathe without endlessly hacking. I will definitely keep this around for future colds.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful and works for high altitude breathing issues as well as a natural reprieve for asthma or colds. Been using it for years. Have a cold and have gone through 5 bottles!</li>
            <li> My 85 year old mother was taking antibiotics for pneumonia and her chest was not clearing up and the meds made her out of it. She started taking the bronchial soothe and her chest cleared up with out any side effects. I recommend this product for anyone suffering with bronchial issues. We keep mom stocked with it.</li>
            <li> My son first tried this syrup when living over seas and it worked well. It helps with mild bronchial inflamation from a mild cold and minimizes the throat secretions when having severe allergies.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve asthma &amp; I&#x27;m allergic to albuterol. This really helps calm calm my coughs and open up my airways with out leaving me wired on steroids.</li>
            <li> My son woke up in the middle of the night with what I later Googled to be Croup cough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was during the hyped up whooping cough outbreak and like any mother I was in a complete panic. I had never heard of Croup. It was maybe 2 am so I went online right away to compare the cough to whooping cough and thankfully that wasn&#x27;t it but WHAT it did sound exactly like was Croup. I looked up what Croup was and how to treat it which is when I found the Ivy Leaf remedy. I ordered through 1 day shipping on Amazon and it was here the following day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; We did a steam treatment immediately, for comfort that night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW, when the Ivy Leaf got here I gave it to my son and I kid you not - he was better with that one dose!!! I  continued him on the liquid for the next 2 days but it really wasn&#x27;t necessary. The cough subsided &amp; he was back to running a muck. I now turn to ONLY this brand Ivy Leaf whenever there&#x27;s a cough in my house and it works the same way every time. I bought 2 bottles this time because we seem to run out at inconvenient times! I tried a little just to see what it tasted like and it reminded me of the Vick&#x27;s 44 my dad used to give me when I had a cough. I can say with conviction -THIS IS WHAT VICK&#x27;S IS &#x27;TRYING&#x27; TO BE so skip the red dye,extra sugar and the days/ hours of doses and get straight to the point with the real deal!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural product for coughs and all my research led me to Enzymatic Therapy. It works great with our 5 year old if he starts to get a cough. Soothes the bronchial passage and soothes coughs! I highly recommend you try this product. It works great with our 5 year old if he starts to get a cough.</li>
            <li> I had bronchitis a couple of years ago and have heard that once you have it, you&#x27;re more susceptible to getting it again. So, last week, I really started to worry when the cold that I had turned into a cough and started moving to my chest. I found an article that said that Ivy Leaf Extract can help prevent bronchitis, so I figured I&#x27;d try it. I found this product, which contains ivy leaf and gave it a whirl. I took the recommended dosage and it worked almost instantly. It soothed my cough and my chest felt clear, as well as my nose. It lasted almost exactly 1 hour. So, I took probably 6 or 7 doses throughout the day, but I was at home, so this wasn&#x27;t inconvenient for me. Then, at night, I took a dose, fell asleep and woke up an hour later coughing. I ended up taking a night time cold medicine to get some sleep. Next day, I felt quite a bit better and I really feel that I was able to keep my cough from settling into my lungs with this product. Even though it only lasts an hour, I would still give it 5 stars because it&#x27;s effective for that hour and because it is a much more natural product than other cough medicines. I will keep some on hand for the future.</li>
            <li> This medicine was really helpful in bronchial cough, in any irritation in throat at home, in traveling, works very quick.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me. Oh well....</li>
            <li> I have a chronic cough that brings up a lot of phlegm.  This started after I had to begin taking heart medications and a bad case of pneumonia a little over a year ago did not help the situation.  I was using cough drops constantly as well as Mucinex when the cough got too bad.  I had two upper respiratory infections in about 8 weeks this spring.  I saw this product and decided to try it.  It is expensive but worth it.  I usually take a dose as soon as I get up and another at bed time.  Those were the very worst times for me coughing up a lot of phlegm.  After 3 days I can see a huge difference in the coughing.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my cough. I had tightness in chest from mucus buildup from a virus. Did not break up the congestion.</li>
            <li> It works good for soothing a cough after the congestion of a chest cold.</li>
            <li> This seems to work pretty good.  I&#x27;ve only had to use it once.  Shipping was fast and product was in good condition.</li>
            <li> Really seems to help in loosening chest congestion and enabling me to expectorate, with no ill effects.  The flavor is fine.</li>
            <li> I have asthma so I use an Advair inhaler daily and Ventolin inhaler when my problems are more acute.&lt;br /&gt;Whenever I catch a cold I get a serious chest cold.  Never just a runny nose and minor symptoms.  I thought this Bronchial Soothe Enzymatic therapy might help without using an over-the-counter cough syrup to help my breathing and loosen mucus.  It is ok for a very mild cough and cold symptoms.  But for me I need more &#x27;help&amp;#34; when I get a cold/sick.</li>
            <li> A friend had given me some last year, tastes terrible but works, just hold your nose. Bought more this year seems breathing the cold northern air makes my lungs hurt, this soothes them.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever! Worked better than prescription cough medicine and love that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> At the first sign of a cough, I give my daughter about 1/2 tsp of the bronchial soothe. The dosage for her age is actually 1 tsp. I&#x27;ve found that 1/2 tsp for her is enough. By the next day the cough has gone away. We discovered that with my daughter that if we caught her cough early enough, it didn&#x27;t have a chance to develop into something more serious. Bronchial soothe has been a great solution to stopping the cough before it has a chance to become something requiring stronger prescription medicine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bronchial soothe did not work when my daughter had allergies and was coughing due to the hay fever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste and smell are not great, but my daughter is willing to take it anyways bc she knows it takes the cough away and bc the dosage is so little. I give it to her in a syringe so she doesn&#x27;t have to smell it before she has it.</li>
            <li> seems to work. Will get another one.</li>
