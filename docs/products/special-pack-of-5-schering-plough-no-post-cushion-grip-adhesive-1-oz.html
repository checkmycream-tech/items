            <li>GREAT PRODUCT FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE the product</li>
            <li>I have used Cushion Grip for many years.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, but I can&#x27;t understand why the price almost tripled in 6 months.  </li>
            <li>He is able to eat better again with his dentures.</li>
            <li>It has made me feel more confident when smiling.</li>
            <li>This is the next best thing, and it is affordable.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to buy this at Wal-Mart, now I have to order it on line.</li>
            <li>I had my dentures relined to insure better holding after many tries.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>this product I have used for years and now can no longer be found in stores in my area, so glad I can still get it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, but I could get it cheeper at the drug store, who I might add no longer</li>
            <li>It  seams to disintegrate more easily than it use to.</li>
            <li>Cushion grip helps them fit better and even helps to prevent sores from my dentures moving by holding them better in place.</li>
            <li>This is a good product if your dentures don&#x27;t quite fit right</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT FOR LOOSE DENTURES IS THE BEST</li>
            <li>AND i THINK IT IS THE BEST FOR A LOOSE DENTURE</li>
            <li>I sure hope it continues to be available.  </li>
            <li>I have some ill-fitting top dentures, and this makes them secure for me.</li>
            <li>Compared to other this does the best job for me.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and lasts up to a week for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It holds like nothing else I have ever tried and so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Cushion grip is working fine for my husband.  </li>
            <li>Easy way to get your dentures to fit correctly</li>
            <li>I have found it very easy to use and had no problems even the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Given the speed by which my gums have shrunk, Cushion Grip has represented the most convenient and economical solution for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>but I would not count on it alone to keep my lowers secure.</li>
            <li>and it is still great the next day.  </li>
            <li>But if I want it while it is still available, I guess I&#x27;ll have to pay the price.</li>
            <li>and I had to use my spare which didn&#x27;t fit well.</li>
            <li>Absolutely indispensable....</li>
            <li>I like the way it makes my dentures fit so smooth -</li>
            <li>but he was very happy to get a few tubes of it.</li>
            <li>I find that cushion grip helps me with the fit of my dentures.  </li>
            <li>I should get them refitted, but this, for me, is a lot better right now.</li>
            <li>It is definitely more of a fast, convenient, temporary reline</li>
            <li>to havon hand recived in perfect condition and would buy again when neded same product as bought locally for much higher price when you can find it</li>
            <li>I use two little dabs of denture cream on my bottom dentures after drying them and that works great too.  </li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t be possible without this amazing product.</li>
            <li>After reading all the great reviews, I purchased Cushion Grip from Amazon early on in my denture experience and it has been if not a life saver for me, a definite &#x27;pride saver&#x27; as I cannot see the dentist twice a month.</li>
            <li>In addition to closely following the package directions, I recommend having a blow dryer handy until you become accustomed to the application.</li>
            <li>This product not only protected a very sore spot from having used another product but it feels good and works.</li>
            <li>It did that far better than than the impressions</li>
            <li>, I find that if you get the tube warm enough it will spread easy, it holds all day long, all day strong, I have gotten use to using my (I am a brand new denture user) dentures a lot more easier by using the cushion grip.</li>
            <li>You may not spread it quite right</li>
            <li>Because I&#x27;ve had practice, I rarely have to do that any longer; I am able to properly apply and shape the substance to my denture in a matter of seconds.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile I use tooth paste &amp; brush my dentures, making sure they are clean &amp; dry.</li>
            <li>Thank You Very Much....</li>
            <li>: Very fast temporary reline once you get used to it.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The tube must be warmed in a cup of hot water before squeezing the substance out at which time in comes out with ease in one piece.</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>this also burns when I first insert it in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I love Cushion Grip and only wish the company would keep in making it!</li>
            <li>it was better but still sore especially when they tilt or slip.</li>
            <li>That happened to me first time</li>
            <li>I am so glad I could finally buy this Cushion Grip again.</li>
            <li>First of all it is NOT an adhesive, if that&#x27;s what you really want look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Prevents the friction and gum soreness from loose fitting dentures.</li>
            <li>Sure beats loose dentures.  </li>
            <li>Before I became skilled enough to make the application quickly, sometimes it would cool down faster than I could shape the pliable rubber-like substance into my denture.</li>
            <li>The outcome is much like a reline from the dentist.</li>
            <li>After I read reviews from users I learned everyone&#x27;s  tricks to make it even easier to use and that I could use each applications much longer than it says on the box.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much.  </li>
            <li>When I decided to try on line, I ran across Schering Plough with 5 tubes of Cushion Grip at a reasonable price, so just had to buy it.  </li>
            <li>Really helps to take up the slack.</li>
            <li>so it holds better to stop slipping</li>
            <li>This product works &amp; works very well &amp; it lasts a lot longer than stated by the mfg.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve read this far be sure to read reviews similar to mine.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s quick and easy and no pasty mess.</li>
            <li>Works better than any other product I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>This product has no nasty taste like other denture grips.  </li>
            <li>I have tried Polygrip,SeaBond and many other products that claim to hold denture in place.  </li>
            <li>wished it held better they still are loose fitting.needs to be a little more sticky</li>
            <li>I clean it daily.  </li>
            <li>I had full extractions and began wearing upper and lower dentures 6 months ago at the age of 47.</li>
            <li>I wear full upper and lower dentures.</li>
            <li>If you did it right, cure time etc your dentures will fit tight &amp; hold.</li>
            <li>me.&lt;br /&gt;I expect to do business here for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making Cushion Grip available.</li>
            <li>Must be careful to use only on dry dentures, but overall very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>My order was delivered very quickly and included such clear and concise directions.  </li>
            <li>so a little more cure time &amp; all was well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>kind of hard to get it to spread onto the dentures however</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without my Cushion Grip.  </li>
            <li>WHEN YOU CAN&#x60;T AFFORD A NEW ONE</li>
            <li>This is a product used by a family member for many years and is the ONLY one she will use, even though all other products have been tried.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time once it is applied - worth getting.</li>
            <li>I reline my dentures twice a week , (partial or full plate) and have a pliable lining that allows me to eat anything without any discomfort at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It conforms near to an exact fit &amp; after biting down its a vacuum like a suction cup.</li>
            <li>After getting upper dentures near three months ago my gums had two very sore spots.</li>
            <li>My soft re-lines by the dentist held up two weeks, max.</li>
            <li>I use this as my signal to remove the old Cushion Grip and apply</li>
            <li>BUT  the price has gone tooooooo far out of sight to ever buy again</li>
            <li>I also feel the cost is above too much.</li>
            <li>: The grip does burn the gums for the first 2 or 3 minutes, but this was less intense for me over time.</li>
            <li>Easy to remove in one piece (run cold water over your plate for easy removal or</li>
            <li>My dentures were pretty loose, now the problem is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just like a soft reline only you don&#x27;t have to rely on the dentist to make the adjustments.</li>
            <li>I say gel but its barely liquid.</li>
            <li>Something that is pliable, can be spread inside your dentures yet soft enough to conform to your gums.</li>
            <li>My dentures have never fit right.  </li>
            <li>I cleaned and dried dentures first time</li>
            <li>I went back to conventional adhesives and they work very well.</li>
            <li>If you do choose to leave the reline in more than a few days, you may start to notice sharp edges because the product becomes harder.</li>

            <li> First of all it is NOT an adhesive, if that&#x27;s what you really want look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Prevents the friction and gum soreness from loose fitting dentures.</li>
            <li> Sure beats loose dentures.  </li>
            <li> Before I became skilled enough to make the application quickly, sometimes it would cool down faster than I could shape the pliable rubber-like substance into my denture.</li>
            <li> The outcome is much like a reline from the dentist.</li>
            <li> After I read reviews from users I learned everyone&#x27;s  tricks to make it even easier to use and that I could use each applications much longer than it says on the box.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much.  </li>
            <li> When I decided to try on line, I ran across Schering Plough with 5 tubes of Cushion Grip at a reasonable price, so just had to buy it.  </li>
            <li> Really helps to take up the slack.</li>
            <li> so it holds better to stop slipping</li>
            <li> This product works &amp; works very well &amp; it lasts a lot longer than stated by the mfg.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve read this far be sure to read reviews similar to mine.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s quick and easy and no pasty mess.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other product I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> This product has no nasty taste like other denture grips.  </li>
            <li> I have tried Polygrip,SeaBond and many other products that claim to hold denture in place.  </li>
            <li> wished it held better they still are loose fitting.needs to be a little more sticky</li>
            <li> I clean it daily.  </li>
            <li> I had full extractions and began wearing upper and lower dentures 6 months ago at the age of 47.</li>
            <li> I wear full upper and lower dentures.</li>
            <li> If you did it right, cure time etc your dentures will fit tight &amp; hold.</li>
            <li> me.&lt;br /&gt;I expect to do business here for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making Cushion Grip available.</li>
            <li> Must be careful to use only on dry dentures, but overall very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> My order was delivered very quickly and included such clear and concise directions.  </li>
            <li> so a little more cure time &amp; all was well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> kind of hard to get it to spread onto the dentures however</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without my Cushion Grip.  </li>
            <li> WHEN YOU CAN&#x60;T AFFORD A NEW ONE</li>
            <li> This is a product used by a family member for many years and is the ONLY one she will use, even though all other products have been tried.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time once it is applied - worth getting.</li>
            <li> I reline my dentures twice a week , (partial or full plate) and have a pliable lining that allows me to eat anything without any discomfort at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It conforms near to an exact fit &amp; after biting down its a vacuum like a suction cup.</li>
            <li> After getting upper dentures near three months ago my gums had two very sore spots.</li>
            <li> My soft re-lines by the dentist held up two weeks, max.</li>
            <li> I use this as my signal to remove the old Cushion Grip and apply</li>
            <li> BUT  the price has gone tooooooo far out of sight to ever buy again</li>
            <li> I also feel the cost is above too much.</li>
            <li> : The grip does burn the gums for the first 2 or 3 minutes, but this was less intense for me over time.</li>
            <li> Easy to remove in one piece (run cold water over your plate for easy removal or</li>
            <li> My dentures were pretty loose, now the problem is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just like a soft reline only you don&#x27;t have to rely on the dentist to make the adjustments.</li>
            <li> I say gel but its barely liquid.</li>
            <li> Something that is pliable, can be spread inside your dentures yet soft enough to conform to your gums.</li>
            <li> My dentures have never fit right.  </li>
            <li> I cleaned and dried dentures first time</li>
            <li> I went back to conventional adhesives and they work very well.</li>
            <li> If you do choose to leave the reline in more than a few days, you may start to notice sharp edges because the product becomes harder.</li>
            <li> it creates a vacuum.</li>
            <li> If it cools down and loses its pliability before you&#x27;ve finished shaping it into your denture, a warm blow dryer over the denture for a few seconds will soften it back up.</li>
            <li> It peeled off dentures after 4 hours the second time it was fine for a few hours then slowly melted out the edges.</li>
            <li> I think some feel a burning sensation because they do not let it cure long enough.</li>
            <li> Love the product, hate that they have jacked up the price so high you can&#x27;t afford to purchase now.  </li>
            <li> Now it seems it is hard to get at a decent price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to work with because my dentures are so small (fit into a standard size with room to spare) .</li>
            <li> The box states that it lasts up to four days, but a single application has lasted up to two weeks for me.</li>
            <li> but they are very limited in what they do and only last for a few hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend to those with  loose lower dentures</li>
            <li> holds for about an hour comes loose.</li>
            <li> I will try the other persons idea of taking dentures out and leaving them out to dry overnight to see if that helps.</li>
            <li> So once cured put it in &amp; push back &amp; up, then bite firmly for about 15 seconds.</li>
            <li> I would purchase some other adhesive.</li>
            <li> I was given some by a friend whose husband died and I had such a hard time with it</li>
            <li> tried product once with very favorable results but then was unable to find at any nearby stores so ordered online.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t find this in stores, always order at least 5 boxes to last awhile, my mom doesn&#x27;t use anything else</li>
            <li> I always ended up with sores because the dentures would move and a tiny particle would get underneath and not be noticed until it was too late.  </li>
            <li> Then spread the gel &amp; let it sit for at least ten minutes.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this online, it felt watered down for some reason.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recommended for Dentures (and  there are other uses too)!</li>
            <li> My lowers broke in half</li>
            <li> I still recommend an adhesive like Poligrip to go along with this although you can use less.</li>
            <li> No sticky mess to deal with.</li>
            <li> It takes a little effort to remove them.</li>
            <li> (your mouth changes slightly everyday)</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Can not enjoy food when the denture slips, it hurts.</li>
            <li> , it was hard.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so hard to find.  </li>
            <li> My husband uses this and has had a hard time finding it.</li>
            <li> One application lasts at least three and sometimes four days.</li>
            <li> It was so much easier for me to buy it while out shopping, I was so disappointed when Wal-Mart quit carrying it!</li>
            <li> It is a very thick thermoplastic gel.</li>
            <li> When I found out how expensive it was</li>
            <li> I use the messy poi dent toothpaste crap and you had to keep applying the paste every couple of hours.</li>
            <li> it is on its way out find it too expensive to purchase</li>
            <li> I was finding it extremely difficult to find this product in stores in my area.  </li>
            <li> WTF?</li>
            <li> afraid to.  </li>
            <li> but HATE that it has become so expensive!</li>

            <li> My Husband  was Suprise that I got it that way. He didn&#x27;t think we would get it any more. He has&lt;br /&gt;Always bought it at Market Basket or Wakgreens.He couldn&#x27;t  find it. I said I&#x27;ll look it up on the Computer. Thank You Very Much....</li>
            <li> This product works the best of any others that I have tried, and this was an excellent price on this product.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT FOR LOOSE DENTURES IS THE BEST WE HAVE EVER USED AMAZON IS THE CHEAPEST PLACE TO PURCHASE IT&lt;br /&gt;  THANK YOU</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without my Cushion Grip.  It makes eating &amp; speaking so much more enjoyable.  My order was delivered very quickly and included such clear and concise directions.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Works better than any other product I have ever tried. Stays put for a good four days&lt;br /&gt;Will buy from again</li>
            <li> I had full extractions and began wearing upper and lower dentures 6 months ago at the age of 47. I am sure all denture wearers know what a humbling experience this can be at any age and I was no exception, it was hard. After the initial healing period, bone loss and gum shrinkage occurred rapidly. My soft re-lines by the dentist held up two weeks, max. After reading all the great reviews, I purchased Cushion Grip from Amazon early on in my denture experience and it has been if not a life saver for me, a definite &#x27;pride saver&#x27; as I cannot see the dentist twice a month. I have found it very easy to use and had no problems even the first time I used it. In addition to closely following the package directions, I recommend having a blow dryer handy until you become accustomed to the application. The tube must be warmed in a cup of hot water before squeezing the substance out at which time in comes out with ease in one piece. Before I became skilled enough to make the application quickly, sometimes it would cool down faster than I could shape the pliable rubber-like substance into my denture. That&#x27;s where the blow dryer comes in. If it cools down and loses its pliability before you&#x27;ve finished shaping it into your denture, a warm blow dryer over the denture for a few seconds will soften it back up. Because I&#x27;ve had practice, I rarely have to do that any longer; I am able to properly apply and shape the substance to my denture in a matter of seconds. The outcome is much like a reline from the dentist. Given the speed by which my gums have shrunk, Cushion Grip has represented the most convenient and economical solution for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Very fast temporary reline once you get used to it. The box states that it lasts up to four days, but a single application has lasted up to two weeks for me. Prevents the friction and gum soreness from loose fitting dentures. Affordable. Dependable. Easy to remove in one piece (run cold water over your plate for easy removal or grip).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The grip does burn the gums for the first 2 or 3 minutes, but this was less intense for me over time. I does not serve as an &#x27;adhesive&#x27; for me on my lower dentures as the tube suggests. I still need to apply an adhesive. If you do choose to leave the reline in more than a few days, you may start to notice sharp edges because the product becomes harder. I use this as my signal to remove the old Cushion Grip and apply new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the use of Cushion Grip has prevented some embarrassing moments for me as a newbie to dentures. I would give it 5 stars if it did not claim to be an &#x27;adhesive.&#x27; It is definitely more of a fast, convenient, temporary reline but I would not count on it alone to keep my lowers secure.</li>
            <li> Made my Mom so Happy!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best!  Once I learned to follow most of the directions I loved it.  It is so easy to use I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so hard to find.  I was given some by a friend whose husband died and I had such a hard time with it I threw it in the trash.  When I found out how expensive it was I tried reading the directions and tried again.  Then I couldn&#x27;t find it until the pharmacist told me to try Amazon.  After I read reviews from users I learned everyone&#x27;s  tricks to make it even easier to use and that I could use each applications much longer than it says on the box.  Now I use it for a month at a time.  Remember, heat is your friend when you put it on and take it off.  I can put it in my denture cleaner overnight and it is still great the next day.  I also take them off and rinse my dentures during the day if needed.  I use two little dabs of denture cream on my bottom dentures after drying them and that works great too.  READ ALL REVIEWS FROM AMAZON COMMUNITY.  I learned a lot and saved a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Works great! ! !  BUT  the price has gone tooooooo far out of sight to ever buy again</li>
            <li> My husband will not use any but cushion Grip. he says it is the easiest to use and works better than any thing else.</li>
            <li> since the company that produced this product has gone out of business I am deeply saddened- I also feel the cost is above too much. I paid under $10 for the same tube I just paid $25.  But if I want it while it is still available, I guess I&#x27;ll have to pay the price.</li>
            <li> I really like this product! Now it seems it is hard to get at a decent price ):</li>
            <li> tried product once with very favorable results but then was unable to find at any nearby stores so ordered online.  would not hesitate to recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> did not meet my expectations but only because of product noy sellers fault.</li>
            <li> This product has no nasty taste like other denture grips.  It lasts about four days or more depending on how you use it.&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I have been using this for years and it is the BEST THERE IS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for Dentures (and  there are other uses too)!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Just like a soft reline only you don&#x27;t have to rely on the dentist to make the adjustments. You can wait a longer time between appointments. Just make sure it is very warm when applying it and don&#x27;t overuse it.</li>
            <li> Denture wearers every where should try Cushion Grip. I use the messy poi dent toothpaste crap and you had to keep applying the paste every couple of hours. cushion grip last for days and keeps your dentures in place. it&#x27;s quick and easy and no pasty mess.</li>
            <li> i&#x60;VE HAD THIS BEFORE AND i THINK IT IS THE BEST FOR A LOOSE DENTURE WHEN YOU CAN&#x60;T AFFORD A NEW ONE</li>
            <li> it is on its way out find it too expensive to purchase</li>
            <li> This is a product used by a family member for many years and is the ONLY one she will use, even though all other products have been tried.</li>
            <li> Cushion grip relieves irritated gums and gives a cushioned  feeling to your dentures. It is easy to use and lasts up to a week for me.&lt;br /&gt;I have used sea bond and glue type products but they are very limited in what they do and only last for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;Cushion grip is the only one for me</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li> Great product. Great service. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE the product but HATE that it has become so expensive!</li>
            <li> I have used Cushion Grip for many years.  I reline my dentures twice a week , (partial or full plate) and have a pliable lining that allows me to eat anything without any discomfort at all.&lt;br /&gt;The price for these 5 tubes was very fair and free shipping made this an outstanding deal for me.&lt;br /&gt;I expect to do business here for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making Cushion Grip available.</li>
            <li> excellent brand with good discount. we have used this product for years. i am glad we were able to find online!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wear my teeth without this!  Walgreens has quit carrying it and ordering it here is the only way I can get it.  I sure hope it continues to be available.  It&#x27;s great stuff.</li>
            <li> Very good product  even if one has to redo after 4 days. But it works great. I recommend to those with  loose lower dentures</li>
            <li> Love this product, but I can&#x27;t understand why the price almost tripled in 6 months.  I can&#x27;t afford to buy it any more!</li>
            <li> Cushion grip is working fine for my husband.  He is able to eat better again with his dentures.</li>
            <li> My Mother and I have been using this every week for years, neither of us can afford a relining. This is the best price I have found, I receive the product when promised, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> holds for about an hour comes loose. I cleaned and dried dentures first time I used it.It peeled off dentures after 4 hours the second time it was fine for a few hours then slowly melted out the edges. this also burns when I first insert it in my mouth.  I will try the other persons idea of taking dentures out and leaving them out to dry overnight to see if that helps.</li>
            <li> This is a God send!! I have dentures until I can get my reline done this product not only holds them in place well but also&lt;br /&gt;Fills in the gap!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this brand and has used it for years.......</li>
            <li> My lowers broke in half and I had to use my spare which didn&#x27;t fit well. Read the reviews and ordered this.  It&#x27;s a little hard to work with because my dentures are so small (fit into a standard size with room to spare) . It&#x27;s a trial and error.  I ordered this on the 11/27 and received 12/3.  Thanks so much.  I will order this again from this company!!!!!!</li>
            <li> kind of hard to get it to spread onto the dentures however, I find that if you get the tube warm enough it will spread easy, it holds all day long, all day strong, I have gotten use to using my (I am a brand new denture user) dentures a lot more easier by using the cushion grip. I think I&#x27;ve found my new denture best friend.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t find this in stores, always order at least 5 boxes to last awhile, my mom doesn&#x27;t use anything else</li>
            <li> I have some ill-fitting top dentures, and this makes them secure for me. I have tried, pastes, powders, etc. I can&#x27;t afford to replace them at this time, and I have been using Cushion Grip. It has made me feel more confident when smiling. I would recommend to give this a try.</li>
            <li> I was finding it extremely difficult to find this product in stores in my area.  When I decided to try on line, I ran across Schering Plough with 5 tubes of Cushion Grip at a reasonable price, so just had to buy it.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I have bought this product for upwards of $7 a piece so when I saw a 5 pack for about $23 I bought it. This is a good product if your dentures don&#x27;t quite fit right (your mouth changes slightly everyday) I still recommend an adhesive like Poligrip to go along with this although you can use less.</li>
            <li> Love the product, hate that they have jacked up the price so high you can&#x27;t afford to purchase now.  WTF?</li>
            <li> My husband found that this product work best for him.  Will reorder in the future. He is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Really helps to take up the slack. 5 pack was a savings.  Sure beats loose dentures.  Will buy this stuff again.</li>
            <li> I have tried Polygrip,SeaBond and many other products that claim to hold denture in place.  I always ended up with sores because the dentures would move and a tiny particle would get underneath and not be noticed until it was too late.  This product not only protected a very sore spot from having used another product but it feels good and works.It actually works longer than 3-4 days before having to be changed .  I clean it daily.  Good luck,  use this product.</li>
            <li> I wear full upper and lower dentures. Wouldn&#x27;t be possible without this amazing product. I can eat anything I want with no problem! This product lasts weeks if not MONTHS, too! Absolutely indispensable....&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love Cushion Grip and only wish the company would keep in making it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t afford plastic surgery to fix my gums. This is the next best thing, and it is affordable. Pat Miller</li>
            <li> wished it held better they still are loose fitting.needs to be a little more sticky so it holds better to stop slipping</li>
            <li> When I ordered this online, it felt watered down for some reason. It didn&#x27;t work like the one cvs use to sell for 5.00. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> At last no oozing paste. One application lasts at least three and sometimes four days. A great product at a good value.</li>
            <li> Have used this as a cushion for several years.  Must be careful to use only on dry dentures, but overall very happy with the product. Thank You</li>
            <li> Easy way to get your dentures to fit correctly</li>
            <li> After getting upper dentures near three months ago my gums had two very sore spots. If your reading you know what its like. Can not enjoy food when the denture slips, it hurts. After 3 or 4 trips to my dentist it was better but still sore especially when they tilt or slip. I knew I had to take charge &amp; find something that worked.I bought a reline kit but have not used it. I also bought the gooey adhesives that&#x27;s a pain to remove, we&#x27;ve all been there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along come Cushion Grip &amp; after reading reviews I was real sure my search was over. First of all it is NOT an adhesive, if that&#x27;s what you really want look elsewhere. It is a very thick thermoplastic gel. I say gel but its barely liquid. In reality that is what you want. Something that is pliable, can be spread inside your dentures yet soft enough to conform to your gums. It did that far better than than the impressions my dentist made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I said its NOT an adhesive but it conforms so well adhesive is not necessary. It conforms near to an exact fit &amp; after biting down its a vacuum like a suction cup. That is what it does it creates a vacuum. It does not let air in so your dentures stay in place. My dentures were pretty loose, now the problem is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heat water on the stove, not boiling &amp; leave the tube in for 5+ minutes. Meanwhile I use tooth paste &amp; brush my dentures, making sure they are clean &amp; dry. Then spread the gel &amp; let it sit for at least ten minutes. You may not spread it quite right but you&#x27;ll learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I said 10 minutes because it needs time to cure. I think some feel a burning sensation because they do not let it cure long enough. If you use a lot, let it cure longer. In my case a tube will do my uppers 4 times. So once cured put it in &amp; push back &amp; up, then bite firmly for about 15 seconds. It takes a little effort to remove them. If you did it right, cure time etc your dentures will fit tight &amp; hold. If you did not allow enough cure time the thermoplastic might stick to you gums. That happened to me first time so a little more cure time &amp; all was well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve read this far be sure to read reviews similar to mine. This product works &amp; works very well &amp; it lasts a lot longer than stated by the mfg. Imagine that, how often does that happen? I got it from Pharmapacks well ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li> It  seams to disintegrate more easily than it use to. I used to be able to buy this at Wal-Mart, now I have to order it on line. It was so much easier for me to buy it while out shopping, I was so disappointed when Wal-Mart quit carrying it!</li>
            <li> My dentures have never fit right.  Took eight months to get them and never went back to the place that made them for lining...afraid to.  Cushion grip helps them fit better and even helps to prevent sores from my dentures moving by holding them better in place.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 20 years.  It is the best ---or I would purchase some other adhesive. I like the way it makes my dentures fit so smooth - No sticky mess to deal with.</li>
            <li> Compared to other this does the best job for me. Will not hesitate to buy product again. It does a great job.</li>
            <li> Following the instructions did not lead to results as advertised. I had my dentures relined to insure better holding after many tries.&lt;br /&gt;I used up 2 containers in an effort to make the product work. I went back to conventional adhesives and they work very well.</li>
            <li> this product I have used for years and now can no longer be found in stores in my area, so glad I can still get it.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.  I have reordered.</li>
            <li> This is my third order of Cushion Grip.  It is the best product of its kind and at a good price.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, but I could get it cheeper at the drug store, who I might add no longer carries it.&lt;br /&gt;I have to thinkk about it twice before I order again. Way to pricey..</li>
            <li> this is a good buy.good to havon hand recived in perfect condition and would buy again when neded same product as bought locally for much higher price when you can find it</li>
            <li> I am so glad I could finally buy this Cushion Grip again. I had used it for years and then the stores quit carrying it. It holds like nothing else I have ever tried and so easy to use. I can eat anything with this.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this and has had a hard time finding it. The price had gone up but he was very happy to get a few tubes of it. It lasts a long time once it is applied - worth getting.</li>
            <li> I find that cushion grip helps me with the fit of my dentures.  I had a friend try it and he did not like it at all.  For me it keeps my teeth from moving around.  I should get them refitted, but this, for me, is a lot better right now.</li>
