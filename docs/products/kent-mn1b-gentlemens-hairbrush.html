            <li>Kent brushes are without exception the best brushes available.</li>
            <li>It feels really good to brush your hair with this one.</li>
            <li>Exceptional quality and design.</li>
            <li>This is a great brush and the quality is easily seen and felt.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bristles are perfect for fine to medium hair and feel fantastic when running across my scalp.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably own a collection of Kent products soon.</li>
            <li>It is a great product and worth the money.</li>
            <li>I love my Kent.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
            <li>It is truly for gentlemen and more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered many and am extremely satisfied with each.</li>
            <li>Glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li>I think I got a faulty brush because too many bristles have fallen out.</li>
            <li>There, I said it. :-)</li>
            <li>so be sure to check for any defections.</li>
            <li>Have always been much more of a comb man than a brush fan, but after reading the many glowing reviews on Amazon thought I would give this brush a try (while also picking up some Kent handmade combs as well).</li>
            <li>wood grain is extraordinarily smooth and the side indentations make it very easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Overall it is a stunning beautiful brush and the pictures do it</li>
            <li>But other than that everything was great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beautiful, wonderfully crafted, from a great company, and will last long enough to pass on to my son and grandson someday.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend the investment in this purchase.</li>
            <li>wow amazing love love.</li>
            <li>This is this THE BEST BRUSH i have ever owe in my life hands down</li>
            <li>Just like my original one, the MN1B is built to exacting standards and the moment you pick it up</li>
            <li>This brush is amazing for short to medium length hair.</li>
            <li>I have used a natural bristle brush for many years</li>
            <li>Worth the price, very much so.</li>
            <li>The wood grain is so fine it barely feels like wood, and the color is beautiful, especially in contrast to the white bristles.</li>
            <li>Very high quality!</li>
            <li>This made a fine Xmas gift for my 28 year old son.  </li>
            <li>The quality of this brush is overall outstanding.</li>
            <li>Took awhile to get it as the post office lost the first one that was sent.</li>
            <li>Exactly as promised in the description.</li>
            <li>My hair is short and I am bald up top</li>
            <li>If you have a short hair style and fine hair, this brush is a must.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>It works great on my short African American hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The dark brown color of the wood looks very rich, and the contrasting white bristles add to the aesthetic appeal of this fine</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what it is, but it just feels so much better on my head in comparison to other brushes i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I had no idea the type of brush made that much of a difference, I&#x27;ve noticed my hair has more shine, is softer to the touch and my scalp gives off less dandruff during the day.  </li>
            <li>Bristles are a little harder than I expected but they do a great job massaging the scalp and brushing my hair easily.  </li>
            <li>and I really like this new brush</li>
            <li>A bit high priced but well made.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and one of life&#x27;s small, every day luxuries that just make things better.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have much use for it, but when I do I usually give a few extra brushes because it makes my scalp tingle and feel good.</li>
            <li>This brush is ok to start but after a week, it is no good.</li>
            <li>Brushes right though my beard with no snags making it feel softer and less scraggly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The quality of Kent brushes is immediately apparent.  </li>
            <li>I returned this product and I&#x27;m kind of skeptical about purchasing another one by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>Based off of my previous experience with this product, it would be kind of hard to recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>Very high quality bristles in this carefully crafted english hair brush.  </li>
            <li>There may well be other less expensive brushes that come close to the quality and feel of this brush, but to me its worth spending a little bit more when its something you&#x27;re going to enjoy using every day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bristles are pretty firm.</li>

            <li> Great product. Bought for my husband &amp; he loves it.</li>
            <li> Do not Buy .... $110 brush and bristles are falling out</li>
            <li> While you might rightfully say this is abit expensive for a hairbrush, to me, it is well worth it and one of life&#x27;s small, every day luxuries that just make things better.</li>
            <li> Great brush.  Bristles are medium firmness.</li>
            <li> Wonderful brush, well made and medium bristles, works great on head and beard. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love my Kent. Its the 5th Kent brush I&#x27;ve owned and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied. I&#x27;ll probably own a collection of Kent products soon.</li>

            <li> Exceptional quality and design. Like always you get that premium European feel and look. Product performs great. Hair and scalp with definitely benefit from using Kent products.</li>
            <li> A wonderful brush. I don&#x27;t regret a single dollar I paid for this. It&#x27;s beautiful, wonderfully crafted, from a great company, and will last long enough to pass on to my son and grandson someday.

And yes, they do are heads and shoulders above other brushes on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expensive?  Kinda.  But considering that you will have it for decades and use it daily, it is a bargain at the price.</li>
            <li> I thought I might have spent more money than I ought to for this hairbrush; but I was wrong. It is a great product and worth the money. My complements to the boar.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a Kent folks,  very nice</li>
            <li> I think I got a faulty brush because too many bristles have fallen out.</li>
            <li> This is this THE BEST BRUSH i have ever owe in my life hands down THE &amp;#34;BEST&amp;#34; in it&#x27;s  game wow amazing love love. Yes its very expensive but well worth. U know u deserve the best go out and get the best.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hairbrush.... I hated hairbrushes when I was a kid. How can I describe a hairbrush without sounding silly? It feels really good to brush your hair with this one. My hair is short and I am bald up top so I don&#x27;t have much use for it, but when I do I usually give a few extra brushes because it makes my scalp tingle and feel good. There, I said it. :-)</li>
            <li> I find this brush to be of the highest quality, if your serious about your personal haircare products then this is for you!</li>
            <li> Made a nice housewarming gift! Great!</li>
            <li> This is a great brush and the quality is easily seen and felt. The wood grain is so fine it barely feels like wood, and the color is beautiful, especially in contrast to the white bristles. Overall it is a stunning beautiful brush and the pictures do it no justice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regards to functionability, it feels great on the scalp. I don&#x27;t know what it is, but it just feels so much better on my head in comparison to other brushes i&#x27;ve used. It is medium in stiffness. It works great on my short African American hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brush did come slightly damaged but I didn&#x27;t notice it until after i started using it so be sure to check for any defections.</li>
            <li> Have always been much more of a comb man than a brush fan, but after reading the many glowing reviews on Amazon thought I would give this brush a try (while also picking up some Kent handmade combs as well). My hair and scalp had no idea what they were missing! Feels good in your hand, feels great on your head. There may well be other less expensive brushes that come close to the quality and feel of this brush, but to me its worth spending a little bit more when its something you&#x27;re going to enjoy using every day.</li>
            <li> Very high quality! My dad loves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bristles are pretty firm. So if your scalp is tender, be warned.</li>
