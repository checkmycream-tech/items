You should give it a try, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>

            <li> I can never have too much of this product. I&#x27;ve used it for years. Im a loyal fan of IC and always will be.</li>
            <li> I just love this product! It makes my hair soft, shiny and allows my wavy hair to be at its best. It doesn&#x27;t make it limp like some other conditioners do. This company does not test on animals and that was a big plus for me. It is hard to find a product that is not tested on animals that works as well as this one does. My hair looks very healthy and I would be lost without this product!</li>
            <li> I have been using  for years. Was Sick could not get out to buy locally. I use the IC finisher afterwards. On wet hair. Let it dry, sleep on it, brush my hair in AM. Maybe spoiled hair is finally easy to manage. No smell. Very important, to me.Shiney hair easy to control.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I am a loyal Fantasia IC product fan.  This leave-in and the Pure Tea Shampoo were my first introduction to the Fantasia IC product line many, many years ago.  I absolutely love this hair treatment and the way it makes my hair feel and shine.  It is loaded with healthy ingredients and designed to continue conditioning your hair after leaving it in to provide superior shine/sheen and encourage new growth.  I initially began using it when my hair was relaxed and not color treated.  I currently use it on my semi-permanent color treated below shoulder length natural hair.  The product is designed to work on relaxed, color treated, damaged, dry, bleached, and sun damaged hair.  Make sure you buy the 16 oz bottle which lasts longer.  I buy it now from amazon since my local Sally&#x27;s no longer carries.  This stuff really works!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years. It&#x27;s not oily, it&#x27;s light like water and it makes my hair feel soft and healthy.  An excellent product.</li>
            <li> excellent product received in a timely manner</li>
            <li> I ordered this Fantasia Leave In Treatment for my 90 year old Aunt. She has used it for over 20 years to volumize her fine hair and for her dry itchy scalp. I am a hairdresser and could not find it at any of my regular distributors. They had stopped carrying it. I was glad to see it on Amazon! My aunt was REALLY glad. It makes me want to try it on my own hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, excellent price very satisfied with the quality of the product. i plan to buy again any time soon.</li>
            <li> Fantasia IC gives my hair, body, bounce and shine that I don&#x27;t get with other leave in conditioners.</li>
            <li> Half of this product was spilled out of the bottle!&lt;br /&gt;Due to the bottle not being sealed.There was however a strip of tape on the top of the bottle that was not a factory strip of tape!</li>
            <li> Item received as described.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent if you have dry hair due to coloring or just using to much the blow dryer. Please dont think because is not expensive it will not work, I make that mistake and I was so wrong. I used to buy very expensive brands and fancy products for my hair and one day my hairdresser that comes from an small town in de desert , introduced this product . Im very please and I really recommended for people who has dry ends or damaged hair. this merchant has very good customer service.</li>
            <li> my husband using this IC for at least 15 years  he won&#x27;t be without it  he was sorry that local stores stopped carrying it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. I use it evryday. Keeps hair from getting the flyaways esplecially during winter when&lt;br /&gt;the air is dry due to the heater.</li>
