            <li>Im a very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I have never found a foundation that works better than theirs!  </li>
            <li>I love the way my face will not get oily when it&#x27;s on and just how it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m ruining my skin by having it on my face! &#x3D;  </li>
            <li>I just love it!</li>
            <li>Kind of orangey</li>
            <li>They product was fine!</li>
            <li>I love Mary Kay,</li>
            <li>I have used this for years and love it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I get better prices ordering from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite foundation brand.</li>
            <li>love MK</li>
            <li>Mary Kay has a very wide variety of colors and formulas that make it easy to fine the perfect product for anyone.</li>
            <li>But other then the wait, it is a good product and a good price</li>
            <li>Normally I love this product - as in &amp;#34;OMG, I finally found my perfect foundation,&amp;#34; but this time it seemed like it had been sitting around for too long</li>
            <li>I love Mary Kay products, but most especially their foundation.  </li>
            <li>This makeup has no smell, and has never irritated my skin, which is super hypersensitive.  </li>
            <li>It was great to find this product for so much cheaper here on amazon, with the same amount of quality that I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of using for years!</li>
            <li>For my skin color, I can use just a bit where I want on my face and it blends in nicely with the rest of my skin, so I only need to use a couple drops here and there, then blend in with a sponge and use a finishing powder.  </li>
            <li>i have tried many different foundation choices and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>The coverage is really good without looking heavy or caked on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m naturally quite pale and have a lot of difficulty finding foundation that matches my skin tone, but Ivory 100 is a great match for me.</li>
            <li>It covers nicely without giving an orange tint that is typical for foundation.</li>
            <li>Product was over 5 years old.</li>
            <li>Not heavy nor greasy.</li>
            <li>I would recommend Mary Kay to anyone who is not pleased with the foundation that they are currently using and are looking for an outstanding product.</li>
            <li>i really just thought this was average.</li>
            <li>Throughout the years I&#x27;ve received numerous compliments on my complexion and it really comes down to the Mary Kay Foundation.</li>
            <li>I have very light, thin skin and was tired of trying to find the right color match that didn&#x27;t look like a &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34;.  </li>

            <li> No reaction on my delicate skin and other products I have had reactions.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s slightly too thick.</li>
            <li> I received an empty box!!!!</li>
            <li> I was unable to buy from our local salesperson because of the prices.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn Mary Kay Foundation for at least 30 years</li>
            <li> not ideal for me</li>
            <li> So addicted to Mary Kay foundation, I might have to start selling it myself!</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how inexpensive the products were.</li>

            <li> They product was fine! just as described. I love Mary Kay, But i think it took 10-14 days to get here. But other then the wait, it is a good product and a good price</li>

            <li> I am on my third tube so I obviously believe in the product.  It offers thick coverage but if that is what you are looking for, that is what you will get.  I use it under my eyes for dark circles.</li>
