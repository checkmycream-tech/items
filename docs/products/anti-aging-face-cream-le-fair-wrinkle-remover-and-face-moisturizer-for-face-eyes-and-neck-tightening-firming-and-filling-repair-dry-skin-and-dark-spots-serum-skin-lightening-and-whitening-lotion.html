            <li>So far, I love this product!</li>
            <li>so i am always on the lookout for new and different products so when LE FAIR  anti-aging skin  was offered to me during a promotion for y honest opinion</li>
            <li>other than that, it is wonderful and does work really well.  </li>
            <li>I will NEVER pay the full price for it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves my skin nice and soft</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m loving the cream.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product and the personal attention I have received from the seller.</li>
            <li>so, I have really dry skin, and struggle finding good products for my face.  </li>
            <li>My skin was very recieptive to this and after a week&#x27;s use, I noticed my skin tone was even, any blemishes had cleared up, and my fine lines started filling in.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face and neck feeling so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>I am satisfied so far.</li>
            <li>the cream I put on my forehead had already absorbed in.  </li>
            <li>I love how it makes my skin feel so far.</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend this product, as it has helped my dry-combination skin become soft and smooth and lovely.</li>
            <li>but this formula seems to have just the right balance to keep my skin from getting greasy, while still keeping it moisturized and supple.</li>
            <li>and I tried it right away.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 32 years old and my comment is with some creams I can feel the moisture in my face when I apply for the first time, and eventually it works better..</li>
            <li>With most moisturizers my mineral foundation goes on too thick because there&#x27;s some kind of residue on my skin.  </li>
            <li>the first week using the cream</li>
            <li>so I can order more in the future.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I like to use a skin serum first the this cream.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>; Fair for a few weeks and trust me</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good moisturizer but too heavy for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had one deep wrinkle in between my eyebrows and it has really gotten a lot better.      </li>
            <li>I actually like it BETTER than my normal Olay.  </li>
            <li>and I can tell there is some sort of retinol or anti-aging properties because my skin feels a certain way when I apply retinol.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly and i love that because sometimes products have a hard time sinking into my skin because i&#x27;m oily.  </li>
            <li>I have to say this is a very high quality moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Feels super light going on and absorbs very well; no grease or residue that I find most moisturizers leave behind.</li>
            <li>I just finish the whole thing and did not see any difference.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need much to do the job.</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>It absorbs fast remaining a lot moisture on my skin.</li>
            <li>May indeed did not see much use yet.</li>
            <li>i got it fast and no damage.</li>
            <li>and this is very soothing.</li>
            <li>In addition, the moisturizer is non-greasy and goes on very smoothly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>Just smooth, as if there were nothing on it, but plump and supple at the same time.  </li>
            <li>Once I received it, I tried it that very night.</li>
            <li>have really disappeared.   </li>
            <li>not first time buyer :)</li>
            <li>The ingredients mention fruit extracts and other ingredients that usually have a distinct scent, but I didn&#x27;t pick up on any sort of fragrance from this product which is ideal for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It does not irritate my sensitive skin and seems pretty gentle.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t any better than all the other brands out there!</li>
            <li>I have been trying several creams and serums lately and this moisturizer is really great.</li>
            <li>the fragrance is also nice (smooth and faint scent).</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t read the super tiny information printed on the jar.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for the price and results.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the cream but for a couple days and can&#x27;t really comment one way or the other except to say that it goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling sticky or oily.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this product, will re-order and recommend far &amp; wide!</li>
            <li>I got this for my wife and so far she really likes it.</li>
            <li>It definitely helped with the moisturization of my skin right after applying it and it wasn&#x27;t greasy or oily at all.</li>
            <li>It soaks in quickly and then the surface of my skin feels dry.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and the lotion</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s early to tell how well it&#x27;s working, but I do have high hopes for it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t often wear makeup or use products on my skin because it is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I was actually very surprised by the consistency of this product.</li>
            <li>my face is very sensitive and this cream does not irritated it and dries my skin out</li>
            <li>I used a coupon code to get a discount on my first bottle and now I&#x27;m going to have to order a second.</li>
            <li>Two days ago I purchased this and on the first day I noticed a BIG difference, but for some reason could not believe it.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how soft and moisturized my skin was feeling, and just after one use!</li>
            <li>It really has helped my face out and also did NOT dry it out.  </li>
            <li>A small amount is all that&#x27;s needed, so it&#x27;s also nice that the jar will last a while.</li>
            <li>It was not an uncomfortable feeling at all, and was quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for a dollar or less using amazingdealsgroul.com.</li>
            <li>Way better than the super expensive things I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I really like anti-aging face cream I received, like that it makes my face so smooth am hoping it helps the wrinkles, I have only used it for a new days but think it is going to make a difference after using it a little longer,</li>
            <li>I have not used it long enough to see a significant improvement except  </li>
            <li>I just got this product and like it so far.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so soft</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Made my winter skin soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling so soft.</li>
            <li>so,so,so soft.</li>
            <li>WOW, what a product.</li>
            <li>They seemed more pronounces lately.</li>
            <li>product surprised me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes completely sealed.  </li>
            <li>Right away, my skin felt baby soft and very &#x27;airy&#x27;, because I&#x27;m so used to moisturizers making my pores feel clogged and heavy.</li>
            <li>It has more of a whipped texture instead of a thin, liquidy lotion-like texture similar to many of the other jarred moisturizers on Amazon.</li>
            <li>it not only got rid of my huge bags under my eyes but also my crows feet and numerous other wrinkles...</li>
            <li>The dry crack around my mouth had gone away by morning, so the moisturizing effects really work.  </li>
            <li>It dried quickly and isn&#x27;t sticky.</li>
            <li>It left my face feeling very, very soft.</li>
            <li>It has been 3 weeks now, and I have noticed a major difference.</li>
            <li>applied this to my face and notice that is is so light and just a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>Have only been using for 5 days but so far</li>
            <li>moisturize very well as i expected</li>
            <li>She has received numerous compliments on how young she is looking at 65 yo</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin with my lupus- so far absolutely no issues with that aspect.</li>
            <li>no dry spots.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No more laugh lines and the crease on my forehead is lessened, not gone</li>
            <li>I normally have very dry, flaky skin during the colder months, and I have been prone to breakouts (in my thirties!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice that this product did anything, but I have used it less than a month.</li>
            <li>that amount never works I will need more.&amp;#34; Since the jar was not huge I expected to empty the jar  very quickly</li>

            <li> so i am always on the lookout for new and different products so when LE FAIR  anti-aging skin  was offered to me during a promotion for y honest opinion</li>
            <li> other than that, it is wonderful and does work really well.  </li>
            <li> I will NEVER pay the full price for it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It leaves my skin nice and soft</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m loving the cream.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product and the personal attention I have received from the seller.</li>
            <li> so, I have really dry skin, and struggle finding good products for my face.  </li>
            <li> My skin was very recieptive to this and after a week&#x27;s use, I noticed my skin tone was even, any blemishes had cleared up, and my fine lines started filling in.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face and neck feeling so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> I am satisfied so far.</li>
            <li> the cream I put on my forehead had already absorbed in.  </li>
            <li> I love how it makes my skin feel so far.</li>
            <li> I highly reccommend this product, as it has helped my dry-combination skin become soft and smooth and lovely.</li>
            <li> but this formula seems to have just the right balance to keep my skin from getting greasy, while still keeping it moisturized and supple.</li>
            <li> and I tried it right away.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 32 years old and my comment is with some creams I can feel the moisture in my face when I apply for the first time, and eventually it works better..</li>
            <li> With most moisturizers my mineral foundation goes on too thick because there&#x27;s some kind of residue on my skin.  </li>
            <li> the first week using the cream</li>
            <li> so I can order more in the future.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I like to use a skin serum first the this cream.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> ; Fair for a few weeks and trust me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good moisturizer but too heavy for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had one deep wrinkle in between my eyebrows and it has really gotten a lot better.      </li>
            <li> I actually like it BETTER than my normal Olay.  </li>
            <li> and I can tell there is some sort of retinol or anti-aging properties because my skin feels a certain way when I apply retinol.</li>
            <li> It absorbs very quickly and i love that because sometimes products have a hard time sinking into my skin because i&#x27;m oily.  </li>
            <li> I have to say this is a very high quality moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Feels super light going on and absorbs very well; no grease or residue that I find most moisturizers leave behind.</li>
            <li> I just finish the whole thing and did not see any difference.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t need much to do the job.</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> It absorbs fast remaining a lot moisture on my skin.</li>
            <li> May indeed did not see much use yet.</li>
            <li> i got it fast and no damage.</li>
            <li> and this is very soothing.</li>
            <li> In addition, the moisturizer is non-greasy and goes on very smoothly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> Just smooth, as if there were nothing on it, but plump and supple at the same time.  </li>
            <li> Once I received it, I tried it that very night.</li>
            <li> have really disappeared.   </li>
            <li> not first time buyer :)</li>
            <li> The ingredients mention fruit extracts and other ingredients that usually have a distinct scent, but I didn&#x27;t pick up on any sort of fragrance from this product which is ideal for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It does not irritate my sensitive skin and seems pretty gentle.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t any better than all the other brands out there!</li>
            <li> I have been trying several creams and serums lately and this moisturizer is really great.</li>
            <li> the fragrance is also nice (smooth and faint scent).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t read the super tiny information printed on the jar.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for the price and results.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the cream but for a couple days and can&#x27;t really comment one way or the other except to say that it goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling sticky or oily.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this product, will re-order and recommend far &amp; wide!</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and so far she really likes it.</li>
            <li> It definitely helped with the moisturization of my skin right after applying it and it wasn&#x27;t greasy or oily at all.</li>
            <li> It soaks in quickly and then the surface of my skin feels dry.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and the lotion</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s early to tell how well it&#x27;s working, but I do have high hopes for it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often wear makeup or use products on my skin because it is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I was actually very surprised by the consistency of this product.</li>
            <li> my face is very sensitive and this cream does not irritated it and dries my skin out</li>
            <li> I used a coupon code to get a discount on my first bottle and now I&#x27;m going to have to order a second.</li>
            <li> Two days ago I purchased this and on the first day I noticed a BIG difference, but for some reason could not believe it.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how soft and moisturized my skin was feeling, and just after one use!</li>
            <li> It really has helped my face out and also did NOT dry it out.  </li>
            <li> A small amount is all that&#x27;s needed, so it&#x27;s also nice that the jar will last a while.</li>
            <li> It was not an uncomfortable feeling at all, and was quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for a dollar or less using amazingdealsgroul.com.</li>
            <li> Way better than the super expensive things I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I really like anti-aging face cream I received, like that it makes my face so smooth am hoping it helps the wrinkles, I have only used it for a new days but think it is going to make a difference after using it a little longer,</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to see a significant improvement except  </li>
            <li> I just got this product and like it so far.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so soft</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Made my winter skin soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling so soft.</li>
            <li> so,so,so soft.</li>
            <li> WOW, what a product.</li>
            <li> They seemed more pronounces lately.</li>
            <li> product surprised me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes completely sealed.  </li>
            <li> Right away, my skin felt baby soft and very &#x27;airy&#x27;, because I&#x27;m so used to moisturizers making my pores feel clogged and heavy.</li>
            <li> It has more of a whipped texture instead of a thin, liquidy lotion-like texture similar to many of the other jarred moisturizers on Amazon.</li>
            <li> it not only got rid of my huge bags under my eyes but also my crows feet and numerous other wrinkles...</li>
            <li> The dry crack around my mouth had gone away by morning, so the moisturizing effects really work.  </li>
            <li> It dried quickly and isn&#x27;t sticky.</li>
            <li> It left my face feeling very, very soft.</li>
            <li> It has been 3 weeks now, and I have noticed a major difference.</li>
            <li> applied this to my face and notice that is is so light and just a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Have only been using for 5 days but so far</li>
            <li> moisturize very well as i expected</li>
            <li> She has received numerous compliments on how young she is looking at 65 yo</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin with my lupus- so far absolutely no issues with that aspect.</li>
            <li> no dry spots.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more laugh lines and the crease on my forehead is lessened, not gone</li>
            <li> I normally have very dry, flaky skin during the colder months, and I have been prone to breakouts (in my thirties!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice that this product did anything, but I have used it less than a month.</li>
            <li> that amount never works I will need more.&amp;#34; Since the jar was not huge I expected to empty the jar  very quickly</li>
            <li> The little dry areas that have developed over the long winter look so much healthier now.</li>
            <li> I  have noticed laugh lines and brow (mean look) creases between my eyes.</li>
            <li> Applying in a circular motion it only took 2 small fingertip drops to cover my whole face and neck.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the no scent to this, a lot of times when things are unscented they are really the most awful smelling.</li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t feel as dry as it did, so I am eager to see further results as time goes by.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it for too long but have begun to notice a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> It is not heavy by any means unless you would cake on the entire jar, but you wouldn&#x27;t, a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep watching the effect on my skin for a long term.</li>
            <li> Just started using the product so long term results are pending.</li>
            <li> I will have to see in the long term, but for now I like that it isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> This cream is thick, and you only really have to use a little bit because its enough.</li>
            <li> but i haven&#x27;t seen a big difference due to using this cream.</li>
            <li> I have been having a problem with my skin being dry because of the weather and this helped me a lot.</li>
            <li> I use this at night for moisturizing face.. Seems to be working my face is not as dry as it used to be..</li>
            <li> Diminished dark circles and lines around eyes in only 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Only been using it a few days.</li>
            <li> I have only been using the product for a few days.  </li>
            <li> Have only been using a few weeks, but I use it before I put my foundation on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few days</li>
            <li> scent is quite faint, but if I stick my nose right down in the jar, it smells a bit like vanilla to me.</li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a long way !</li>
            <li> but the price is comparable to other anti-aging moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I got this the other day</li>
            <li> I actually have sensitive skin, so buying moisturizers is a bit complicated.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the</li>
            <li> By the time I got down to my neck my forehead</li>
            <li> Holy cow!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small than I expected...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and creamy and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I would say it cuts the appearance down of the lines on my forehead in about half!  </li>
            <li> few days ago-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a few days and in a matter of days I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> The jar is a little but small</li>
            <li> My only real complaint is that it is hard to read the ingredients on the jar.</li>
            <li> The print is small and there&#x27;s no box that it is also on.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure where it is made from looking at the jar, OR if it has been tested on animals or not.  </li>
            <li> This is a very thick, luxurious cream, and a very small amount goes a very long way!</li>
            <li> I have never had sensitive skin but lately with a lot of products I have had some unpleasant reactions, so</li>
            <li> Hard to describe.  </li>
            <li> replied to my inquiry even late at night</li>
            <li> I wanted to try it because I saw Dr. Oz recommended it, plus I&#x27;m on a &amp;#34;try everything&amp;#34; kick with skin care lately.  </li>
            <li> I am in my late 40&#x27;s and slowly watching my age show</li>
            <li> I mean not tacky or greasy.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean dry like dried out in a bad way.  </li>
            <li> I used to be a smoker so my face had some serious wrinkles..</li>
            <li> It smells a bit like plain yogurt, which seemed a bit odd to me, but the scent is very faint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just impatient!!!  </li>
            <li> it might have made a small impact, but it isn&#x27;t crazy visible.</li>
            <li> i wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle or anything so not going to rate them bad but definitely don&#x27;t expect a crazy visible difference.</li>
            <li> I feel I wasted my money because I had to buy another cream beside yours :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.  </li>
            <li> Hope it&#x27;s working, I guess ill just wait and see.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell badly.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work on my face. :(</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;a a easy apply. And this product does not cause irritation.</li>
            <li> Love the texture but did nothing for me.  I will NEVER pay the full price for it. I just finish the whole thing and did not see any difference. I will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> Have only been using for 5 days but so far no results...I&#x27;m just impatient!!!  I does go on smoothly!!!</li>
            <li> Great product. I haven&#x27;t been using it for too long but have begun to notice a difference in my skin. It&#x27;s definitely moisturized and looks fuller/more youthful.</li>
            <li> Great lotion that keeps my face from drying out but it also looks good under makeup.  I have very sensitive skin and the lotion didn&#x27;t make me break out.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is very nice skin cream. not oily.</li>
            <li> moisturize very well as i expected</li>
            <li> I really like anti-aging face cream I received, like that it makes my face so smooth am hoping it helps the wrinkles, I have only used it for a new days but think it is going to make a difference after using it a little longer,</li>
            <li> I love this cream..it not only got rid of my huge bags under my eyes but also my crows feet and numerous other wrinkles...I used to be a smoker so my face had some serious wrinkles..the first week using the cream and I could tell a huge difference..definitely recommend</li>
            <li> A regular cream to me. I like how it feels on my skin though</li>
            <li> Very light weight moisturizer, perfect for summer</li>
            <li> I just got this product and like it so far. It has a smooth application on your skin and you don&#x27;t need much to do the job. I have only been using it for two days so it&#x27;s early to tell how well it&#x27;s working, but I do have high hopes for it.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell yet. Only been using it a few days.</li>
            <li> this is a very nice cream. although i didnot ordered it for myself i ended using myself. it improved the wrinkles on my face.</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to see a significant improvement except  my face feels moisturized and smooth. If I had used it for about 3 weeks it may be a different review, that is why I can&#x27;t give it a 5 star review.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Joyce</li>
            <li> it is amazing item i love it</li>
            <li> I used 2 times. It is still good.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Le Fair Anti Aging Skin Cream! This product feels so good on your skin. I use it as a night cream after cleansing. It leaves my face and neck feeling so soft and smooth! I have sensitivities to some product, but this did not leave my skin red or irritated at all. The little dry areas that have developed over the long winter look so much healthier now. I am just loving this! I am very hopeful that it will continue to show good results. I have fine lines and &amp;#34;laugh&amp;#34; lines that hopefully will continue to smooth out with continued use.</li>
            <li> I like it! Good flavour and not greesy! I&#x27;ve been using this just 3 days. until now, I can&#x27; tell it&#x27;s better than the others, but i like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 32 years old and my comment is with some creams I can feel the moisture in my face when I apply for the first time, and eventually it works better.. I used to use L&#x27;oreal cream it works nice but I wanted to try something better that&#x27;s why I ordered your cream and I have been using L&amp;eacute; Fair for a few weeks and trust me I can&#x27;t feel any difference in my skin, even when I apply it I feel like a I need to put something else in my face because I can&#x27;t feel the moisturize although I have oil skin.. So, today I stopped using your cream and I started using the L&#x27;oreal one again.. I feel I wasted my money because I had to buy another cream beside yours :(</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and so far she really likes it. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This product really works. I have been having a problem with my skin being dry because of the weather and this helped me a lot. A must try :)</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few days now, but i really like this product.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my skin nice and soft no dry spots.&lt;br /&gt;My husband says my complexion is clearer.&lt;br /&gt;I still have fine lines by my eyes , but will give an updated review after i have been using longer.</li>
            <li> Quality skin product that is working as described. Great texture and ability to spread evenly. Excellent quality and value !</li>
            <li> I have been trying several creams and serums lately and this moisturizer is really great. I have never had sensitive skin but lately with a lot of products I have had some unpleasant reactions, so I don&#x27;t know what they are putting in them. With that said. I really appreciate the no scent to this, a lot of times when things are unscented they are really the most awful smelling. This has an exceptional softness to it that I really look for in my moisturizer. It is not heavy by any means unless you would cake on the entire jar, but you wouldn&#x27;t, a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I Got This Product At A Discount In Return For An Honest Review. I Love ThisSkin Cream. It Made My Skin Look So Smooth.</li>
            <li> When I got this product...It&#x27;s small than I expected...I don&#x27;t mind because I think it is cute...other than that, it is wonderful and does work really well.  I had no reactions from it which it is plus.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, and am satisfied with the product.  It is smooth and silky to the touch, and feels great on my skin!  I have only been using the product for a few days.  Hoping to see a difference soon!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product. The directions said use a pea sized amount and I thought &amp;#34;ya with my aging skin that amount never works I will need more.&amp;#34; Since the jar was not huge I expected to empty the jar  very quickly I decided to use the amount recommended for a starter and see what happened. Well I was amazed to see very good results using only the amount recommended(pea sized). This makes my skin feel firmer and softer. I love it.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin, not greasy no matter how much I put on. Plus it didn&#x27;t make me breakout, which I always have a problem with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great under my foundation. I have been using it morning and night.</li>
            <li> the texture of this product is very rich and smooth but not greasy. It absorbs fast remaining a lot moisture on my skin. the fragrance is also nice (smooth and faint scent). I use this every night for a week and it makes my skin more moisturized every morning. I&#x27;ll keep watching the effect on my skin for a long term.</li>
            <li> May indeed did not see much use yet. Fine cosmetic effects. Next, if I want to continue to use the opportunity.</li>
            <li> So so soooo good- I just received this wonderful product few days ago- I have applied it to my facial skin and I can already see the difference. I am satisfied so far. hopfully the product will continue to work for me so I can order more in the future.</li>
            <li> This product is the BEST face cream/moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. Nice, smooth consistency, no fragrance or odor. A small amount is all that&#x27;s needed, so it&#x27;s also nice that the jar will last a while. Feels super light going on and absorbs very well; no grease or residue that I find most moisturizers leave behind. Right away, my skin felt baby soft and very &#x27;airy&#x27;, because I&#x27;m so used to moisturizers making my pores feel clogged and heavy. My skin was very recieptive to this and after a week&#x27;s use, I noticed my skin tone was even, any blemishes had cleared up, and my fine lines started filling in. I&#x27;ve also increased my water intake to maximize effectiveness in the quest for the best skin I can have, and I now wake up looking much more refreshed and bright because my skin is so hydrated &amp; nourished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this product, will re-order and recommend far &amp; wide!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.  Isn&#x27;t any better than all the other brands out there!</li>
            <li> i got it fast and no damage. the cream it has a very nice texture not to oily i personally like it. not first time buyer :)</li>
            <li> ahhh! so, I have really dry skin, and struggle finding good products for my face.  This cream is thick, and you only really have to use a little bit because its enough. I started applying it after I take a shower, and wow does my face feel good. I am def. going to repurchase after I am all out.</li>
            <li> This is now one of my favorite anti aging creams.  It makes my skin feel so soft and I can wear it under makeup.</li>
            <li> I recieved this at a discout through a discount group. I have to say this is a very high quality moisturizer. It smells a bit like plain yogurt, which seemed a bit odd to me, but the scent is very faint. I could feel the tightening effects of this anti-aging cream seconds after I applied it to my face and neck, and could continue to feel it throughout the day. It was not an uncomfortable feeling at all, and was quite pleasant. This is a very thick, luxurious cream, and a very small amount goes a very long way! I normally have very dry, flaky skin during the colder months, and I have been prone to breakouts (in my thirties! yikes!) but this formula seems to have just the right balance to keep my skin from getting greasy, while still keeping it moisturized and supple. It is not greasy at all, but very light  on application. I highly reccommend this product, as it has helped my dry-combination skin become soft and smooth and lovely.</li>
            <li> i squint a lot so i have wrinkles on my forehead. i got this to see if it could alleviate some of them but i haven&#x27;t seen a big difference due to using this cream. it might have made a small impact, but it isn&#x27;t crazy visible. i wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle or anything so not going to rate them bad but definitely don&#x27;t expect a crazy visible difference.</li>
            <li> Ordered this with a discount code.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that my face is brighter and smoother. I would purchase again!</li>
            <li> The product arrived as promised. I&#x27;ve been using for a few days and in a matter of days I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my skin. I highly recommend this product for the price and results.</li>
            <li> It works wonder on softening you sk8n and has help bring life back to my mother&#x27;s face. She has received numerous compliments on how young she is looking at 65 yo</li>
            <li> I am happy with the cream so far. My face doesn&#x27;t feel as dry as it did, so I am eager to see further results as time goes by. The customer service was awesome since that seems to be a dying trend these days. So far, so good. Barbara M</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good moisturizer but too heavy for me.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer serum.</li>
            <li> This skin cream works great for a nightly moisturizer and makes my skin feel smoother and more supple. It does not irritate my sensitive skin and seems pretty gentle. The container is pretty small but the cream has lasted me quite awhile, so I consider it a good product that I use often. As for anti-aging, I assume it is making a difference and I can tell there is some sort of retinol or anti-aging properties because my skin feels a certain way when I apply retinol.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work on my face. :(</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell badly.  I can&#x27;t stand product that has a perfume-like smell.  I have extremely sensitive skin and this is very soothing.</li>
            <li> Love this product. In even a very short amount of time using my face feels and looks softer.  Easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t change the look of make up.</li>
            <li> THIS CREAM FILLS SO NICE ON MY SKIN.  NO ITCHINESS OR DRYNESS AT ALL. NO LINGERING OILY FEELING. VERY NICE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> good flavour and not greesy! i&#x27;ve been using this just 2 days. until now, i can&#x27; tell it&#x27;s better than the others, but i like it.</li>
            <li> It left my face feeling very, very soft. In addition, the moisturizer is non-greasy and goes on very smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;Most of all, its customer satisfaction is the best of all.&lt;br /&gt;The seller replied to my inquiry even late at night and I&#x27;ve got received their response within 2-3 hours after I sent it by e-mail.&lt;br /&gt;I love it and you&#x27;d love it!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice that this product did anything, but I have used it less than a month. It may be fine if used longer.</li>
            <li> feels good, looks like some improvement in my face.  Love it</li>
            <li> My mom has this and I used some on a weekend stay at her house and it is wonderful. Made my winter skin soft. Love it</li>
            <li> Have only been using a few weeks, but I use it before I put my foundation on. It dried quickly and isn&#x27;t sticky. Also, a little goes a long way !</li>
            <li> Just received this about a week ago. While there isn&#x27;t a big change. It feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this at night for moisturizing face.. Seems to be working my face is not as dry as it used to be..</li>
            <li> Le Fair Anti Aging Skin Cream feels light on your skin and had no adverse reactions to sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this to my face and notice that is is so light and just a little goes a long way.  Applying in a circular motion it only took 2 small fingertip drops to cover my whole face and neck. By the time I got down to my neck my forehead the cream I put on my forehead had already absorbed in.  The dry crack around my mouth had gone away by morning, so the moisturizing effects really work.  I&#x27;m very pleased to have receive this at a promotional rate to try out then review with my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream comes in a very attractive container that I don&#x27;t mine letting set out on my vanity.  I tried to get a good picture but the lighting in here isn&#x27;t that great and can&#x27;t use a flash on glass.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I don&#x27;t often wear makeup or use products on my skin because it is very sensitive. This product, however, not only does not irritate my skin, it makes my skin look great and I love the way it feels on my skin. I used a coupon code to get a discount on my first bottle and now I&#x27;m going to have to order a second. It&#x27;s just that great!</li>
            <li> Great product. Diminished dark circles and lines around eyes in only 2 weeks. Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> Just started using the product so long term results are pending. I do love the ease of application, absorbs quickly, no annoying odor. I have very sensitive skin with my lupus- so far absolutely no issues with that aspect.</li>
            <li> So far so good! I have just ordered this product for the second time and can&#x27;t wait. It leaves my skin feeling so soft. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Goes on very smoothly.  Made my skin look radiant!</li>
            <li> I am in my late 40&#x27;s and slowly watching my age show so i am always on the lookout for new and different products so when LE FAIR  anti-aging skin  was offered to me during a promotion for y honest opinion I was thrilled to give it a try. First of all, the bottle is BEAUTIFUL it screams LET ME PAMPER YOU! It goes on very nicely, not to thick, it has a very light pleasant scent, it did not bother my sensitive skin, which is a huge deal for me, it soaks right in, and leaves no greasy feeling, and it leaves your skin feeling so,so,so,so soft. WOW, what a product.</li>
            <li> I was actually very surprised by the consistency of this product. It has more of a whipped texture instead of a thin, liquidy lotion-like texture similar to many of the other jarred moisturizers on Amazon. It definitely helped with the moisturization of my skin right after applying it and it wasn&#x27;t greasy or oily at all. It absorbed incredibly quickly and it was very refreshing. The ingredients mention fruit extracts and other ingredients that usually have a distinct scent, but I didn&#x27;t pick up on any sort of fragrance from this product which is ideal for people with sensitive skin. The jar is a little but small but the price is comparable to other anti-aging moisturizers.</li>
            <li> The company is awesome.  The delivery was fast. I haven&#x27;t used the cream but for a couple days and can&#x27;t really comment one way or the other except to say that it goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling sticky or oily.  I will update in a couple weeks after I have used it to see if has made an improvement in my skin.  Ok..weeks later...my skin has more elasticity in it it seems and the wrinkles have faded quite a bit...ordered another jar!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is definitely improving my skin, very happy so far. My only complaint is the I can&#x27;t read the super tiny information printed on the jar.</li>
            <li> I just love this Anti-Aging Cream. It makes your skin so smooth, and at the same time it is a filler if you need to fill in lines of any kind! I&#x27;m still using it, in the morning at night. It&#x27;s only been a few days but it&#x27;s great😊</li>
            <li> Everything was as described - excellent.</li>
            <li> Holy cow!  I love this face cream.  I wanted to try it because I saw Dr. Oz recommended it, plus I&#x27;m on a &amp;#34;try everything&amp;#34; kick with skin care lately.  It is unlike any skin cream I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s thick and creamy and a little goes a long way.  It soaks in quickly and then the surface of my skin feels dry.  I don&#x27;t mean dry like dried out in a bad way.  I mean not tacky or greasy.  Just smooth, as if there were nothing on it, but plump and supple at the same time.  Hard to describe.  So makeup goes on super great!  With most moisturizers my mineral foundation goes on too thick because there&#x27;s some kind of residue on my skin.  Not with this.  It goes on very fine and is buildable.  I wanted the eye serum Dr. Oz recommends with this too, but I can&#x27;t find where to buy it without having to sign up for some monthly commitment and I don&#x27;t like those deals.  So I used this on my eyes too and it&#x27;s great there as well.  Will definitely continue to buy and use this.  Oh, yeah!  It&#x27;s a super price for the quality!  Way better than the super expensive things I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Is a very good product.&lt;br /&gt;The product has to inform good friends</li>
            <li> very awesome !! I really love it</li>
            <li> Great experience purchasing product.</li>
            <li> Great facial cream my face is very sensitive and this cream does not irritated it and dries my skin out it does the total opposite and makes my skin feel refreshed.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! Used for a month and diminished crows feet and fine lines around my eyes.  Smooth creamy texture is easy to apply. No greasy feeling afterward.  Could not believe the difference it made in one month!!</li>
            <li> Everything that I ordered was successfully delivered to me. So far, I love this product! It is very light and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Great product. Noticed change within a week of using.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. It goes on light and smooth. not greasy. The texture is nice and creamy. It absorbs very quickly and i love that because sometimes products have a hard time sinking into my skin because i&#x27;m oily.  I like to use a skin serum first the this cream.</li>
            <li> Awesome cream! A must buy...not sticky like most and makes my face feel great!</li>
            <li> I  loving this moisturizer! I actually have sensitive skin, so buying moisturizers is a bit complicated. I use it morning and. Iggy and I&#x27;m loving the results. Goes on smooth, smells nice and clean and is very light. I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I  have noticed laugh lines and brow (mean look) creases between my eyes. They seemed more pronounces lately. I have tried several things and nothing changed, I have been thinking about going the expensive route and getting products that cost LOTS more. Two days ago I purchased this and on the first day I noticed a BIG difference, but for some reason could not believe it. It has been 3 weeks now, and I have noticed a major difference. No more laugh lines and the crease on my forehead is lessened, not gone but no as deep. I will definitely continue to use this product from here on out.</li>
            <li> I love the Le Fair anti aging cream !! It is exactly what I was looking for. Quick shipping too! I am very pleased with this product and the personal attention I have received from the seller. I will continue to buy from the seller. 😊</li>
            <li> I am so happy with my purchase and couldnt wait to try it out! Once I received it, I tried it that very night. I was amazed at how soft and moisturized my skin was feeling, and just after one use! The texture of the moisturizer is creamy and smooth to the touch. I didnt detect any type of smell, which is a plus for me because I prefer no smell. I would highly recommend this product to any and everyone looking for a great anti aging skin cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for a dollar or less using amazingdealsgroul.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I love the way this brightens up and makes my face feel so smooth! I was using Olay before this, but that has now changed!</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my skin feel so far. I will have to see in the long term, but for now I like that it isn&#x27;t greasy. It feels light on my skin. Hope it&#x27;s working, I guess ill just wait and see.</li>
            <li> Love it! I&#x27;ll be getting more!</li>
            <li> I love using this rich cream as a night cream and wake up feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> Product provided with significant promotional discount for purposes of review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product surprised me.  I actually like it BETTER than my normal Olay.  In some ways it is similar- the container, the consistency, even the way it absorbs into my skin.  However, this works on my skin much better as a wrinkle FILLER, so I have been enjoying using this before my makeup.  I would say it cuts the appearance down of the lines on my forehead in about half!  It also leaves my skin quite smooth, and I&#x27;ve not had problems with piling or &#x27;rolling&#x27; at all.  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes completely sealed.  My only real complaint is that it is hard to read the ingredients on the jar. The print is small and there&#x27;s no box that it is also on.  It says it is distributed by a company in Texas but I&#x27;m not sure where it is made from looking at the jar, OR if it has been tested on animals or not.  It&#x27;s a great pre-makeup wrinkle filler though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is quite faint, but if I stick my nose right down in the jar, it smells a bit like vanilla to me.</li>
            <li> I got this the other day and I tried it right away.  I was really excited since I am looking for a good wrinkle cream.  So far I&#x27;m loving the cream.  It really has helped my face out and also did NOT dry it out.  I&#x27;ve had some creams that just don&#x27;t moisturize my face well.  I&#x27;m still trying it but so far so good !  Another thing I love about this product is the seller.  After you order this the seller is very good about sending you a email.  It&#x27;s very detailed about how you should eat healthy and drink plenty of water, which I drink 8 glasses a day.  Also it&#x27;s made in the U.S.A.      I had to add after I have been using this product for 3 weeks I have noticed a lot of my deeper wrinkles have really disappeared.   I had one deep wrinkle in between my eyebrows and it has really gotten a lot better.      I got this product as a discount for an unbiased honest review.</li>
