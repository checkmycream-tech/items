            <li>Very good for treatment of mild dandruff.</li>
            <li>Very effective and easy to use.</li>
            <li>- effective</li>
            <li>/&gt;which is no-where as effective.</li>
            <li>It is by far the best anti-dandruff hairgroom ever made.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use Brylcream even though not as good as the original Top Brass.</li>
            <li>Top Brass sold for $4.00 in the Beauty Supply stores.</li>
            <li>so I was glad to be able to find it here.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the item</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more of this product.</li>
            <li>I decided to go ahead and spend the money for Top Brass</li>
            <li>For about 3 weeks all I did was apply Top Brass to itchy spots</li>
            <li>Top Brass Hair Grooming Gel:</li>
            <li>Top Brass is helping with flaking in my hair and eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find it in stores, or anyplace</li>
            <li>But I will rate again after I use it some more.  </li>
            <li>I sure hope amazon continues to sell it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Top Brass ZP 11 Anti&#x3D;Dandruff Hairgroom for over 30+ years.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for greater than 13 years.</li>
            <li>I chose this product because I had good success with the origional Top Brass (not a dandruff control product)</li>
            <li>So far so good!  </li>
            <li>and I liked the fact that it came quickly through the mail.</li>
            <li>it was just too strong for me and</li>
            <li>Non greasy and light.</li>
            <li>I WOULD RECOMMENED THIS TO ANY MAN OR WOMAN LOOKING TO BE DANDRUFF FREE.</li>
            <li>The Jamica ones perform poorer than those made in the USA which also not as good as the original ones in the old day made by Revelon.</li>
            <li>and I paid 7 times as much!!!</li>
            <li>and it seems the original is no longer manufactured.  </li>
            <li>Also, it is the best product so far that I have used for my scalp itching and facial blotch&#x27;s (Rodacea).  </li>
            <li>A little pricey but very good product</li>
            <li>I bought this product in a London salon for 5 pounds, and since then have not been able to get it at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>This product is becoming more and more harder to find</li>
            <li>It has a mild scent, doesn&#x27;t gunk up my scalp or try to undo my dreads.</li>
            <li>The product is super.</li>
            <li>I like the product, but the pricing on amazon was too high as you should be able to buy a carton of six for what I paid for one.</li>
            <li>Whether it&#x27;s a day watching the ponies or a night swingin&#x27; on the dance floor, Top Brass for Men is for Men of Action!</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years in the military and was glad to find it again at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>but I always go back to using it for my kind of hair(coarse and unrul).&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>No longer available, Top Brass is the only hairdressing cream they now produce&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks for making this product available for those of us who really need it.</li>
            <li>Men of Action stink.....and Real Men of Action stink of Top Brass!</li>
            <li>I have been using Top Brass (blue tube) for about 30 years!</li>
            <li>This product was first class in the&lt;br /&gt;prevention againsts dandruff.</li>
            <li>I have been using top brass (Blue tube) for over 20 years.  </li>
            <li>if getting a perm for you is like dousing your scalp with gasoline within the first 1 minute of application...</li>
            <li>if you have suffered from a lifetime of itching scalp with those large flakes.....then you really need to try this.....</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t like them much.</li>
            <li>price was for one tube, $50.00.  too much.</li>
            <li>This product really works, however when you stop using it the dandruff will return.  </li>
            <li>I hope the price does not continue to rise because there are people who really need this product.</li>
            <li>It does not work fast but trust me in a couple of weeks you will notice the difference.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Revlon really screwed up when they discontinued ZP-11 Hairgroom.</li>
            <li>IT REALLY WORKS AND DOSENT LEAVE YOUR HAIR GREASY.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>So far after one used my scalp feels much better and the dry patch are not there anymore.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find this product on the shelves anymore where I live.</li>
            <li>You can never be too forward with that special girl if your hair is looking good, and no unsightly flakes due to our special patented ZP-11 anti-dandruff formula means she&#x27;ll won&#x27;t be shy about running her fingers through your hair!</li>
            <li>For Men of Action!</li>
            <li>First time of having a big relief from dandruff.</li>
            <li>so I wound&#x27;t recommend it to those with sensitive scalp.  </li>
            <li>(PS - the \\&quot;hair thickener\\&quot; TB in the yellow tube is the exact opposite)</li>
            <li>My dry scalp has significantly cleared since using this product, and I have only used it for a short period.</li>
            <li>Actually, I bought this product for my 87 year old father who used to use it back in the early seventies.  </li>
            <li>and I have no regrets buying it.</li>
            <li>The one major CON I found is that once you stop using it, the dandruff come back.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and it really works!</li>

            <li> Furthermore, if you like to flat iron your hair</li>
            <li> However, this product may be used only 2 or 3 times a week - it is dangerous to use it more often and even when used should be rinsed off soon after applying.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with the product and recommend it to everyone I know who suffers from problem dandruff.</li>
            <li> - can be used daily with minimal drying.  </li>
            <li> I however discovered Keracare Dry and Itchy lotion which has the same active ingredient(Pyrithione Zinc)and works just as well.</li>
            <li> The winters in NC have been very dry and sucked the moisture out of my skin and scalp.</li>
            <li> As an African American with dreads, it&#x27;s hard to find a product that will take care of itchy scalp without being heavy, smelly or detangling.</li>
            <li> On other sites.</li>
            <li> I have tried other hair creams</li>
            <li> the only problem is that it is sometimes hard to find (except on the internet) and never can find it in retail stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry revlon stoped making it which drove up the price too much.</li>
            <li> It keeps my dandruff down, without leaving my hair oily and heavy.  </li>
            <li> excelent product my husband uses it everyday</li>
            <li> After a few uses, my dandruff began to disappear.  </li>
            <li> This is a product that I have used for years, but was having a difficult time finding it in local stores.  </li>
            <li> I used to pay less than $3 for the product!!</li>
            <li> and I hardly noticed my hair at all.</li>
            <li> I mean it......</li>
            <li> but it initially causes flakes to fall off and can be annoying if you wear dark colours.</li>
            <li> only gave it 3 stars because I am disappointed that the company no longer sells in drugstores, or beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> Now, only the remaining few units are out there at prices which are outrageous.</li>
            <li> I HAVE HAD BAD DANDRUFF SINCE I WAS A BABY.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Top Brass sold for $4.00 in the Beauty Supply stores.Amazon and the seller is ripping us off. This is price GOUGING. Buyer Beware. On other sites. Amazon is listed as selling item for $3.96.</li>
            <li> I have been using Top Brass (blue tube) for about 30 years! It keeps dandruff in check, my remaining hair in place, and has almost no fragrance added. (PS - the \\&quot;hair thickener\\&quot; TB in the yellow tube is the exact opposite)</li>
            <li> This stuff works for dandruff but you have to use it forever!!!!  It also caused my scalp to burn so I wound&#x27;t recommend it to those with sensitive scalp.  Furthermore, if you like to flat iron your hair and you don&#x27;t have a relaxer this cream will make your hair swell up.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend...it was just too strong for me and the cons outweighed the pro.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this product on the shelves anymore where I live. Gotta have it! Eliminates itchy scalp &amp; zaps dandruff.</li>
            <li> This product is becoming more and more harder to find so I was glad to be able to find it here.  Product was delivered on time.</li>
            <li> I did a review on YouTube. Check it out here...    [...]    In a nutshell however it is:    - great in conjunction with dandruff shampoo.  - can be used daily with minimal drying.  - effective but it initially causes flakes to fall off and can be annoying if you wear dark colours.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the item and I liked the fact that it came quickly through the mail. I will be ordering more of this product.</li>
            <li> As an African American with dreads, it&#x27;s hard to find a product that will take care of itchy scalp without being heavy, smelly or detangling. The winters in NC have been very dry and sucked the moisture out of my skin and scalp. Being from CA I didn&#x27;t know what to do! I tried a couple things but I didn&#x27;t like them much. I decided to go ahead and spend the money for Top Brass and I&#x27;m so glad I did! A little goes a long way and it really works! It has a mild scent, doesn&#x27;t gunk up my scalp or try to undo my dreads. While my boyfriend was in the hospital, I didn&#x27;t have the time or energy to wash my hair. For about 3 weeks all I did was apply Top Brass to itchy spots and I hardly noticed my hair at all. Great stuff! Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey.</li>
            <li> Very good for treatment of mild dandruff.</li>
            <li> Top Brass Hair Grooming Gel: For Men of Action! Whether it&#x27;s a day watching the ponies or a night swingin&#x27; on the dance floor, Top Brass for Men is for Men of Action! You can never be too forward with that special girl if your hair is looking good, and no unsightly flakes due to our special patented ZP-11 anti-dandruff formula means she&#x27;ll won&#x27;t be shy about running her fingers through your hair! You&#x27;ll be looking good. Looking good at a formal dinner in Manhattan, and looking good in a fist-fight in a seedy Tijuana bar, and she&#x27;ll notice. Just remember, men smell....Men of Action stink.....and Real Men of Action stink of Top Brass!</li>
            <li> excelent product my husband uses it everyday we still have it but I shall order soon stop it enough is enpouigh</li>
            <li> So far so good!  Top Brass is helping with flaking in my hair and eyebrows. Also, it is the best product so far that I have used for my scalp itching and facial blotch&#x27;s (Rodacea).  I have not been able to find it in stores, or anyplace but Amazon.com. Thanks for making this product available for those of us who really need it.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist uses this dandruff hairdressing on my scalp when my hair is styled in a wet-set.  It keeps my dandruff down, without leaving my hair oily and heavy.  After a few uses, my dandruff began to disappear.  I am really pleased with the product and recommend it to everyone I know who suffers from problem dandruff.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but very good product</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years in the military and was glad to find it again at Amazon.com. I&#x27;m sorry revlon stoped making it which drove up the price too much.</li>
            <li> returned.  price was for one tube, $50.00.  too much.</li>
            <li> So far after one used my scalp feels much better and the dry patch are not there anymore. But I will rate again after I use it some more.  So now its been a couple of weeks since I have started using the top brass, its great. No flakes at all. I used to have a build up around my hair line even though I wash my hair once a week.  All gone.. This stuff is great... Don&#x27;t know why it has been taken off the market, but I sure hope amazon continues to sell it.</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised! My dry scalp has significantly cleared since using this product, and I have only used it for a short period. Would recommend to others!</li>
            <li> Great hair product for people with scalp disorders. Very effective and easy to use. Non greasy and light.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but the pricing on amazon was too high as you should be able to buy a carton of six for what I paid for one.</li>
            <li> Where can you find this item, I would love to purchase!!!!!!!!  Everywhere I go it says no longer available ugh!!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent Product, been using it for over 20 years. It&#x27;s always been about $4.00 now the price is a rip off!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Top Brass ZP 11 Anti&#x3D;Dandruff Hairgroom for over 30+ years.  I have tried other hair creams but I always go back to using it for my kind of hair(coarse and unrul).&lt;br /&gt;But the only problem is that it is sometimes hard to find (except on the internet) and never can find it in retail stores.</li>
            <li> Revlon Manufacturers used to produce a hair dressing that was named ZP11. This product was first class in the&lt;br /&gt;prevention againsts dandruff. No longer available, Top Brass is the only hairdressing cream they now produce&lt;br /&gt;which is no-where as effective.</li>
            <li> This is a product that I have used for years, but was having a difficult time finding it in local stores.  I ordered it thru Amazon and I now have a 2 to 3 year supply.  It works well with my hair, keeping the dandruff at a minimum.</li>
            <li> over price$$$ but is excellent product, we use for kids and adults after lices atack the family and everyting is clean.</li>
            <li> I have been using top brass (Blue tube) for over 20 years.  My beautician at the time recommended this product for my dandruff.  This product really works, however when you stop using it the dandruff will return.  This product prevents dandruff,conditions the hair, and helps hair grow.    I purchased this product from the corner rexall drug store in chicago for 20 years.  I paid around $5 per tube.   One day I went to this drug store and was told this product was discontinued. I found the product on Amazon.com with a price 3 times what I paid at the drug store.  I needed the product so I paid $15 charged by Amazon.com.      I hope the price does not continue to rise because there are people who really need this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for greater than 13 years. It is a miracle cream for my scalp. I have a dermatolgic condition known as seborrhea. When I tell you this is the answer I mean it......if you have suffered from a lifetime of itching scalp with those large flakes.....then you really need to try this.....if getting a perm for you is like dousing your scalp with gasoline within the first 1 minute of application...give this stuff a try. It does not work fast but trust me in a couple of weeks you will notice the difference.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in a London salon for 5 pounds, and since then have not been able to get it at a reasonable price.  I however discovered Keracare Dry and Itchy lotion which has the same active ingredient(Pyrithione Zinc)and works just as well.</li>
            <li> Just as it was described, it is just great</li>
            <li> Great product.  Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Revlon really screwed up when they discontinued ZP-11 Hairgroom. It is by far the best anti-dandruff hairgroom ever made. Now, only the remaining few units are out there at prices which are outrageous. I bought two tube because nothing else will contain my scalp issues like this product!</li>
            <li> Actually, I bought this product for my 87 year old father who used to use it back in the early seventies.  Back then it was a hair grooming product which conditioned the scalp, you combed it in your hair in the morning, and wore it all day.  This version of ZP-11 is a product made in Jamaica, and comes with WARNING stickers stating that it should be applied to the scalp briefly then washed out.  It is no longer a grooming product and dad says it has none of the medicinal benefits of the earlier version produced by REVLON. Paid $20 per tube that should be in the $5 to $7 range.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because I had good success with the origional Top Brass (not a dandruff control product) and it seems the original is no longer manufactured.  However, this product may be used only 2 or 3 times a week - it is dangerous to use it more often and even when used should be rinsed off soon after applying. I was looking for a hairgroom cream.  I don&#x27;t need to control dandruff with a hairgroom cream and don&#x27;t want to use something that is not competely to control my hair, so I can&#x27;t use this at all.  It was a gross waist of money.  I will continue to use Brylcream even though not as good as the original Top Brass.</li>
            <li> I HAVE HAD BAD DANDRUFF SINCE I WAS A BABY.  AND THIS IS THE ONLY PRODUCT THAT TOTALLY ELIMINATED MY DANDRUFF AND DOSENT MAKE MY SCALP ITCH.  IT WAS ACTUALLY RECOMMENED TO ME BY MY HAIR STYLIST.  I WOULD RECOMMENED THIS TO ANY MAN OR WOMAN LOOKING TO BE DANDRUFF FREE. IT REALLY WORKS AND DOSENT LEAVE YOUR HAIR GREASY.</li>
            <li> I wonder why it is difficult to get this Top Brass of Revlon.&lt;br /&gt;I think is a very good product  as antidandruff.I hope to find some units in Amazon.</li>
            <li> There are ones made in Jamica or USA. The Jamica ones perform poorer than those made in the USA which also not as good as the original ones in the old day made by Revelon.</li>
            <li> Works great&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it 3 stars because I am disappointed that the company no longer sells in drugstores, or beauty supply stores. The one major CON I found is that once you stop using it, the dandruff come back.  Otherwise, great product, and not greasy at all. I would definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I used to pay less than $3 for the product!! Now you can&#x27;t find it anywhere and I paid 7 times as much!!!</li>
            <li> The product is super. First time of having a big relief from dandruff. Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Did what they said it would do and I have no regrets buying it. I definitely will be buying it again...</li>
            <li> I have never had a problem with this product.</li>
