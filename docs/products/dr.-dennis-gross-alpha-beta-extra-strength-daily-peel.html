            <li>Have tried many products to reduce age spots.  </li>

            <li>I think most of us would benefit from</li>
            <li>I love the way it brightens my skin and helps keep the evidence of skin damage under control (I am outdoors ALOT).&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Fabulous product!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I kept using it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been so confident going au naturel....</li>
            <li>To me, it&#x27;s a nice product that should be used in moderation when you see fit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed that there&#x27;s a peel strong enough to fix my issues, but not burn my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>AS IT MAKE MY SKIN VERY CLEAN AND POLISH LOOKING.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s honestly a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>My \\&quot;over 50\\&quot; skin that spent way too many days in the sun is now in great shape!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased with the results that I think the price is just fine.  </li>
            <li>I was able to use it while I was pregnant with no issues and even my husband uses them once in a while!</li>
            <li>Great product, have bought 3 times now does not irritate my sensitive skin ,would recommend .</li>
            <li>While this product is absolutely incredible, I would recommend purchasing the individual packets.  </li>
            <li>I look younger and my skin has greatly improved in many ways:  </li>
            <li>Directions are easy to follow.</li>
            <li>This is so easy to use, and didn&#x27;t cause any issues with stinging or redness.</li>
            <li>Easy to use....</li>
            <li>It made me break out, maybe it was too strong for my skin.</li>
            <li>These pads brighten the skin, lesson appearance of pores and fine lines.</li>
            <li>With continued use I am hoping to see improvement in fine lines and diminished sun spots.</li>
            <li>color, pore size, elasticity, fine lines and glow.  </li>
            <li>This is lactic acid based in the first peel which is perfect for melasma and the retinol in the second step</li>
            <li>It is a great addition to my Obagi regimen and it is amazing at exfoliating my skin to reveal that hidden pinkish glow.  </li>
            <li>It is a great addition to my Obagi regimen and it is amazing at exfoliating my skin to reveal that hidden pinkish glow.  </li>
            <li>This product along with clarisonic has made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>Started up again same great results.</li>
            <li>helps keep my skin clear and bright.</li>
            <li>Use it everyday and watch your skin turn flawless.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this.</li>
            <li>Even my younger coworkers compliment on how great my skin looks.</li>
            <li>I used one kit over 45 days and it really was amazing.  </li>
            <li>I received the 10 day for free from an Allure prize</li>
            <li>It stings a bit, but well worth it for more smoother even skin tone.</li>
            <li>A great product from Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare.</li>
            <li>I wish it were more reasonably priced or had more &#x27;bells and whistles&#x27;</li>
            <li>Use: on clean skin use step one by lightly rubbing on face and neck...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy and I can already see my skin tone even out.</li>
            <li>At first the product made me breakout even more</li>
            <li>B004SCJDC2 Kate Somerville Kate Somerville Clinic-to-Go Resurfacing Peel Pads]], and the original strength [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The package is nice enough that I feel comfortable leaving it out on my bathroom counter top.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited when I saw the price on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>Been using it for a month now, and my skin is significantly brighter.</li>
            <li>To me it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li>Step 2 appears to close the pores and leaves my face feeling exceptionally clean.</li>
            <li>First time I used it, I could tell it was pretty strong, but my skin handled it OK.  </li>
            <li>I always use before a special event.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li>This makes my face feel really clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Blotchy, pore size, I even have mild Rosacea.  </li>
            <li>Not a miracle quick fix but</li>
            <li>My skin looked very nice after, and some portions are much smoother after only one step.</li>
            <li>Dark spots are gone and wrinkles are greatly diminished.</li>
            <li>I cant wait to see how clear and bright i look when my next 30 day box of peels arrive :)</li>
            <li>my skin is oily and this is a great product for keeping the oil down.</li>
            <li>Also believe that active ingredients in creams and serums are more effective.  </li>
            <li>(Always finish with SPF 30 or higher!)  </li>
            <li>I was even willing to include pictures of my face in this review to use as an example!</li>
            <li>I have noticed smaller pores, diminished fine lines and my face seems to have a fuller more youthful appearance.  </li>
            <li>These pads are great at clearing off dead skin cells and brightening our skin...</li>
            <li>I received the packets of the extra strength pads to try and really liked.</li>
            <li>Worth a try IMO.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as strong as the spa treatment, but I can keep up the treatment on a nightly basis, and that keeps the pores clean and clear of oil buildup.  </li>
            <li>I like to use this system every morning on freshly cleansed skin then follow with serum, moisturizer and mineral makeup.</li>
            <li>I remembered how nice my skin looked after a peel, back when I used to get them.  </li>
            <li>Like most baby boomers, my skin was looking old and porous.</li>
            <li>Honestly this is the only product that has ever truly cleared up my skin.</li>
            <li>the best I hoped for was to not get noticeably worse.  </li>
            <li>The Subscribe &amp; Save option not only offers a great price - it ensures that you won&#x27;t run out, and continuity matters in skin care.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>You can find other products just as good but not as pricey.</li>
            <li>and this dries it right up.</li>
            <li>You will see it improve right before your eyes.</li>
            <li>My beautiful skin was ruined and I was left with stripes and larger pores.  </li>
            <li>It is a quick 5 minute therapy that really works.  </li>
            <li>If you are like me you went through a period of early peels on ebay, then really strong peels in a MD office, phototherapy...and no results except reactive hyper pigmentation ....  </li>
            <li>and it is very gentle.  </li>
            <li>+ year old sundamaged skin that is super sensitive to most exfoilants and retinols.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re trying this for the first time, be aware that your skin might &#x27;purge&#x27; itself for the first couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>Reduced breakouts, even skintone and smaller pores are the most noticeable differences I have found.</li>
            <li>Although I also get regular facials and eat a healthy diet, so these additional factors will only make your skin even better.</li>
            <li>I switched from using the regular strength every day because this option is considerably more affordable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>wait two minutes then step two leave on over night or use first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>She wants to buy another month&#x27;s supply!</li>
            <li>Overall, her skin looks smoother and more youthful.</li>
            <li>I have used many different kinds of peels from Philosophy and glycolic</li>
            <li>but I am going to reduce use once I am done with the first pack</li>
            <li>As an African American women with very oily brown skin, I had difficulty in finding a product that would do a great job in exfoliating my skin, eliminate my acne and improve areas where there is hyper-pigmentation.  </li>
            <li>Hearing good things about the AB peel, I read a few more reviews and then decided on the Extra strength version.  </li>
            <li>My pores were smaller and my skin was more supple.  </li>
            <li>My pores were smaller and my skin was more supple.  </li>
            <li>; each morning and night (if you are using for the first time - get 30 pads and use every 3 days, then 2 days, then 1 day - then get your 60 day pads for am/pm.  </li>
            <li>Although the label says you might have a reaction at first, I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>but I figured if I used the extra strength I would get better results.</li>
            <li>I use my mini-micro blade roller first before applying the wipes for maximum penetration into the skin.</li>
            <li>I am pretty amazed.</li>
            <li>A million times better than Dr. Dennis Gross&#x27; peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>I bought this product at Sephora about a year ago and fell in love with it instantly.</li>
            <li>Also used in conjunction with the Dr. Gross Brightener (*LOVE*).</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a first.</li>
            <li>pretty for the first time in  years.</li>
            <li>I love this product and would definitely recommend using it.</li>
            <li>This really helps get my face more younger and clearer.</li>
            <li>First they are so easy to use especially if you travel.  </li>
            <li>These skin resurfacing pads take off the old stuff and give an anti-aging boost in 2 quick steps.</li>
            <li>I had a few breakouts after the first couple of uses which kind of freaked me out</li>
            <li>I am 57 with combination skin, large pores on nose,  and still have acne flair ups.  </li>
            <li>When I ran out I thought I would be smart and save money by getting a substitute product set- PTR Retinol Fusion PM and PTR Un wrinkle peel pads.  </li>
            <li>After I normally wash my face, I use this product and it is interesting to see how much cleaner i become,and the residue that is left on the pad.  </li>
            <li>(I have fine lines and moderate hyperpigmentation).  </li>
            <li>These extra strength pads by Dr. Dennis Gross are amazing.  </li>
            <li>For all the hype and hoopla, I found this product to be a real flop.</li>
            <li>They should be ashamed of themselves for charging so much.</li>
            <li>There is so much product on each pad</li>
            <li>My skin is very oily and I am very strict on washing my face before and after bed and before workouts.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t see much of a difference on those but</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t really do that now.  </li>
            <li>If you intend to use this on your neck, then you might need the whole pad but for my purposes it was sufficient.  </li>
            <li>It really evens out your skin tone and helps to prevent breakouts too.</li>
            <li>Really like the way this product makes my skin look and feel.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After, I have used the pads on my face is absolutely glows and glows all day.  </li>
            <li>Well this stuff is so gentle it fools you.</li>
            <li>I ordered this after reading an article written by Jane Seymore about how much she likes the product.  </li>
            <li>If you have never tried these I would really recommend them.</li>
            <li>Although they have faded some over the years, if it was not for my freckles, they would be very noticeable and it looks like I have hollowed out sunken cheeks, although I do not.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>I really like this peel.</li>
            <li>That said this stuff really works.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone that wants to improve the clarity and texture of their skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>The pads do not actually make your skin peel like a professional grade peel, but the results are still worthwhile.</li>
            <li>I live in Los Angeles - where pretty much everyone uses these types of products after the age of 30.  </li>
            <li>I also love their serums, but I use other brands, too (Boots No. 7, Origins).</li>
            <li>I will certainly be buying this again and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Great exfoliating but pretty expensive.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 50 years old, work full time and have to get my 12 and 14 year old to school before 8:00 a.m. in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Usually i dont write any review but with this product its amazing.</li>
            <li>I used it directly after the first applications were done.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft, really helps my acne, diminishes scars, and brightens and evens out my skintone!</li>
            <li>You can cut the pads in half to get more use.</li>
            <li>My acne scarring is less and my pores are better looking with fewer blackheads.</li>
            <li>Luckily it was over the weekend, so I had a couple of days to peel before going back to work.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin incredibly soft and smooth, evens out my skin tone, and has improved its overall appearance.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>I had high expectations for this product based on the reviews I have read about it.</li>
            <li>This product, although highly rated, does not do anything.</li>
            <li>I heard great reviews about this from a friend, not totally sold on it just yet, but also only half way through the container.</li>
            <li>saw a little change in skin tone and will keep using to see if i get better results.</li>
            <li>My initial observations with the pads marked as 1 was that it smelled pleasantly clean and neutral.  </li>
            <li>My initial observations with the pads marked as 1 was that it smelled pleasantly clean and neutral.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle on my skin but my skin is not too sensitive.</li>
            <li>I use them 2-3 times a week, and my skin is starting to look better than it has in a long time.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also good for poor reduction</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and my skin didn&#x27;t even flake or peel as they state was normal.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m 30 and wanted to try something else or incorporate a new product to my regimen.  </li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve used it, you can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Once application makes your skin look like new.</li>
            <li>The peel is toted as improving skin&#x27;s tone and texture while adding radiance, minimizing pores, reducing breakouts, lightening dark spots and diminishing fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Truly deminishes break outs, fine lines and dark spots.</li>
            <li>I HAVE VERY SENSITIVE SKIN</li>
            <li>Make skin very soft and you can feel them working.</li>
            <li>In using Obagi for several years, I noticed that you can&#x27;t use it consistently.  </li>
            <li>On my first day of use, I used it on the evening replacing my toner (which has alcohol as an ingredient) with the Dr. Gross AB peel.  </li>
            <li>After waiting I put on pad number 2 and did the same thing I did when I applied the first pad.  </li>
            <li>After waiting I put on pad number 2 and did the same thing I did when I applied the first pad.  </li>
            <li>There were some comments on the pads drying out, so I left the foil on top w just enough released to get the pads out, and put them both back in the container they come in.  </li>
            <li>The individually wrapped packets, for about the same price, offer more product and last longer.</li>
            <li>Less than one month &#x3D; huge difference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like anything you use when you start to clean out your skin--sometimes it has to get worse before it can get better (similar to Retin-A).</li>
            <li>There is only a slight burning sensation when you use it but nothing that you won&#x27;t be able to handle.</li>
            <li>Half the pad was more than enough to cleanse and tone my face.  </li>
            <li>Following up the peel/brightener with pure argan oil (+ SPF 50 in the am) leaves my face literally velvety.</li>
            <li>maybe it&#x27;s too early to judge, but I haven&#x27;t really noticed a big difference in my skin other than the fact that it feels really clean and soft immediately after I use the product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not drying and it&#x27;s helping me clear my melasma.</li>
            <li>They are gentle enough to use every night if you wanted.</li>
            <li>The cloth in the packet is larger and much wetter.</li>
            <li>so I did the professional peels in my doctor&#x27;s office (did 4 of them).  </li>
            <li>Her over-50 sensitive skin has visibly improved and she hasn&#x27;t even been using it a month.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of skin care products professional and OTC.</li>
            <li>The process if simple, time efficient and very do-able.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t order it fast enough despite the somewhat steep price tag.  </li>
            <li>I have adult acne</li>
            <li>Thanks Dr Gross!</li>
            <li>I no longer complain about dryness and my pores are nearly invisible now that I&#x27;ve switched to the peels.  </li>
            <li>I no longer complain about dryness and my pores are nearly invisible now that I&#x27;ve switched to the peels.  </li>
            <li>Regular use helps my skin to not break out as much.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it as frequently in the summer while i am trying to tan just like I don&#x27;t use retinol in the Summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A real winner and must have in my daily skin care.</li>
            <li>and I was quite surprised at all the comments and likes that came out of the woodwork.  </li>
            <li>and WOW it burned.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and supple.</li>
            <li>Because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So far I use it every three days, since my skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li>then again, I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize I had sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I especially appreciate that Amazon sells it much cheaper than Sephora.</li>
            <li>I have 40+-yr-old, sensitive, acne- and blackhead-prone skin.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s soft as ever.</li>
            <li>the good thing is you can always half the pads or opt to use it less often than daily (perhaps 3 times a week)</li>
            <li>the good thing is you can always half the pads or opt to use it less often than daily (perhaps 3 times a week)</li>
            <li>I have always had large pores and this is the only product that actually makes my pores look normal size.</li>
            <li>And for something that&#x27;s so easy to use anytime, including in the middle of a busy week, I&#x27;ve come to rely on the little</li>
            <li>This is not typical for me...</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone that wants to improve their tone and exfoliate their face from dry and old skin.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone that wants to improve their tone and exfoliate their face from dry and old skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never loved my skin more.</li>
            <li>I had a problem with acne when I was younger which left me with large pores and scars.</li>
            <li>Ok, yes it&#x27;s pricy however if you consider the amount of money spent trying other cheap products, you end up spending same if not more.</li>
            <li>Reading the previous reviews gave me hope that this product would rejuvenate my skin without the need for more extreme dermatologist&#x27;s procedures.</li>
            <li>The process takes less than 5 minutes so well worth the time.  </li>
            <li>I am a 46 year old woman who had a professional facial and was sold this product at the spa for twice the price.  </li>
            <li>I did not experience any discomfort or stinging on my skin and the product dried quickly.  </li>
            <li>I did not experience any discomfort or stinging on my skin and the product dried quickly.  </li>
            <li>Kinda made me feel like I wasn&#x27;t aging as bad as I thought lol.  </li>
            <li>I even went the extra mile and ordered an extra month&#x27;s worth thinking that perhaps one month of use wasn&#x27;t long enough.  </li>
            <li>What I was left with was baby soft glowing skin.</li>
            <li>I definitely would recommend this product if you do not have discretionary money for a professional grade peel.</li>
            <li>I am 54 years old and wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles but was hoping it would help my pores appear smaller or give me a fresher look.</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty sensitive, so I can&#x27;t use it everyday.</li>
            <li>His face has broken out even more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not normally one to write reviews but on this particular occasion I&#x27;ve decided to make the exception.</li>
            <li>My skin looked great when I was using this, it&#x27;s just a little too expensive for me to use all the time.  </li>
            <li>Much stronger than I expected!</li>
            <li>did significantly increase my moisturizing when I started using the peel, but it&#x27;s also been a harsh dry winter.</li>
            <li>not a single one said that it made any difference at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, Dr. Dennis Gross has had some major product, marketing and packaging changes</li>
            <li>At the age of 42, I bought this because a Sephora salesperson recommended it &#x27;highly&#x27; and had ABSOLUTELY NO change in skin quality</li>
            <li>I called the company to report the doctor&#x27;s findings and they would not talk to me, instead referring me to their barracuda big city attorney who LIED (I have her name) and stated that no reactions of this type had ever happened before and that I was out of luck, that the company and product was not liable.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say my skin looked worse when I was using it than it had from any other product.</li>
            <li>The very first time I used this, the dry dead skin was gone.</li>
            <li>Observing that a whole pad was soaked in the product I opted to half it.  </li>
            <li>I use them religiously every night (they don&#x27;t get dried out either if you keep the foil that covers them when you first use them - replace that over the pads each time and you will not have them drying out at all).  </li>
            <li>and I use them to eliminate fine lines and uneven skin texture in my fight to maintain youthful skin !!!</li>
            <li>But peels are expensive and I did not appreciate the down time of having your whole face come off on you before it gets better.  </li>
            <li>The towelettes in these containers are too small and dry too quickly.  </li>
            <li>For very dry complexions, this product provides the level of exfoliation necessary to restore a natural glow to the skin.  </li>
            <li>Face looks clear and glows, no whole bunch of makeup needed to cover up, just wash and go.</li>

            <li> Love the product.  </li>
            <li> So, I read most of the reviews before I decided to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Face looks fresh, bright, and glowing.  </li>

            <li> Love these skin pads.</li>
            <li> I have received so many compliments on my complexion since I started using it.</li>
            <li> I saw the greatest difference when I used it on the back of my hands!</li>
            <li> I worked in the cosmetic industry for years and have found my skin to look and feel the best when using Dr. Dennis Gross peel pads.</li>

            <li> I think most of us would benefit from</li>
            <li> I love the way it brightens my skin and helps keep the evidence of skin damage under control (I am outdoors ALOT).&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Fabulous product!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I kept using it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been so confident going au naturel....</li>
            <li> To me, it&#x27;s a nice product that should be used in moderation when you see fit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed that there&#x27;s a peel strong enough to fix my issues, but not burn my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> AS IT MAKE MY SKIN VERY CLEAN AND POLISH LOOKING.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s honestly a pretty good product.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with the results that I think the price is just fine.  </li>
            <li> I was able to use it while I was pregnant with no issues and even my husband uses them once in a while!</li>
            <li> Great product, have bought 3 times now does not irritate my sensitive skin ,would recommend .</li>
            <li> While this product is absolutely incredible, I would recommend purchasing the individual packets.  </li>
            <li> I look younger and my skin has greatly improved in many ways:  </li>
            <li> Directions are easy to follow.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use, and didn&#x27;t cause any issues with stinging or redness.</li>
            <li> Easy to use....</li>
            <li> It made me break out, maybe it was too strong for my skin.</li>
            <li> These pads brighten the skin, lesson appearance of pores and fine lines.</li>
            <li> With continued use I am hoping to see improvement in fine lines and diminished sun spots.</li>
            <li> color, pore size, elasticity, fine lines and glow.  </li>
            <li> This is lactic acid based in the first peel which is perfect for melasma and the retinol in the second step</li>
            <li> It is a great addition to my Obagi regimen and it is amazing at exfoliating my skin to reveal that hidden pinkish glow.  </li>
            <li> It is a great addition to my Obagi regimen and it is amazing at exfoliating my skin to reveal that hidden pinkish glow.  </li>
            <li> This product along with clarisonic has made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> Started up again same great results.</li>
            <li> helps keep my skin clear and bright.</li>

            <li> I really enjoy this.</li>
            <li> Even my younger coworkers compliment on how great my skin looks.</li>
            <li> I used one kit over 45 days and it really was amazing.  </li>
            <li> I received the 10 day for free from an Allure prize</li>
            <li> It stings a bit, but well worth it for more smoother even skin tone.</li>
            <li> A great product from Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare.</li>
            <li> I wish it were more reasonably priced or had more &#x27;bells and whistles&#x27;</li>
            <li> Use: on clean skin use step one by lightly rubbing on face and neck...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and easy and I can already see my skin tone even out.</li>
            <li> At first the product made me breakout even more</li>
            <li> B004SCJDC2 Kate Somerville Kate Somerville Clinic-to-Go Resurfacing Peel Pads]], and the original strength [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The package is nice enough that I feel comfortable leaving it out on my bathroom counter top.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited when I saw the price on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a month now, and my skin is significantly brighter.</li>
            <li> To me it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li> Step 2 appears to close the pores and leaves my face feeling exceptionally clean.</li>
            <li> First time I used it, I could tell it was pretty strong, but my skin handled it OK.  </li>
            <li> I always use before a special event.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li> This makes my face feel really clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> Blotchy, pore size, I even have mild Rosacea.  </li>
            <li> Not a miracle quick fix but</li>
            <li> My skin looked very nice after, and some portions are much smoother after only one step.</li>
            <li> Dark spots are gone and wrinkles are greatly diminished.</li>
            <li> I cant wait to see how clear and bright i look when my next 30 day box of peels arrive :)</li>
            <li> my skin is oily and this is a great product for keeping the oil down.</li>
            <li> Also believe that active ingredients in creams and serums are more effective.  </li>
            <li> (Always finish with SPF 30 or higher!)  </li>
            <li> I was even willing to include pictures of my face in this review to use as an example!</li>
            <li> I have noticed smaller pores, diminished fine lines and my face seems to have a fuller more youthful appearance.  </li>
            <li> These pads are great at clearing off dead skin cells and brightening our skin...</li>
            <li> I received the packets of the extra strength pads to try and really liked.</li>
            <li> Worth a try IMO.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as strong as the spa treatment, but I can keep up the treatment on a nightly basis, and that keeps the pores clean and clear of oil buildup.  </li>
            <li> I like to use this system every morning on freshly cleansed skin then follow with serum, moisturizer and mineral makeup.</li>
            <li> I remembered how nice my skin looked after a peel, back when I used to get them.  </li>
            <li> Like most baby boomers, my skin was looking old and porous.</li>
            <li> Honestly this is the only product that has ever truly cleared up my skin.</li>
            <li> the best I hoped for was to not get noticeably worse.  </li>
            <li> The Subscribe &amp; Save option not only offers a great price - it ensures that you won&#x27;t run out, and continuity matters in skin care.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> You can find other products just as good but not as pricey.</li>
            <li> and this dries it right up.</li>
            <li> You will see it improve right before your eyes.</li>
            <li> My beautiful skin was ruined and I was left with stripes and larger pores.  </li>
            <li> It is a quick 5 minute therapy that really works.  </li>
            <li> If you are like me you went through a period of early peels on ebay, then really strong peels in a MD office, phototherapy...and no results except reactive hyper pigmentation ....  </li>
            <li> and it is very gentle.  </li>
            <li> + year old sundamaged skin that is super sensitive to most exfoilants and retinols.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re trying this for the first time, be aware that your skin might &#x27;purge&#x27; itself for the first couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Reduced breakouts, even skintone and smaller pores are the most noticeable differences I have found.</li>
            <li> Although I also get regular facials and eat a healthy diet, so these additional factors will only make your skin even better.</li>
            <li> I switched from using the regular strength every day because this option is considerably more affordable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> wait two minutes then step two leave on over night or use first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> She wants to buy another month&#x27;s supply!</li>
            <li> Overall, her skin looks smoother and more youthful.</li>
            <li> I have used many different kinds of peels from Philosophy and glycolic</li>
            <li> but I am going to reduce use once I am done with the first pack</li>
            <li> As an African American women with very oily brown skin, I had difficulty in finding a product that would do a great job in exfoliating my skin, eliminate my acne and improve areas where there is hyper-pigmentation.  </li>
            <li> Hearing good things about the AB peel, I read a few more reviews and then decided on the Extra strength version.  </li>
            <li> My pores were smaller and my skin was more supple.  </li>
            <li> My pores were smaller and my skin was more supple.  </li>
            <li> ; each morning and night (if you are using for the first time - get 30 pads and use every 3 days, then 2 days, then 1 day - then get your 60 day pads for am/pm.  </li>
            <li> Although the label says you might have a reaction at first, I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> but I figured if I used the extra strength I would get better results.</li>
            <li> I use my mini-micro blade roller first before applying the wipes for maximum penetration into the skin.</li>
            <li> I am pretty amazed.</li>
            <li> A million times better than Dr. Dennis Gross&#x27; peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> I bought this product at Sephora about a year ago and fell in love with it instantly.</li>
            <li> Also used in conjunction with the Dr. Gross Brightener (*LOVE*).</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a first.</li>
            <li> pretty for the first time in  years.</li>
            <li> I love this product and would definitely recommend using it.</li>
            <li> This really helps get my face more younger and clearer.</li>
            <li> First they are so easy to use especially if you travel.  </li>
            <li> These skin resurfacing pads take off the old stuff and give an anti-aging boost in 2 quick steps.</li>
            <li> I had a few breakouts after the first couple of uses which kind of freaked me out</li>
            <li> I am 57 with combination skin, large pores on nose,  and still have acne flair ups.  </li>
            <li> When I ran out I thought I would be smart and save money by getting a substitute product set- PTR Retinol Fusion PM and PTR Un wrinkle peel pads.  </li>
            <li> After I normally wash my face, I use this product and it is interesting to see how much cleaner i become,and the residue that is left on the pad.  </li>
            <li> (I have fine lines and moderate hyperpigmentation).  </li>
            <li> These extra strength pads by Dr. Dennis Gross are amazing.  </li>
            <li> For all the hype and hoopla, I found this product to be a real flop.</li>
            <li> They should be ashamed of themselves for charging so much.</li>
            <li> There is so much product on each pad</li>
            <li> My skin is very oily and I am very strict on washing my face before and after bed and before workouts.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see much of a difference on those but</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t really do that now.  </li>
            <li> If you intend to use this on your neck, then you might need the whole pad but for my purposes it was sufficient.  </li>
            <li> It really evens out your skin tone and helps to prevent breakouts too.</li>
            <li> Really like the way this product makes my skin look and feel.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After, I have used the pads on my face is absolutely glows and glows all day.  </li>
            <li> Well this stuff is so gentle it fools you.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after reading an article written by Jane Seymore about how much she likes the product.  </li>
            <li> If you have never tried these I would really recommend them.</li>
            <li> Although they have faded some over the years, if it was not for my freckles, they would be very noticeable and it looks like I have hollowed out sunken cheeks, although I do not.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> I really like this peel.</li>
            <li> That said this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone that wants to improve the clarity and texture of their skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> The pads do not actually make your skin peel like a professional grade peel, but the results are still worthwhile.</li>
            <li> I live in Los Angeles - where pretty much everyone uses these types of products after the age of 30.  </li>
            <li> I also love their serums, but I use other brands, too (Boots No. 7, Origins).</li>
            <li> I will certainly be buying this again and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great exfoliating but pretty expensive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50 years old, work full time and have to get my 12 and 14 year old to school before 8:00 a.m. in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Usually i dont write any review but with this product its amazing.</li>
            <li> I used it directly after the first applications were done.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft, really helps my acne, diminishes scars, and brightens and evens out my skintone!</li>
            <li> You can cut the pads in half to get more use.</li>
            <li> My acne scarring is less and my pores are better looking with fewer blackheads.</li>
            <li> Luckily it was over the weekend, so I had a couple of days to peel before going back to work.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin incredibly soft and smooth, evens out my skin tone, and has improved its overall appearance.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this product based on the reviews I have read about it.</li>
            <li> This product, although highly rated, does not do anything.</li>
            <li> I heard great reviews about this from a friend, not totally sold on it just yet, but also only half way through the container.</li>
            <li> saw a little change in skin tone and will keep using to see if i get better results.</li>
            <li> My initial observations with the pads marked as 1 was that it smelled pleasantly clean and neutral.  </li>
            <li> My initial observations with the pads marked as 1 was that it smelled pleasantly clean and neutral.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle on my skin but my skin is not too sensitive.</li>
            <li> I use them 2-3 times a week, and my skin is starting to look better than it has in a long time.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also good for poor reduction</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and my skin didn&#x27;t even flake or peel as they state was normal.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m 30 and wanted to try something else or incorporate a new product to my regimen.  </li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve used it, you can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Once application makes your skin look like new.</li>
            <li> The peel is toted as improving skin&#x27;s tone and texture while adding radiance, minimizing pores, reducing breakouts, lightening dark spots and diminishing fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Truly deminishes break outs, fine lines and dark spots.</li>
            <li> I HAVE VERY SENSITIVE SKIN</li>
            <li> Make skin very soft and you can feel them working.</li>
            <li> In using Obagi for several years, I noticed that you can&#x27;t use it consistently.  </li>
            <li> On my first day of use, I used it on the evening replacing my toner (which has alcohol as an ingredient) with the Dr. Gross AB peel.  </li>
            <li> After waiting I put on pad number 2 and did the same thing I did when I applied the first pad.  </li>
            <li> After waiting I put on pad number 2 and did the same thing I did when I applied the first pad.  </li>
            <li> There were some comments on the pads drying out, so I left the foil on top w just enough released to get the pads out, and put them both back in the container they come in.  </li>
            <li> The individually wrapped packets, for about the same price, offer more product and last longer.</li>
            <li> Less than one month &#x3D; huge difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like anything you use when you start to clean out your skin--sometimes it has to get worse before it can get better (similar to Retin-A).</li>
            <li> There is only a slight burning sensation when you use it but nothing that you won&#x27;t be able to handle.</li>
            <li> Half the pad was more than enough to cleanse and tone my face.  </li>
            <li> Following up the peel/brightener with pure argan oil (+ SPF 50 in the am) leaves my face literally velvety.</li>
            <li> maybe it&#x27;s too early to judge, but I haven&#x27;t really noticed a big difference in my skin other than the fact that it feels really clean and soft immediately after I use the product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not drying and it&#x27;s helping me clear my melasma.</li>
            <li> They are gentle enough to use every night if you wanted.</li>
            <li> The cloth in the packet is larger and much wetter.</li>
            <li> so I did the professional peels in my doctor&#x27;s office (did 4 of them).  </li>
            <li> Her over-50 sensitive skin has visibly improved and she hasn&#x27;t even been using it a month.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of skin care products professional and OTC.</li>
            <li> The process if simple, time efficient and very do-able.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t order it fast enough despite the somewhat steep price tag.  </li>
            <li> I have adult acne</li>
            <li> Thanks Dr Gross!</li>
            <li> I no longer complain about dryness and my pores are nearly invisible now that I&#x27;ve switched to the peels.  </li>
            <li> I no longer complain about dryness and my pores are nearly invisible now that I&#x27;ve switched to the peels.  </li>
            <li> Regular use helps my skin to not break out as much.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it as frequently in the summer while i am trying to tan just like I don&#x27;t use retinol in the Summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A real winner and must have in my daily skin care.</li>
            <li> and I was quite surprised at all the comments and likes that came out of the woodwork.  </li>
            <li> and WOW it burned.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> So far I use it every three days, since my skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li> then again, I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize I had sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I especially appreciate that Amazon sells it much cheaper than Sephora.</li>
            <li> I have 40+-yr-old, sensitive, acne- and blackhead-prone skin.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s soft as ever.</li>
            <li> the good thing is you can always half the pads or opt to use it less often than daily (perhaps 3 times a week)</li>
            <li> the good thing is you can always half the pads or opt to use it less often than daily (perhaps 3 times a week)</li>
            <li> I have always had large pores and this is the only product that actually makes my pores look normal size.</li>
            <li> And for something that&#x27;s so easy to use anytime, including in the middle of a busy week, I&#x27;ve come to rely on the little</li>
            <li> This is not typical for me...</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone that wants to improve their tone and exfoliate their face from dry and old skin.  </li>

            <li> I had a problem with acne when I was younger which left me with large pores and scars.</li>
            <li> Ok, yes it&#x27;s pricy however if you consider the amount of money spent trying other cheap products, you end up spending same if not more.</li>
            <li> Reading the previous reviews gave me hope that this product would rejuvenate my skin without the need for more extreme dermatologist&#x27;s procedures.</li>
            <li> The process takes less than 5 minutes so well worth the time.  </li>
            <li> I am a 46 year old woman who had a professional facial and was sold this product at the spa for twice the price.  </li>
            <li> I did not experience any discomfort or stinging on my skin and the product dried quickly.  </li>
            <li> I did not experience any discomfort or stinging on my skin and the product dried quickly.  </li>
            <li> Kinda made me feel like I wasn&#x27;t aging as bad as I thought lol.  </li>
            <li> I even went the extra mile and ordered an extra month&#x27;s worth thinking that perhaps one month of use wasn&#x27;t long enough.  </li>
            <li> What I was left with was baby soft glowing skin.</li>
            <li> I definitely would recommend this product if you do not have discretionary money for a professional grade peel.</li>
            <li> I am 54 years old and wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles but was hoping it would help my pores appear smaller or give me a fresher look.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty sensitive, so I can&#x27;t use it everyday.</li>
            <li> His face has broken out even more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not normally one to write reviews but on this particular occasion I&#x27;ve decided to make the exception.</li>
            <li> My skin looked great when I was using this, it&#x27;s just a little too expensive for me to use all the time.  </li>
            <li> Much stronger than I expected!</li>
            <li> did significantly increase my moisturizing when I started using the peel, but it&#x27;s also been a harsh dry winter.</li>
            <li> not a single one said that it made any difference at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, Dr. Dennis Gross has had some major product, marketing and packaging changes</li>
            <li> At the age of 42, I bought this because a Sephora salesperson recommended it &#x27;highly&#x27; and had ABSOLUTELY NO change in skin quality</li>
            <li> I called the company to report the doctor&#x27;s findings and they would not talk to me, instead referring me to their barracuda big city attorney who LIED (I have her name) and stated that no reactions of this type had ever happened before and that I was out of luck, that the company and product was not liable.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say my skin looked worse when I was using it than it had from any other product.</li>
            <li> The very first time I used this, the dry dead skin was gone.</li>
            <li> Observing that a whole pad was soaked in the product I opted to half it.  </li>
            <li> I use them religiously every night (they don&#x27;t get dried out either if you keep the foil that covers them when you first use them - replace that over the pads each time and you will not have them drying out at all).  </li>
            <li> and I use them to eliminate fine lines and uneven skin texture in my fight to maintain youthful skin !!!</li>
            <li> But peels are expensive and I did not appreciate the down time of having your whole face come off on you before it gets better.  </li>
            <li> The towelettes in these containers are too small and dry too quickly.  </li>
            <li> For very dry complexions, this product provides the level of exfoliation necessary to restore a natural glow to the skin.  </li>
            <li> Face looks clear and glows, no whole bunch of makeup needed to cover up, just wash and go.</li>
            <li> The burning is minimal and it really calms the skin down.</li>
            <li> used this product as directed, along with his All-In-One Facial Cleanser, and have no marked improvement to show for it.  </li>
            <li> Im not sure that I will try for another month due to the cost (I&#x27;ve currently been using the product for 2 weeks straight each night).</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This is the product ive been looking for a long time.</li>
            <li> I found it very strange for an extra strength product to do nothing, not even turn my skin pink.  </li>
            <li> It removes any residue from other facial cleansers.  </li>
            <li> and it does leave your skin feeling dry, but if you moisturize it isn&#x27;t too bothersome.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately the #1 jar is on the dry side, and the pads will be dry before I&#x27;m finished.</li>
            <li> You can get products with the same active ingredients for a quarter of the price anyway.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m going to use the less harsh \\&quot;daily peel\\&quot; (the extra strength does sting upon application!) and use the extra strength one</li>
            <li> I had several dark spots from sun/age</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect any miracles, just slightly above average product.</li>
            <li> Essentially, purchasing this product was equivalent to throwing money down the drain.  </li>
            <li> My skin is recently getting dryer and moisturizers don&#x27;t seem to work in getting it back to its usual glow.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;12 hours later I still feel slightly sunburned</li>
            <li> Left my skin a little dry for the day</li>
            <li> I am half Mexican and white with pale olive complexion.</li>
            <li> A great product with no irritation or peeling or any horrible side effects.</li>
            <li> once every few weeks when I notice that my skin is starting to get a bit flaky.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re expensive, but I think they&#x27;re worth it.</li>
            <li> It is expensive but worth every penny you spend for it.</li>
            <li> I had tried it a few years ago but was hesitant to actually purchase because of the cost.</li>
            <li> As others have suggested, you don&#x27;t necessarily need to use this everyday.</li>
            <li> The zits that do come \\&quot;that time of the month\\&quot; are smaller, dark marks have faded, pores are less visible-</li>
            <li> it is worth the money, but don&#x27;t expect to see dramatic results after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> Late 40&#x27;s, having occasional breakouts around my chin area, and combination oily and dry lifeless skin on my forehead and chin that moisturizer wouldn&#x27;t penetrate.</li>
            <li> I did some research and used some other brand home peels both in bottles and pads.  </li>
            <li> and then every other night.</li>
            <li> which many studies have already found to be dangerous!</li>
            <li> use this just about every other week in the morning after I have cleaned my face.  </li>
            <li> , Downgraded a star because the pads are small, not enough liquid to do face and neck.</li>
            <li> I started with an every other day routine which still yielded results.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave the skin peeling or cause any redness unlike some other products.</li>
            <li> The pads are very wet</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried about it irritating my skin because mine is very sensitive, and I had no problem.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I can think about this product is price.  </li>
            <li> The only negative thing I can think about this product is price.  </li>
            <li> I have dark patches (melasma, hyperpigmentation) on both cheeks and the bridge of my nose.</li>
            <li> I have thin sensitive skin (and also using script retinol)</li>
            <li> All the money I have spent at dermatologist was a waste cpared to the price and difference these have made.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t advise cutting the pads in half, as they aren&#x27;t huge to begin with, but I use the product approximately 3 times per week and see improvement, so that may be enough for others as well.</li>
            <li> but i remedied that by switching from everyday use to every other.  </li>
            <li> , I guess that&#x27;s the skin &amp;#34;purging&amp;#34;, but it wasn&#x27;t a big deal and the pimples were very small and faded</li>
            <li> Since they&#x27;re a bit of a splurge for me, I cut them in half</li>
            <li> In the less than the 30 days my age spots are lightening.  </li>
            <li> I do believe my skin tone is improved and lines are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> And they were almost half the price on here than they were in store at Sephora.  </li>
            <li> I figured the neutralize step would hurt less, but no, it burned also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Initially, I was skeptical but after using the pads for several weeks I have found a difference in the clarity of my skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut the pads in half and used them 2x/day.</li>
            <li> USED PREVIOUSLY AND WILL CONTINUE.</li>
            <li> I can see the improvement in my skin with a few week&#x27;s use; it&#x27;s smoother, less wrinkled, and my slight acne scarring is even slighter now.</li>
            <li> They do sting a little, but nothing unbearable.</li>
            <li> Little to no makeup</li>
            <li> Skin looks brighter and a little firmer.  </li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about the &amp;#34;Extra Strength&amp;#34;, esp.</li>
            <li> Skin feels just a little smoother</li>
            <li> I was desperate to find a cure for my oily, large pore, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product a few times a week for about a year now.</li>
            <li> it actually dried my skin out, made me peel and caused a breakout.</li>
            <li> I saw a noticeable difference within a few uses.</li>
            <li> With my heavy schedule, just don&#x27;t have&lt;br /&gt;the time to experiment and wait.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I noticed that the dried skin from my chin and sides of my cheeks have disappeared.  </li>
            <li> and I noticed that the dried skin from my chin and sides of my cheeks have disappeared.  </li>
            <li> Alas, I am still the same looking person in the mirror.</li>
            <li> Use behind your ears, don&#x27;t forget your neck (back of the neck too ladies) and let it do its job.</li>
            <li> waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m bummed that I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> USE IT FOR A FEW MONTHS.</li>
            <li> every few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend cutting the pads in half, save yourself some money.</li>
            <li> I cut each pad in half and get 60 days out of this set (because I&#x27;m frugal!)</li>
            <li> It is about half the retail store price!</li>
            <li> This cleanser removes all makeup, including mascara (not sure about waterproof mascara, though) and never leaves my skin feeling tight.</li>
            <li> A short time after using the Alpha Beta Peel, I noticed a dramatic improvement in my skin tone and texture.  </li>
            <li> I initially thought the product was expensive.  </li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m still getting small breakouts, so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me or if the product is just not doing its job.</li>
            <li> I have repeated this process for the past 3 days</li>
            <li> No more flake dryness anywhere just a radiant glowing skin.&lt;br</li>

            <li> No more flake dryness anywhere just a radiant glowing skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s even more expensive :().</li>
            <li> I only use these twice a week b/c they&#x27;re so expensive</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m just lazy.</li>
            <li> apologized profusely, telling me that bad reaction HAD HAPPENED BEFORE with other(s) and that they would do everything in their power to help me get my skin fixed: facials, microdermabrasian, paying for dermatologist visits, whatever</li>
            <li> and was looking to clear up some acne/unevenness after years of bad skin.</li>
            <li> in my late 20&#x27;s and for me the results have been about the same.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was afraid that it would leave my skin red</li>
            <li> I have been on the Obagi regimen since my late college years.  </li>
            <li> but I posted a silly selfie the other day to my Facebook.</li>
            <li> This is expensive stuff, but it works, unlike other products that claim to.</li>
            <li> The changes in my skin is not drastic but subtle.</li>
            <li> Might work if your a teenager but not for serious skin care.  </li>
            <li> give this a try to improve skin after bad teenage acne.</li>
            <li> I have never experienced any chemical burns or severe dryness as others have complained of but</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a pleasant thing to go through.  </li>
            <li> I am ALWAYS getting complimented on my skin, and I&#x27;m in my late 50&#x27;s!  </li>
            <li> She always struggled with dry, blotchy skin and painful acne.</li>
            <li> Last year, I had a microdermabrasion procedure done by my dermatologist that was extremely uncomfortable and bordered on  painful.  </li>
            <li> Its worse.  </li>
            <li> This product has reduced the redness and acne in a dramatic way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit on the expensive side</li>
            <li> way too expensive but works.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical after I read the rave reviews for this product.  </li>
            <li> Wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive, but I made the mistake of trying them once and got hooked.</li>
            <li> It took approximately 10 days for my skin to heal and the results were disappointing.  </li>
            <li> These have been my mainstay for years and you can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to these pads!  </li>
            <li> won.&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical that an at home peel would do anything at all.</li>
            <li> I just chose the wrong strength for my skin type.</li>
            <li> But it is usually so expensive.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> it is scary to think that my face was holding all of this residue before i began using this product!</li>
            <li> Expensive mistake!</li>
            <li> Very expensive with no results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m soooo disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> The 2 steps aren&#x27;t too annoying</li>
            <li> used to get peels at my derm, but the harshness is too brutal for post-accutane skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product!  I cut each pad in half and get 60 days out of this set (because I&#x27;m frugal!) and I swear by it.  My skin is so much better with it and I try never to miss a day!</li>
            <li> The best product  for problem skin. My skin is very happy and now my partner has discovered it, so I have to share.</li>
            <li> I have always had large pores and this is the only product that actually makes my pores look normal size. It also greatly reduced the redness of my skin. If you&#x27;re trying this for the first time, be aware that your skin might &#x27;purge&#x27; itself for the first couple of weeks. I will definitely use these for the rest of my life. Since they&#x27;re a bit of a splurge for me, I cut them in half so I get two months out of 30 pads.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on the reviews about a year ago and i must say i&#x27;m glad i did. Ok, yes it&#x27;s pricy however if you consider the amount of money spent trying other cheap products, you end up spending same if not more. I have oily acne prone skin this product has made my skin the best it&#x27;s ever looked. I stopped using it once i moved to South Florida. Big mistake! Started up again same great results. Face looks clear and glows, no whole bunch of makeup needed to cover up, just wash and go.</li>
            <li> Love these pads! They are gentle enough to use every night if you wanted. They make my face feel great</li>
            <li> These are great and work like they claim.  I do prefer Peter Thomas Roth pads 1  step for 3 minutes, works great.</li>
            <li> This product produces noticeable differences in my skin. Reduced breakouts, even skintone and smaller pores are the most noticeable differences I have found. Although I also get regular facials and eat a healthy diet, so these additional factors will only make your skin even better. A great product with no irritation or peeling or any horrible side effects. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This makes my face feel really clean and fresh.  After I normally wash my face, I use this product and it is interesting to see how much cleaner i become,and the residue that is left on the pad.  it is scary to think that my face was holding all of this residue before i began using this product!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  They have cleared my son&#x27;s stubborn acne in just a couple of weeks and I use them to eliminate fine lines and uneven skin texture in my fight to maintain youthful skin !!!</li>
            <li> I had a problem with acne when I was younger which left me with large pores and scars. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks, and my scars have faded quite a bit and my pores have shrunk drastically. It also leaves your skin feeling so smooth! I will keep using this from now on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit on the expensive side and it does leave your skin feeling dry, but if you moisturize it isn&#x27;t too bothersome. I&#x27;d say overall it is worth the money, but don&#x27;t expect to see dramatic results after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product a few times a week for about a year now. I switched from using the regular strength every day because this option is considerably more affordable.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s and for me the results have been about the same.&lt;br /&gt;It helps keep my skin clear and bright. When I don&#x27;t use it for a week I can see and feel the difference. And for something that&#x27;s so easy to use anytime, including in the middle of a busy week, I&#x27;ve come to rely on the little pick me up it gives my skin.</li>
            <li> I received the packets of the extra strength pads to try and really liked.I have used a product simular to this and it was in a jar and had lots of liquid&lt;br /&gt;to spare, which was great, so that is why I purchased the jars this time.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the #1 jar is on the dry side, and the pads will be dry before I&#x27;m finished. The #2 jar is perfect. I am on auto ship, so I switched my next&lt;br /&gt;shipment to the packets. The cloth in the packet is larger and much wetter. Expensive mistake!</li>
            <li> For all the hype and hoopla, I found this product to be a real flop. It didn&#x27;t just fall short- it actually dried my skin out, made me peel and caused a breakout. I can honestly say my skin looked worse when I was using it than it had from any other product. You can get products with the same active ingredients for a quarter of the price anyway. They should be ashamed of themselves for charging so much.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Use it everyday and watch your skin turn flawless. I even use it around my eyes. I look much younger than I am.</li>
            <li> I was impressed how soon I noticed a positive change to my skin. I saw a noticeable difference within a few uses. These pads brighten the skin, lesson appearance of pores and fine lines. Use: on clean skin use step one by lightly rubbing on face and neck...wait two minutes then step two leave on over night or use first thing in the morning. After about 15 minutes I moisturize. There is so much product on each pad I cut the pads in two which makes them go further.</li>
            <li> First I have great skin but after menopause not so nice.  Blotchy, pore size, I even have mild Rosacea.  I also was a sun goddess back in the day so started to see brown spots as well.  I needed drastic measures so I did the professional peels in my doctor&#x27;s office (did 4 of them).  It did help some but it&#x27;s not a pleasant thing to go through.  I did some research and used some other brand home peels both in bottles and pads.  These extra strength pads by Dr. Dennis Gross are amazing.  I will soon be going on my 3rd month of using them and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  First they are so easy to use especially if you travel.  I use them religiously every night (they don&#x27;t get dried out either if you keep the foil that covers them when you first use them - replace that over the pads each time and you will not have them drying out at all).  I saw results at end of month.  My skin started to glow, redness started to lighten up, more even skin tone and pore size diminished greatly.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with these.  Worth a try IMO.</li>
            <li> Great product!Really was a nice treat for your skin and a great price considering what others sell it for. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Best skin product around. I get so many compliments on my skin now. It cleared up a skin irritation. You can cut the pads in half to get more use.</li>
            <li> i bought this product hoping that it would do what it said it would,but it actually ended up breaking out my skin.everything may not work the same for every person but personally i would not use this product again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my mom and she is thrilled with it. She wants to buy another month&#x27;s supply! Her over-50 sensitive skin has visibly improved and she hasn&#x27;t even been using it a month. She always struggled with dry, blotchy skin and painful acne. This product has reduced the redness and acne in a dramatic way. Overall, her skin looks smoother and more youthful.</li>
            <li> I was desperate to find a cure for my oily, large pore, acne prone skin. However these pads were not it. Very expensive with no results.</li>
            <li> I have used many different kinds of peels from Philosophy and glycolic and I will say this is the best. I have noticed my skin is smoother and even in texture and tone after 2 weeks. My acne scarring is less and my pores are better looking with fewer blackheads. I am half Mexican and white with pale olive complexion. My skin is very oily and I am very strict on washing my face before and after bed and before workouts. I use this almost every night but I am going to reduce use once I am done with the first pack and then every other night. It is gentle on my skin but my skin is not too sensitive.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It does a great job in softening, smoothing and tightening skin. It also helps out with discolorations&lt;br /&gt;and it help my pores and reduce acne breakouts. I would recommend this product. I wish it came in a larger size for the price of the product.</li>
            <li> My \\&quot;over 50\\&quot; skin that spent way too many days in the sun is now in great shape! Dark spots are gone and wrinkles are greatly diminished. The results don&#x27;t happen over night, but I am in my second month of using the product every night and the results are very impressive. The extra-strength was necessary for the sun damage, and I am told I look ten years younger! Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and I have noticed a different in my skin.  At first the product made me breakout even more but i remedied that by switching from everyday use to every other.  I have tried a lot of skin care products professional and OTC. This product by far as been the best. The changes in my skin is not drastic but subtle. There is only a slight burning sensation when you use it but nothing that you won&#x27;t be able to handle. Also I wait a good 20 minutes before i put anything on my face as to let the peel do its work.  I will continue using with hopes to see more progress. Would recommend this product to a friend with acne issues.</li>
            <li> It is a great product and I can not go with out! It immediatly brightens skin and over all helps the condition.</li>
            <li> This product is great for clearer skin.  It does the job for reducing blemishes.  With continued use I am hoping to see improvement in fine lines and diminished sun spots.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this. The 2 steps aren&#x27;t too annoying and I feel I see wonderful results when used daily, but I also use ExfoliKate [[ASIN:B002M3NV2C Kate Somerville ExfoliKate(R) Intensive Exfoliating Treatment 2 oz]], Clinic-to-Go [[ASIN:B004SCJDC2 Kate Somerville Kate Somerville Clinic-to-Go Resurfacing Peel Pads]], and the original strength [[ASIN:B000NPAJYY MD Skincare Alpha Beta Daily Face Peel- 2 Steps, 30 Applications]].&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I do like all of the above products, but if I do have to choose just one it would be this.</li>
            <li> way too expensive but works.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical after I read the rave reviews for this product.  I&#x27;m only two weeks into using it and am entirely impressed with the results.  I look younger and my skin has greatly improved in many ways:  color, pore size, elasticity, fine lines and glow.  I&#x27;m 50 years old, work full time and have to get my 12 and 14 year old to school before 8:00 a.m. in the morning.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to commit to time intensive regimes.  The process if simple, time efficient and very do-able.  I went to a party tonight and had three people compliment me on my complexion (never had that before).  The package is nice enough that I feel comfortable leaving it out on my bathroom counter top.  I initially thought the product was expensive.  I&#x27;m so pleased with the results that I think the price is just fine.  I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 28 with combination oily skin that just doesn&#x27;t like to behave, so when I saw an on-air presentation of Dr. Dennis Gross&#x27;s Extra Strength AHA/BHA Peel I couldn&#x27;t order it fast enough despite the somewhat steep price tag.  The peel is toted as improving skin&#x27;s tone and texture while adding radiance, minimizing pores, reducing breakouts, lightening dark spots and diminishing fine lines and wrinkles.  My skin could benefit from all of the above, especially minimizing pore size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product as directed, along with his All-In-One Facial Cleanser, and have no marked improvement to show for it.  I even went the extra mile and ordered an extra month&#x27;s worth thinking that perhaps one month of use wasn&#x27;t long enough.  Essentially, purchasing this product was equivalent to throwing money down the drain.  My skin now looks identical to how it did 2 months ago.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I started using it about 2 years ago. Late 40&#x27;s, having occasional breakouts around my chin area, and combination oily and dry lifeless skin on my forehead and chin that moisturizer wouldn&#x27;t penetrate. The very first time I used this, the dry dead skin was gone. I was afraid that it would leave my skin red but it didn&#x27;t at all. What I was left with was baby soft glowing skin. At first I used it every third day and after that, no more breakouts around my mouth or chin. I invested in a Clairsonic brush too and while I use the Clairsonic daily I only need to use the alpha beta peel once every few weeks when I notice that my skin is starting to get a bit flaky. Yes it&#x27;s pricy but I&#x27;m not using it daily so it lasts a long time. Even my younger coworkers compliment on how great my skin looks. I highly recommend this product. I wish I&#x27;d found it years ago.</li>
            <li> Wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive, but I made the mistake of trying them once and got hooked. I will always have these on hand, they make my skin smooth and bright. They do sting a little, but nothing unbearable. Makes it feel like they are truly working :)</li>
            <li> This is the product ive been looking for a long time. This really helps get my face more younger and clearer. Darkspots fades away and you will notice the result in just a week. Usually i dont write any review but with this product its amazing.</li>
            <li> very effective, I have always LOVED these Beta pads, they are so refreshing for  my skin! I use them every night too!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I am so glad that I came across this skin care product.  I have adult acne and I used to pay tons of money on spa chemical peels and dermabrasion treatments.  Now I can take care of my own skin at home.  It&#x27;s not as strong as the spa treatment, but I can keep up the treatment on a nightly basis, and that keeps the pores clean and clear of oil buildup.  Big thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I used this product every day for 2 months. My skin flaked up a lot but otherwise, it did nothing.</li>
            <li> my skin is oily and this is a great product for keeping the oil down. does it reduce pore size? i haven&#x27;t yet seen that happen. but i will keep trying.</li>
            <li> Wish this product existed in my teenage years!  I am 57 with combination skin, large pores on nose,  and still have acne flair ups.  This product along with clarisonic has made a huge difference.  Pore clogging debri removed from skin and no question about it - my skin is brighter, more even toned, clearer, softer, and glows.  Also believe that active ingredients in creams and serums are more effective.  I use the extra strength pads 3-4 times a week.  A must have in my skin care routine!</li>
            <li> Not a miracle quick fix but my skin looks clearer and smoother.  I had several dark spots from sun/age and I don&#x27;t see much of a difference on those but the rest of my skin looks brighter.  Im not sure that I will try for another month due to the cost (I&#x27;ve currently been using the product for 2 weeks straight each night).</li>
            <li> I only use this skincare when I have time to wait for my skin to grow back. . With my heavy schedule, just don&#x27;t have&lt;br /&gt;the time to experiment and wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Renee Evers</li>
            <li> My skin looked great when I was using this, it&#x27;s just a little too expensive for me to use all the time.  I like to make it a season change treat for my skin every 3 or 4 months.</li>
            <li> i HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT ALMOST DAILY FOR ONE YEAR AND THE RESULTS ARE AMAZING.  IT HAS SMOOTHED MY SKIN LIKE THE SURFACE OF A PEACH. I HAVE VERY SENSITIVE SKIN AND YET I HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH SURFACE ALLERGY OR REDNESS.  YOU MUST ONLY USE THIS PRODUCT AT NIGHT BEFORE BED AND REMEMBER TO APPLY YOUR SERUMS AND OR NIGHT TIME MOISTURIZER.  I USE BOTH.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT IF YOU DO NOT LIKE THE TEXTURE OF YOUR SKIN.</li>
            <li> These skin resurfacing pads take off the old stuff and give an anti-aging boost in 2 quick steps. I like to use this system every morning on freshly cleansed skin then follow with serum, moisturizer and mineral makeup.</li>
            <li> I love it and I can totally see a difference when I use them. They&#x27;re expensive, but I think they&#x27;re worth it.</li>
            <li> I know everyone&#x27;s been raving about this product, but I&#x27;m still waiting to love it. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week, so maybe it&#x27;s too early to judge, but I haven&#x27;t really noticed a big difference in my skin other than the fact that it feels really clean and soft immediately after I use the product. Also, I&#x27;m still getting small breakouts, so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me or if the product is just not doing its job. Hoping it&#x27;ll become more effective.</li>
            <li> price on Amazon is definitely better than purchasing it in a store! My skin is pretty sensitive, so I can&#x27;t use it everyday. Will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> i have used this for years...it does help stop the aging process...</li>
            <li> This product did wonders for my facial acne. I also used it on the pimply bumps on my upper arms. The red discoloration disappeared and the bumps are gone: this stuff works everywhere! I will be sure to repeat every six months! Thanks Dr Gross!</li>
            <li> Have tried many products to reduce age spots.  In the less than the 30 days my age spots are lightening.  The process takes less than 5 minutes so well worth the time.  Directions are easy to follow.</li>
            <li> Returned item.  Doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype.  Might work if your a teenager but not for serious skin care.  Would not recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> As an African American women with very oily brown skin, I had difficulty in finding a product that would do a great job in exfoliating my skin, eliminate my acne and improve areas where there is hyper-pigmentation.  A short time after using the Alpha Beta Peel, I noticed a dramatic improvement in my skin tone and texture.  I always receive compliments from friends and strangers.  Last year, I had a microdermabrasion procedure done by my dermatologist that was extremely uncomfortable and bordered on  painful.  It took approximately 10 days for my skin to heal and the results were disappointing.  I use this product once a week and found it has done a better job than the microdermabrasion procedure.  I will continue to use this product for maintenance and see if there will be additional improvement.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product based on recommendations of friends and I&#x27;m glad I tried it.  I have been on the Obagi regimen since my late college years.  Now I&#x27;m 30 and wanted to try something else or incorporate a new product to my regimen.  I use Cerave moisturizing wash, Obagi toner and Obagi tretinoin cream .1 in the evening and a glycol moisturizer in the morning with sunscreen and it has worked to make my skin supple and glowing.  In using Obagi for several years, I noticed that you can&#x27;t use it consistently.  My dermatologist recommended that I take breaks or add another product that will shock my skin as if going on a &amp;#34;restart&amp;#34; before I get back into the regular Obagi regimen.  My skin is recently getting dryer and moisturizers don&#x27;t seem to work in getting it back to its usual glow.  I remembered how nice my skin looked after a peel, back when I used to get them.  But peels are expensive and I did not appreciate the down time of having your whole face come off on you before it gets better.  I did this when I was reviewing for the bar and I could hide out indoors for weeks at a time but I can&#x27;t really do that now.  Hearing good things about the AB peel, I read a few more reviews and then decided on the Extra strength version.  I did not know what the difference was having no experience whatsoever between these products.  I figured I wanted something that will deliver the best results in the shortest time possible so I went for the Extra strength and I do not regret this decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item arrived a day earlier than promised and it was packaged well with bubble wrap around the cylindrical carton tube that held the two containers.  On my first day of use, I used it on the evening replacing my toner (which has alcohol as an ingredient) with the Dr. Gross AB peel.  Observing that a whole pad was soaked in the product I opted to half it.  Half the pad was more than enough to cleanse and tone my face.  If you intend to use this on your neck, then you might need the whole pad but for my purposes it was sufficient.  My initial observations with the pads marked as 1 was that it smelled pleasantly clean and neutral.  There were no overpowering smells of additives or perfumes in the pads and putting it on my skin was easy and pleasant.  I did not experience any discomfort or stinging on my skin and the product dried quickly.  As stated in the instructions, I waited over 2 minutes to have it absorb fully into my skin.  After waiting I put on pad number 2 and did the same thing I did when I applied the first pad.  After waiting 2 minutes, I applied my regular Obagi Tretinoin and went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I woke up, I immediately noticed a more radiant glow.  My pores were smaller and my skin was more supple.  Repeating this process again in the morning, I put on my glycolic moisturizer after and topped it off with sunscreen.  I have repeated this process for the past 3 days and I noticed that the dried skin from my chin and sides of my cheeks have disappeared.  No more flake dryness anywhere just a radiant glowing skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sold on this product.  It is a great addition to my Obagi regimen and it is amazing at exfoliating my skin to reveal that hidden pinkish glow.  I no longer complain about dryness and my pores are nearly invisible now that I&#x27;ve switched to the peels.  I recommend this product to anyone that wants to improve their tone and exfoliate their face from dry and old skin.  The only negative thing I can think about this product is price.  It is not chump change buying this peel but the good thing is you can always half the pads or opt to use it less often than daily (perhaps 3 times a week) once you&#x27;ve achieved your desired results.  It is expensive but worth every penny you spend for it.might need the whole pad but for my purposes it was sufficient.

            <li> I have been using this product for a while. I just looked at the bottom of the plastic jar and surprisingly found that it is plastic #7 ( containing BPA) which many studies have already found to be dangerous!</li>
            <li> Great product. It really evens out your skin tone and helps to prevent breakouts too. I will certainly be buying this again and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product, have bought 3 times now does not irritate my sensitive skin ,would recommend .</li>
            <li> So great--bought this after my friend recommended it. I&#x27;ve never loved my skin more. Excellent product, I use it every morning and my skin is GLOWING.</li>
            <li> I heard great reviews about this from a friend, not totally sold on it just yet, but also only half way through the container. Not sure if it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have followed the directions but have seen no improvement in skin tone or texture nor have I experienced any skin peeling or flaking as the product advertised.</li>
            <li> Really like the way this product makes my skin look and feel.  I use at night and wake up with a glow in the morning.  If I want to have that glow during the day, I&#x27;ll opt to use it with my morning regimen.  (Always finish with SPF 30 or higher!)  I do believe my skin tone is improved and lines are less noticeable.  I&#x27;m on subscribe &amp; save so I don&#x27;t ever have to go without!</li>
            <li> Like most baby boomers, my skin was looking old and porous. Reading the previous reviews gave me hope that this product would rejuvenate my skin without the need for more extreme dermatologist&#x27;s procedures. Alas, I am still the same looking person in the mirror. The promises of this skin peel product did not hold to be true.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money for better snake oil</li>
            <li> These have been my mainstay for years and you can&#x27;t go wrong.  It is a quick 5 minute therapy that really works.  My routine; each morning and night (if you are using for the first time - get 30 pads and use every 3 days, then 2 days, then 1 day - then get your 60 day pads for am/pm.  You will look younger, pores smaller, lines are smaller.  Use behind your ears, don&#x27;t forget your neck (back of the neck too ladies) and let it do its job. I did purchase the EVIS Red which I just received to help as well.  I will let you know in a review by month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JanSimpson</li>
            <li> These are my favorite peels.  They are kind of pricey but I keep buying them because they keep making my skin look nice.  Regular use helps my skin to not break out as much.  I always use before a special event.</li>
            <li> Watch out, this stuff is strong!  First time I used it, I could tell it was pretty strong, but my skin handled it OK.  Two days later I used it again, and woke up the next day with a red face!  I gave myself a chemical burn!  Luckily it was over the weekend, so I had a couple of days to peel before going back to work.  So, fair warning, go lightly with this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product line for years and love love love it. Yes, Dr. Dennis Gross has had some major product, marketing and packaging changes but I still love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this just about every other week in the morning after I have cleaned my face.  I don&#x27;t use it as frequently in the summer while i am trying to tan just like I don&#x27;t use retinol in the Summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After, I have used the pads on my face is absolutely glows and glows all day.  Its that healthy glow and like after I have left my Eustachian glow.  After using this I apply the Dr. Dennis Gross moisture tint.</li>
            <li> Great Amazon price and product fo 40+ year old sundamaged skin that is super sensitive to most exfoilants and retinols. A real winner and must have in my daily skin care.</li>
            <li> Honestly this is the only product that has ever truly cleared up my skin. I&#x27;m not normally one to write reviews but on this particular occasion I&#x27;ve decided to make the exception. I used this product leading up to my wedding in January to keep my skin under control. When I&#x27;ve had really deep cystic pimples this is the only thing that reduces them. I was able to use it while I was pregnant with no issues and even my husband uses them once in a while!</li>
            <li> This stuff is $$$.  I used one kit over 45 days and it really was amazing.  I had totally given up on any product ever actually helping my skin ever glow, the best I hoped for was to not get noticeably worse.  Well this stuff is so gentle it fools you. If you are like me you went through a period of early peels on ebay, then really strong peels in a MD office, phototherapy...and no results except reactive hyper pigmentation ....  This is lactic acid based in the first peel which is perfect for melasma and the retinol in the second step just kicks it in. I never peeled with this, just tried to use it 5 days a week.  When I ran out I thought I would be smart and save money by getting a substitute product set- PTR Retinol Fusion PM and PTR Un wrinkle peel pads.  Yeah that worked as well as water.  I am probably harsher than I should be but I posted a silly selfie the other day to my Facebook. Little to no makeup and I was quite surprised at all the comments and likes that came out of the woodwork.  Kinda made me feel like I wasn&#x27;t aging as bad as I thought lol.  Of course that is not what it is about but even my kid was like gosh Mom whats going on?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to these pads!  And they were almost half the price on here than they were in store at Sephora.  I use them 2-3 times a week, and my skin is starting to look better than it has in a long time.  It does bring out imperfections at the beginning, but if you&#x27;ve ever had a facial, you know that you have to release the toxins before you can have glowing skin.  There were some comments on the pads drying out, so I left the foil on top w just enough released to get the pads out, and put them both back in the container they come in.  No dryness yet!!  Totally worth the amazing price!!!</li>
            <li> Far and away the best alpha-hydroxy product available without a prescription.  For very dry complexions, this product provides the level of exfoliation necessary to restore a natural glow to the skin.  The Subscribe &amp; Save option not only offers a great price - it ensures that you won&#x27;t run out, and continuity matters in skin care.</li>
            <li> I received the 10 day for free from an Allure prize I won.&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical that an at home peel would do anything at all. I tried this out and WOW it burned. I have thin sensitive skin (and also using script retinol) so it may have something to do with it. Keep a fan or waving paper nearby. I figured the neutralize step would hurt less, but no, it burned also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it was only 2-4 minutes of pain per step(fanning helped!). My skin looked very nice after, and some portions are much smoother after only one step. Much stronger than I expected! Some of my blackheads were falling out after, which is great! Don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s enough to help with my cystic acne at all, but we&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12 hours later I still feel slightly sunburned (although do not look it! big plus) so I won&#x27;t be using this daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Downgraded a star because the pads are small, not enough liquid to do face and neck. Plus, the pads alone are quite abrasive.</li>
            <li> This alpha beta peel and the Retin-A cream I use at night are the two skin care items I would not do without. I&#x27;ve been using it since 2009 when my sister-in-law, who had been using it for a while, let me try it.  I saw results immediately. My skin was smoother and had more of a glow. Although the label says you might have a reaction at first, I didn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s like anything you use when you start to clean out your skin--sometimes it has to get worse before it can get better (similar to Retin-A). This is expensive stuff, but it works, unlike other products that claim to. Because of these products, I can save on moisturizers, etc. I am ALWAYS getting complimented on my skin, and I&#x27;m in my late 50&#x27;s!  That never used to happen. I&#x27;m one of those adult-acne-prone people, and I&#x27;m not anymore since I started using the alpha beta peel. Recently I got a sample of the extra-strength version of this. I tried it without any problems, so I may start using it (it&#x27;s even more expensive :(). I never leave home without their travel packets; they&#x27;re great.  I also wash with Dr. Dennis Gross&#x27; All-in-One Facial Cleanser with Toner. This cleanser removes all makeup, including mascara (not sure about waterproof mascara, though) and never leaves my skin feeling tight. Plus I don&#x27;t have to buy and use toner--another step and cost. I also love their serums, but I use other brands, too (Boots No. 7, Origins). Their tinted moisturizer is great--really disappears on my skin, but I need to add additional moisturizer, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> great product. I am a 46 year old woman who had a professional facial and was sold this product at the spa for twice the price.  Love the product.  My skin is soft and supple.</li>
            <li> So, I read most of the reviews before I decided to purchase this product. Initially, I was skeptical but after using the pads for several weeks I have found a difference in the clarity of my skin.  Because I have sensitive skin I started with an every other day routine which still yielded results. The pads do not actually make your skin peel like a professional grade peel, but the results are still worthwhile. The pads are very wet so I often squeeze some of the liquid before using them. I definitely would recommend this product if you do not have discretionary money for a professional grade peel.</li>
            <li> used daily and found the product improving my skin appearance...one of the best i tried so far ....will probably reorder</li>
            <li> I love this product.  The burning is minimal and it really calms the skin down. It doesn&#x27;t leave the skin peeling or cause any redness unlike some other products. Face looks fresh, bright, and glowing.  You must follow the instructions to get the best results.</li>
            <li> While this product is absolutely incredible, I would recommend purchasing the individual packets.  The towelettes in these containers are too small and dry too quickly.  The individually wrapped packets, for about the same price, offer more product and last longer.</li>
            <li> Since I began using this product, I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is softer and brown spots are diminished. So far I use it every three days, since my skin is sensitive. However I plan to increase the frequency and expect to see greater results...will update my post at that point. As for now, I really love this product and plan on purchasing it again!</li>
            <li> I have used the regular alpha beta peel and it worked but I figured if I used the extra strength I would get better results. It made me break out, maybe it was too strong for my skin. I will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of brightening the skin. I use my mini-micro blade roller first before applying the wipes for maximum penetration into the skin. It stings a bit, but well worth it for more smoother even skin tone.</li>
            <li> Great exfoliating but pretty expensive.  You can find other products just as good but not as pricey.</li>
            <li> good product. saw a little change in skin tone and will keep using to see if i get better results.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after reading an article written by Jane Seymore about how much she likes the product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 45 days as a two step system (have already reordered once) and am very pleased with the result.  It&#x27;s quick and easy and I can already see my skin tone even out.</li>
            <li> If you have never tried these I would really recommend them.All the money I have spent at dermatologist was a waste cpared to the price and difference these have made. Better than anything I have ever tried!!!!</li>
            <li> Love these skin pads. Make skin very soft and you can feel them working. Skin looks brighter and a little firmer.  It is my 3rd time using them and I&#x27;ll continue to order them. Found that amazon has the best price on them.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing beauty product I have ever used. Once you&#x27;ve used it, you can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I am pretty amazed. I have dark patches (melasma, hyperpigmentation) on both cheeks and the bridge of my nose. I&#x27;ve used everything from a 4% hydroquinone cream to a prescription medication called Finacea to remove these spots and NOTHING worked like this peel in combo with the Dr. Dennis Gross Ferulic Acid. Less than one month &#x3D; huge difference.</li>
            <li> Do not use ANY products by this company, UNLESS YOU WANT TO RISK RUINING YOUR SKIN.  Years ago as a busy mom, I bought a Dr. Dennis Gross in-home facial kit from Costco and applied all the products in order carefully according to directions (which I read several times to insure I was applying correctly).  When I removed the heated facial mask at the appointed time, my cheeks were permanently damaged!!!  They were bunched up and raised like cauliflower and it was absolutely horrifying. To this day I have stripes on my cheeks from the damage this product did.  Although they have faded some over the years, if it was not for my freckles, they would be very noticeable and it looks like I have hollowed out sunken cheeks, although I do not.  Further, I immediately contacted the Dr. Dennis Gross company and a lady there (I have her name somewhere) apologized profusely, telling me that bad reaction HAD HAPPENED BEFORE with other(s) and that they would do everything in their power to help me get my skin fixed: facials, microdermabrasian, paying for dermatologist visits, whatever and she advised me to see my dermatologist and report back as to how they could help me(several friends heard this conversation on speakerphone).  I then visited the dermatologist who told me not to use any products on my skin beyond vaseline and Cetaphil, that my skin had been severely damaged and that I could no longer get facials.  My beautiful skin was ruined and I was left with stripes and larger pores.  To this day, I cannot use anything else also and I cannot get facials.  I called the company to report the doctor&#x27;s findings and they would not talk to me, instead referring me to their barracuda big city attorney who LIED (I have her name) and stated that no reactions of this type had ever happened before and that I was out of luck, that the company and product was not liable. When I stated that I had three speakerphone witnesses who heard the company say it had happened before she back-tracked her lies, but still would not take responsibility. Dr. Dennis Gross products ruined my skin and they did not care.  I have before and after photos of the damage. Guard your skin, you can have permanent damage like me if you use this company&#x27;s products.  Pass it on, so no one you care about gets damaged.her lies, but still would not take responsibility.

            <li> I just want to help the people out there who are buying this product based on the reviews to date.  I live in Los Angeles - where pretty much everyone uses these types of products after the age of 30.  At the age of 42, I bought this because a Sephora salesperson recommended it &#x27;highly&#x27; and had ABSOLUTELY NO change in skin quality (I have fine lines and moderate hyperpigmentation).  I thought that maybe my lines and spots needed an extra boost so I decided to give it another shot and repurchased the product.  I used it directly after the first applications were done.  Again, no visible results.  I talked to some friends of mine and it turns out they all tried the product too (based on it&#x27;s &#x27;cheaper then a dermatologist price&#x27;) and not a single one said that it made any difference at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This sis not work for me.</li>
            <li> I seen clearer looking skin. My blemish marks faded about 75% ... better than nothing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s honestly a pretty good product. I have very oily skin and this dries it right up. I have never experienced any chemical burns or severe dryness as others have complained of but then again, I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin. I bought this because of the reviews on shrinking pores. I can&#x27;t say that I have noticed any difference in my pore size. Overall it&#x27;s a good product but I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s worth the price. If it were cheaper, I may purchase again. But as of now... probably not. Don&#x27;t expect any miracles, just slightly above average product.</li>
            <li> I really like this peel. it&#x27;s not drying and it&#x27;s helping me clear my melasma. It&#x27;s also good for poor reduction</li>
            <li> I only use these twice a week b/c they&#x27;re so expensive but what a difference they make. Once application makes your skin look like new. Left my skin a little dry for the day but nothing I couldn&#x27;t deel with</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m soooo disappointed in this product. I am 54 years old and wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles but was hoping it would help my pores appear smaller or give me a fresher look. I&#x27;ve used the product as stated but no results...nothing. I have very sensitive skin and my skin didn&#x27;t even flake or peel as they state was normal.Everything bothers my skin! I found it very strange for an extra strength product to do nothing, not even turn my skin pink.  I&#x27;m bummed that I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I have good skin, but whose skin couldn&#x27;t look better? This is so easy to use, and didn&#x27;t cause any issues with stinging or redness. I have received so many compliments on my complexion since I started using it. I will definitely purchase it again!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize I had sensitive skin or I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased the extra strength version. That said this stuff really works. You take one of the step 1 pads and swipe it all over your face (avoid getting the pad too close to the eye).  Then you are to wait two minutes and take a step 2 pad and swipe it all over. It is very easy.  You are not supposed to wash it off although I found I had to because it was burning and my face was turning quite red. If I decide to purchase in the future I will definitely purchase the regular strength version of this product.  It is a great chemical peel I just chose the wrong strength for my skin type.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this product based on the reviews I have read about it. A year ago my esthetician recommended I try it at home but I hesitated on the purchase because of the cost. After reading reviews and doing research, I finally bit the bullet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin after a month of use. I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt by giving it time  but I was overall disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now returning to my go-to products that promise the same results and actually work. Nature&#x27;s Cure Papaya Enzyme toner, cleanser and moisturizer, and LAC-Hydrin Five Moisturizer. These products are miracle workers for evening out skin tone and enhancing cell turnover. A million times better than Dr. Dennis Gross&#x27; peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money.</li>
            <li> seems to be doing good</li>
            <li> I bought this product at Sephora about a year ago and fell in love with it instantly. It makes my skin incredibly soft and smooth, evens out my skin tone, and has improved its overall appearance. I&#x27;ll continue to use this product and hope they don&#x27;t change up the formula! I especially appreciate that Amazon sells it much cheaper than Sephora.</li>
            <li> I have 40+-yr-old, sensitive, acne- and blackhead-prone skin. I was a little concerned about the &amp;#34;Extra Strength&amp;#34;, esp. since they won&#x27;t clarify what is the regular strength vs. extra. No worries though, I&#x27;ve had no skin irritation at all with this. Did have a bit of acne to start, I guess that&#x27;s the skin &amp;#34;purging&amp;#34;, but it wasn&#x27;t a big deal and the pimples were very small and faded quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut the pads in half and used them 2x/day. Also used in conjunction with the Dr. Gross Brightener (*LOVE*). Been using them both for about 3 weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say the blackheads are 85% improved. Haven&#x27;t had acne since the initial purge. FINALLY the skin around my nose stopped peeling (was a big problem before this product). Enlarged pores improved 75%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did significantly increase my moisturizing when I started using the peel, but it&#x27;s also been a harsh dry winter. Following up the peel/brightener with pure argan oil (+ SPF 50 in the am) leaves my face literally velvety. That&#x27;s a first.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! It helped even out my skin and gave me a glow. I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> In a matter of 48 hours I noticed a change in my skin. Truly deminishes break outs, fine lines and dark spots.</li>
            <li> I do like this and it is very gentle.  I saw the greatest difference when I used it on the back of my hands!</li>
            <li> These are my favorite peel pads! I worked in the cosmetic industry for years and have found my skin to look and feel the best when using Dr. Dennis Gross peel pads. These are for ALL skin types!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son that has acne.  He was using the clearasil pads and i decided to buy him this because of the great reviews.  His face has broken out even more.  I gave it some time thinking maybe everything is just coming out.  Its worse.  Back to the clearasil pads.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT AS IT MAKE MY SKIN VERY CLEAN AND POLISH LOOKING. USE IT FOR A FEW MONTHS. USED PREVIOUSLY AND WILL CONTINUE.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this product. But it is usually so expensive. I was so excited when I saw the price on Amazon.com. It is about half the retail store price! This is a great product. It makes my skin so soft, really helps my acne, diminishes scars, and brightens and evens out my skintone! I love it! I suggest, after you have finished step one and you are waiting the two minutes to start step two, stand in front of your bathroom mirror and watch your skin. You will see it improve right before your eyes. I love this product!</li>
            <li> This is the best daily peel I have ever used.  I would recommend it to anyone that wants to improve the clarity and texture of their skin.</li>
            <li> I bought the 5 day pack at sephora for 15$, currently waiting for my 30 day pack from amazon (cheaper here than sephora!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to get peels at my derm, but the harshness is too brutal for post-accutane skin. 21 and was looking to clear up some acne/unevenness after years of bad skin. 4 days in, i will say I&#x27;mm brighter looking, pores are smaller and skin is clearer! I think most of us would benefit from the 30 day-5 days is good improvement, but not miraculous. I cant wait to see how clear and bright i look when my next 30 day box of peels arrive :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only issue I have is that the product does sting during the 2-3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend all people in their 20s give this a try to improve skin after bad teenage acne. I&#x27;m impressed that there&#x27;s a peel strong enough to fix my issues, but not burn my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (a month later)&lt;br /&gt;So the full 30 peels came in the mail, perfect condition. Not expired-zero issues with the product being \\&quot;bad\\&quot;. Been using it for a month now, and my skin is significantly brighter. Still get blackheads from working in food service, but they aren&#x27;t so embedded to where they don&#x27;t come out. The zits that do come \\&quot;that time of the month\\&quot; are smaller, dark marks have faded, pores are less visible-I feel...pretty for the first time in  years. If I was to rate this peel for effectiveness, I&#x27;d give it a 10/10 hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that my skin has gotten to where I&#x27;m happy, I&#x27;m going to use the less harsh \\&quot;daily peel\\&quot; (the extra strength does sting upon application!) and use the extra strength one every few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best 45$ you will spend on skincare, spend it on something that works than 3 15$ products that won&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> I alterante using the regular strenght and the extra strenght Alpha beta Peel every night after washing my face and before putting on my moisturizer and eye cream.  I love the way it brightens my skin and helps keep the evidence of skin damage under control (I am outdoors ALOT).&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product...also helps wwith pore size and breakouts.  Fabulous product!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  This is the only one that seems to help reduce pore size (I have issues between my eyebrows and nose).  I had a few breakouts after the first couple of uses which kind of freaked me out but I&#x27;m glad I kept using it.  I took off a star for the steep price.  I wish it were more reasonably priced or had more &#x27;bells and whistles&#x27; lol.  I haven&#x27;t decided if I will repurchase just yet-hopefully I can find another product that works as well as this one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews. I guess I&#x27;m just lazy. That being said, I had to review this peal. I was amazed at how well these pads worked. I had tried it a few years ago but was hesitant to actually purchase because of the cost. I used some of my tax refund to purchase, and now I can&#x27;t imagine not using it. To me it&#x27;s worth the price! My skin looks the best it has since I can remember....no acne, and it&#x27;s soft as ever. It has a nice glow to it too. And I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 weeks!!! I was blown away. It fits simply into my morning routine: wash, tone, step 1, brush my teeth, step 2, floss and mouthwash, serum and moisturizer. I used to never even set foot out of the house without makeup on, and now I have no qualms about it....I was even willing to include pictures of my face in this review to use as an example! I only wish I had some before pictures!!! But I used to refuse to take pictures unless I had makeup on. I&#x27;ve never been so confident going au naturel....It&#x27;s an amazing feeling!!!</li>
            <li> These pads are great at clearing off dead skin cells and brightening our skin... Easy to use.... But extremely effective</li>
            <li> This product, although highly rated, does not do anything. I&#x27;ve used it several times. I recommend you try a different &amp;#34;at home peel&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> Too pricey and I see no difference whatsoever.  Does not compare to LeMer products or Murad.  Will not purchase again.  Sorry.</li>
            <li> I see no difference after using this product. Skin feels just a little smoother but i cana chieve that using lesser price products from neutrogena.</li>
            <li> I use this product 3 or 4 times a week before bed. I have noticed smaller pores, diminished fine lines and my face seems to have a fuller more youthful appearance.  I was a bit worried about it irritating my skin because mine is very sensitive, and I had no problem. I highly recommend cutting the pads in half, save yourself some money. I love this product and would definitely recommend using it.</li>
            <li> As another shopper indicated, I began having break outs from using this product.  This is not typical for me...I was hoping on getting some anti-aging results and decided to try this product after being recommended by a beauty magazine.  I would recommend trying another product instead!</li>
            <li> I like the cleaning pads for the 1st Step.  It removes any residue from other facial cleansers.  Step 2 appears to close the pores and leaves my face feeling exceptionally clean.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for clearing up your skin and giving you a nice healthy glow. You don&#x27;t need to use it every day as advertised. I actually found my face wreaking havoc when I tried to. To me, it&#x27;s a nice product that should be used in moderation when you see fit.</li>
            <li> A great product from Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare. I can see the improvement in my skin with a few week&#x27;s use; it&#x27;s smoother, less wrinkled, and my slight acne scarring is even slighter now. As others have suggested, you don&#x27;t necessarily need to use this everyday. I wouldn&#x27;t advise cutting the pads in half, as they aren&#x27;t huge to begin with, but I use the product approximately 3 times per week and see improvement, so that may be enough for others as well.</li>
