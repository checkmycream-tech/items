            <li>was offered this product for a great deal to try and give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>This is a moisturizer, not a treatment, so it doesn’t have to do anything but be good at that job.</li>

            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;~ Is it best for a certain skin type?</li>
            <li>These sound great to put on my skin.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;these are my own words&lt;</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>(but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support).</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve really, really liked them both.</li>
            <li>This is a nice moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the</li>
            <li>The container however feels very cheap and not like I am buying a quality beauty product.</li>
            <li>and it made my skin very very smooth and soft!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I used this on my arms and legs and my skin felt so much better after I used it.</li>
            <li>My remarks are sincere and my own.ee or virtually so for product testing and review.</li>
            <li>now I feel way better.</li>
            <li>also love the scent of it.</li>
            <li>It is like a fusion of vanilla and chocolate, I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I just love this skin cream.</li>
            <li>Another keeper for sure.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the sticky feeling most lotions leave on my skin.  </li>
            <li>My favorite part?</li>
            <li>I love the richness of it...</li>
            <li>This is packed with organic and natural oils and butters known to be great for the skin, along with arnica, calendula, allantoin and chamomile.</li>
            <li>Alone,  I think each one of them would have calmed my skin,  but together they create a light , creamy concoction that I am in love with.</li>
            <li>My skin is so dry, so I was happy to get to try this out and give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>, I used more for my eczema and it work really good  for me and my son  of 11 yrs old .</li>
            <li>Very light, barely there yeasty (but in a good way, think</li>
            <li>This product is hands down the BEST product on the market for soothing my son&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived quickly and appropriately packaged in a 4 ounce jar.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;We are happy with this purchase, and will likely order again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are fantastic.</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;this dose work great on dry skin</li>
            <li>It is very smooth and has a gentle sent.</li>
            <li>And after much trial and error, I finally discovered that the best method for treating these (for me) is a thorough scrubbing with a cleanser containing salicylic acid, followed by a lotion with a large amount of aloe.  </li>
            <li>So when I was offered this Aloe Vera Daily Moistureizer Cream with Shea Butter from Derma-nu Miracle Skin Remedies for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered a container.</li>
            <li>It soaked in quickly after I rubbed it on my feet.</li>
            <li>Kind of makes you wonder how absolutely genuine said reviews are and whether or not they are coming from actual users of the product for the stated problem.</li>
            <li>I love this cream and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I love all of the powerful ingredients --aloe vera, cocoa and shea butters, and the many essential oils.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sincerely grateful to have been introduced to such good quality, natural skin creams</li>
            <li>It went on smoothly,  absorbed quickly into my skin,  and did not leave a greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>definitely think that this cream will be perfect for people with dry skin as it is</li>
            <li>and since it&#x27;s all natural ingredients I feel much better about using it.</li>
            <li>This is paraben free, all natural, and organic.</li>
            <li>Smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>But the ingredients in this are STELLAR</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t have the opportunity to try this product enough time to give this a higher rating but I will keep updating this review with more info and let you know what effect this product had on me</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for making this product!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get over how soft and smooth my skin feels after using this moisturizing skin cream.</li>
            <li>cream is very very moisturizing, and since I have a skin type that is prone to acne and oiliness, it doesnt go well with very hydrating</li>

            <li>I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li>and I’ve seen less effective formulations marketed as miracle serums.</li>
            <li>He have dry skin and eczema also but more severe .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fragrance free, not tested on sweet bunnies (or any other animals)</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel very moisturized.</li>
            <li>very hydrating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t contain so much aloe that it is sticky, but it still helps alleviate the redness after I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very light&lt;</li>
            <li>It readily absorbs and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>These are some of the ingredients :Clinical Strength Organic Aloe, Shea Butter, Cocoa Butter, Vitamin B5, Organic Oils of; Jojoba, Borage, Flax Seed, Evening Primrose, Rose Hip, Lavender, Calendula, Chamomile &amp; Green Tea.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy like many other creams.</li>
            <li>I really love it and will continue to purchase this cream and their other mentioned cream (being the Youth Regenerating Moisturizing cream).</li>
            <li>I had been looking for a cream that contained aloe as the lotion I had been using is apparently no longer available.  </li>
            <li>this cream made it silky smooth and soft, I am planning of purchasing the bigger tub as my hand cream.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So far I really like the product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this moisturizer on the strength of its ingredients and well as the soft way it leaves my skin</li>
            <li>It recently showed up on his face in large welts.</li>
            <li>and my skin felt soft all day long&lt;</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so grateful that these natural skin care products are being made here, instead of China.</li>
            <li>I wanted him to have something natural.</li>
            <li>Did not work for my skin, got strange pimples all over:/ Pretty greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural ingredients don&#x27;t irritate his skin.</li>
            <li>It is naturally unscented so it doesn&#x27;t give him any headaches, yet is doesn&#x27;t stink either.</li>
            <li>only thing I don&#x27;t particularly care for is the smell of the lotion.  </li>
            <li>He has been using it twice a day and that has been enough to keep the large red patches of eczema away.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a few days and can already see the fine little cracks and breaking dry skin closing up and healing quickly.</li>
            <li>Even thought it is super humid, my skin still cracks due to washing dishes and bottles as well as cleaning all day long.</li>
            <li>I am not a fan of lotions in general.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always known the healing powers of the Aloe plant, but it is really apparent in this Miracle Skin Remedies Moisturizing Cream.</li>
            <li>: This is a thick lotion, smooth, that spreads well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>* Removed dry, dusty look to skin and replaced it with nice moist looking skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this Derma-nu Aloe Vera Cream for anyone who wants to not only moisturize but heal their dry skin.</li>
            <li>a wife who&#x27;s always busy with work, gardening, and house errands over all, my hands tend to be dry and rough.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>

            <li> UPDATE on 9-13-15 Have seen no change for the better whatsoever since starting treatment with this product and am so disappointed, especially because this product received such high ratings by the reviewers.</li>
            <li> There is a slight presence left behind, but it’s more of a protective-feeling one than something you wish you could wash off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering with this current round of eczema for many months now, and it&#x27;s irritating, sore</li>
            <li> We have been looking for a lotion or skin cream for the extra dry, calloused areas.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> it goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li> I only use this cream once a day, every other day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I knew my face would be extremely dry</li>
            <li> that dry out my skin</li>
            <li> I always had dry skin and problems with eczemas....</li>
            <li> /&gt;~ Packaging: 4oz wide mouth plastic jar with screw on lid.&lt;br /&gt;~ Immediate cosmetic effects:</li>
            <li> I was afraid I was going to have to suffer the plight of ingrown hairs or have to deal with the sticky mess of pure aloe until I found a new lotion.  </li>
            <li> You only have to use a very little bit -</li>
            <li> Other than that it should work for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;~</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I ordered Aloe Vera cream by Derma-nu for my 16 year old son who has had really bad eczema his whole life.</li>

            <li> like this this daily moisturizer cream&lt;br /&gt;this dose work great on dry skin&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy like some&lt;br /&gt;skin creams do !&lt;br /&gt;i have applied  on  legs and arms in the&lt;br /&gt;morning and my skin felt soft all day long&lt;br /&gt;these are my own words&lt;br /&gt;i received this product as a promotion&lt;br /&gt;in return for my review</li>
            <li> I did a pedicure on my feet then I put this cream on it. It soaked in quickly after I rubbed it on my feet. It&#x27;s not greasy like many other creams. My skin is so dry, so I was happy to get to try this out and give my honest opinion. I used this on my arms and legs and my skin felt so much better after I used it. My skin is sometimes itchy and I didn&#x27;t feel itchy after using this cream. These are some of the ingredients :Clinical Strength Organic Aloe, Shea Butter, Cocoa Butter, Vitamin B5, Organic Oils of; Jojoba, Borage, Flax Seed, Evening Primrose, Rose Hip, Lavender, Calendula, Chamomile &amp; Green Tea. These sound great to put on my skin. This is paraben free, all natural, and organic. I like that this is made in the USA and not tested on animals. It&#x27;s 100% satisfaction guarantee. I recommend this for sure.&lt;br /&gt;I was offered this product for a great deal to try and give my honest opinion. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> We have been looking for a lotion or skin cream for the extra dry, calloused areas.&lt;br /&gt;We purchased this Aloe Vera skin cream in a promotion for testing and review.&lt;br /&gt;We like the fact that it doesn’t leave skin feeling greasy, it does not have a strong&lt;br /&gt;flowery scent,  and has ingredients that help promote healing of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;We are happy with this purchase, and will likely order again.</li>
            <li> How do you compare the hundreds of skin care products? As a regular tester, I&#x27;ve arrived at a list of key considerations. I hope these help you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Fragrance: Very light, barely there yeasty (but in a good way, think beer not yuck) smell.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel during application: This is a thick lotion, smooth, that spreads well.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel after absorption: Smooth and soft. There is a slight presence left behind, but it’s more of a protective-feeling one than something you wish you could wash off. Doesn’t just vanish, feels like it’s still at work moisturizing your skin.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it best for a certain skin type?: I wouldn’t use it on your face if you have oily skin. Other than that it should work for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it tested on animals?: No.&lt;br /&gt;~ Packaging: 4oz wide mouth plastic jar with screw on lid.&lt;br /&gt;~ Immediate cosmetic effects:* Removed dry, dusty look to skin and replaced it with nice moist looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;~ Potential long-term effectiveness:* This is a moisturizer, not a treatment, so it doesn’t have to do anything but be good at that job. But the ingredients in this are STELLAR and I’ve seen less effective formulations marketed as miracle serums. This is packed with organic and natural oils and butters known to be great for the skin, along with arnica, calendula, allantoin and chamomile. I highly recommend this moisturizer on the strength of its ingredients and well as the soft way it leaves my skin feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Know the difference between cosmetic and long-term effects: Cosmetic effects are immediate and only present when the product has been applied recently - just like makeup. Long-term effects take longer to see and should remain when you stop using the product (but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support). The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.

            <li> Haven&#x27;t have the opportunity to try this product enough time to give this a higher rating but I will keep updating this review with more info and let you know what effect this product had on me and if I found any problems with it. I got this in return of a review</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and like it thus the reason for my second purchase.</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail yesterday, so I will update my review once I have use the product for a few weeks. So far I really like the product. It is very smooth and has a gentle sent. It made my skin feel very moisturized. I am a little reluctant to use it on my face, but will do so and let you know how it works. The container however feels very cheap and not like I am buying a quality beauty product.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this Derma-Nu to use after an at home facial peel. I knew my face would be extremely dry and it would crack and peel and I needed something that would be calming and would provide anti-inflammatory benefits. The list of ingredients led me to believe this would be just what I would need.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quickly and appropriately packaged in a 4 ounce jar.  After the peel (and subsequent peels) this cream provided the deep hydration my skin needed after the shock of the peel.  It went on smoothly,  absorbed quickly into my skin,  and did not leave a greasy feel.  I love all of the powerful ingredients --aloe vera, cocoa and shea butters, and the many essential oils.  Alone,  I think each one of them would have calmed my skin,  but together they create a light , creamy concoction that I am in love with. I have oily skin so I don&#x27;t need it every night,  but I often use peels and Retin A that dry out my skin and I use it then.&lt;br /&gt;I received this Skin Cream at a promotional price for evaluation and review purposes. I like to do reviews after my purchases for those considering whether to buy it or not,  as I often buy online and I rely on the reviews of others,  as well.</li>
            <li> My skin feels great with this cream! I always had dry skin and problems with eczemas.... now I feel way better. I&#x27;ll continue taking this twice daily! I got this product in exchange of an honest and fair review.... here you are: the cream is great! I love it!</li>
            <li> It just be 3 day w the product and I like it , I used more for my eczema and it work really good  for me and my son  of 11 yrs old . He have dry skin and eczema also but more severe . And the dry skin is not more there .&lt;br /&gt;Thanks !!</li>
            <li> I am always searching for a great skin moisturizer. Even thought it is super humid, my skin still cracks due to washing dishes and bottles as well as cleaning all day long. So when I was offered this Aloe Vera Daily Moistureizer Cream with Shea Butter from Derma-nu Miracle Skin Remedies for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered a container. I have been using it for a few days and can already see the fine little cracks and breaking dry skin closing up and healing quickly. I&#x27;ve always known the healing powers of the Aloe plant, but it is really apparent in this Miracle Skin Remedies Moisturizing Cream. I definitely recommend this Derma-nu Aloe Vera Cream for anyone who wants to not only moisturize but heal their dry skin.</li>
            <li> I used this product on my face everyday, and it made me broke out on day 3.&lt;br /&gt;You might think that why give it a 4 star if it broke you out? Well, I think that it was partly because my skin type is oily to combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;This cream is very very moisturizing, and since I have a skin type that is prone to acne and oiliness, it doesnt go well with very hydrating moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;However, I found a way to make it work. I only use this cream once a day, every other day.&lt;br /&gt;It did work out and it made my skin very very smooth and soft!&lt;br /&gt;I also love the scent of it. It is like a fusion of vanilla and chocolate, I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;I definitely think that this cream will be perfect for people with dry skin as it is very hydrating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this as my hand cream and oh my, how it made my hand so smooth.&lt;br /&gt;As a wife who&#x27;s always busy with work, gardening, and house errands over all, my hands tend to be dry and rough.&lt;br /&gt;But this cream made it silky smooth and soft, I am planning of purchasing the bigger tub as my hand cream.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this using a promo code for testing.</li>
            <li> I just love this skin cream. I&#x27;m really starting to take notice of Derma-nu products, this is the second skin cream line of theirs that I have purchased (at a reduced price, as a promotional sample) and I&#x27;ve really, really liked them both. The ingredients are fantastic. It&#x27;s fragrance free, not tested on sweet bunnies (or any other animals) and it&#x27;s made in the USA. It&#x27;s hydrating, soothing, softening and moisturizing - I really love it and will continue to purchase this cream and their other mentioned cream (being the Youth Regenerating Moisturizing cream). I&#x27;m sincerely grateful to have been introduced to such good quality, natural skin creams and I&#x27;m so grateful that these natural skin care products are being made here, instead of China. Another keeper for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering with this current round of eczema for many months now, and it&#x27;s irritating, sore and I want it gone. I tried a using an RX with RX strength (2 1/2%) hydrocortisone; which has always worked in the past, but not this time. So I was hoping this would work and since it&#x27;s all natural ingredients I feel much better about using it. Keep your fingers crossed for me because I have never had this bad an outbreak before----Will update further down the road. UPDATE on 9-13-15 Have seen no change for the better whatsoever since starting treatment with this product and am so disappointed, especially because this product received such high ratings by the reviewers. Kind of makes you wonder how absolutely genuine said reviews are and whether or not they are coming from actual users of the product for the stated problem. Am going to discontinue use!!</li>
            <li> very nice!  face always feels hydrated.  love it. will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a nice moisturizer.  I am not a fan of lotions in general.  I don&#x27;t like the sticky feeling most lotions leave on my skin.  This cream absorbs well and does not leave that sticky feeling.  I had been looking for a cream that contained aloe as the lotion I had been using is apparently no longer available.  So, when I received the offer to review this item at a reduced rate, I jumped at the chance.  I am not disappointed.  I cannot shave without the horrible plight of ingrown hairs.  And after much trial and error, I finally discovered that the best method for treating these (for me) is a thorough scrubbing with a cleanser containing salicylic acid, followed by a lotion with a large amount of aloe.  I was afraid I was going to have to suffer the plight of ingrown hairs or have to deal with the sticky mess of pure aloe until I found a new lotion.  But this lotion has worked great for me.  It doesn&#x27;t contain so much aloe that it is sticky, but it still helps alleviate the redness after I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The things I like about this lotion:&lt;br /&gt;1.  It is very light&lt;br /&gt;2.  You only have to use a very little bit - it goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;3.  It moisturizes well&lt;br /&gt;4.  It comes in a lidded container so you aren&#x27;t bruising your fingers trying to squeeze out the last drops of lotion from a squeeze tube.&lt;br /&gt;5. It is certified organic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t particularly care for is the smell of the lotion.  It doesn&#x27;t contain any perfumes, so the scent of all the natural goodies in the lotion mix together to produce almost a vague yeasty smell.  But the smell does not linger once you apply the lotion and it isn&#x27;t offensive, just not your typical lotion scent.  So for that reason, I didn&#x27;t dock it any stars.</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I ordered Aloe Vera cream by Derma-nu for my 16 year old son who has had really bad eczema his whole life. It recently showed up on his face in large welts. We have tried a lot of products throughout the years with no success unless we had a prescription for cortisone cream. Because of the harsh chemicals in the prescription cream I wanted him to have something natural. That is when I came across this product. It has been a miracle cream for my son. It doesn&#x27;t burn, leave a greasy residue, or have harsh chemicals. He has been using it twice a day and that has been enough to keep the large red patches of eczema away. Thank you so much for making this product! I have told others about it that have children with eczema.</li>
            <li> Did not work for my skin, got strange pimples all over:/ Pretty greasy.</li>
            <li> This product is hands down the BEST product on the market for soothing my son&#x27;s eczema. It&#x27;s all natural ingredients don&#x27;t irritate his skin. It is naturally unscented so it doesn&#x27;t give him any headaches, yet is doesn&#x27;t stink either. My favorite part? It readily absorbs and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy.I love the richness of it...it&#x27;s like body butter, without the sliminess. I can&#x27;t get over how soft and smooth my skin feels after using this moisturizing skin cream. I love this cream and highly recommend. I know I will be purchasing more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  I was offered this product at a promotion price to share my honest and unbiased opinion!</li>
            <li> Awesome aloe Vera. Smells great!!</li>
