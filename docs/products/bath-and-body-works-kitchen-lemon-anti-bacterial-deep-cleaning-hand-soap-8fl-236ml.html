            <li> What more can I say? The soap smells good, cleans good.  The service was excellent.  It is pricy, but the quality is worth it.  I am just glad there is a B&amp;BW in Hawaii now.</li>
            <li> I really wanted the moisturizing antibacterial and this is not it.  It still is nice.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery came quickly and all is as expected.</li>
            <li> I always expect the best from bath and body works. And I was not disappointed. It was delivered sooner than expected. I do like this scent.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and the person who received it Loved the product and would get the same thing again.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrant smell of lemon for the kitchen. Soft cleansing for the hands.  Recommended choice of scent for the value.</li>
            <li> This is not antibacterial soap. It does not say so on the bottle and it contains no antibacterial ingredients.</li>
            <li> This is the best kitchen  hand soap, it smells very pleasant.  I only use it after I cut onions, garlic etc. and the smell comes right out.</li>
            <li> Mom loves this item. Great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but I like their white citrus scent if you want the scent to last.</li>
            <li> My Dad loves this ... I love the smell and the size.  He loves he is keeping the flu and colds away.  High recommend it</li>
            <li> This soap works well with powerful odors but remains gentle on your skin.  The scent is lemon and even my Fad</li>
            <li> See my comment on the Sea Island Cotton product.&lt;br /&gt;Not only is it everything I&#x27;ve said, but it also is antibacterial! That is something else that is very important to me. You can never tell...tis better to be safe than sorry. LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> Love this soap and the smell is awesome! I will definitely purchase more! Great for kitchen or bathroom use and got within a week!</li>
            <li> I like this product because when cooking or handling meats, dicing onions, this product removes all the smells that should remain in your kitchen, not on your hands,</li>
            <li> I got this on time and have used it for some time. I like the scent and it does a very good job. It really helps cut the grease on your hands and rinses clean. Good kitchen product because it leaves no residue or after scent. Yes, I would recommed this product. The only thing about squirt bottles ,in general, when used in the kitchen,one should remember to clean the bottle after use.</li>
            <li> A friend had this in their kitchen, tried it there, ordered it, really like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I needed a non female scent for the kitchen, so lemon was perfect.  pump works fine, but I prefer not to have antibacterial soap.  Other than that, it was everything you expect from Bath and Body works</li>
            <li> Too bad we were forced to switch to a different scent.</li>
            <li> Every kitchen chore begins with a hand cleansing using the BBW liquid soap. It has a pleasant fresh scent, creates a nice foamy wash, is gentle and effective and leaves no residue. I have two soap dispensers on my kitchen counter - one for dish soap and one for Bath and Body Works Anti-Bacterial hand soap. I use a BBW pump bottle to keep the dish soap also, so I have a matching pair! A few years ago I received a gift of 2 shiny metal covers for the pump bottles, and they are attractive enough to keep on the kitchen counter all the time. I have tried most of the other \\&quot;flavors\\&quot; of BBW liquid soap, but the lemon scent is my favorite for the kitchen.</li>
