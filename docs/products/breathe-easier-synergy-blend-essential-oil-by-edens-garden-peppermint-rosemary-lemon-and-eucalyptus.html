            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Smells great and does seem to have helped some with my allergies at night.</li>
            <li>But the scent is great, and also works well for use in vaporizers.  </li>
            <li>If you need a great inhaler and equally great selection of aromatherapy oils, try Edens Garden for the oils and get the Mabis inhaler.</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing product!</li>
            <li>but this is actually nice!</li>
            <li>I like some synergy blends more then others, but over all I&#x27;m very happy with Edens Gardens.</li>
            <li>Good bye stopped up nose since I have used this product</li>
            <li>Good combination of eucalyptus, lemon, peppermint and rosemary.</li>
            <li>They are good quality for the money.  </li>
            <li>Havnt tried yet but heard good things</li>
            <li>It would be good to use in a homemade chest rub for children.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li>I love Eden&#x27;s Garden oils!  </li>
            <li>stuff smells and works amazing.  </li>
            <li>this really smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I also use it in my warm in my kitchen because I have gas heat to warm the house.</li>
            <li>but I liked</li>
            <li>Rosemary oil is also great at helping to purify the air as well as having many more reported health benefits.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t very strong.</li>
            <li>and he got all better on his own without having to go to the Dr.s once.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent of the Breathe Easy Synergy blend!</li>
            <li>This oil has a nice strong odor for clearing out the chest and sinuses.  </li>
            <li>I love this oil, going to purchase more</li>
            <li>Since he started using it he hasn&#x27;t had many headaches or sinus issues.  </li>
            <li>so i could sleep better.</li>
            <li>Lovely smell</li>
            <li>Most of the sinus blends smell like Vicks vapor rub</li>
            <li>Absolutely my favorite</li>
            <li>We love it and use it every night.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite scent combinations.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this blend again to see if it was still potent.  </li>
            <li>It is not quite as potent as the Plant Therapy product, but we no longer need that.  </li>
            <li>-5x more than this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I sleep much better &amp; feel refresh in the morning.</li>
            <li>In partnership, I also purchased the Mabis steam inhaler since many folks recommended it for use with aromatherapy oils.</li>
            <li>I am amazed at how it works and how it has became my favorite scent, because I have tried all the famous brands but this formula is just what pleases me and more importantly what works.  </li>
            <li>Either one works fine for me, I do apply the oil to the filter more so now.  </li>
            <li>The oils are good, maybe not quite as good as the really high cost stuff, but good enough for the price.</li>
            <li>None of these oils smell overly-strong and gently provide fairly long-lasting relief of sinus congestion (and sinus headache for me).</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a great oil that doesn&#x27;t cost $40 or more a bottle but works like one that does, Edens Garden is your last stop!</li>
            <li>yourself and your friends/family a favor and avoid the money-grubbers by choosing a fairly priced, high quality brand like Edens Garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll be back to buy more from Edens Garden - thank you for a fantastic product!!!</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad, I rather smell this then the Vicks rub. :)</li>
            <li>My allergies cause sinus swelling sometimes and this is a quick safe way for me to start breathing through my nose again.</li>
            <li>I also notice a huge difference in my allergies when I use it.</li>
            <li>This one has a really strong and clean sent.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re cheap.</li>
            <li>It smells great and seems to really help the whole family with allergy issues.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice, sinus-clearing blend of essential oils.  </li>
            <li>I normally mix up my own</li>
            <li>so it can really go to work helping us be able to breathe</li>
            <li>We love this as much as Breathe  by Doterra</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d say it smells like a sweet eucalyptus smell, but now he loves it.</li>
            <li>For my money this is a great product which I will use again as well as consider  their other offerings</li>
            <li>favorite thing about these oils is that they&#x27;re high quality</li>
            <li>their oil is the holy grail and worth 4</li>
            <li>I breath it in right from the bottle</li>
            <li>All of these essential oils smell great on their own in a diffuser, or mixed in with a carrier oil for topical use, but when combined they work</li>
            <li>By far my most favorite of the essential oils.  </li>
            <li>My kids also like it very much when they have a stuffy nose.  </li>
            <li>have purchased MANY Eden&#x27;s Garden essential oils and oil blends and true to their reputation this oil is just as high quality therapeautic grade oil as any I have purchased.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my sinus open and I&#x27;m breathing better.</li>
            <li>Also just a side note, it tends to take away the urge to have a cigarette ;-)</li>
            <li>This really helped her and everyone in the house!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how stuffy I&#x27;d get until the first night I used this</li>
            <li>He said he had to get used to the smell first</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the smell and will definitely purchase this again</li>
            <li>I love to use this product when my kids have any type of upper respiratory infection/cold.  </li>
            <li>We have several of the oils and they have helped replace so many items in our medicine cabinet.  </li>
            <li>It smells lovely and it&#x27;s not too strong for my little one&#x27;s noses.</li>
            <li>The product itself seems high-quality to me based on their claimed ingredients and by my own comparisons with other brands that use synthetic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product so much I purchase several for friends.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t strong enough for children.</li>
            <li>I am fairly new to essential oils and I have to say I love this one.</li>
            <li>I gave this a high rating because it really works!</li>
            <li>I like it so much</li>
            <li>very relaxing.</li>
            <li>This oil has a woodsy smell that is very soothing.  </li>
            <li>It really helps me breathe.</li>
            <li>It really bothers me when a customer is treated this way.</li>
            <li>Very helpful in opening up your head.</li>
            <li>This product really works when you are having sinus, breahing issues.</li>
            <li>I like to just breathe it straight from the bottle, up through my nose.  </li>
            <li>I feel this is a much safer alternative.</li>
            <li>I have suffered from asthma and allergies my whole life</li>
            <li>The Oil Really Works To Help Relieve Sinus Pressure .</li>
            <li>I use EOs mostly for their smell although I know they have some other practical uses.</li>
            <li>Still, however, he gets mild reactions (sniffles and such) from time to time.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the seller.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, so I add this blend to my diffuser for a few hours during the day, and then I add it to our bedroom diffuser so it will run during the night while we sleep.</li>
            <li>Within minutes, he was breathing normally, \\&quot;Mom I can breathe now!\\</li>
            <li>This smells quite nice when mixed with a carrier oil, and when applied as suggested it does provide a little temporary relief from stuffiness.  </li>
            <li>and how clearly I could breath through my nose!</li>
            <li>I will say that if you need something to last all night, you will want to mix it with a cream or something to keep it on the surface of your skin (I actually just use some Vicks), because this oil will absorb into your skin and then the aromatherapy part of it wears off fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>My 7 year old son had a ear ache</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had sinus infection for THREE months and this has been the only blend that has really moved my congestion.</li>
            <li>WOW does it work.  </li>
            <li>Just started doing essential oils, and this stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>My kids said the house smells like old people some times</li>
            <li>Doterra even sells a &#x27;family physician kit&#x27; that suggests you rub their oils on your skin and ingest it for the purposes of curing ailments - yet to my knowledge they don&#x27;t provide a SINGLE source of research to back any of their claims or recommendations.&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of those despicable health claims and sales pitches, even if you use EO&#x27;s simply to enjoy the aromas there is no reason to pay 4-5x the price for the same quality product.</li>
            <li>I love all of the Essential Oils I have purchased from Edens Garden this one has been my go to for days when I am having trouble breathing and a stuffy nose due to Allergies .I</li>
            <li>The first two times they ended up shipping us the ones that we were missing.</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s nasal polyps haven&#x27;t&#x27; bothered him since then (due to high doses of vitamin C, quercetin, garlic and kefir).</li>
            <li>It was well worth the investment to feel better after so long being sick.</li>
            <li>It helped a little, but not as much as the &amp;#34;Germ Fighter&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>They ship a little more slowly than other Amazon products, but I think part of that is because I live across the country from their company.  </li>

            <li> My husband&#x27;s nasal polyps haven&#x27;t&#x27; bothered him since then (due to high doses of vitamin C, quercetin, garlic and kefir).</li>
            <li> It was well worth the investment to feel better after so long being sick.</li>
            <li> It helped a little, but not as much as the &amp;#34;Germ Fighter&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> They ship a little more slowly than other Amazon products, but I think part of that is because I live across the country from their company.  </li>
            <li> : I tried this blend on my husband who has chronic sniffles alternating with complete blockage due to polyps.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m actually pretty irritated by those that claim these can replace common medicines without showing an iota of research to support these claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact, when I used the &amp;#34;Germ Fighter&amp;#34; with a few drops of Ravensara mixed in coconut oil, he had almost complete clearance.  </li>
            <li> and I just reorder more because I am so afraid of running out.  </li>
            <li> Well, the last time I ordered, I filed the same missing product report, and nothing ever received.</li>
            <li> This oil blend is probably not strong enough for those with deep sinus</li>
            <li> Normally he has to go at least two times in the winter.  </li>
            <li> Nothing has been helping, none of the typical allergy meds, etc, and I wanted to add something to our humidifier and diffuser to help open up our airways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I was starting to run low on my other oils and wanted to use them for a few other things before I replaced them.</li>
            <li> Easier Blend Essential Oil has been  very helpful when breathing becomes difficult.</li>
            <li> I much rather use this than any allergy Medication that leaves me tired.</li>
            <li> I rub a few drops on the temples (not too close to the eyes) and down the back of the neck.</li>
            <li> This family member and several others in the essential oil sales industry also like to claim outrageous health benefits and cures that their oils can provide in order to sell more product.</li>
            <li> you suffer from allergies, or are stuffed up a bit due to colds or flu</li>
            <li> I used this for two days with a cold aromatherapy mister and felt at least 95% better.  </li>
            <li> My dad has trouble breathing due to a black mold infection from years ago.</li>
            <li> This blend is a must have in your EO first aid kit if you or a family member suffers from sinus or allergy problems.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops in my humidifier and also rub some of it (neat) in my hands and breathe it in.</li>
            <li> adding a few drops to a diffuser, vaporizer, or bathwater when you&#x27;re feeling stuffy.</li>
            <li> Past review</li>
            <li> I bought it for my 5 year old who suffers from seasonal allergies and severe nose congestion.</li>
            <li> We have a home nebulizer that we use when he&#x27;s having a hard time breathing.  </li>
            <li> I have never used essential oils or a cold mister before.  </li>
            <li> I have mixed this with a carrier oil whenever I have a cold with a cough and rubbed on my chest.  </li>
            <li> I have purchase every oil I have found and could purchase related to sinus, cold and breathing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously considering buying this in a gallon jug because I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
            <li> , I even put it on the bottoms of our feet and behind our ears with a carrier oil</li>
            <li> so I rubbed 2 drops behind his ear &amp; on his neck.</li>
            <li> 34;What does this guy have against Doterra?&amp;#34; Well, a family member of mine got suckered into the scam despite my warnings and provided research opposing her claims and is now working to sucker the rest of my family into paying stupid amounts of money on Doterra products.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately whomever fulfills the orders does an absolutely terrible job... each time we&#x27;ve ordered quite a few, and every time we&#x27;ve received the wrong ones.</li>
            <li> I got a bad cold over the Christmas holiday</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This will be our \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; oil when anyone in our house has a stuffy nose, sinus pressure, congestion, cold, cough, etc!</li>
            <li> It is just miserable.</li>

            <li> I bought this to add to my medicine cabinet because we are just dying with allergies here.  It is just miserable. Period.  Nothing has been helping, none of the typical allergy meds, etc, and I wanted to add something to our humidifier and diffuser to help open up our airways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff smells and works amazing.  I like it so much, I even put it on the bottoms of our feet and behind our ears with a carrier oil so it can really go to work helping us be able to breathe better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased MANY Eden&#x27;s Garden essential oils and oil blends and true to their reputation this oil is just as high quality therapeautic grade oil as any I have purchased.  If you are looking for a great oil that doesn&#x27;t cost $40 or more a bottle but works like one that does, Edens Garden is your last stop!</li>
            <li> I love this oil, going to purchase more</li>
            <li> This one has a really strong and clean sent.</li>
            <li> I am fairly new to essential oils and I have to say I love this one. I put a few drops in my humidifier and also rub some of it (neat) in my hands and breathe it in. Wonderful!! This blend is a must have in your EO first aid kit if you or a family member suffers from sinus or allergy problems. I will definitely be keeping this one around.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old son had a ear ache so I rubbed 2 drops behind his ear &amp; on his neck. With in a minute he said his ear was draining and asked for a q-tip! Amazing!</li>
            <li> Keeps my sinus open and I&#x27;m breathing better.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, sinus-clearing blend of essential oils.  Put it on a cotton ball or breath it in out of the bottle to use.  None of these oils smell overly-strong and gently provide fairly long-lasting relief of sinus congestion (and sinus headache for me).</li>
            <li> To me, this smells like peppermint mixed with honeysuckle.  I had bronchitis for 3 1/2 weeks.  I used this for two days with a cold aromatherapy mister and felt at least 95% better.  I have never used essential oils or a cold mister before.  It was well worth the investment to feel better after so long being sick.</li>
            <li> this really smells wonderful.  very relaxing.</li>
            <li> This oil has a woodsy smell that is very soothing.  I bought it for my boyfriend and he uses it in his Greenair Spa diffuser at night.  Since he started using it he hasn&#x27;t had many headaches or sinus issues.  I got a bad cold over the Christmas holiday and he put the diffuser on my night stand and put this oil in it.  The Breath Easier oil actually helped open up my sinuses so i could sleep better.</li>
            <li> We love this as much as Breathe  by Doterra</li>
            <li> I have mixed this with a carrier oil whenever I have a cold with a cough and rubbed on my chest.  It clears up my cough even time.  It&#x27;s an amazing product!</li>
            <li> It really helps me breathe. I put it in my humidifier by my bed at night and I don&#x27;t wake up stuffed up. Great product. Lovely smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously considering buying this in a gallon jug because I&#x27;m addicted. I&#x27;ve had sinus infection for THREE months and this has been the only blend that has really moved my congestion. Including the three antibiotics I&#x27;ve been on. It&#x27;s a pleasant smell too! Most of the sinus blends smell like Vicks vapor rub but this is actually nice!</li>
            <li> Smells great and does seem to have helped some with my allergies at night.</li>
            <li> By far my most favorite of the essential oils.  I have purchase every oil I have found and could purchase related to sinus, cold and breathing and I just reorder more because I am so afraid of running out.  I have not had a sinus problem since using this.  I have had chronic sinus problems my entire life living in the humid south.  I use to wake up with a headache every morning , but not anymore.  I have not had to take a sinus tablet since I have been using this.  I apply 2 or 3 drops to the filter of my cpap machine, I have also put 2 drops into the water instead of the filter.  Either one works fine for me, I do apply the oil to the filter more so now.  I love this product so much I purchase several for friends.  I have mixed this with carrier oil and applied to the grands, place on cotton balls for inhalation, but since I have the cpap just the use at night has been all I have needed. I am amazed at how it works and how it has became my favorite scent, because I have tried all the famous brands but this formula is just what pleases me and more importantly what works.  Good bye stopped up nose since I have used this product and I will not run out.  I hope it works as well for you as it does for me.</li>
            <li> Absolutely my favorite</li>
            <li> Good quality! Sinuses were inflamed so I put it a couple of drops on a q-tip and rubbed it up into my nostrils...WOW does it work.  Also just a side note, it tends to take away the urge to have a cigarette ;-)</li>
            <li> This works awesome for my baby! I also notice a huge difference in my allergies when I use it.</li>
            <li> This smells quite nice when mixed with a carrier oil, and when applied as suggested it does provide a little temporary relief from stuffiness.  We love it and use it every night.</li>
            <li> I have ordered from Eden&#x27;s Garden three times, and all three times they have messed up my order. The oils are good, maybe not quite as good as the really high cost stuff, but good enough for the price. Unfortunately whomever fulfills the orders does an absolutely terrible job... each time we&#x27;ve ordered quite a few, and every time we&#x27;ve received the wrong ones. The first two times they ended up shipping us the ones that we were missing. Well, the last time I ordered, I filed the same missing product report, and nothing ever received. It really bothers me when a customer is treated this way. Word of warning to those looking to purchase from this seller!</li>
            <li> Very helpful in opening up your head.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scent combinations. It&#x27;s really nice if you have a cold or sinus problems.</li>
            <li> Good combination of eucalyptus, lemon, peppermint and rosemary. I like some synergy blends more then others, but over all I&#x27;m very happy with Edens Gardens.</li>
            <li> Past review: I tried this blend on my husband who has chronic sniffles alternating with complete blockage due to polyps.  It helped a little, but not as much as the &amp;#34;Germ Fighter&amp;#34; oil blend I ordered through a different company.  In fact, when I used the &amp;#34;Germ Fighter&amp;#34; with a few drops of Ravensara mixed in coconut oil, he had almost complete clearance.  This oil blend is probably not strong enough for those with deep sinus problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;November 2016 -  It&#x27;s been over 2 years since my last review of 3 stars.  My husband&#x27;s nasal polyps haven&#x27;t&#x27; bothered him since then (due to high doses of vitamin C, quercetin, garlic and kefir). Still, however, he gets mild reactions (sniffles and such) from time to time. Last night was such a time.  I decided to try this blend again to see if it was still potent.  Mixed it with avocado oil, (Kirkland brand which I have on hand for cooking),  1/2 teaspoon  avocado oil and 2 drops of this blend rubbed on his feet.  We both slept well (listening to sniffles-snoring is not my idea of a rest).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in fairness to this company I am changing my review to 5 stars.  It is not quite as potent as the Plant Therapy product, but we no longer need that.  For my money this is a great product which I will use again as well as consider  their other offerings</li>
            <li> I gave this a high rating because it really works! I bought it for my 5 year old who suffers from seasonal allergies and severe nose congestion. This really helped her and everyone in the house! I didn&#x27;t realize how stuffy I&#x27;d get until the first night I used this and how clearly I could breath through my nose! It smells lovely and it&#x27;s not too strong for my little one&#x27;s noses. Oh and it&#x27;s quite soothing and relaxing as well.</li>
            <li> Just started doing essential oils, and this stuff really works.  My husband struggles with upper respiratory issues, so I put this on his chest and had a humidifier going with this and he got all better on his own without having to go to the Dr.s once.  Normally he has to go at least two times in the winter.  He said he had to get used to the smell first, I&#x27;d say it smells like a sweet eucalyptus smell, but now he loves it.</li>
            <li> This product really works when you are having sinus, breahing issues. My allergies cause sinus swelling sometimes and this is a quick safe way for me to start breathing through my nose again.</li>
            <li> I use EOs mostly for their smell although I know they have some other practical uses. I&#x27;m not a believer that these are an alternative medicine and I&#x27;m actually pretty irritated by those that claim these can replace common medicines without showing an iota of research to support these claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, how you use this product is on you. The product itself seems high-quality to me based on their claimed ingredients and by my own comparisons with other brands that use synthetic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite thing about these oils is that they&#x27;re high quality and they&#x27;re cheap. They&#x27;re not part of some DoTerra direct sales scam that tries to convince people their oil is the holy grail and worth 4-5x more than this.&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself and your friends/family a favor and avoid the money-grubbers by choosing a fairly priced, high quality brand like Edens Garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS I know an immediate question that might come to your mind is &amp;#34;What does this guy have against Doterra?&amp;#34; Well, a family member of mine got suckered into the scam despite my warnings and provided research opposing her claims and is now working to sucker the rest of my family into paying stupid amounts of money on Doterra products. This family member and several others in the essential oil sales industry also like to claim outrageous health benefits and cures that their oils can provide in order to sell more product. I have literally heard some of them tell me that the essential oils can help cure cancer. Doterra even sells a &#x27;family physician kit&#x27; that suggests you rub their oils on your skin and ingest it for the purposes of curing ailments - yet to my knowledge they don&#x27;t provide a SINGLE source of research to back any of their claims or recommendations.&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of those despicable health claims and sales pitches, even if you use EO&#x27;s simply to enjoy the aromas there is no reason to pay 4-5x the price for the same quality product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It smells great and seems to really help the whole family with allergy issues.</li>
            <li> I used it in my machine. I sleep much better &amp; feel refresh in the morning. I also use it in my warm in my kitchen because I have gas heat to warm the house. My kids said the house smells like old people some times but hey we can breath. The smell is not bad, I rather smell this then the Vicks rub. :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell and will definitely purchase this again</li>
            <li> I love Eden&#x27;s Garden oils!  They are good quality for the money.  They ship a little more slowly than other Amazon products, but I think part of that is because I live across the country from their company.  This oil has a nice strong odor for clearing out the chest and sinuses.  I like to just breathe it straight from the bottle, up through my nose.  My kids also like it very much when they have a stuffy nose.  I will say that if you need something to last all night, you will want to mix it with a cream or something to keep it on the surface of your skin (I actually just use some Vicks), because this oil will absorb into your skin and then the aromatherapy part of it wears off fairly quickly.  But the scent is great, and also works well for use in vaporizers.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> My dad has trouble breathing due to a black mold infection from years ago. His doctor recommended peppermint oil (which I also ordered from this same company) but I liked this breathe easier blend as a complement and something different for him to use. In partnership, I also purchased the Mabis steam inhaler since many folks recommended it for use with aromatherapy oils. He loves it all! If you need a great inhaler and equally great selection of aromatherapy oils, try Edens Garden for the oils and get the Mabis inhaler. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have emphysema and the Breathe Easier Blend Essential Oil has been  very helpful when breathing becomes difficult. Highly recommend the seller.</li>
            <li> I love all of the Essential Oils I have purchased from Edens Garden this one has been my go to for days when I am having trouble breathing and a stuffy nose due to Allergies .I just take deep breaths in while inhaling this through my nose the results are immediate for me as I feel everything open up where I can breath easier. I much rather use this than any allergy Medication that leaves me tired.I feel this is a much safer alternative.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of the Breathe Easy Synergy blend! I normally mix up my own but I was starting to run low on my other oils and wanted to use them for a few other things before I replaced them. This blend smells great and works perfect in a bedside diffuser at night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you suffer from allergies, or are stuffed up a bit due to colds or flu then give this blend a try. The Eucalyptus helps to open up your sinuses as does the Rosemary oil. Rosemary oil is also great at helping to purify the air as well as having many more reported health benefits. Lemon oil is also used as an antiseptic and helps with asthma and respiratory ailments, as well as being anti-fungal, and having astringent properties when used on your skin. Peppermint oil works well for respiratory problems, but is also used for upset stomachs and even headaches. All of these essential oils smell great on their own in a diffuser, or mixed in with a carrier oil for topical use, but when combined they work even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try adding a few drops to a diffuser, vaporizer, or bathwater when you&#x27;re feeling stuffy. I love the smell, so I add this blend to my diffuser for a few hours during the day, and then I add it to our bedroom diffuser so it will run during the night while we sleep.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from asthma and allergies my whole life and whenever I feel tightness in my chest I breath it in right from the bottle and it gives me instant relief. It also works for easing headache and tension. I rub a few drops on the temples (not too close to the eyes) and down the back of the neck. Within about 10 minutes it relaxes me. This stuff works. Believe that!</li>
            <li> Havnt tried yet but heard good things</li>
            <li> The Oil Really Works To Help Relieve Sinus Pressure .</li>
            <li> I love to use this product when my kids have any type of upper respiratory infection/cold.  I also rub it on the soles of their feet when they have a cough and it seems to help.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t very strong. It would be good to use in a homemade chest rub for children. It isn&#x27;t strong enough for children.</li>
            <li> My son has asthma.  We have a home nebulizer that we use when he&#x27;s having a hard time breathing.  Today I added two drops of Breathe blend to the nebulizer diluted in about a tablespoon of water. Within minutes, he was breathing normally, \\&quot;Mom I can breathe now!\\&quot; I am a believer in Edens Garden oils.  We have several of the oils and they have helped replace so many items in our medicine cabinet.  This will be our \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; oil when anyone in our house has a stuffy nose, sinus pressure, congestion, cold, cough, etc! Very satisfied with this product.  We&#x27;ll be back to buy more from Edens Garden - thank you for a fantastic product!!!</li>
