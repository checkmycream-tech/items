            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>but once I used N95, I throw out my T3 right away.</li>
            <li>For those of us in love with &amp;#34;scalp&amp;#34; mode, it would be nice for it to turn on to the same setting that was last used instead of pushing a button on the side three times to get there.</li>
            <li>I actually like my T3 much better.</li>
            <li>make my hair smooth and soft.</li>

            <li>It dries my hair fast, and makes my hair very shiny and straight.  </li>
            <li>and I think it works really well.</li>

            <li>First purcahse with the seller, delivery to Canada is about 2.5 weeks, and product is vry good, worse for the dollar spend.</li>
            <li>After returned another cheaper panasonic hair dryer I finally find the right one!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Sure it&#x27;s a little over priced</li>
            <li>the hot pink is just too pretty!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find any difference between this dryer and normal dryer</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used this dryer for over a year now and I think it works really well. I don&#x27;t find any difference between this dryer and normal dryer but it blow dries  my hair really quickly and has options for cold and hot air.</li>
            <li> Great product! my Kids like it!</li>
            <li> love it! Make my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> It is the best hair dryer I have! I used have a old one which I used for many years! Best quality!</li>
            <li> The hair dryer is very nice. Just one drawback for me. As the standard voltage is 100v, in north american, I do no dare to use other level than set.</li>
            <li> The dryer looks good and works. I ordered this because a friend&#x27;s recommendation. Honestly, I feel it is a bit overly expensive. I was hoping my hair would be smooth and shiny after use but the outcome was not that great. Plus, there is no English manual, only Japanese one. A bit frustrated.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!I can even repair your hair!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use hair dryers, but I do love this one.</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how great this hair dryer was until I went on vacation without it. My hair was so dry and icky, I couldn&#x27;t wait to get home to use it. I will never leave home without it. Worth the money, great product, works like it says!</li>
            <li> worth money. super good quality and really made in japan. im from singapore and it does not need adaptor to use it. will recommend my friends to buy it. it help my hair looks shinning and smooth</li>
            <li> Its dry the hair quicker than other dryer, and light weight..love it&lt;br /&gt;but for the other fancy function, i never try, its a little pricy.</li>
            <li> After returned another cheaper panasonic hair dryer I finally find the right one! I love it. The color is very cute, making me want to use it all the time.</li>
            <li> I got this for my gf and she loves using it. She used to hate taking showers at night just because of the wet hair but this thing changed her life :)</li>
            <li> good quality ,i like it.good service.i got my dryer on time. i will keep looking for stuff in your store!!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer worth every penny of my investment and none of the drug store items can match up to it, not even close. I&#x27;ve been using Aveda&#x27;s hair products and with this magic dryer, I can feel it&#x27;s even smoother &amp; lighter. Even it&#x27;s set to turbo, the wind is not those kind of super hot hot air that damages hair. As the instruction says, blow dry with turbo hot till 80-90% and used the set (hot &amp; cold air switches mode) for the rest 10-20%. Another plus point for their being considerate to have a separate mode for drying scalp &amp; skin. Recommend to friends? Definitely.</li>
            <li> fast shipping from Japan &amp; excellent for my fine Asian hair!</li>
            <li> I thought that hair dryers are just that - hair dryers. This is not your standard hair dryer - it can basically style your hair without applying any gel or styling products on your hair. It is that amazing. And it keeps the style of your hair for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.  It dries my hair fast, and makes my hair very shiny and straight.  I used to use Revlon hair drier from drug store which is about $15.  Revlon hair dryer usually stops working after one year from purchase and makes my hair very dry and unhealthy.  This Panasonic hair dryer is a little pricy compared to regular dryer you can get from drug store but you get what you pay for.  It&#x27;s worth it.  The finish of the body prevents your fingerprints to stick even though you have hair cream or hand cream on your hand so you can keep the beautiful appearance of the dryer. I feel my hair has been healthier and shinier with this.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS!! This is such a life saver. 1. hair gets dry much faster. 2. with little patient, you can have silky smooth hair. 3. the hot pink is just too pretty!</li>
            <li> Totally love it. It makes my hair smooth and the feeling of touch is so good.</li>
            <li> I think it is too heavy for its price. I see a lot recommendation for it and decided to give it a try. I did not notice any difference for my fuzzy hair with it. I actually like my T3 much better.</li>
            <li> I tried it in Japan first time and was amazed! It makes my hair smooth and stylish. Order one immediately after I got back to US. Great product &amp; Great Service from the seller!</li>
            <li> make my hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> First purcahse with the seller, delivery to Canada is about 2.5 weeks, and product is vry good, worse for the dollar spend.</li>
            <li> The best hair dryer I ever use. It drys fast, and the hair feel smoother than before. The price is a little expensive ,but worth it. I would recommend to my friend.</li>
            <li> Great wind, and does not hurt my hair that much!!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it! It worth the price, and I show it to many friends.</li>
            <li> This is a quality hair dryer and really does dry hair differently than the $30 models.  I dry my hair very carelessly, usually without even a brush, and my hair still ends up being relatively sleek and under control in the end!  Everything down to the electric plug feels very high-quality and well-made, seems like it will last a while.  Sounds weird, but I love plugging this hair dryer in because the plug is really nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: it resets to &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; setting as default every time you turn it off and back on.  For those of us in love with &amp;#34;scalp&amp;#34; mode, it would be nice for it to turn on to the same setting that was last used instead of pushing a button on the side three times to get there.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this to be the best dryer ever because of all the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it did cut blow drying time by about 20 minutes, but my hair is wavy and thick.&lt;br /&gt;The videos showed that this blow dryer uses new technology to leave moisture in the hair..&lt;br /&gt;my hair stays too frizzy after I use this blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;I use this blow dryer the 1st half and use my old dryer (Elchim 2001 Professional Hair Dryer) to finish off my hair..&lt;br /&gt;My hair stays pretty good when using both dryers! :)</li>
