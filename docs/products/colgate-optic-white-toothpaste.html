    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Not that impressed with this toothpaste&#x27;s feeling, the taste or what it claims to do...</li>
            <li>Got two tubes for 4.99 Amazon lighting deal was awesome price.  </li>
            <li>and I think this is the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used, everything considered.</li>
            <li>THE BEST TOOTHPASTE EVER.</li>
            <li>20% empty.taste is not the best</li>
            <li>, I am happy I got to try this out!!</li>
            <li>Now the best part is the whitening power!</li>
            <li>This is good stuff!  </li>
            <li>I gave my toothpaste to my boyfriend to use and he loved it!</li>
            <li>My son has used it for a year and has beautiful teeth.  </li>
            <li>It has a great flavor and seems to whiten my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Try it if you want, but dont expect great results.</li>
            <li>so this product is great.  </li>
            <li>Smokers, pop and coffee drinkers should all be happy.  </li>
            <li>This is a great toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It works, feels great, and looks good.  </li>
            <li>As for the whitening, I found the toothpaste to me moderately successful.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but now the smallest amount of sugar dense candy is not too pleasant.</li>
            <li>It did seem to keep them bright, but we did not notice it removing discolorations or whitening areas that had yellowed a bit from coffee, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another note about Sparkling Mint is that it is really a bright mint flavor.  </li>
            <li>It says to use for 4 weeks for optimum whiteness.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, good luck to all.</li>
            <li>This paste does a good job in whitening.</li>
            <li>Also the taste and smell are good.</li>
            <li>This is a good thing because we know that peroxide can be used to whiten teeth.</li>
            <li>It makes my mouth feel clean and smell great - just what I&#x27;m looking for!</li>
            <li>A clean, minty breath is great!  </li>
            <li>It was delivered quickly and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this and will be buying it again.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to this product to anyone looking to brighten their smile :D</li>
            <li>Your smile is your best accessory so use the Colgate® Optic White® Regimen to maintain it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste!  </li>
            <li>I love it though!</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste is absoluetly amazing.</li>
            <li>That is amazing to me.</li>
            <li>also the taste is a nice mint taste but not overpowering like some mint toothpastes are.</li>
            <li>I liked it so well,l</li>
            <li>Good minty flavor, but not over the top.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say I didn&#x27;t notice a difference.  </li>
            <li>I kindly hide my tube from my boyfriend.</li>
            <li>I like this toothpaste because it feels warm on my teeth when I brush.  </li>
            <li>I think it works just as good or better for a 2-3 dollars cheaper.</li>
            <li>After 3 days use, my lips look liked they were stung by a bee</li>
            <li>Good stuff :)</li>
            <li>The toothbrush has some nice rubbery grips on the handle that I like and make the brush easier to hold.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a toothbrush holder because the Sonicare stands up on its own.</li>
            <li>As a Trio, I get a great clean feel, almost like I just went to the dentist cleaning.</li>
            <li>Also, taste great (for toothpaste) and I have experienced no side effects, problems or issues with regards to my usage thus far either.  </li>
            <li>Yes, the taste is very strong.  </li>
            <li>Was more bearable when rinsing with warm water.  </li>
            <li>At best, I would say that the color has perhaps evened out a bit more, but I really don&#x27;t think that I have achieve a much greater level of whiteness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Did I expect it to work miracles with a resultant dazzling smile?  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t get this at Amazon because I ran out of product, needed something quick and found a good price at a warehouse club for a 4 Pack.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s real nice has tongue/cheek brush, toothpaste holder cups in the bristles and was very soft.</li>
            <li>All in all, I was pleased</li>
            <li>and I will probably buy more of this brand when this tube runs out.  </li>
            <li>I wish they made it in a pump, since I find those to be more convenient.  </li>
            <li>This is a good whitening toothpaste that is good for sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m betting a lot of Viners got it because they were so pleased with their sample as I was.  </li>
            <li>and I have never ever been able to say that about a toothpaste before.  </li>
            <li>Toothpaste alone will not leave you with healthy gums.</li>
            <li>I have tried several teeth whitening toothpastes and have not yet been this impressed.  </li>
            <li>I had been using this brand for quite some time; it really does a great job of whiteening.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li>The longer you brush the more you can feel the peroxide?</li>
            <li>I feel like they have more rights than me.</li>
            <li>Many people are getting sores, blisters, tingling/burning/numbing of tongue, aggravated glands in the side and corners of their mouths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
            <li>this is an OK toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Of course, it is not as good as professional whitening, but it is good toothpaste</li>
            <li>Checked out reviews on the internet that many people have written causing severe mouth problems using this product.  </li>
            <li>I have struggled for many years to keep stain and tarter from accumulating in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I expect better results with time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Yes, I will continue purchasing this produce because of the results that my daughter has enjoyed.</li>
            <li>since I used the strips, and so this was more of a tune-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my smile is like a Diamond good price for a ggod product</li>
            <li>You might have a better one.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to guess what amount would be safe to use on my teeth</li>
            <li>Yes, simply more SNAKE OIL to line the manufacturer&#x27;s pocket book until we find out the TRUTH.  </li>
            <li>thank  most dense pastes that come out of a tube</li>
            <li>Whitens more than 3 shades</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>toothpaste is my favorite part.</li>
            <li>The second best part??</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for more than a month in hopes that I would see drastic results at some point.</li>
            <li>after a couple more days went by I</li>
            <li>noticed most of my teeth were sore.</li>
            <li>Upon first use, it was quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste tastes great and leaves your mouth fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>I am a toothpaste snob and have always bought the best such as Rembrandt, Mentadent, or Crest 3D because good toothpaste (including a Sonicare toothbrush) is so much better/cheaper than dental work.    </li>
            <li>My favorite feature being that it lathers up easy with my motorized toothbrush.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s the most important thing about a whitening toothpaste?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced no problems whatsoever with sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting much, but after using it, I am so impressed with this that this will become my new toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>wow, this product really cleans your teeth; they feel great!</li>
            <li>for the brushing experience, the minty flavor is quite strong, but not off putting.  </li>
            <li>The taste is minty, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s extremely strong or over-bearing.</li>
            <li>I thought the \\&quot;flavor\\&quot; was too strong.  </li>
            <li>(the mouth wash is a bit strong, but I will just save it for when I get my braces off in 2 weeks..)</li>
            <li>It tasted so strongly toxic and chemical that I thought the tube must be poisoned.</li>
            <li>I have great oral hygiene and no other oral problems until I began using this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I still prefer to use the strips for more noticeable whitening for special occasion.</li>
            <li>The mouthfeel is very clean and fresh afterwards, so it works okay as a toothpaste but</li>
            <li>Made a true believer out of me for sure.  </li>
            <li>started using the regimen and honest to god, within a week I had very noticeably whiter teeth!</li>
            <li>The first thing you&#x27;ll sense is that the toothpaste gets warm in your mouth when the peroxide activates.  </li>
            <li>nice and clean fresh minty taste</li>
            <li>my husband nor I had any problems with teeth sensitivity from using this toothpaste, and we found the taste to be fine.  </li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s been fine.</li>
            <li>when brushing with that, my gums were fine.</li>
            <li>but it was fine.   </li>
            <li>So as a toothpaste, it&#x27;s perfectly fine.  </li>
            <li>is worth trying if you are looking for something new based on its attractive pricing.</li>
            <li>I am for certain not going to spend a lot time using whitening strips and all that kind of thing.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really expect to see amazing results from this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I have found (as this product is surprisingly cheap)</li>
            <li>In a week my teeth were noticeably whiter, healthy gums and a fresh minty breath that made friends and coworkers stop turning their faces away every time I spoke to them.</li>
            <li>Put holes in my teeth and the dentist filled them as cavaties.  </li>
            <li>Others noticed as well and complimented me on it, and I started to smile a lot more.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get that feeling when i use my cheap ultra brite toothpaste.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was given the chance to try the regimen FREE via Influenster</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t say enough wonderful things about this toothpaste (the whole line really).  </li>
            <li>I have trouble believing that 400 people took the effort to say wonderful things about Colgate Optic</li>
            <li>Fortunately, 2 days after stopping use of the product, the pain is beginning to subside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but as results of using this toothpaste are much lighter, and yep I&#x27;m buying many more</li>
            <li>I look forward to seeing if there is continuing improvement after a month of use, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>I have had my teeth professionally whitened before but just can&#x27;t rationalize spending that kind of money any more.  </li>
            <li>Your mouth will feel really sparkling and cool which I kind of like, but some may find the flavor too strong.    </li>
            <li>The taste was OK at first, and I just thought people were being crybabies.</li>
            <li>Like many reviewers, I did experience some tooth sensitivity during the first 2 days of using it</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this toothpaste but in the end it just makes me gag.</li>
            <li>so I make sure I have a brilliant smile on my wedding day, not to mention saving a few dollars to use towards the honeymoon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like it gets my teeth really clean though.</li>
            <li>It has an interesting foaming action I&#x27;ve never had with one better.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it makes my mouth feel clean for hours even after I eat or drink.</li>
            <li>My teeth have never felt so clean and noticably whiter with just one brush.</li>
            <li>bright white teeth is important too me.</li>
            <li>The mouthwash is alcohol free, but I still had a mild burn while I used it.</li>
            <li>it is quite strong and also makes your breath feel so fresh.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re not talking movie star white, but the difference is noticeable and pleasant.</li>
            <li>but much to my pleasant surprise, this stuff actually DOES WORK.  </li>
            <li>The taste is pleasant and I am looking forward to sparkling, white results.</li>
            <li>Once rinsed, my teeth felt smooth and clean and my mouth fresh.  </li>
            <li>The first week is great, white teeth then sores!</li>
            <li>I have no loyalty to any toothpaste brands and generally buy the best brand on sale at my local stores.</li>
            <li>My husband wants me to buy more</li>
            <li>Impressive to say the least.  </li>
            <li>It might be true, but the specifics they listed was Diethyl Glycol and the fakes coming from south africa - and it was another line of toothpaste of theirs.</li>
            <li>But tube was full of air</li>
            <li>but i have never used a true whitening toothpaste like this.</li>
            <li>My teeth were whiter and healthier looking and my mouth felt super clean.</li>
            <li>I like this stuff even better than strips, because strips don&#x27;t give you whole tooth results, and strips hurt like fire on a couple of my worn teeth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like Listerine&#x27;s burn but not nearly as bad.  </li>
            <li>and I can already see a big difference!&lt;br /&gt;The Toothpaste - tastes kind of strong to me, but I can deal with that if it keeps whitening.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to try this product through a program that sends me amazing free samples.</li>
            <li>my top teeth are actually looking brighter and whiter already :)</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s my main staining that I need to stay on top of.  </li>
            <li>But if it was able to help lighten my choppers by a shade or two in a few weeks then that was a good thing.  </li>
            <li>With Advanced Seal Professional Effects Enamel Safe Dental Whitening Kit, 20-count box]], which works a lot faster, so if you&#x27;re in a hurry to whiten I would suggest using those instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Furthermore, all 3 products are reasonably priced at a retail value of $2.99 each (4 oz toothpaste and 8 oz mouthwash).&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend the Colgate Optic White product line to anyone looking for a great inexpensive tooth whitening system.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite toothpaste and I will buy no other because i couldn&#x27;t ask for a better one!</li>
            <li>This is a great product for people who want a whiter smile, especially considering its reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>After buying a new sonicare toothbrush i decided to step up to a better toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>It has a lot of silica in it, so it feels more abrasive than others, but it does the trick (along with some nominal amounts of hydrogen peroxide) to actually whiten my teeth as good or better than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve used.    </li>
            <li>bad\\&quot; in the first place!   </li>
            <li>WOW! :)  </li>
            <li>Standard mint, however, I noted that it did not taste as strong as most tooth pastes do.</li>
            <li>I will say is that I loved the clean feel after using the product; hydrogen peroxide and Silica are a great combination for that overall clean scrubbed feel that will last long after the first morning brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>And after rinsing and for several hours after brushing there was a nice slippery feeling on my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Additionally, I&#x27;ve found with a lot of toothpastes such as Crest Pro Health that they contain some kind of ingredient (one of the gingivitis or plaque chemicals) that tends to dissolve my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that Colgate has done their homework, but it is too early to tell if the additional silica will result in increased enamel wear.    </li>
            <li>, is that the hydrogen peroxide seems to make my teeth more sensitive.</li>
            <li>The paste was a bit gritty, which I actually liked, and it stuck to my teeth instead of feeling like it would slide off.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a way to whiten your teeth with the convenience of a toothpaste then this is worth a try.</li>
            <li>Fresh breath, still cleans.  </li>
            <li>I no longer use any toothpaste or dental products because I&#x27;ve developed an allergy to the chemicals and can&#x27;t find one that seems safe.</li>
            <li>Before testing any of the whiteners, my teeth were kind of off-white, bordering on yellow</li>
            <li>oh well, was worth a try in getting the whitest smile.</li>
            <li>Nothing changed, so I can&#x27;t say this toothpaste was a success.</li>
            <li>received this product from complimentary from Influenster.</li>
            <li>received these products complimentary from Influenster.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s totally worth it from my point of view.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to just avoid the toothpaste touching anything other than my gums and teeth while brushing, but this is quite difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall after using for more than 3 weeks now</li>
            <li>The Optic White toothbrush has a couple unique, innovative features.</li>
            <li>, they went away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Because it is only a toothpaste and inexpensive, the product is fairly advertised and priced and deserves the high marks.</li>
            <li>again then inside of my mouth doesn&#x27;t feel right again that I realize what was going</li>
            <li>The price is right.</li>
            <li>I noticed that my mouth and tongue tingled right away.</li>
            <li>, right?  </li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to get my favorite toothpaste complimentary from Influenster in my Sugar &#x27;n Spice Vox Box this month.</li>
            <li>so the fact this lathers up easy makes my brushing happening faster than it does with most other toothpastes.</li>
            <li>I love the freshness it leaves more than any other toothpaste, but that&#x27;s absolutely it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d pay upwards of 7 for another single tube to be honest, so</li>
            <li>I recently got the Colgate optic white regimen courtesy of Influenster, and was pretty happy for the chance to try it out.</li>
            <li>With consistent usage, I do believe my smile will continue to be white and my teeth healthy.</li>
            <li>You can tell right away that there are some powerful ingredients in the toothpaste, but for me it wasn&#x27;t strong enough to deter me from using it.</li>
            <li>&amp; it really whitened!</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste ~ it&#x27;s the only one I use anymore.  </li>
            <li>I love the pearly white look of my teeth after using this for abouty two weeks!</li>
            <li>I tried Optic White hoping I could replace my more pricey Rembrandt with it.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to everyone who is interested in purchasing a toothpaste for whitening their teeth.</li>
            <li>after the first brush my teeth were noticeably whiter.</li>
            <li>the first brushing</li>
            <li>and I get so many compliments on how white they are.</li>
            <li>and I think it works pretty well at the task of cleaning and whitening teeth.  </li>
            <li>Now I read those who give one star first before I&#x27;ll ever decide to buy a product.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Colgate!</li>
            <li>and at first thought my mouth was irritated from that).</li>
            <li>UPDATE more than a year later</li>
            <li>I had two more periods last year (two months and then three months) when I lost my sense of taste again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very, very happy to say I was wrong.</li>
            <li>It feels as if I ate something extremely hot.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different kinds and none of them work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been an avid user of the toothpaste for about a year now</li>
            <li>If you have ever rinsed with hydrogen peroxide then you&#x27;ll know exactly what it tastes like.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny when you spit it out because it continues foaming on your tongue and around your gums.</li>
            <li>Thanks Influenster for sending it to me in my Voxbox!</li>
            <li>Try Colgate Optic, and if you don&#x27;t have results by the time you finish the first tube (</li>
            <li>I thought I got my first cavity...</li>
            <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled by these initial results and very excited, as I expected that my teeth would just continue to get whiter and whiter.  </li>
            <li>Amazing when you factor in that this toothpaste is priced at a fraction of the cost of other whitening toothpastes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather use other products that may take longer to be effective but taste better---or else just stick with whitestrips.</li>
            <li>, you feel a warm burst caused by the release of hydrogen peroxide that is not off tasting as in other brands that contain this ingredient.</li>
            <li>was super excited to try Colgate&#x27;s Optic White product line.</li>
            <li>However, Optic White is good for keeping your teeth white in between whitening sessions.  </li>
            <li>I noticed this was a Gold Box special recently that sold out quickly</li>
            <li>It just looks very cool even left out on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These companies pay people to give positive reviews, and we the consumer fall for it.</li>
            <li>I first noticed it while eating a chilled apple; the texture and temp were too much</li>
            <li>, salt tastes pretty much like nothing.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re sensitive to whitening strips and other products, this could be a good alternative for you.</li>
            <li>The only plus is that it has more fluoride and it may whiten slightly, but I&#x27;m not going to drop $$ on this when I can spend a little more and get a tube of the good stuff.</li>
            <li>so clean fresh and of course white them and</li>
            <li>That healed, but I&#x27;ve had persistent dry mouth, the glands under my chin are swollen, and I lost most of my sense of taste.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly stronger than Crest 3D whitening toothpaste.   </li>
            <li>This toothpaste doesn&#x27;t whiten as fast, but its a gradual shift in the positive direction.  </li>
            <li>of my teeth whiter, not just areas covered by a strip, and that by using it more or less often I can find and maintain a level of whiteness that&#x27;s right for</li>
            <li>My mouth is really dry!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Still, it really did make my teeth quite a bit whiter.  </li>
            <li>It takes up too much time.  </li>
            <li>So I found this very convenient.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even whiten fractionally as well as Rembrandt (I use Intense Stain Rembrandt).</li>
            <li>I really like what I&#x27;m seeing, but I can&#x27;t see much because today marks day 3 and that doesn&#x27;t give me enough time to make an accurate decision, as the box itself says allow one week for a difference in whitening and 4 weeks for results.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a teeth-whitening toothpaste, or a tooth-whitening product without much hassle, this is it.</li>
            <li>and I really haven&#x27;t noticed that my teeth are any whiter.</li>
            <li>I threw away the whole tube.</li>
            <li>I have never had senstive teeth and normally use a water pik on the highest power of 5 and can no longer have the power higher than 2 without severe pain.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is a real winner.  </li>
            <li>, the tube is sturdy and works very well.  </li>
            <li>I drink coffee and tea every day and it seems that this product keeps much of the staining at bay.  </li>
            <li>whole mouth and tongue start tingling.  </li>
            <li>but really there is none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We used the whole tube and neither one of us</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s comfortable to use daily.</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise</li>
            <li>Used one of these but didn&#x27;t see much improvement.</li>
            <li>guess it really does depend on what your teeth looked like when you started using the product.  </li>
            <li>Since then i have stopped using it and really hope this skin irritation will go away</li>
            <li>I really wanted to use it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Crest whitening strips before and those worked really well.   </li>
            <li>Well for three days while using the product, my tongue really hurts and is swollen.  </li>
            <li>I guess it delivered the \\&quot;1 shade whiter in 1 week\\&quot; claim, but it would not have been really noticeable</li>
            <li>I really do like the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>so I know what I&#x27;m taking about) and it really does whiten in your teeth.  </li>
            <li>More empty promises and fancy marketing hype</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe really.</li>
            <li>I doubted that this product would work but after 2 weeks my teeth are absolutely whiter.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in the whitening.</li>
            <li>It is really foamy and fills my mouth which makes my teeth feel that they are getting cleaner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve rinsed with hydrogen peroxide before so the taste really didn&#x27;t bother me</li>
            <li>On the other hand, the price is very close to a regular toothpaste, and I&#x27;m sure it does that job fine.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product:  I have used whitening strips before and have had pretty good results, but they are so expensive that I have saved them for special occasions only.  </li>
            <li>While every person will have individual results, I found that this is just about as good as any other whitening toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it has any more whitening ability then other toothpastes like they claim.  </li>
            <li>I purchased Colgate Optic White and was excited to use a product that would whiten my teeth.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re familiar with the whitening strips, this paste leaves a similar tingling sensation and taste as the bleaching agent that&#x27;s used on the strips.</li>
            <li>It is better than other brands.</li>
            <li>It whitens better than other well known brands too.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel normal!</li>
            <li>For those of you reading this who would like to know what that toothpaste was, it was Colgate Total Clean Mint (NOT</li>
            <li>So, if you need a quick whitening effect, I would recommend this--just don&#x27;t expect much beyond your initial progress.</li>
            <li>There was also an almost effervescent foaming quality that I really liked, not the usual toothpaste foaming.  </li>
            <li>The plus of a product like this is that you need to brush your teeth anyway, and the 4oz size doesn&#x27;t cost much more than the average toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get past the foaming of the mouthwash but the toothpaste is nice.</li>
            <li>Not bad looking, but definitely not white.  </li>
            <li>Texture: initially slightly thicker than most toothpaste, but this was not a problem once brushing began.  </li>
            <li>My teeth and mouth feel fresh, clean and are glowing after using the Colgate Optic White Toothpaste for only one week</li>
            <li>however I don&#x27;t give up after just one use and will try to see if things get better after a second or third try.</li>
            <li>glad I finally found a toothpaste that you can actually tell is cleaning.</li>
            <li>I found this toothpaste to be decent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll also check consumer complaints on the internet on various products so I can make an informed decision on whether a product is worthy.</li>
            <li>Main selling point is from the product description:  ---  </li>
            <li>after using the toothpaste twice a day, I was VERY surprised to see that my teeth already looked whiter!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It makes eating saltier or highly acidic foods almost unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also comes with a relatively high amount of fluoride at 0.76%.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high hopes when I got this product.</li>
            <li>They also use a high amount of sucralose.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product to take on a trip to attend my 45th high school reunion.  </li>
            <li>Colgate® Optic White(tm) has a high impact formula to make it easier to whiten as you brush your teeth.</li>
            <li>It claims to have a high impact formula that whitens teeth in 5 days.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t possible say enough great things about this Optic White brand of products, especially the mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I have absolutely NO sensitivity, which is a huge plus(I&#x27;m what some may call a teeth whitening connoisseur-</li>
            <li>and I definitely notice a whiter smile.  </li>
            <li>Felt like it is just a marketing tactic for a normal tooth paste product</li>
            <li>I just want to feel normal again.  </li>
            <li>would recommend the COLGATE OPTIC WHITE TOOTHPASTE if you need to brighten up your smile.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s it, just normal toothpaste with hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li>I received the Optic White Regimen (toothpaste, toothbrush and mouthwash) complimentary from Influenster.</li>
            <li>I received 3 Colgate Optic White products (a toothbrush,toothpaste, and mouthwash) complimentary of Influenster.com for testing and review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;Having</li>
            <li>received the Colgate Optic White toothbrush, mouthwash and toothpaste complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>I normally just brush my tongue with the brush it self, so I didn&#x27;t use the scraper for that.</li>
            <li>It leaves me with fresherbreath for longer than the Sensodine Pronamal that I normally use.</li>
            <li>My teeth are not only pearly white, but they have that fresh from the dentist feeling every day, like you get right after a cleaning.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After using the product for about a month and half, my teeth are nice and white and not unnaturally so.</li>
            <li>I gave it a few shots and found it worthwhile until I had more pain than usual.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought 2 of the new toothbrushes with the whitener stick in the bottom for $15 each.  </li>
            <li>live&#x27;s your teeth</li>
            <li>Colgate Total Plus Whitening or Colgate Total Advanced Whitening).</li>
            <li>, I drink 4 cups of strong black tea every day</li>
            <li>Not disgusting by any means, but they are certainly not the pearly white veneers we see on television.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The taste is very much peroxide, but I actually like the foam it creates.</li>
            <li>I will be updating this review, especially if people are interested in a follow-up.</li>
            <li>the Optic White series has not failed me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying Optic White for the first time, and</li>
            <li>It did not make my teeth over-sensitive which some whitening chemicals do, and I think people interested in whitening while they brush should definitely give this paste a try.</li>
            <li>The symptoms are exactly the same of others who tried this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I noticed it has whitened my teeth  a bit in the first couple of weeks, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference after that initial time.  </li>
            <li>I actually saw results after the first use.</li>
            <li>I normally use a Sonicare toothbrush on the sensitive setting and Sensodine toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think they are necessarily due to the foaminess of the toothpaste, but more on that later.</li>
            <li>, the toothpaste is a little strong.</li>
            <li>As far as whitening goes, my teeth are pretty white already</li>
            <li>I had hoped to increase the results over time but after the initial whitening stage of 10 days-2 weeks the results stay pretty much the same.</li>
            <li>So I went to the trusty ol internet, and sure enough reviews of people who&#x27;ve used this toothpaste a long time said the same thing.</li>
            <li>Oddly, I&#x27;ve developed canker sores more frequently than usual after using this toothpaste for awhile.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not used to the large size, if you are familiar with a Sonicare brush the head is really tiny compared to a conventional toothbrush.</li>
            <li>One more thing, the toothpaste tastes like regular toothpaste so it doesn&#x27;t have that odd tooth-strip taste.</li>
            <li>And even if this product or teeth whitening products in general weren&#x27;t detrimental to the teeth&#x27;s enamel, I still wouldn&#x27;t have rated this toothpaste highly.</li>
            <li>, the tube is somewhat smaller than a normal large tube, so it barely lasted a week with 3 people using</li>
            <li>My whole upper and lower lip were swollen with a sore throat.  </li>
            <li>I am always trying different whitening pastes, but they either cost too much, taste too yucky or they don&#x27;t work that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>for whitening, my husband and I both have had our teeth professional whitened</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know that I can support it&#x27;s claim that it will whiten with professional results.</li>
            <li>She also gave me a sample of Colgate Sensitive Enamel Protect.  </li>
            <li>Well, this Colgate Optic White does not have that ingredient yet cleans my teeth really well.  </li>
            <li>As far as taste goes, this toothpaste isn&#x27;t offending</li>
            <li>The most important thing to me is that it doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive, which is what I was afraid of.</li>
            <li>The name is very catchy: OPTIC WHITE.</li>
            <li>Still, no way I was doing both; my mouth was too sensitive after using the toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Nearly all toothpastes have SLS and etc.</li>
            <li>After a few weeks of use, it does seem to have better whitening effect than my old Colgate Total toothpaste.</li>
            <li>My gums and teeth don&#x27;t feel as sensitive after using this paste as it does when I used the whitening strips.</li>
            <li>Cost me money to have my teeth fixed.  </li>
            <li>No matter how much brushing and flossing, my teeth looked like I never brushed them.  </li>
            <li>I started using it and in 3 days my front teeth were so sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I am surprised.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting to feel very depressed--you don&#x27;t know how much pleasure and comfort the simple process of eating gives you until you lose that pleasure and comfort.</li>
            <li>I think the COLGATE OPTIC WHITE TOOTHPASTE is much easier to use than the whitening strips.</li>
            <li>Colgate Optic White  is a very ggod product  </li>
            <li>So far, there&#x27;s been a clear whitening (I&#x27;d say a couple of shades)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using the Colgate Advanced White variant, but to no effect, so I gave Optic White a chance.</li>
            <li>but now i have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I have never had issues with sensitive teeth before, but just a day or two after beginning to use this toothpaste, I started getting a lot of tooth pain all over.</li>
            <li>After 4 uses in 2 days, it was still too early for any detectable whitening to occur (and indeed, none had)</li>
            <li>but my teeth became so sensitive that I had difficulty eating and drinking.  </li>
            <li>and my teeth are whiter than they&#x27;ve been in my adult life.  </li>
            <li>I tried finishing up my old toothpaste tube and just ended up throwing it out.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive teeth or skin at all and never have I had a toothpaste do this.</li>
            <li>I gagged and, honestly, nearly vomited when I used it.</li>
            <li>I am not squeamish or sensitive or melodramatic, but this is one experience I will not soon forget.</li>
            <li>I nearly dropped tears.</li>
            <li>&quot; My teeth started getting sensitive on the upper right and left sides around the time I started using this product.</li>
            <li>It is shameful, yes, but after much coffee and tea, and more than a few nights of forgetting to brush, they are not pretty.</li>
            <li>Look up consumeraffairs.com for over 90 complaints of more serious problems from people who have used it longer.  </li>
            <li>On the first day of purchase, I used optic white only at night.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time last week and almost immediately starting experiencing severe tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li>it may be a tad bit higher than the regular paste I like the way it taste and keeps the biters white</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pleased that Optic White lived up to its product claims and would purchase this item again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update March 01, 2012; after several months of use I&#x27;d just like to report that there is no visible increase in whitening beyond the first couple of weeks use.</li>
            <li>Bottom line is that for me it worked and though it&#x27;s a little more expensive, I&#x27;ve since bought two more tubes for my family.</li>
            <li>The only positive reviews are the ones posted by Colgate Palmolive employees pretending to be consumers, all cribbing from the same marketing script.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then you might have some stains that can be removed, but for someone like me that just has normal, slightly yellow teeth, it&#x27;s not going to do anything to whiten them.</li>
            <li>me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use Ultra Brite toothpaste which is cheap but always scored well with consumer reports and the Optic White left my teeth with more or less the same feeling of cleaned/polished.</li>
            <li>The Optic White I got says New York, NY and made in Mexico.</li>
            <li>The two things that are different about this toothpaste from other products I&#x27;ve tried is that there is not a whole lot of gritty texture to the paste and the taste is very, very strong.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks and was expecting amazing results, but there are a few problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>By September my mouth was very sore and my lips dry all the time.</li>
            <li>I was simply amazed by how much whiter my teeth became after just one brushing with Optic White and a Sonocare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>also feel like my acid reflux might not be responding to the medication I take because I feel like I&#x27;m about to have a major attack of stomach acid and sort of feel nausea too</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B004VGSVHS Crest 3d White Vivid Anticavity Teeth</li>
            <li>so Colgate must be aware of these severe reactions by other users.  </li>
            <li>I just used my regular brush and the results are good enough that I will continue to use at least until the tube is empty.</li>
            <li>I am just one of those people that can&#x27;t seem to achieve much whitening due to loss of enamel, and frequent coffee intake, but I think others might see a difference.  </li>
            <li>All I can say is, I have seen some result on my first tube considerating that I&#x27;m a active smoker</li>
            <li>The real downside is that my lips have been very dry and started chapping since I used this product.</li>
            <li>Yes, my teeth, formerly a dull yellow, is now noticeably more white!  </li>
            <li>Hydrogen peroxide may taste bad but it is a great way to whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li>I like Colgate in general, and</li>
            <li>However, I will tell you about myself and my use of Optic White thus far.  </li>
            <li>This is a plus, especially for people with sensitive taste buds.  </li>
            <li>It simply isn&#x27;t possible for any toothpaste to replace professional or even at home whitening products.  </li>
            <li>Not even barely.</li>
            <li>I plan on adding to my review later, after frequent use</li>
            <li>I bought extra for my adult children, and they like it as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the entire system as directed twice a day for nearly two weeks.</li>
            <li>Optic White Collection contains Colgate® Optic White® toothpaste which whitens teeth in 1 week, a toothbrush with whitening cups and polishing bristles, and new Optic White® mouthwash which protects against future stains.</li>
            <li>Just used this toothpaste for the first time and immediately noticed an odd warming sensation that I thought might be caused from some abrasive additive because I use an electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see such a visible difference, especially for my teeth not being \\&quot;so</li>
            <li>I used Colgate Optic White for 3 weeks and developed sores and a white coating on my tongue.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are naturally off-white, and coupled with occasional tea and coffee drinking they have become quite yellowish especially around the canines.</li>
            <li>After reading other reveiws it appears I am not the only one with adverse reactions and would caution others to be aware of potential problems.  </li>
            <li>I really like all the other Optic White products as well.</li>
            <li>Starting on day one of using this I had problems which only got worse as I used it more.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth, which is why I typically have to live with it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this toothpaste straight for 3 weeks, then for the following 2 used it every other day-alternating with my regular toothpaste.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m anxious to see the results in a few more days.</li>
            <li>I am a black coffee and red wine drinker and it really has made my teeth whiter.  </li>
            <li>I used all 3 products together (toothpaste, mouthwash and toothbrush), the toothpaste left my mouth feeling fresher, and in less than a week my teeth were much whiter.</li>
            <li>Initially at the 5-day mark, I noticed that the yellowness was less intense.</li>
            <li>The other thing was that the instructions mention being careful not to swallow much of it and says to call poison control if you do!  </li>
            <li>It was sort of shocking to be able to actually see the toothpaste working right after the first use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still not completely used to it after nearly two weeks, but it&#x27;s not a major issue.</li>
            <li>Only downside is the intense flavor that comes on at the end that makes it very hard to rinse your mouth because it is so intense.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not entirely sure if certain ingredients can actually trigger canker sores but not too long after I switched back to the old tooth paste I had been using</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Not that impressed with this toothpaste&#x27;s feeling, the taste or what it claims to do...</li>
            <li> Got two tubes for 4.99 Amazon lighting deal was awesome price.  </li>
            <li> and I think this is the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used, everything considered.</li>
            <li> THE BEST TOOTHPASTE EVER.</li>
            <li> 20% empty.taste is not the best</li>
            <li> , I am happy I got to try this out!!</li>
            <li> Now the best part is the whitening power!</li>
            <li> This is good stuff!  </li>
            <li> I gave my toothpaste to my boyfriend to use and he loved it!</li>
            <li> My son has used it for a year and has beautiful teeth.  </li>
            <li> It has a great flavor and seems to whiten my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Try it if you want, but dont expect great results.</li>
            <li> so this product is great.  </li>
            <li> Smokers, pop and coffee drinkers should all be happy.  </li>
            <li> This is a great toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It works, feels great, and looks good.  </li>
            <li> As for the whitening, I found the toothpaste to me moderately successful.  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasant taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but now the smallest amount of sugar dense candy is not too pleasant.</li>
            <li> It did seem to keep them bright, but we did not notice it removing discolorations or whitening areas that had yellowed a bit from coffee, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another note about Sparkling Mint is that it is really a bright mint flavor.  </li>
            <li> It says to use for 4 weeks for optimum whiteness.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, good luck to all.</li>
            <li> This paste does a good job in whitening.</li>
            <li> Also the taste and smell are good.</li>
            <li> This is a good thing because we know that peroxide can be used to whiten teeth.</li>
            <li> It makes my mouth feel clean and smell great - just what I&#x27;m looking for!</li>
            <li> A clean, minty breath is great!  </li>
            <li> It was delivered quickly and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this and will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to this product to anyone looking to brighten their smile :D</li>
            <li> Your smile is your best accessory so use the Colgate® Optic White® Regimen to maintain it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste!  </li>
            <li> I love it though!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste is absoluetly amazing.</li>
            <li> That is amazing to me.</li>
            <li> also the taste is a nice mint taste but not overpowering like some mint toothpastes are.</li>
            <li> I liked it so well,l</li>
            <li> Good minty flavor, but not over the top.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say I didn&#x27;t notice a difference.  </li>
            <li> I kindly hide my tube from my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste because it feels warm on my teeth when I brush.  </li>
            <li> I think it works just as good or better for a 2-3 dollars cheaper.</li>
            <li> After 3 days use, my lips look liked they were stung by a bee</li>
            <li> Good stuff :)</li>
            <li> The toothbrush has some nice rubbery grips on the handle that I like and make the brush easier to hold.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a toothbrush holder because the Sonicare stands up on its own.</li>
            <li> As a Trio, I get a great clean feel, almost like I just went to the dentist cleaning.</li>
            <li> Also, taste great (for toothpaste) and I have experienced no side effects, problems or issues with regards to my usage thus far either.  </li>
            <li> Yes, the taste is very strong.  </li>
            <li> Was more bearable when rinsing with warm water.  </li>
            <li> At best, I would say that the color has perhaps evened out a bit more, but I really don&#x27;t think that I have achieve a much greater level of whiteness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Did I expect it to work miracles with a resultant dazzling smile?  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t get this at Amazon because I ran out of product, needed something quick and found a good price at a warehouse club for a 4 Pack.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s real nice has tongue/cheek brush, toothpaste holder cups in the bristles and was very soft.</li>
            <li> All in all, I was pleased</li>
            <li> and I will probably buy more of this brand when this tube runs out.  </li>
            <li> I wish they made it in a pump, since I find those to be more convenient.  </li>
            <li> This is a good whitening toothpaste that is good for sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m betting a lot of Viners got it because they were so pleased with their sample as I was.  </li>
            <li> and I have never ever been able to say that about a toothpaste before.  </li>
            <li> Toothpaste alone will not leave you with healthy gums.</li>
            <li> I have tried several teeth whitening toothpastes and have not yet been this impressed.  </li>
            <li> I had been using this brand for quite some time; it really does a great job of whiteening.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li> The longer you brush the more you can feel the peroxide?</li>
            <li> I feel like they have more rights than me.</li>
            <li> Many people are getting sores, blisters, tingling/burning/numbing of tongue, aggravated glands in the side and corners of their mouths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
            <li> this is an OK toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Of course, it is not as good as professional whitening, but it is good toothpaste</li>
            <li> Checked out reviews on the internet that many people have written causing severe mouth problems using this product.  </li>
            <li> I have struggled for many years to keep stain and tarter from accumulating in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I expect better results with time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Yes, I will continue purchasing this produce because of the results that my daughter has enjoyed.</li>
            <li> since I used the strips, and so this was more of a tune-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my smile is like a Diamond good price for a ggod product</li>
            <li> You might have a better one.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to guess what amount would be safe to use on my teeth</li>
            <li> Yes, simply more SNAKE OIL to line the manufacturer&#x27;s pocket book until we find out the TRUTH.  </li>
            <li> thank  most dense pastes that come out of a tube</li>
            <li> Whitens more than 3 shades</li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> toothpaste is my favorite part.</li>
            <li> The second best part??</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for more than a month in hopes that I would see drastic results at some point.</li>
            <li> after a couple more days went by I</li>
            <li> noticed most of my teeth were sore.</li>
            <li> Upon first use, it was quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste tastes great and leaves your mouth fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> I am a toothpaste snob and have always bought the best such as Rembrandt, Mentadent, or Crest 3D because good toothpaste (including a Sonicare toothbrush) is so much better/cheaper than dental work.    </li>
            <li> My favorite feature being that it lathers up easy with my motorized toothbrush.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s the most important thing about a whitening toothpaste?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced no problems whatsoever with sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting much, but after using it, I am so impressed with this that this will become my new toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> wow, this product really cleans your teeth; they feel great!</li>
            <li> for the brushing experience, the minty flavor is quite strong, but not off putting.  </li>
            <li> The taste is minty, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s extremely strong or over-bearing.</li>
            <li> I thought the \\&quot;flavor\\&quot; was too strong.  </li>
            <li> (the mouth wash is a bit strong, but I will just save it for when I get my braces off in 2 weeks..)</li>
            <li> It tasted so strongly toxic and chemical that I thought the tube must be poisoned.</li>
            <li> I have great oral hygiene and no other oral problems until I began using this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I still prefer to use the strips for more noticeable whitening for special occasion.</li>
            <li> The mouthfeel is very clean and fresh afterwards, so it works okay as a toothpaste but</li>
            <li> Made a true believer out of me for sure.  </li>
            <li> started using the regimen and honest to god, within a week I had very noticeably whiter teeth!</li>
            <li> The first thing you&#x27;ll sense is that the toothpaste gets warm in your mouth when the peroxide activates.  </li>
            <li> nice and clean fresh minty taste</li>
            <li> my husband nor I had any problems with teeth sensitivity from using this toothpaste, and we found the taste to be fine.  </li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s been fine.</li>
            <li> when brushing with that, my gums were fine.</li>
            <li> but it was fine.   </li>
            <li> So as a toothpaste, it&#x27;s perfectly fine.  </li>
            <li> is worth trying if you are looking for something new based on its attractive pricing.</li>
            <li> I am for certain not going to spend a lot time using whitening strips and all that kind of thing.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really expect to see amazing results from this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I have found (as this product is surprisingly cheap)</li>
            <li> In a week my teeth were noticeably whiter, healthy gums and a fresh minty breath that made friends and coworkers stop turning their faces away every time I spoke to them.</li>
            <li> Put holes in my teeth and the dentist filled them as cavaties.  </li>
            <li> Others noticed as well and complimented me on it, and I started to smile a lot more.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get that feeling when i use my cheap ultra brite toothpaste.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was given the chance to try the regimen FREE via Influenster</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t say enough wonderful things about this toothpaste (the whole line really).  </li>
            <li> I have trouble believing that 400 people took the effort to say wonderful things about Colgate Optic</li>
            <li> Fortunately, 2 days after stopping use of the product, the pain is beginning to subside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but as results of using this toothpaste are much lighter, and yep I&#x27;m buying many more</li>
            <li> I look forward to seeing if there is continuing improvement after a month of use, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I have had my teeth professionally whitened before but just can&#x27;t rationalize spending that kind of money any more.  </li>
            <li> Your mouth will feel really sparkling and cool which I kind of like, but some may find the flavor too strong.    </li>
            <li> The taste was OK at first, and I just thought people were being crybabies.</li>
            <li> Like many reviewers, I did experience some tooth sensitivity during the first 2 days of using it</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this toothpaste but in the end it just makes me gag.</li>
            <li> so I make sure I have a brilliant smile on my wedding day, not to mention saving a few dollars to use towards the honeymoon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like it gets my teeth really clean though.</li>
            <li> It has an interesting foaming action I&#x27;ve never had with one better.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it makes my mouth feel clean for hours even after I eat or drink.</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt so clean and noticably whiter with just one brush.</li>
            <li> bright white teeth is important too me.</li>
            <li> The mouthwash is alcohol free, but I still had a mild burn while I used it.</li>
            <li> it is quite strong and also makes your breath feel so fresh.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re not talking movie star white, but the difference is noticeable and pleasant.</li>
            <li> but much to my pleasant surprise, this stuff actually DOES WORK.  </li>
            <li> The taste is pleasant and I am looking forward to sparkling, white results.</li>
            <li> Once rinsed, my teeth felt smooth and clean and my mouth fresh.  </li>
            <li> The first week is great, white teeth then sores!</li>
            <li> I have no loyalty to any toothpaste brands and generally buy the best brand on sale at my local stores.</li>
            <li> My husband wants me to buy more</li>
            <li> Impressive to say the least.  </li>
            <li> It might be true, but the specifics they listed was Diethyl Glycol and the fakes coming from south africa - and it was another line of toothpaste of theirs.</li>
            <li> But tube was full of air</li>
            <li> but i have never used a true whitening toothpaste like this.</li>
            <li> My teeth were whiter and healthier looking and my mouth felt super clean.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff even better than strips, because strips don&#x27;t give you whole tooth results, and strips hurt like fire on a couple of my worn teeth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like Listerine&#x27;s burn but not nearly as bad.  </li>
            <li> and I can already see a big difference!&lt;br /&gt;The Toothpaste - tastes kind of strong to me, but I can deal with that if it keeps whitening.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to try this product through a program that sends me amazing free samples.</li>
            <li> my top teeth are actually looking brighter and whiter already :)</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s my main staining that I need to stay on top of.  </li>
            <li> But if it was able to help lighten my choppers by a shade or two in a few weeks then that was a good thing.  </li>
            <li> With Advanced Seal Professional Effects Enamel Safe Dental Whitening Kit, 20-count box]], which works a lot faster, so if you&#x27;re in a hurry to whiten I would suggest using those instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Furthermore, all 3 products are reasonably priced at a retail value of $2.99 each (4 oz toothpaste and 8 oz mouthwash).&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend the Colgate Optic White product line to anyone looking for a great inexpensive tooth whitening system.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite toothpaste and I will buy no other because i couldn&#x27;t ask for a better one!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for people who want a whiter smile, especially considering its reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> After buying a new sonicare toothbrush i decided to step up to a better toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> It has a lot of silica in it, so it feels more abrasive than others, but it does the trick (along with some nominal amounts of hydrogen peroxide) to actually whiten my teeth as good or better than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve used.    </li>
            <li> bad\\&quot; in the first place!   </li>
            <li> WOW! :)  </li>
            <li> Standard mint, however, I noted that it did not taste as strong as most tooth pastes do.</li>
            <li> I will say is that I loved the clean feel after using the product; hydrogen peroxide and Silica are a great combination for that overall clean scrubbed feel that will last long after the first morning brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> And after rinsing and for several hours after brushing there was a nice slippery feeling on my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Additionally, I&#x27;ve found with a lot of toothpastes such as Crest Pro Health that they contain some kind of ingredient (one of the gingivitis or plaque chemicals) that tends to dissolve my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that Colgate has done their homework, but it is too early to tell if the additional silica will result in increased enamel wear.    </li>
            <li> , is that the hydrogen peroxide seems to make my teeth more sensitive.</li>
            <li> The paste was a bit gritty, which I actually liked, and it stuck to my teeth instead of feeling like it would slide off.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a way to whiten your teeth with the convenience of a toothpaste then this is worth a try.</li>
            <li> Fresh breath, still cleans.  </li>
            <li> I no longer use any toothpaste or dental products because I&#x27;ve developed an allergy to the chemicals and can&#x27;t find one that seems safe.</li>
            <li> Before testing any of the whiteners, my teeth were kind of off-white, bordering on yellow</li>
            <li> oh well, was worth a try in getting the whitest smile.</li>
            <li> Nothing changed, so I can&#x27;t say this toothpaste was a success.</li>
            <li> received this product from complimentary from Influenster.</li>
            <li> received these products complimentary from Influenster.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s totally worth it from my point of view.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to just avoid the toothpaste touching anything other than my gums and teeth while brushing, but this is quite difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall after using for more than 3 weeks now</li>
            <li> The Optic White toothbrush has a couple unique, innovative features.</li>
            <li> , they went away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Because it is only a toothpaste and inexpensive, the product is fairly advertised and priced and deserves the high marks.</li>
            <li> again then inside of my mouth doesn&#x27;t feel right again that I realize what was going</li>
            <li> The price is right.</li>
            <li> I noticed that my mouth and tongue tingled right away.</li>
            <li> , right?  </li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to get my favorite toothpaste complimentary from Influenster in my Sugar &#x27;n Spice Vox Box this month.</li>
            <li> so the fact this lathers up easy makes my brushing happening faster than it does with most other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I love the freshness it leaves more than any other toothpaste, but that&#x27;s absolutely it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d pay upwards of 7 for another single tube to be honest, so</li>
            <li> I recently got the Colgate optic white regimen courtesy of Influenster, and was pretty happy for the chance to try it out.</li>
            <li> With consistent usage, I do believe my smile will continue to be white and my teeth healthy.</li>
            <li> You can tell right away that there are some powerful ingredients in the toothpaste, but for me it wasn&#x27;t strong enough to deter me from using it.</li>
            <li> &amp; it really whitened!</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste ~ it&#x27;s the only one I use anymore.  </li>
            <li> I love the pearly white look of my teeth after using this for abouty two weeks!</li>
            <li> I tried Optic White hoping I could replace my more pricey Rembrandt with it.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to everyone who is interested in purchasing a toothpaste for whitening their teeth.</li>
            <li> after the first brush my teeth were noticeably whiter.</li>
            <li> the first brushing</li>
            <li> and I get so many compliments on how white they are.</li>
            <li> and I think it works pretty well at the task of cleaning and whitening teeth.  </li>
            <li> Now I read those who give one star first before I&#x27;ll ever decide to buy a product.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Colgate!</li>
            <li> and at first thought my mouth was irritated from that).</li>
            <li> UPDATE more than a year later</li>
            <li> I had two more periods last year (two months and then three months) when I lost my sense of taste again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very, very happy to say I was wrong.</li>
            <li> It feels as if I ate something extremely hot.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different kinds and none of them work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an avid user of the toothpaste for about a year now</li>
            <li> If you have ever rinsed with hydrogen peroxide then you&#x27;ll know exactly what it tastes like.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny when you spit it out because it continues foaming on your tongue and around your gums.</li>
            <li> Thanks Influenster for sending it to me in my Voxbox!</li>
            <li> Try Colgate Optic, and if you don&#x27;t have results by the time you finish the first tube (</li>
            <li> I thought I got my first cavity...</li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled by these initial results and very excited, as I expected that my teeth would just continue to get whiter and whiter.  </li>
            <li> Amazing when you factor in that this toothpaste is priced at a fraction of the cost of other whitening toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather use other products that may take longer to be effective but taste better---or else just stick with whitestrips.</li>
            <li> , you feel a warm burst caused by the release of hydrogen peroxide that is not off tasting as in other brands that contain this ingredient.</li>
            <li> was super excited to try Colgate&#x27;s Optic White product line.</li>
            <li> However, Optic White is good for keeping your teeth white in between whitening sessions.  </li>
            <li> I noticed this was a Gold Box special recently that sold out quickly</li>
            <li> It just looks very cool even left out on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These companies pay people to give positive reviews, and we the consumer fall for it.</li>
            <li> I first noticed it while eating a chilled apple; the texture and temp were too much</li>
            <li> , salt tastes pretty much like nothing.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re sensitive to whitening strips and other products, this could be a good alternative for you.</li>
            <li> The only plus is that it has more fluoride and it may whiten slightly, but I&#x27;m not going to drop $$ on this when I can spend a little more and get a tube of the good stuff.</li>
            <li> so clean fresh and of course white them and</li>
            <li> That healed, but I&#x27;ve had persistent dry mouth, the glands under my chin are swollen, and I lost most of my sense of taste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly stronger than Crest 3D whitening toothpaste.   </li>
            <li> This toothpaste doesn&#x27;t whiten as fast, but its a gradual shift in the positive direction.  </li>
            <li> of my teeth whiter, not just areas covered by a strip, and that by using it more or less often I can find and maintain a level of whiteness that&#x27;s right for</li>
            <li> My mouth is really dry!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Still, it really did make my teeth quite a bit whiter.  </li>
            <li> It takes up too much time.  </li>
            <li> So I found this very convenient.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even whiten fractionally as well as Rembrandt (I use Intense Stain Rembrandt).</li>
            <li> I really like what I&#x27;m seeing, but I can&#x27;t see much because today marks day 3 and that doesn&#x27;t give me enough time to make an accurate decision, as the box itself says allow one week for a difference in whitening and 4 weeks for results.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a teeth-whitening toothpaste, or a tooth-whitening product without much hassle, this is it.</li>
            <li> and I really haven&#x27;t noticed that my teeth are any whiter.</li>
            <li> I threw away the whole tube.</li>
            <li> I have never had senstive teeth and normally use a water pik on the highest power of 5 and can no longer have the power higher than 2 without severe pain.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is a real winner.  </li>
            <li> , the tube is sturdy and works very well.  </li>
            <li> I drink coffee and tea every day and it seems that this product keeps much of the staining at bay.  </li>
            <li> whole mouth and tongue start tingling.  </li>
            <li> but really there is none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We used the whole tube and neither one of us</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s comfortable to use daily.</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise</li>
            <li> Used one of these but didn&#x27;t see much improvement.</li>
            <li> guess it really does depend on what your teeth looked like when you started using the product.  </li>
            <li> Since then i have stopped using it and really hope this skin irritation will go away</li>
            <li> I really wanted to use it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Crest whitening strips before and those worked really well.   </li>
            <li> Well for three days while using the product, my tongue really hurts and is swollen.  </li>
            <li> I guess it delivered the \\&quot;1 shade whiter in 1 week\\&quot; claim, but it would not have been really noticeable</li>
            <li> I really do like the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> so I know what I&#x27;m taking about) and it really does whiten in your teeth.  </li>
            <li> More empty promises and fancy marketing hype</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe really.</li>
            <li> I doubted that this product would work but after 2 weeks my teeth are absolutely whiter.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in the whitening.</li>
            <li> It is really foamy and fills my mouth which makes my teeth feel that they are getting cleaner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve rinsed with hydrogen peroxide before so the taste really didn&#x27;t bother me</li>
            <li> On the other hand, the price is very close to a regular toothpaste, and I&#x27;m sure it does that job fine.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product:  I have used whitening strips before and have had pretty good results, but they are so expensive that I have saved them for special occasions only.  </li>
            <li> While every person will have individual results, I found that this is just about as good as any other whitening toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it has any more whitening ability then other toothpastes like they claim.  </li>
            <li> I purchased Colgate Optic White and was excited to use a product that would whiten my teeth.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re familiar with the whitening strips, this paste leaves a similar tingling sensation and taste as the bleaching agent that&#x27;s used on the strips.</li>
            <li> It is better than other brands.</li>
            <li> It whitens better than other well known brands too.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel normal!</li>
            <li> For those of you reading this who would like to know what that toothpaste was, it was Colgate Total Clean Mint (NOT</li>
            <li> So, if you need a quick whitening effect, I would recommend this--just don&#x27;t expect much beyond your initial progress.</li>
            <li> There was also an almost effervescent foaming quality that I really liked, not the usual toothpaste foaming.  </li>
            <li> The plus of a product like this is that you need to brush your teeth anyway, and the 4oz size doesn&#x27;t cost much more than the average toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get past the foaming of the mouthwash but the toothpaste is nice.</li>
            <li> Not bad looking, but definitely not white.  </li>
            <li> Texture: initially slightly thicker than most toothpaste, but this was not a problem once brushing began.  </li>
            <li> My teeth and mouth feel fresh, clean and are glowing after using the Colgate Optic White Toothpaste for only one week</li>
            <li> however I don&#x27;t give up after just one use and will try to see if things get better after a second or third try.</li>
            <li> glad I finally found a toothpaste that you can actually tell is cleaning.</li>
            <li> I found this toothpaste to be decent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll also check consumer complaints on the internet on various products so I can make an informed decision on whether a product is worthy.</li>
            <li> Main selling point is from the product description:  ---  </li>
            <li> after using the toothpaste twice a day, I was VERY surprised to see that my teeth already looked whiter!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It makes eating saltier or highly acidic foods almost unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also comes with a relatively high amount of fluoride at 0.76%.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high hopes when I got this product.</li>
            <li> They also use a high amount of sucralose.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to take on a trip to attend my 45th high school reunion.  </li>
            <li> Colgate® Optic White(tm) has a high impact formula to make it easier to whiten as you brush your teeth.</li>
            <li> It claims to have a high impact formula that whitens teeth in 5 days.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t possible say enough great things about this Optic White brand of products, especially the mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely NO sensitivity, which is a huge plus(I&#x27;m what some may call a teeth whitening connoisseur-</li>
            <li> and I definitely notice a whiter smile.  </li>
            <li> Felt like it is just a marketing tactic for a normal tooth paste product</li>
            <li> I just want to feel normal again.  </li>
            <li> would recommend the COLGATE OPTIC WHITE TOOTHPASTE if you need to brighten up your smile.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s it, just normal toothpaste with hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li> I received the Optic White Regimen (toothpaste, toothbrush and mouthwash) complimentary from Influenster.</li>
            <li> I received 3 Colgate Optic White products (a toothbrush,toothpaste, and mouthwash) complimentary of Influenster.com for testing and review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;Having</li>
            <li> received the Colgate Optic White toothbrush, mouthwash and toothpaste complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I normally just brush my tongue with the brush it self, so I didn&#x27;t use the scraper for that.</li>
            <li> It leaves me with fresherbreath for longer than the Sensodine Pronamal that I normally use.</li>
            <li> My teeth are not only pearly white, but they have that fresh from the dentist feeling every day, like you get right after a cleaning.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After using the product for about a month and half, my teeth are nice and white and not unnaturally so.</li>
            <li> I gave it a few shots and found it worthwhile until I had more pain than usual.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought 2 of the new toothbrushes with the whitener stick in the bottom for $15 each.  </li>
            <li> live&#x27;s your teeth</li>
            <li> Colgate Total Plus Whitening or Colgate Total Advanced Whitening).</li>
            <li> , I drink 4 cups of strong black tea every day</li>
            <li> Not disgusting by any means, but they are certainly not the pearly white veneers we see on television.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The taste is very much peroxide, but I actually like the foam it creates.</li>
            <li> I will be updating this review, especially if people are interested in a follow-up.</li>
            <li> the Optic White series has not failed me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying Optic White for the first time, and</li>
            <li> It did not make my teeth over-sensitive which some whitening chemicals do, and I think people interested in whitening while they brush should definitely give this paste a try.</li>
            <li> The symptoms are exactly the same of others who tried this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I noticed it has whitened my teeth  a bit in the first couple of weeks, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference after that initial time.  </li>
            <li> I actually saw results after the first use.</li>
            <li> I normally use a Sonicare toothbrush on the sensitive setting and Sensodine toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they are necessarily due to the foaminess of the toothpaste, but more on that later.</li>
            <li> , the toothpaste is a little strong.</li>
            <li> As far as whitening goes, my teeth are pretty white already</li>
            <li> I had hoped to increase the results over time but after the initial whitening stage of 10 days-2 weeks the results stay pretty much the same.</li>
            <li> So I went to the trusty ol internet, and sure enough reviews of people who&#x27;ve used this toothpaste a long time said the same thing.</li>
            <li> Oddly, I&#x27;ve developed canker sores more frequently than usual after using this toothpaste for awhile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not used to the large size, if you are familiar with a Sonicare brush the head is really tiny compared to a conventional toothbrush.</li>
            <li> One more thing, the toothpaste tastes like regular toothpaste so it doesn&#x27;t have that odd tooth-strip taste.</li>
            <li> And even if this product or teeth whitening products in general weren&#x27;t detrimental to the teeth&#x27;s enamel, I still wouldn&#x27;t have rated this toothpaste highly.</li>
            <li> , the tube is somewhat smaller than a normal large tube, so it barely lasted a week with 3 people using</li>
            <li> My whole upper and lower lip were swollen with a sore throat.  </li>
            <li> I am always trying different whitening pastes, but they either cost too much, taste too yucky or they don&#x27;t work that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> for whitening, my husband and I both have had our teeth professional whitened</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know that I can support it&#x27;s claim that it will whiten with professional results.</li>
            <li> She also gave me a sample of Colgate Sensitive Enamel Protect.  </li>
            <li> Well, this Colgate Optic White does not have that ingredient yet cleans my teeth really well.  </li>
            <li> As far as taste goes, this toothpaste isn&#x27;t offending</li>
            <li> The most important thing to me is that it doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive, which is what I was afraid of.</li>
            <li> The name is very catchy: OPTIC WHITE.</li>
            <li> Still, no way I was doing both; my mouth was too sensitive after using the toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Nearly all toothpastes have SLS and etc.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of use, it does seem to have better whitening effect than my old Colgate Total toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My gums and teeth don&#x27;t feel as sensitive after using this paste as it does when I used the whitening strips.</li>
            <li> Cost me money to have my teeth fixed.  </li>
            <li> No matter how much brushing and flossing, my teeth looked like I never brushed them.  </li>
            <li> I started using it and in 3 days my front teeth were so sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I am surprised.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to feel very depressed--you don&#x27;t know how much pleasure and comfort the simple process of eating gives you until you lose that pleasure and comfort.</li>
            <li> I think the COLGATE OPTIC WHITE TOOTHPASTE is much easier to use than the whitening strips.</li>
            <li> Colgate Optic White  is a very ggod product  </li>
            <li> So far, there&#x27;s been a clear whitening (I&#x27;d say a couple of shades)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the Colgate Advanced White variant, but to no effect, so I gave Optic White a chance.</li>
            <li> but now i have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I have never had issues with sensitive teeth before, but just a day or two after beginning to use this toothpaste, I started getting a lot of tooth pain all over.</li>
            <li> After 4 uses in 2 days, it was still too early for any detectable whitening to occur (and indeed, none had)</li>
            <li> but my teeth became so sensitive that I had difficulty eating and drinking.  </li>
            <li> and my teeth are whiter than they&#x27;ve been in my adult life.  </li>
            <li> I tried finishing up my old toothpaste tube and just ended up throwing it out.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive teeth or skin at all and never have I had a toothpaste do this.</li>
            <li> I gagged and, honestly, nearly vomited when I used it.</li>
            <li> I am not squeamish or sensitive or melodramatic, but this is one experience I will not soon forget.</li>
            <li> I nearly dropped tears.</li>
            <li> &quot; My teeth started getting sensitive on the upper right and left sides around the time I started using this product.</li>
            <li> It is shameful, yes, but after much coffee and tea, and more than a few nights of forgetting to brush, they are not pretty.</li>
            <li> Look up consumeraffairs.com for over 90 complaints of more serious problems from people who have used it longer.  </li>
            <li> On the first day of purchase, I used optic white only at night.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time last week and almost immediately starting experiencing severe tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li> it may be a tad bit higher than the regular paste I like the way it taste and keeps the biters white</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pleased that Optic White lived up to its product claims and would purchase this item again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update March 01, 2012; after several months of use I&#x27;d just like to report that there is no visible increase in whitening beyond the first couple of weeks use.</li>
            <li> Bottom line is that for me it worked and though it&#x27;s a little more expensive, I&#x27;ve since bought two more tubes for my family.</li>
            <li> The only positive reviews are the ones posted by Colgate Palmolive employees pretending to be consumers, all cribbing from the same marketing script.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then you might have some stains that can be removed, but for someone like me that just has normal, slightly yellow teeth, it&#x27;s not going to do anything to whiten them.</li>
            <li> me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use Ultra Brite toothpaste which is cheap but always scored well with consumer reports and the Optic White left my teeth with more or less the same feeling of cleaned/polished.</li>
            <li> The Optic White I got says New York, NY and made in Mexico.</li>
            <li> The two things that are different about this toothpaste from other products I&#x27;ve tried is that there is not a whole lot of gritty texture to the paste and the taste is very, very strong.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks and was expecting amazing results, but there are a few problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> By September my mouth was very sore and my lips dry all the time.</li>
            <li> I was simply amazed by how much whiter my teeth became after just one brushing with Optic White and a Sonocare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> also feel like my acid reflux might not be responding to the medication I take because I feel like I&#x27;m about to have a major attack of stomach acid and sort of feel nausea too</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B004VGSVHS Crest 3d White Vivid Anticavity Teeth</li>
            <li> so Colgate must be aware of these severe reactions by other users.  </li>
            <li> I just used my regular brush and the results are good enough that I will continue to use at least until the tube is empty.</li>
            <li> I am just one of those people that can&#x27;t seem to achieve much whitening due to loss of enamel, and frequent coffee intake, but I think others might see a difference.  </li>
            <li> All I can say is, I have seen some result on my first tube considerating that I&#x27;m a active smoker</li>
            <li> The real downside is that my lips have been very dry and started chapping since I used this product.</li>
            <li> Yes, my teeth, formerly a dull yellow, is now noticeably more white!  </li>
            <li> Hydrogen peroxide may taste bad but it is a great way to whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li> I like Colgate in general, and</li>
            <li> However, I will tell you about myself and my use of Optic White thus far.  </li>
            <li> This is a plus, especially for people with sensitive taste buds.  </li>
            <li> It simply isn&#x27;t possible for any toothpaste to replace professional or even at home whitening products.  </li>
            <li> Not even barely.</li>
            <li> I plan on adding to my review later, after frequent use</li>
            <li> I bought extra for my adult children, and they like it as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the entire system as directed twice a day for nearly two weeks.</li>
            <li> Optic White Collection contains Colgate® Optic White® toothpaste which whitens teeth in 1 week, a toothbrush with whitening cups and polishing bristles, and new Optic White® mouthwash which protects against future stains.</li>
            <li> Just used this toothpaste for the first time and immediately noticed an odd warming sensation that I thought might be caused from some abrasive additive because I use an electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see such a visible difference, especially for my teeth not being \\&quot;so</li>
            <li> I used Colgate Optic White for 3 weeks and developed sores and a white coating on my tongue.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are naturally off-white, and coupled with occasional tea and coffee drinking they have become quite yellowish especially around the canines.</li>
            <li> After reading other reveiws it appears I am not the only one with adverse reactions and would caution others to be aware of potential problems.  </li>
            <li> I really like all the other Optic White products as well.</li>
            <li> Starting on day one of using this I had problems which only got worse as I used it more.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth, which is why I typically have to live with it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this toothpaste straight for 3 weeks, then for the following 2 used it every other day-alternating with my regular toothpaste.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m anxious to see the results in a few more days.</li>
            <li> I am a black coffee and red wine drinker and it really has made my teeth whiter.  </li>
            <li> I used all 3 products together (toothpaste, mouthwash and toothbrush), the toothpaste left my mouth feeling fresher, and in less than a week my teeth were much whiter.</li>
            <li> Initially at the 5-day mark, I noticed that the yellowness was less intense.</li>
            <li> The other thing was that the instructions mention being careful not to swallow much of it and says to call poison control if you do!  </li>
            <li> It was sort of shocking to be able to actually see the toothpaste working right after the first use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not completely used to it after nearly two weeks, but it&#x27;s not a major issue.</li>
            <li> Only downside is the intense flavor that comes on at the end that makes it very hard to rinse your mouth because it is so intense.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not entirely sure if certain ingredients can actually trigger canker sores but not too long after I switched back to the old tooth paste I had been using</li>
            <li> I also think the tube is kind of small if you live in a household that shares toothpaste it will be expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it a month and had to cut back on using it to only every other day because it made my teeth quite sensitive, so I think this Optic White is rather abrasive.  </li>
            <li> It helps maintain my white teeth, but so do other toothpastes and they don&#x27;t make my teeth so sensitive like the Optic White</li>
            <li> But, in the past several months, I&#x27;ve noticed that the tubes are now at least a third filled with air!</li>
            <li> I guess I was wrong because it does not whiten nearly as well and doesn&#x27;t leave my teeth feeling as clean.</li>
            <li> I wish I had never set eyes on this toothpaste, as do the hundreds of people who have left negative reviews online (Google &amp;#34;consumer affairs colgate toothpaste reviews&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> After only 2 days of using colgate optic white toothpaste i started having some skin irritation inside of my mouth and dry lips.</li>
            <li> I am an avid flosser and always brush at least twice a day.</li>
            <li> I am just not sure the whitening element is doing much if anything.</li>
            <li> i would probably have a problem with whitening strips, which i have not used, but just must be sensitive to the wearing down of enamel or something.</li>
            <li> Mouthwash - Taste horrible and even know it&#x27;s alcohol free unlike most brands it still burns...</li>
            <li> So I switched back to my old, blue gel toothpaste and immediately, I had no more pain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using peroxide-based mouthwashes for awhile now, but haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in whiteness, so was a bit skeptical about this product, but decided to give it a go.  </li>
            <li> But, in the name of vanity I continued using it on and off for several weeks although the whitening effect was minimal.</li>
            <li> Also, I prefer to use a fluoride rinse to help prevent cavities, so I wouldn&#x27;t use this one long term.</li>
            <li> I mean, how good/bad can a toothpaste really be?</li>
            <li> I advise other with issues with this product to do the same.</li>
            <li> the other hand, my daughter has received multiple compliments since she began using this product.  </li>
            <li> If you are a coffee drinker or do any other things that can stain teeth, you will not get the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and although I wouldn&#x27;t say that it dramatically whiten my teeth that could be due to the fact that the strips had already made them as white as they could be, it&#x27;s been almost two years come March 2012</li>
            <li> They were several shades whiter and, after one brushing, whiter than after using other products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands that work about the same.  </li>
            <li> My expectations were low because I suffer from extreme tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li> so I tested it 2 more days and the sensitivity is bad enough</li>
            <li> I also just brushed my teeth with it a few minutes ago and the moment I put the toothbrush to my lower left gum I immediately felt sensitivity.</li>
            <li> The Optic White looks unimpressive as just a plain white paste.  </li>
            <li> and dreading brushing my teeth because of the taste....and finally decided the tradeoffs are just not worth it.  </li>
            <li> Personally I pitched the rest of the tube - not worth it to me.</li>
            <li> My teeth became too sensitive and not able to brush.</li>
            <li> So, I asked my husband if he had noticed anything, and he (grudgingly!) admitted that he had noticed his own teeth looking whiter</li>
            <li> For a week I have had loose stools and now after reading all the web reviews know why.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback to the location of the built in tongue scraper was that when I laid my toothbrush down on the counter I felt yucky letting the scraper rest on the counter.</li>
            <li> but my teeth became very sensitive and it was hard to eat.  </li>
            <li> Like many people, I am sick and tired of buying the pricey whitening strips and pastes only to become agitated with the whole process and lackluster results.</li>
            <li> I did notice slight whitening but wondered how a product that was brushed on could whiten, from the inside out, if it was not designed to stay on the teeth for a period of time as you have to do with whitening</li>
            <li> I have bought one previously and ended up going back to another brand.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed results after only a week and a half.</li>
            <li> I have since heard this same type of complaint from two friends who also used this Optic White Toothpaste and mouth rinse</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried strips and different brands of toothpaste, all with disappointing results, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I started using Colgate Optic White about a week ago.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After searching the web, I find vast numbers of negative reviews of this product, symptoms similar to mine.  </li>
            <li> But my teeth were noticeably whiter in three days and kept getting whiter for the next few days.  </li>
            <li> not really,</li>
            <li> and I really do not notice any whitening effects.  </li>
            <li> I looked at the ingredients of Colgate Optic White and was astounded by all the harsh ingredients.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i highly DO NOT recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have been using Colgate Optic White for a few months now.  </li>
            <li> , turns out there&#x27;s a few different ingredients that can cause it: SLS, propylene glycol, and some other things.</li>
            <li> I almost always have yucky black coffee stains on my lower front teeth from the coffee that typically have to stay until the next dentist visit.  </li>
            <li> Be careful using ingredients from other countries that have no testing procedures for safety.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that you do get a bit of a chemical taste in your mouth if you brush for too long.</li>
            <li> I admit, I was doubtful at first, but it really did work.</li>
            <li> It lathers up well in your mouth due to the hydrogen peroxide, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You can google \\&quot;Colgate optic white\\&quot; for other people&#x27;s complains.  </li>
            <li> They might not bother other people.  </li>
            <li> I still have some other toothpaste</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty skeptical of all the tooth whitening products out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products - strips, trays w/ gel, mouthwash, etc.</li>
            <li> But still, he had to have MRIS and other stuff, not to mention the scare of the possibility of tumors and cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product or any product containing such harsh chemicals!</li>
            <li> I went ahead and bought the small 4 oz size tube, which in combination with a store sale and a couple coupons only cost pennies.</li>
            <li> I am giving this product 5 stars because although I don&#x27;t expect to achieve unbelievable results, it is simply a toothpaste and cannot perform miracles.</li>
            <li> This works just like any other whitining toothpaste on the market, there is nothing optic about it</li>
            <li> I am an avid pop and tea drinker so needless to say I need a product that will remove stains from teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After a couple weeks, it kinda seemed like my teeth were whiter, but after a month, even other people noticed.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that did not occur; in fact, over three weeks later, there has been little additional change since those first few days.  </li>
            <li> My mouth is still sore and I have to be very careful about ingesting acidic food and drinks.</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews I fear there must be something wrong with my tube of toothpaste, so in the trash it goes, and unfortunately I will never know how effective it might be for whitening.</li>
            <li> I did a web search looking for others that might have had the same reaction and found out that a lot have had similar and worse results at http://www.consumeraffairs.com/cosmetics/colgate.html&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind the flavor though I did noticed a slight bitter taste when brushing.  </li>
            <li> I have a pretty difficult time with other whitening products, so I was a little leery of trying a toothpast to use every day.</li>
            <li> Noticeably less after-taste than other toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to review products such as this, because there is not much to say about a simple product.  </li>
            <li> have tried a few different whitening agents: toothpastes (usually with baking soda in them), mouthwashes, gel trays, gum.</li>
            <li> but I did notice after brushing that my breath did not feel or stay that \\&quot;minty-fresh\\&quot; as long as it does with my usual brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, lets get down to the points.  </li>
            <li> The swelling went down after changing toothpastes.</li>
            <li> The Optic White mint flavor was about average (not especially strong or weak)</li>
            <li> Whitestrips and other heavy duty teeth whiteners make my teeth throb with pain.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I brush my teeth too long, and toothbrush is too hard, but I know one thing, this toothpaste is NOT worth the pain.</li>
            <li> My teeth have always been a slightly pale-yellow color.  </li>
            <li> Is what a dentist told me when I seen her less than a week ago.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the only remedy to discoloration of teeth is to burn hundreds of dollars and find one of those websites that offer deals and check daily to see if a dentist in your area is offering teeth whitening services.</li>
            <li> , Optic White isn&#x27;t on the American Dental Association (ADA) list of approved toothpastes, and it&#x27;s impossible to know if it&#x27;s because Colgate didn&#x27;t apply for Optic White to be on the list, or if it&#x27;s because the product didn&#x27;t meet the ADA&#x27;s guidelines for safety and effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> This tooth paste has a slight tingle and warming sensation unlike others that feel like they are scratching your teeth</li>
            <li> I drink black coffee, and lots of it, every day.  </li>
            <li> The product overall did not noticeably whiten my teeth, it improved the color a little, but it was barely noticeable and my shade was somewhere in the middle, thankfully it wasn&#x27;t too bad before I began this regimen.</li>
            <li> The sparkling mint flavor of the toothpaste and mouthwash were not overwhelmingly strong like other products out on the market.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to rate anything one star because I feel that the corresponding \\&quot;I hate it\\&quot; is too strong.</li>
            <li> and we don&#x27;t die, but I found that a little unnerving.  </li>
            <li> but they look a little brighter.    </li>
            <li> After three or four days the pain was less, but I developed a painful sore in the back of my throat.</li>
            <li> after looking on online about complains on this toothpaste i found out its very common amount recent users of this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I bought the &amp;#34;Enamel White Luminous Mint.&amp;#34; I used it for four days twice a day before I realized that it was the cause of my entire mouth and throat hurting (I also had a cold and was using cough drops/zinc,</li>
            <li> This did seem to make my teeth whiter, but after a few days I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to use it anymore:  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for a few weeks now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a coffee/wine/tea drinker and after a few weeks my teeth were a shade or two whiter.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not as harsh</li>
            <li> will cause skin irritation and not designed to be used everyday like</li>
            <li> (I used to be a heavy smoker), but they weren&#x27;t heavily stained</li>
            <li> Granted, I was VERY skeptical when I first learned about this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the brush.  </li>
            <li> I did not have particularly sensitive teeth beforehand, but after a few days of use, I found it uncomfortable to eat cold products or particularly crunchy products.</li>
            <li> Comparing it to the Crest White Stripes, the result it not as dramatic, but for a whitening toothpaste, I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first thought it was going to have a bad taste or an off-putting texture when looking at it</li>
            <li> within a few days afterwards there were no more canker sores and my cracked and peeling lips began to heal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and have noticed very little whitening, however, it has made them a lot shinier.</li>
            <li> Just a few days (like two!)</li>
            <li> and I would like to keep using it to see if my teeth will get any whiter, but not sure I can.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if Colgate is doing this on purpose or if it is the cheat of some supplier, but it&#x27;s not fair and not worth it.</li>
            <li> Will be anxious to see the results with longer use.  </li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t cause any tooth or gum sensitivity, which is usually a problem for me and whitening strips.  </li>
            <li> also think this is a small bottle 8oz for the price, but I make up for that and use a small amount each time to make it last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth are sensitive to cold</li>
            <li> Does it come in a small travel size?</li>
            <li> The brush itself has some small rubber cup type things.</li>
            <li> Within a few days, there was a noticeable whitening and on my visit to the dentist this past week, he asked if I had changed anything in my home care regiment!</li>
            <li> After using a few days, I have notice a subtle improvement, but nothing life changing.  </li>
            <li> It was awful to the point of panic, I could not get it out of my mouth fast enough.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re hard to avoid, so it must be the glycol.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried so hard to like this toothbrush...</li>
            <li> Hard to explain, but the package says they help hold in the toothpaste and apply it to your tooth surfaces.</li>
            <li> so I would hope you would at least see some sort of improvement</li>
            <li> I thought I was going crazy, that I had a medical issue.</li>
            <li> However it does seem to take longer to whiten, at least for my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Annoyed that I wasted money on this.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult for me to keep my lower teeth pearly white.  </li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t notice as much whitening as Colgate promised, what I DID notice was terrible stinging all around the inside of my mouth after using for a few days.</li>
            <li> I moved the toothbrush around and felt it a little bit on other areas too, but not as bad.</li>
            <li> On the left side of my tongue, it feels as if a blister is forming, it hurts really bad.  </li>
            <li> mouthwash tastes bad initially.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried in the past to use whitening strips and have always had to stop after one or two applications due to them causing an increase in painful tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I noticed that it made my mouth tingle a lot and was not a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> See an extensive review here: [...]</li>
            <li> and I had to chew very slowly and deliberately.</li>
            <li> But I did notice one other symptom: the lingering tastes in my mouth that were impossible to rinse away.</li>
            <li> and I have NEVER experienced this before.</li>
            <li> The seal was broken on the bottom end of both toothpaste tubes when I opened the cartons.  </li>
            <li> But I really do hate Colgate Optic White.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m stuck with 2 $15 toothbrushes that are no good!</li>
            <li> With those other toothpastes, I get an annoying slough-off of a layer of mouth skin.  </li>
            <li> He was skeptical, but he agreed to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste is awful, caused white mouth and tongue.</li>
            <li> to find out what was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Useless to whiten teeth in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It leaves some sort of weird film in my mouth, to the point I need to rinse with Listerine to get it out.</li>
            <li> tooth brush looks weird.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t drink cold pop.  </li>
            <li> Pressure, heat, cold, all agony.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t, and a few days ago got this horrible shock in my mouth after eating a spoonful of ice cream...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it gets progressively worse, but it does, and I really, really HATE brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> This stuff is scary!</li>
            <li> I think that it has hydrogen peroxide in it (for the whitening process) and that probably accounts for it, but I found it slightly unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> It also tastes incredibly, incredibly bad.</li>
            <li> Then I&#x27;ll make up my mind if I want to chance a bad experience.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing to mention is that I didn&#x27;t start off with really badly discolored teeth, either.</li>
            <li> It also tastes bad.</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about the toothpaste, it works</li>
            <li> Plus it kills a lot of bacteria that would cause bad breath and tooth decay.</li>
            <li> Just chewing would be painful.</li>
            <li> I have been sick for awhile</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is dangerous!  </li>
            <li> :-(  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any painful sensitivity!</li>
            <li> A metallic like taste that was just horrible.</li>
            <li> This is a very bad product and I will never buy anything Colgate manufacturers again!</li>
            <li> taste was horrible and side effects were too horrible.</li>
            <li> have used Colgate toothpaste for decades, but plan to seek a safer alternative than digesting nasty chemicals in drugstore</li>
            <li> away from this crap!!</li>
            <li> I do know that both my husband and myself had a terrible and shocking experience and suffered a severe aftertaste the remainder of the day.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just used this toothpaste for the first time and immediately noticed an odd warming sensation that I thought might be caused from some abrasive additive because I use an electric toothbrush and I have NEVER experienced this before. I did a web search looking for others that might have had the same reaction and found out that a lot have had similar and worse results at http://www.consumeraffairs.com/cosmetics/colgate.html&lt;br /&gt;I also feel like my acid reflux might not be responding to the medication I take because I feel like I&#x27;m about to have a major attack of stomach acid and sort of feel nausea too and I blame this product on this however I don&#x27;t give up after just one use and will try to see if things get better after a second or third try. My mouth is really dry!&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t get this at Amazon because I ran out of product, needed something quick and found a good price at a warehouse club for a 4 Pack.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a week and have an allergic reaction. You can google \\&quot;Colgate optic white\\&quot; for other people&#x27;s complains.  My whole upper and lower lip were swollen with a sore throat.  The doctor said it was a virus but didn&#x27;t know the cause.  It was only after my lips healed and I started to use \\&quot;optic white\\&quot; again then inside of my mouth doesn&#x27;t feel right again that I realize what was going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I called Colgate customer service to report the problem. I advise other with issues with this product to do the same.</li>
            <li> Oddly, I&#x27;ve developed canker sores more frequently than usual after using this toothpaste for awhile. At some point, I&#x27;ve had up to 4 or 5 in my mouth at once! I&#x27;m not entirely sure if certain ingredients can actually trigger canker sores but not too long after I switched back to the old tooth paste I had been using [[ASIN:B004VGSVHS Crest 3d White Vivid Anticavity Teeth Whitening Radiant Mint Toothpaste 5.8oz, Twin Pack 11.6 Oz Total]], they went away pretty quickly. I gave this product a 2 out of 5 stars instead of 1 because yes, it DID whiten my teeth....but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the extra canker sores I was getting from it.</li>
            <li> I eat a lot of foods that stain teeth, so I&#x27;m in the habit of carrying a travel-sized toothbrush &amp; toothpaste set to keep the staining at a minimum. I am always trying different whitening pastes, but they either cost too much, taste too yucky or they don&#x27;t work that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product didn&#x27;t taste any different than regular mint paste &amp; it really whitened! My husband wants me to buy more so we can keep using it.</li>
            <li> I gave this toothpaste 4 stars instead of five because of a couple of issues.  They might not bother other people.  For one thing, there is an almost \\&quot;fizzy\\&quot; sensation when you&#x27;re brushing with it.  I think that it has hydrogen peroxide in it (for the whitening process) and that probably accounts for it, but I found it slightly unpleasant.  The other thing was that the instructions mention being careful not to swallow much of it and says to call poison control if you do!  I realize that no toothpaste is designed to be swallowed, and yet we do swallow it and we don&#x27;t die, but I found that a little unnerving.  Still, it really did make my teeth quite a bit whiter.  My teeth have always been a slightly pale-yellow color.  Not bad looking, but definitely not white.  I am for certain not going to spend a lot time using whitening strips and all that kind of thing.  It takes up too much time.  So I found this very convenient.  If you&#x27;re expecting the blinding white teeth of the model in the tv commercial, forget it.  But my teeth were noticeably whiter in three days and kept getting whiter for the next few days.  I did find that the areas on the teeth where they curve in to meet the next tooth took a lot longer to whiten, so I started waiting a minute or two before rinsing and that seemed to help those areas to whiten, too.  All in all, I was pleased and I will probably buy more of this brand when this tube runs out.  I wish they made it in a pump, since I find those to be more convenient.  And maybe they will, eventually.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s the most important thing about a whitening toothpaste?  Does it work?  Well, I&#x27;ve been using Colgate Optic White Toothpaste exclusively now for two weeks and I definitely notice a whiter smile.  I had my whole family try it and everyone from the heavy coffee drinker to the nothing but water member reported similar results (which I could see). Comparing it to the Crest White Stripes, the result it not as dramatic, but for a whitening toothpaste, I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the brushing experience, the minty flavor is quite strong, but not off putting.  There was also an almost effervescent foaming quality that I really liked, not the usual toothpaste foaming.  And after rinsing and for several hours after brushing there was a nice slippery feeling on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know packaging isn&#x27;t a big concern with toothpaste, but I have to mention the vintage tin-like tube.  It just looks very cool even left out on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: It works, feels great, and looks good.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this and will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> This is a good whitening toothpaste that is good for sensitive teeth.  It has a pleasant taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for whitening, my husband and I both have had our teeth professional whitened so we were looking at its efficacy in keeping teeth white.  It did seem to keep them bright, but we did not notice it removing discolorations or whitening areas that had yellowed a bit from coffee, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the tube is somewhat smaller than a normal large tube, so it barely lasted a week with 3 people using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a solid toothpaste but I don&#x27;t know that I can support it&#x27;s claim that it will whiten with professional results.</li>
            <li> I had visible results within a few days of, twice a day, use but really had daily noticeable results when I brushed three or four times a day.  Only downside is the intense flavor that comes on at the end that makes it very hard to rinse your mouth because it is so intense.  Was more bearable when rinsing with warm water.  I noticed this was a Gold Box special recently that sold out quickly and I&#x27;m betting a lot of Viners got it because they were so pleased with their sample as I was.  We will also be buying this again.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this toothpaste straight for 3 weeks, then for the following 2 used it every other day-alternating with my regular toothpaste.   This toothpaste feels a bit abrasive and the taste is not that good--two reasons why I stopped using it every day.   My teeth do feel alot cleaner using this toothpaste.  Are they whiter? not really, but they look a little brighter.    Not that impressed with this toothpaste&#x27;s feeling, the taste or what it claims to do...</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste ~ it&#x27;s the only one I use anymore.  My teeth are not only pearly white, but they have that fresh from the dentist feeling every day, like you get right after a cleaning.  I love the pearly white look of my teeth after using this for abouty two weeks!</li>
            <li> Colgate Optic White&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for months and:&lt;br /&gt;- My teeth have definitely turned whiter and stains have been disappearing!&lt;br /&gt;- no adverse reactions (though some reviews stated they had some adverse reactions, so i would just be aware)&lt;br /&gt;- nice and clean fresh minty taste</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product:  I have used whitening strips before and have had pretty good results, but they are so expensive that I have saved them for special occasions only.  I do use \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; toothpaste, but I have never seen any noticeable results from toothpaste alone, despite trying various brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I began using this toothpaste at the same time.  He was skeptical, but he agreed to give it a try.  Just a few days (like two!) after using the toothpaste twice a day, I was VERY surprised to see that my teeth already looked whiter!  So, I asked my husband if he had noticed anything, and he (grudgingly!) admitted that he had noticed his own teeth looking whiter too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled by these initial results and very excited, as I expected that my teeth would just continue to get whiter and whiter.  Unfortunately, that did not occur; in fact, over three weeks later, there has been little additional change since those first few days.  At best, I would say that the color has perhaps evened out a bit more, but I really don&#x27;t think that I have achieve a much greater level of whiteness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither my husband nor I had any problems with teeth sensitivity from using this toothpaste, and we found the taste to be fine.  So, if you need a quick whitening effect, I would recommend this--just don&#x27;t expect much beyond your initial progress.</li>
            <li> Is what a dentist told me when I seen her less than a week ago. After she told me that, she asked me was I using a whitening toothpaste. I was using the Arm and Hammer Peroxi-care for some time and about a week before I seen her I used this product twice a day. I told her I was using this and she told me not to use teeth whitening products. At some point before or after she asked if I had any teeth sensitivity and I told her \\&quot;yea.\\&quot; My teeth started getting sensitive on the upper right and left sides around the time I started using this product. She recommended me some toothpaste and gave me samples of the ones she recommended. For those of you reading this who would like to know what that toothpaste was, it was Colgate Total Clean Mint (NOT Colgate Total Plus Whitening or Colgate Total Advanced Whitening). She also gave me a sample of Colgate Sensitive Enamel Protect.  And even if this product or teeth whitening products in general weren&#x27;t detrimental to the teeth&#x27;s enamel, I still wouldn&#x27;t have rated this toothpaste highly. The product overall did not noticeably whiten my teeth, it improved the color a little, but it was barely noticeable and my shade was somewhere in the middle, thankfully it wasn&#x27;t too bad before I began this regimen. Unfortunately the only remedy to discoloration of teeth is to burn hundreds of dollars and find one of those websites that offer deals and check daily to see if a dentist in your area is offering teeth whitening services. I paid $200 for mine last February and I didn&#x27;t cash that coupon in yet, my appointment is this Friday.</li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t notice as much whitening as Colgate promised, what I DID notice was terrible stinging all around the inside of my mouth after using for a few days. It makes eating saltier or highly acidic foods almost unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Threw the stuff away and went back to regular Colgate paste.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste!  It has a great flavor and seems to whiten my teeth.  I also like the texture of this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Ive used every whitening product out there. I tried Optic White hoping I could replace my more pricey Rembrandt with it. Not a chance! It doesn&#x27;t even whiten fractionally as well as Rembrandt (I use Intense Stain Rembrandt). The only plus is that it has more fluoride and it may whiten slightly, but I&#x27;m not going to drop $$ on this when I can spend a little more and get a tube of the good stuff. Try it if you want, but dont expect great results.</li>
            <li> All I can say is, I have seen some result on my first tube considerating that I&#x27;m a active smoker my teethe are not pearly white but as results of using this toothpaste are much lighter, and yep I&#x27;m buying many more</li>
            <li> I am a toothpaste snob and have always bought the best such as Rembrandt, Mentadent, or Crest 3D because good toothpaste (including a Sonicare toothbrush) is so much better/cheaper than dental work.    The Optic White looks unimpressive as just a plain white paste.  No stripes, twin tubes, sparkles, or any flavor-bursting crystals or strips.  I was not expecting much, but after using it, I am so impressed with this that this will become my new toothpaste.  It has a lot of silica in it, so it feels more abrasive than others, but it does the trick (along with some nominal amounts of hydrogen peroxide) to actually whiten my teeth as good or better than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve used.    It also comes with a relatively high amount of fluoride at 0.76%.  This is compared to the Crest 3D at 0.243% (or triple) while the Crest Pro Health lists 0.454%.    Additionally, I&#x27;ve found with a lot of toothpastes such as Crest Pro Health that they contain some kind of ingredient (one of the gingivitis or plaque chemicals) that tends to dissolve my mouth.  With those other toothpastes, I get an annoying slough-off of a layer of mouth skin.  I asked my dentist, and she said it is one of the chemicals and likely an irritant to my gums.  Well, this Colgate Optic White does not have that ingredient yet cleans my teeth really well.  I&#x27;m sure that Colgate has done their homework, but it is too early to tell if the additional silica will result in increased enamel wear.    Another note about Sparkling Mint is that it is really a bright mint flavor.  Your mouth will feel really sparkling and cool which I kind of like, but some may find the flavor too strong.    I would highly recommend this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I can actually feel this toothpaste working and I have never ever been able to say that about a toothpaste before.  Also, my teeth are already noticeably whiter after only 3-4 days of use.  Got two tubes for 4.99 Amazon lighting deal was awesome price.  I&#x27;d pay upwards of 7 for another single tube to be honest, so glad I finally found a toothpaste that you can actually tell is cleaning.</li>
            <li> It lathers up well in your mouth due to the hydrogen peroxide, so a little goes a long way. also the taste is a nice mint taste but not overpowering like some mint toothpastes are. I&#x27;ve only used this a week and I think this is the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used, everything considered. My favorite feature being that it lathers up easy with my motorized toothbrush. The heads on the motorized toothbrushes isn&#x27;t very big so the fact this lathers up easy makes my brushing happening faster than it does with most other toothpastes. As far as whitening goes, my teeth are pretty white already and so I&#x27;ve not noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> This did seem to make my teeth whiter, but after a few days I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to use it anymore:  the taste is JUST HORRID.  I juggled the trade off between whiter taste, minty breath (not with this flavor!) and dreading brushing my teeth because of the taste....and finally decided the tradeoffs are just not worth it.  I&#x27;d rather use other products that may take longer to be effective but taste better---or else just stick with whitestrips.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is amazing.  The instant that your toothbrush hits your teeth, you feel a warm burst caused by the release of hydrogen peroxide that is not off tasting as in other brands that contain this ingredient. Within a few days, there was a noticeable whitening and on my visit to the dentist this past week, he asked if I had changed anything in my home care regiment! Amazing when you factor in that this toothpaste is priced at a fraction of the cost of other whitening toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought 2 of the new toothbrushes with the whitener stick in the bottom for $15 each.  The stick which you have to turn to get the gel out of doesn&#x27;t work!  Now I&#x27;m stuck with 2 $15 toothbrushes that are no good!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is awful, caused white mouth and tongue. I have been sick for awhile and now I know its Colgate Optic white</li>
            <li> I purchased this product three days ago. I really like what I&#x27;m seeing, but I can&#x27;t see much because today marks day 3 and that doesn&#x27;t give me enough time to make an accurate decision, as the box itself says allow one week for a difference in whitening and 4 weeks for results. However, I will tell you about myself and my use of Optic White thus far.  I am a COFFEE drinker. I only have one - two cups a day, two being the maximum. On the first day of purchase, I used optic white only at night. Second day, I used it only at night. Third day (today) I used it twice and will use it twice from this day forward.   TASTE: The taste is minty, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s extremely strong or over-bearing. It makes my mouth feel clean and smell great - just what I&#x27;m looking for! A clean, minty breath is great!  I am an avid flosser and always brush at least twice a day. Toothpaste alone will not leave you with healthy gums. FLOSS!! I can definitely see my teeth getting whiter and I&#x27;ve only used it 4 times in the matter of 3 days. I&#x27;m anxious to see the results in a few more days. This price is affordable, especially compared to whitening products/kits. It&#x27;s certainly stronger than Crest 3D whitening toothpaste.   The price is right. Have some patience. People expect to see results in a day or two (and they smoke and drink coffee/tea! come on!)   I will be updating this review, especially if people are interested in a follow-up. I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It is difficult to review products such as this, because there is not much to say about a simple product.  So, lets get down to the points.  Whitening Effect:  Impressive to say the least.  The effect was noticeable after one brushing.  After a week, I feel like my teeth are several shades whiter.  I have tried several teeth whitening toothpastes and have not yet been this impressed.  Texture: initially slightly thicker than most toothpaste, but this was not a problem once brushing began.  Flavor: Standard mint, however, I noted that it did not taste as strong as most tooth pastes do. This is a plus, especially for people with sensitive taste buds.  After-Taste:  Noticeably less after-taste than other toothpastes.  If you are looking for a teeth-whitening toothpaste, or a tooth-whitening product without much hassle, this is it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for a few weeks now.  I don&#x27;t think it has any more whitening ability then other toothpastes like they claim.  No toothpaste yet is going to whiten your teeth like strips or dentistry procedures.  As far as taste goes, this toothpaste isn&#x27;t offending but I prefer Crest Whitening as well.  Otherwise, this toothpaste hasn&#x27;t irritated my gums and teeth at all is worth trying if you are looking for something new based on its attractive pricing.</li>
            <li> After using this toothpaste for several weeks now, I think it is making a difference. The most important thing to me is that it doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive, which is what I was afraid of. I have a pretty difficult time with other whitening products, so I was a little leery of trying a toothpast to use every day. But, it&#x27;s been fine. So if you&#x27;re sensitive to whitening strips and other products, this could be a good alternative for you. Just keep using it every day and you&#x27;ll see results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and I really haven&#x27;t noticed that my teeth are any whiter. I also just brushed my teeth with it a few minutes ago and the moment I put the toothbrush to my lower left gum I immediately felt sensitivity. I moved the toothbrush around and felt it a little bit on other areas too, but not as bad. I still have some other toothpaste so I used that instead and then there was no sensitivity when brushing with that, my gums were fine. But I don&#x27;t mind the taste and I would like to keep using it to see if my teeth will get any whiter, but not sure I can.</li>
            <li> I had been using this brand for quite some time; it really does a great job of whiteening. But, in the past several months, I&#x27;ve noticed that the tubes are now at least a third filled with air! I don&#x27;t know if Colgate is doing this on purpose or if it is the cheat of some supplier, but it&#x27;s not fair and not worth it.</li>
            <li> So I might just be tricking myself into believing that this toothpaste is working, but I do notice a difference in the color of my teeth. I like Colgate in general, and the Optic White series has not failed me. My only complaint is that you do get a bit of a chemical taste in your mouth if you brush for too long. Keep it under three minutes!</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time last week and almost immediately starting experiencing severe tooth sensitivity. I actually ended up going to the dentist because I thought I needed a root canal. I never had problems with sensitivity before. I threw away the whole tube.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand of toothpaste for over 6 months, even tho it may be a tad bit higher than the regular paste I like the way it taste and keeps the biters white</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really expect to see amazing results from this toothpaste.  It simply isn&#x27;t possible for any toothpaste to replace professional or even at home whitening products.  However, Optic White is good for keeping your teeth white in between whitening sessions.  The taste is very much peroxide, but I actually like the foam it creates.</li>
            <li> I purchased Colgate Optic White and was excited to use a product that would whiten my teeth.  After two weeks of twice a day brushing, I did notice my teeth were whiter but my gums were sore and the inside of my mouth started getting sores.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if I didn&#x27;t rinse my mouth well enough after brushing but I immediately stopped using the product.  My sores cleared up after a week.  Personally I pitched the rest of the tube - not worth it to me.</li>
            <li> wow, this product really cleans your teeth; they feel great! it is quite strong and also makes your breath feel so fresh. my top teeth are actually looking brighter and whiter already :)</li>
            <li> After using Optic White for about three weeks, I believe it is the reason I have soreness in the root area. It started in just one spot, but is now affecting about two-thirds of my teeth. I have never had senstive teeth and normally use a water pik on the highest power of 5 and can no longer have the power higher than 2 without severe pain. I do believe the product has whitened my teeth somewhat which is why I am rating it 2 stars.  After reading other reveiws it appears I am not the only one with adverse reactions and would caution others to be aware of potential problems.  I just hope that discontinuing use will reverse the issues and eliminate the pain I&#x27;ve been experiencing.</li>
            <li> The name is very catchy: OPTIC WHITE. But it works. I wish it were cheaper. I prefer it to the strips that I used before because they hurt my teeth. This toothpaste doesn&#x27;t whiten as fast, but its a gradual shift in the positive direction.  I recommend it to everyone who is interested in purchasing a toothpaste for whitening their teeth.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a noticeable change in the whiteness of my teeth with this. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months and I still don&#x27;t see anything different. Not even barely. It also tastes incredibly, incredibly bad. The taste was OK at first, and I just thought people were being crybabies. Now I get it. I don&#x27;t know how it gets progressively worse, but it does, and I really, really HATE brushing my teeth. I&#x27;m stubborn and a cheapskate so I&#x27;m not throwing it out til I finish the tube but man, I can&#x27;t wait to be done with this! I will be browsing the reviews to see what else is out there because I will never use this again. GROSS.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is a real winner.  I like the texture, the tube is sturdy and works very well.  And....I actually believe my teeth are whiter.  I liked it so well,l I bought a tube just today.</li>
            <li> I believe some whitening has occurred in the month that I&#x27;ve used this. I drink coffee and tea every day and it seems that this product keeps much of the staining at bay.  Will be anxious to see the results with longer use.  The longer you brush the more you can feel the peroxide? working..whole mouth and tongue start tingling.  The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is the aftertaste..reminds me of a Sucrets throat lozenge, something on that order.  It goes away, might be just me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using peroxide-based mouthwashes for awhile now, but haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in whiteness, so was a bit skeptical about this product, but decided to give it a go.  Upon first use, it was quite pleasant. Good minty flavor, but not over the top. You can definitely tell the hydrogen peroxide is in there, but its not objectionable.  So I used it for one week, twice a day, morning and night. After one week, I would say my teeth are one shade whiter. We&#x27;re not talking movie star white, but the difference is noticeable and pleasant. I look forward to seeing if there is continuing improvement after a month of use, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it a month and had to cut back on using it to only every other day because it made my teeth quite sensitive, so I think this Optic White is rather abrasive.  It is whitening though, I drink 4 cups of strong black tea every day so that&#x27;s my main staining that I need to stay on top of.  It helps maintain my white teeth, but so do other toothpastes and they don&#x27;t make my teeth so sensitive like the Optic White does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Optic White isn&#x27;t on the American Dental Association (ADA) list of approved toothpastes, and it&#x27;s impossible to know if it&#x27;s because Colgate didn&#x27;t apply for Optic White to be on the list, or if it&#x27;s because the product didn&#x27;t meet the ADA&#x27;s guidelines for safety and effectiveness.  I do prefer to use a toothpaste on the ADA list.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste tastes great and leaves your mouth fresh and clean.  However, I have been using it two times per day (morning and evening) and I really do not notice any whitening effects.  I have been using it for one month now so I would hope you would at least see some sort of improvement but really there is none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I would still consider buying another tube is only for the taste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying Optic White for the first time, and after the first brush my teeth were noticeably whiter. It was sort of shocking to be able to actually see the toothpaste working right after the first use. I plan on adding to my review later, after frequent use so I can see how the whitening continues but so far so good. I do have one comment, the toothpaste is a little strong. You can tell right away that there are some powerful ingredients in the toothpaste, but for me it wasn&#x27;t strong enough to deter me from using it. If you have a low tolerance for stronger toothpaste, than this is not for you.</li>
            <li> I have yellow teeth. It is shameful, yes, but after much coffee and tea, and more than a few nights of forgetting to brush, they are not pretty. Not disgusting by any means, but they are certainly not the pearly white veneers we see on television.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a few different whitening agents: toothpastes (usually with baking soda in them), mouthwashes, gel trays, gum. They all work to varying degrees, but none as well as this product.&lt;br /&gt;With the first brushing I noticed a difference. After a week, they were noticeably whiter. It says to use for 4 weeks for optimum whiteness.&lt;br /&gt;The only con I have found (as this product is surprisingly cheap), is that the hydrogen peroxide seems to make my teeth more sensitive. I did not have particularly sensitive teeth beforehand, but after a few days of use, I found it uncomfortable to eat cold products or particularly crunchy products. I first noticed it while eating a chilled apple; the texture and temp were too much and I had to chew very slowly and deliberately. Since then the sensitivity seems to have subsided, but I know whitening agents tend to have this side effect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty skeptical of all the tooth whitening products out there. I have had my teeth professionally whitened before but just can&#x27;t rationalize spending that kind of money any more.  I&#x27;ve used other products - strips, trays w/ gel, mouthwash, etc. Some work and some I just can&#x27;t see any difference after repeated use over time. I always buy toothpaste that has a whitening agent in it.   After 3 days of using the Optic White I was surprised to see such a visible difference, especially for my teeth not being \\&quot;so bad\\&quot; in the first place!   I first thought it was going to have a bad taste or an off-putting texture when looking at it but it was fine.   Bottom line is that for me it worked and though it&#x27;s a little more expensive, I&#x27;ve since bought two more tubes for my family.</li>
            <li> I found this toothpaste to be decent.  I didn&#x27;t mind the flavor though I did noticed a slight bitter taste when brushing.  The paste was a bit gritty, which I actually liked, and it stuck to my teeth instead of feeling like it would slide off.  Once rinsed, my teeth felt smooth and clean and my mouth fresh.  As for the whitening, I found the toothpaste to me moderately successful.  I&#x27;m a coffee/wine/tea drinker and after a few weeks my teeth were a shade or two whiter. Did I expect it to work miracles with a resultant dazzling smile?  No.  But if it was able to help lighten my choppers by a shade or two in a few weeks then that was a good thing.  If you&#x27;re looking for a way to whiten your teeth with the convenience of a toothpaste then this is worth a try.</li>
            <li> I think some people might experience noticeable whitening with this toothpaste.  I am just one of those people that can&#x27;t seem to achieve much whitening due to loss of enamel, and frequent coffee intake, but I think others might see a difference.  It did not make my teeth over-sensitive which some whitening chemicals do, and I think people interested in whitening while they brush should definitely give this paste a try.</li>
            <li> I used Colgate Optic White for 3 weeks and developed sores and a white coating on my tongue.  I have great oral hygiene and no other oral problems until I began using this toothpaste.  BUYER BEWARE! The first week is great, white teeth then sores!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high hopes when I got this product. I mean, how good/bad can a toothpaste really be? Several toothpastes in the market nowadays claim they&#x27;ll make your teeth whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the difference between Colgate Optic White and the others? Colgate WORKS! In a week my teeth were noticeably whiter, healthy gums and a fresh minty breath that made friends and coworkers stop turning their faces away every time I spoke to them.</li>
            <li> My husband and I bought this to use before our wedding.  We used the whole tube and neither one of us noticed a difference.  I thought the \\&quot;flavor\\&quot; was too strong.  It&#x27;s like Listerine&#x27;s burn but not nearly as bad.  Still, no way I was doing both; my mouth was too sensitive after using the toothpaste.  However, it still works as a toothpaste.  Fresh breath, still cleans.  It also didn&#x27;t cause any tooth or gum sensitivity, which is usually a problem for me and whitening strips.  So as a toothpaste, it&#x27;s perfectly fine.  As a whitening product, it&#x27;s a dud.</li>
            <li> THE BEST TOOTHPASTE EVER. After using this, my teeth are noticeably whiter and I get so many compliments on how white they are. They are so white I feel like they have more rights than me.</li>
            <li> I thought I was going crazy, that I had a medical issue. Turns out it&#x27;s optic white. If you do some research, you&#x27;ll see this stuff is danger of being recalled. Many people are getting sores, blisters, tingling/burning/numbing of tongue, aggravated glands in the side and corners of their mouths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine was tingling/numb tongue, burning lips. I did research and came up with yeast infections of the mouth, but I just knew that wasn&#x27;t it. But I did notice one other symptom: the lingering tastes in my mouth that were impossible to rinse away. A metallic like taste that was just horrible. The symptoms are exactly the same of others who tried this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, turns out there&#x27;s a few different ingredients that can cause it: SLS, propylene glycol, and some other things. They also use a high amount of sucralose. Basically, if you have any of these symptoms, get off the paste immediately. I should also not that one of the forums I visited, a man documented his experience of find a swelling on one of his nodes in his neck, which the doctors think was an allergic reaction. The swelling went down after changing toothpastes. But still, he had to have MRIS and other stuff, not to mention the scare of the possibility of tumors and cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Counterfeit claims and recalls last year: Colgate claims counterfeit on some of their toothpastes. It might be true, but the specifics they listed was Diethyl Glycol and the fakes coming from south africa - and it was another line of toothpaste of theirs. Well, Diethyl and Propyl Glycol(which is in Optic White) are both antifreeze derivatives. The Optic White I got says New York, NY and made in Mexico. So I don&#x27;t know, maybe there were fakes, but I think that it should be considered that Colgate is possibly lying. Nearly all toothpastes have SLS and etc. They&#x27;re hard to avoid, so it must be the glycol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, good luck to all.</li>
            <li> this is an OK toothpaste.But tube was full of air so it was like 20% empty.taste is not the best</li>
            <li> This toothpaste lives up to its claims; my teeth were noticeably whiter within seven days. I like that brushing with Optic White can help make *all* of my teeth whiter, not just areas covered by a strip, and that by using it more or less often I can find and maintain a level of whiteness that&#x27;s right for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use Ultra Brite toothpaste which is cheap but always scored well with consumer reports and the Optic White left my teeth with more or less the same feeling of cleaned/polished. The Optic White mint flavor was about average (not especially strong or weak) but I did notice after brushing that my breath did not feel or stay that \\&quot;minty-fresh\\&quot; as long as it does with my usual brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pleased that Optic White lived up to its product claims and would purchase this item again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update March 01, 2012; after several months of use I&#x27;d just like to report that there is no visible increase in whitening beyond the first couple of weeks use. I had hoped to increase the results over time but after the initial whitening stage of 10 days-2 weeks the results stay pretty much the same.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of use, it does seem to have better whitening effect than my old Colgate Total toothpaste. If you&#x27;re familiar with the whitening strips, this paste leaves a similar tingling sensation and taste as the bleaching agent that&#x27;s used on the strips. However, it&#x27;s not as harsh so it&#x27;s comfortable to use daily. My gums and teeth don&#x27;t feel as sensitive after using this paste as it does when I used the whitening strips. I still prefer to use the strips for more noticeable whitening for special occasion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for awhile now (Colgate Optic White Toothpaste) and I think it works pretty well at the task of cleaning and whitening teeth.  The two things that are different about this toothpaste from other products I&#x27;ve tried is that there is not a whole lot of gritty texture to the paste and the taste is very, very strong.  It&#x27;s literally like brushing your teeth with a box of Altoids.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff!  Of course, it is not as good as professional whitening, but it is good toothpaste and I have noticed that my teeth are whiter.  I bought extra for my adult children, and they like it as well.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is dangerous!  Take a chance if you choose to. Put holes in my teeth and the dentist filled them as cavaties.  Cost me money to have my teeth fixed.  Also bleached spots on my towels after wiping my mouth from brushing my teeth.  My sister likewise used this tooth paste and her tongue felt like it was on fire. Her throat remained sore for months.  Went to the dr. to find out what was wrong.  He had no idea what was causing such discomfort. Had to get medicine for the sores (holes) in put in her mouth tissue.  Checked out reviews on the internet that many people have written causing severe mouth problems using this product.  No, doesn&#x27;t happen to everyone, but it just might be you!  Taught me a lesson here about checking out ratings people give on Amazon.  Now I read those who give one star first before I&#x27;ll ever decide to buy a product.  Then I&#x27;ll make up my mind if I want to chance a bad experience.  I&#x27;ll also check consumer complaints on the internet on various products so I can make an informed decision on whether a product is worthy. Be careful using ingredients from other countries that have no testing procedures for safety.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 months now and I can honestly say I didn&#x27;t notice a difference.  I like the taste and the way my teeth feel after brushing but my teeth are not any whiter. I&#x27;m a crest girl so once I finish the tube, I will go back to crest.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to take on a trip to attend my 45th high school reunion.  Starting on day one of using this I had problems which only got worse as I used it more.  First my tongue was burning which I attributed to maybe a change in my usual eating habits but after the second or third day when I started to develop canker sores in my mouth and blisters on my lips I began to think it was from the use of this toothpaste which was the only change in my daily product use.  After the 5th day I went and purchased another toothpaste which is the one I have used for several years without any problems and within a few days afterwards there were no more canker sores and my cracked and peeling lips began to heal.  I have since heard this same type of complaint from two friends who also used this Optic White Toothpaste and mouth rinse so Colgate must be aware of these severe reactions by other users.  This is a very bad product and I will never buy anything Colgate manufacturers again!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have any of the issues others mentioned, and though I didn&#x27;t test before and after with the toothpaste I do think it works well.</li>
            <li> My husband began using this product in July and I decided to try it. I noticed that it made my mouth tingle a lot and was not a pleasant experience. But, in the name of vanity I continued using it on and off for several weeks although the whitening effect was minimal. By September my mouth was very sore and my lips dry all the time. I looked at the ingredients of Colgate Optic White and was astounded by all the harsh ingredients. I couldn&#x27;t believe I had been so foolish and vane, and threw the product in the trash. My mouth is still sore and I have to be very careful about ingesting acidic food and drinks. I would not recommend this product or any product containing such harsh chemicals!</li>
            <li> I have struggled for many years to keep stain and tarter from accumulating in my mouth.  No matter how much brushing and flossing, my teeth looked like I never brushed them.  Stain accumulated because I drink coffee.  When my hygienist told me to try this toothpaste and mouthwash, I agreed to try.  Much to my surprise, when I went for my next exam, I had no tarter and no stains.  I have continued to use both the toothpaste and the mouthwash for over a year and have kept my teeth looking and feeling like I just left the dentists chair.</li>
            <li> Used one of these but didn&#x27;t see much improvement. Felt like it is just a marketing tactic for a normal tooth paste product</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking this was Colegate&#x27;s version of Crests 3D white toothpaste. I guess I was wrong because it does not whiten nearly as well and doesn&#x27;t leave my teeth feeling as clean. I&#x27;ll finish this tube but not buying it again..</li>
            <li> I saw the commercial and was intrigued by this product. Like many people, I am sick and tired of buying the pricey whitening strips and pastes only to become agitated with the whole process and lackluster results. I have no loyalty to any toothpaste brands and generally buy the best brand on sale at my local stores. I went ahead and bought the small 4 oz size tube, which in combination with a store sale and a couple coupons only cost pennies. The product claims whiter teeth in one week. I have been using for 5 days now and I do notice a difference. I expect better results with time. The plus of a product like this is that you need to brush your teeth anyway, and the 4oz size doesn&#x27;t cost much more than the average toothpaste. I did not buy the accompanying toothbrush. I just used my regular brush and the results are good enough that I will continue to use at least until the tube is empty. I am giving this product 5 stars because although I don&#x27;t expect to achieve unbelievable results, it is simply a toothpaste and cannot perform miracles. Because it is only a toothpaste and inexpensive, the product is fairly advertised and priced and deserves the high marks. The only draw back for me was that I tend to brush for about 2 minutes and by the 1 minute mark, the toothpaste does start to have that mouth wash burn but I can deal with that for whiter teeth. Thanks Colgate!</li>
            <li> I did notice slight whitening but wondered how a product that was brushed on could whiten, from the inside out, if it was not designed to stay on the teeth for a period of time as you have to do with whitening strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, my daughter has received multiple compliments since she began using this product.  Her teeth look whiter and sparklier.&lt;br /&gt;I guess it really does depend on what your teeth looked like when you started using the product.  If you are a coffee drinker or do any other things that can stain teeth, you will not get the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I will say is that I loved the clean feel after using the product; hydrogen peroxide and Silica are a great combination for that overall clean scrubbed feel that will last long after the first morning brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I will continue purchasing this produce because of the results that my daughter has enjoyed.</li>
            <li> After buying a new sonicare toothbrush i decided to step up to a better toothpaste.  After only 2 days of using colgate optic white toothpaste i started having some skin irritation inside of my mouth and dry lips. after looking on online about complains on this toothpaste i found out its very common amount recent users of this toothpaste. Since then i have stopped using it and really hope this skin irritation will go away soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i highly DO NOT recommend this product! will cause skin irritation and not designed to be used everyday like the label says its can!</li>
            <li> The product do not delivery what it promise.</li>
            <li> I have mixed emotions on this product.  My son has used it for a year and has beautiful teeth.  I started using it and in 3 days my front teeth were so sensitive.  I did not expect it.  I quit using it and things improved so I tested it 2 more days and the sensitivity is bad enough I can&#x27;t drink cold pop.  I am surprised.  I really wanted to use it.  Be cautious when you start to use it.  For a week I have had loose stools and now after reading all the web reviews know why.  I would have never connected toothpaste to tummy problems.</li>
            <li> I have been using Colgate Optic White for a few months now.  I am a black coffee and red wine drinker and it really has made my teeth whiter.  It isn&#x27;t like using the strips or anything, but it does make my teeth whiter.</li>
            <li> I wish I had never set eyes on this toothpaste, as do the hundreds of people who have left negative reviews online (Google &amp;#34;consumer affairs colgate toothpaste reviews&amp;#34;). I bought the &amp;#34;Enamel White Luminous Mint.&amp;#34; I used it for four days twice a day before I realized that it was the cause of my entire mouth and throat hurting (I also had a cold and was using cough drops/zinc, and at first thought my mouth was irritated from that). It was like burning the roof of your mouth on pizza, but my entire mouth, even under my tongue. After three or four days the pain was less, but I developed a painful sore in the back of my throat. That healed, but I&#x27;ve had persistent dry mouth, the glands under my chin are swollen, and I lost most of my sense of taste. It&#x27;s been 2.5 weeks since I stopped using the toothpaste and sugar tastes like salt, salt tastes pretty much like nothing. I&#x27;m starting to feel very depressed--you don&#x27;t know how much pleasure and comfort the simple process of eating gives you until you lose that pleasure and comfort. I have no idea why this product is still on the market or why there hasn&#x27;t been a class-action suit about the damage it has done. I want my sense of taste back!! I just want to feel normal again.  UPDATE more than a year later: The pain lasted about a month and loss of taste lasted three months. I had two more periods last year (two months and then three months) when I lost my sense of taste again. My dentist has been telling me I now have a persistent dry-mouth condition he&#x27;s concerned about. I no longer use any toothpaste or dental products because I&#x27;ve developed an allergy to the chemicals and can&#x27;t find one that seems safe. All this was triggered by the Optic White toothpaste--I&#x27;ve never had mouth issues before in my life.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just toothpaste and won&#x27;t change the color of your teeth a bit. These companies pay people to give positive reviews, and we the consumer fall for it.</li>
            <li> Disclosure: I&#x27;ve used the Crest whitening strips before and those worked really well.   Main selling point is from the product description:  ---  \\&quot;for a whiter teeth in one week, with results that improve with daily use \\&quot;  ---  After 2 weeks of using this regularly, it has made no difference at all.  On the other hand, the price is very close to a regular toothpaste, and I&#x27;m sure it does that job fine. I am just not sure the whitening element is doing much if anything.</li>
            <li> I think the COLGATE OPTIC WHITE TOOTHPASTE is much easier to use than the whitening strips. However it does seem to take longer to whiten, at least for my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the [[ASIN:B00336EUTK Crest 3D White Whitestrips With Advanced Seal Professional Effects Enamel Safe Dental Whitening Kit, 20-count box]], which works a lot faster, so if you&#x27;re in a hurry to whiten I would suggest using those instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the COLGATE OPTIC WHITE TOOTHPASTE works well and although I wouldn&#x27;t say that it dramatically whiten my teeth that could be due to the fact that the strips had already made them as white as they could be, it&#x27;s been almost two years come March 2012 since I used the strips, and so this was more of a tune-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the product for about a month and half, my teeth are nice and white and not unnaturally so. I didn&#x27;t experience any tooth or gum sensitivity, so that&#x27;s a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing to mention is that I didn&#x27;t start off with really badly discolored teeth, either. Before testing any of the whiteners, my teeth were kind of off-white, bordering on yellow (I used to be a heavy smoker), but they weren&#x27;t heavily stained and so the whitening strips helped and the toothpaste just re-tuned that work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the COLGATE OPTIC WHITE TOOTHPASTE if you need to brighten up your smile. One more thing, the toothpaste tastes like regular toothpaste so it doesn&#x27;t have that odd tooth-strip taste.</li>
            <li> This paste does a good job in whitening. The duo pack was a oood buy. It is better than other brands.</li>
            <li> I recently got the Colgate optic white regimen courtesy of Influenster, and was pretty happy for the chance to try it out. I admit, I was doubtful at first, but it really did work. I used all 3 products together (toothpaste, mouthwash and toothbrush), the toothpaste left my mouth feeling fresher, and in less than a week my teeth were much whiter. Others noticed as well and complimented me on it, and I started to smile a lot more. Not only do these products work, but they are affordable!</li>
            <li> Colgate Optic White  is a very ggod product  live&#x27;s your teeth so clean fresh and of course white them and my smile is like a Diamond good price for a ggod product</li>
            <li> I received this toothpaste, the mouthwash and the toothbrush from the Colgate Optic White Line via [...] for testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using all three products for 4 days/nights now and I can already see a big difference!&lt;br /&gt;The Toothpaste - tastes kind of strong to me, but I can deal with that if it keeps whitening. I also think the tube is kind of small if you live in a household that shares toothpaste it will be expensive. I kindly hide my tube from my boyfriend. Ha-ha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Toothbrush - ugh....I tried so hard to like this toothbrush...it&#x27;s real nice has tongue/cheek brush, toothpaste holder cups in the bristles and was very soft. I don&#x27;t know what it is...thinking maybe the angle of the bristles on this toothbrush, but my gums hurt when I use this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mouthwash - Taste horrible and even know it&#x27;s alcohol free unlike most brands it still burns...I can deal with that since it&#x27;s only for a minute twice daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also think this is a small bottle 8oz for the price, but I make up for that and use a small amount each time to make it last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Verdict: Will buy the toothpaste &amp; mouthwash</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste because it feels warm on my teeth when I brush.  My teeth are sensitive to cold so this product is great.  Also the taste and smell are good.</li>
            <li> Bought a tube at Wal-Mart. Used it up. No difference with my teeth. Cleans my mouth though. Useless to whiten teeth in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and have noticed very little whitening, however, it has made them a lot shinier. I don&#x27;t feel like it gets my teeth really clean though. It feels like i still have some plaque around my gums. I don&#x27;t get that feeling when i use my cheap ultra brite toothpaste. I think it works just as good or better for a 2-3 dollars cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last six months and can say that my teeth are noticably whiter.  Smokers, pop and coffee drinkers should all be happy.  This tooth paste has a slight tingle and warming sensation unlike others that feel like they are scratching your teeth this is smoothe.  Buy a pack of this, use it twice a day and you will see your teeth get whiter over time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had very white teeth and my addition to coffee doesn&#x27;t help. I&#x27;ve tried strips and different brands of toothpaste, all with disappointing results, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I started using Colgate Optic White about a week ago. I&#x27;m very, very happy to say I was wrong. So far, there&#x27;s been a clear whitening (I&#x27;d say a couple of shades) and I hope it will continue working. This is a great product for people who want a whiter smile, especially considering its reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> I bought and used this product for three days.  I noticed that my mouth and tongue tingled right away. I thought that it was the whitening product working. Well for three days while using the product, my tongue really hurts and is swollen.  It feels as if I ate something extremely hot.  On the left side of my tongue, it feels as if a blister is forming, it hurts really bad.  Look up consumeraffairs.com for over 90 complaints of more serious problems from people who have used it longer.  I have not changed anything else in my diet or products that could account for this.</li>
            <li> My teeth are naturally off-white, and coupled with occasional tea and coffee drinking they have become quite yellowish especially around the canines. I&#x27;ve only been using the Colgate Advanced White variant, but to no effect, so I gave Optic White a chance. Initially at the 5-day mark, I noticed that the yellowness was less intense. I guess it delivered the \\&quot;1 shade whiter in 1 week\\&quot; claim, but it would not have been really noticeable had I not looked closely. Like many reviewers, I did experience some tooth sensitivity during the first 2 days of using it but I kept at it anyway, and the feeling eventually went away. The real downside is that my lips have been very dry and started chapping since I used this product. Even the skin on the inside of my mouth peels off sometimes. I&#x27;ve tried to just avoid the toothpaste touching anything other than my gums and teeth while brushing, but this is quite difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall after using for more than 3 weeks now, I&#x27;d say my teeth look shinier after brushing but it did not further reduce the discoloration after the initial 5 days. The mouthfeel is very clean and fresh afterwards, so it works okay as a toothpaste but nothing more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy again - perhaps I&#x27;ll try Crest Whitestrips instead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks and was expecting amazing results, but there are a few problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I used it twice a day for a week or two but my teeth became very sensitive and it was hard to eat.  I now alternate it with Pepsodent, using Colgate at night and Pepsodent in the morning.  Doing this, the sensitivity has gone away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  I noticed it has whitened my teeth  a bit in the first couple of weeks, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference after that initial time.  It might be because of my switching between the two toothpastes, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Yes, the taste is very strong.  I just gargle an extra time to get the taste out, and it goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, that was my experience with it.  You might have a better one.</li>
            <li> I tried the Colgate Optic White Regimen: toothpaste, toothbrush and mouthwash.  My family has used Colgate products for years. The company claims to whiten teeth in 5 days. I gave it a try. The toothpaste has a mint flavor. Per the ingredients, it contains hydrogen peroxide because it foams up. This is a good thing because we know that peroxide can be used to whiten teeth. I like that it is already measured out in a toothpaste and I don&#x27;t have to guess what amount would be safe to use on my teeth enamel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given the chance to try the regimen FREE via Influenster but I will definitely purchase Colgate Optic White again. As a tea, coffee and soda drinker, I did notice improvement in my teeth. With consistent usage, I do believe my smile will continue to be white and my teeth healthy.</li>
            <li> I received this in my Influenster VoxBox almost 2 weeks ago. I will say, to review this, I should mention that I was also using the tooth brush &amp; mouthwash at the same time. I really do like the toothpaste. It has an interesting foaming action I&#x27;ve never had with one better. As a Trio, I get a great clean feel, almost like I just went to the dentist cleaning.</li>
            <li> This works just like any other whitining toothpaste on the market, there is nothing optic about it but it still cleans and get the job done.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to get my favorite toothpaste complimentary from Influenster in my Sugar &#x27;n Spice Vox Box this month. I honestly can&#x27;t say enough wonderful things about this toothpaste (the whole line really).  I have absolutely NO sensitivity, which is a huge plus(I&#x27;m what some may call a teeth whitening connoisseur-so I know what I&#x27;m taking about) and it really does whiten in your teeth.  I would recommend to this product to anyone looking to brighten their smile :D</li>
            <li> This is a great toothpaste. My teeth and mouth feel fresh, clean and are glowing after using the Colgate Optic White Toothpaste for only one week, I am happy I got to try this out!! I really like all the other Optic White products as well.</li>
            <li> The seal was broken on the bottom end of both toothpaste tubes when I opened the cartons.  I then threw both tubes away.</li>
            <li> Finally a toothpaste that works well for everything including whitening.  This product is now my go-to tooth paste.  Does it come in a small travel size?</li>
            <li> Granted, I was VERY skeptical when I first learned about this product.  More empty promises and fancy marketing hype I thought, just like everyone else, right?  Yes, simply more SNAKE OIL to line the manufacturer&#x27;s pocket book until we find out the TRUTH.  but much to my pleasant surprise, this stuff actually DOES WORK.  Yes, my teeth, formerly a dull yellow, is now noticeably more white!  This was after just one (1) week of regular brushing, after each meal, and nothing else.  Even my sister-in-law noticed my whiter teeth when I asked her if she saw anything different about me!  ha ha. yes, this stuff DOES WORK again.  Made a true believer out of me for sure.  WOW! :)  Also, taste great (for toothpaste) and I have experienced no side effects, problems or issues with regards to my usage thus far either.  No pain, sensitivity or soreness to report, unlike others who did report such problems.  Like all products, medicines, etc, it&#x27;s truly case-by-case and everyone reacts differently to various products.  This all said, I DO recommend you give this toothpaste a try.  I couldn&#x27;t believe really. A product that ACTUALLY works and delivered AS PROMISED.  Well done, Colgate!!</li>
            <li> I bought this paste @walmart and tried for 2 weeks. taste was horrible and side effects were too horrible. My teeth became too sensitive and not able to brush. I changed the paste (bought Vicco) and in 2 days i was back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended.</li>
            <li> this toothpaste works but i have never used a true whitening toothpaste like this. makes brushing easier thank  most dense pastes that come out of a tube but now i have sensitive teeth. didnt have a problem with candy before but now the smallest amount of sugar dense candy is not too pleasant. i am going to stop once the tube is gone. i would probably have a problem with whitening strips, which i have not used, but just must be sensitive to the wearing down of enamel or something. oh well, was worth a try in getting the whitest smile. hope the sensitivity is temporary. maybe box should have a warning for some folks like me.</li>
            <li> I have never had issues with sensitive teeth before, but just a day or two after beginning to use this toothpaste, I started getting a lot of tooth pain all over. I figured it was something else and kept using it for a week or so. I had pain every day! Just chewing would be painful. So I switched back to my old, blue gel toothpaste and immediately, I had no more pain. Annoyed that I wasted money on this.</li>
            <li> Please Google all the reactions that people have been suffering from as a result of Colgate Optic White.  After 3 days use, my lips look liked they were stung by a bee and I had redness all around my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Colgate toothpaste for decades, but plan to seek a safer alternative than digesting nasty chemicals in drugstore toothpastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, here on Amazon I see suspicious product reviews all the time.  I have trouble believing that 400 people took the effort to say wonderful things about Colgate Optic White.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from this crap!!</li>
            <li> After 4 uses in 2 days, it was still too early for any detectable whitening to occur (and indeed, none had) but my teeth became so sensitive that I had difficulty eating and drinking.  Pressure, heat, cold, all agony.  Fortunately, 2 days after stopping use of the product, the pain is beginning to subside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After searching the web, I find vast numbers of negative reviews of this product, symptoms similar to mine.  The only positive reviews are the ones posted by Colgate Palmolive employees pretending to be consumers, all cribbing from the same marketing script.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product not recommended for anyone under any circumstances; should be recalled.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to think tooth whitening pastes are just a scam. I&#x27;ve tried many different kinds and none of them work. Maybe these pastes are relying on people that drink coffee, smoke, ect. Then you might have some stains that can be removed, but for someone like me that just has normal, slightly yellow teeth, it&#x27;s not going to do anything to whiten them. It also tastes bad.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to try this product through a program that sends me amazing free samples. I doubted that this product would work but after 2 weeks my teeth are absolutely whiter. I like this product because it makes my mouth feel clean for hours even after I eat or drink.</li>
            <li> I was simply amazed by how much whiter my teeth became after just one brushing with Optic White and a Sonocare toothbrush.  They were several shades whiter and, after one brushing, whiter than after using other products.  I&#x27;ve now been using Optic White for about six weeks and my teeth are whiter than they&#x27;ve been in my adult life.  I&#x27;ve experienced no problems whatsoever with sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> I have only used this for about 3 weeks, however my teeth do seem to be getting whiter. The taste is pleasant and I am looking forward to sparkling, white results.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this toothpaste but in the end it just makes me gag. :-(  It leaves some sort of weird film in my mouth, to the point I need to rinse with Listerine to get it out. The taste also makes me gag, it&#x27;s not minty like it&#x27;s scent.  My teeth aren&#x27;t any whiter either, and I brush my teeth twice a day (morning and before bed). Oh well.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s it, just normal toothpaste with hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide is suppose to help whiten teeth. It worked in a week but stayed the same in the consecutive 3 weeks. Nothing changed, so I can&#x27;t say this toothpaste was a success.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have sensitive teeth and did not find Optic White comfortable. I gave it a few shots and found it worthwhile until I had more pain than usual. I gave my toothpaste to my boyfriend to use and he loved it! It&#x27;s toothpaste, but a whitening booster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product from complimentary from Influenster.</li>
            <li> I received the Optic White Regimen (toothpaste, toothbrush and mouthwash) complimentary from Influenster. This toothpaste is absoluetly amazing. My teeth have never felt so clean and noticably whiter with just one brush. I tried finishing up my old toothpaste tube and just ended up throwing it out. This is my new favorite toothpaste and I will buy no other because i couldn&#x27;t ask for a better one!</li>
            <li> While every person will have individual results, I found that this is just about as good as any other whitening toothpaste.  I drink black coffee, and lots of it, every day.  It is very difficult for me to keep my lower teeth pearly white.  I almost always have yucky black coffee stains on my lower front teeth from the coffee that typically have to stay until the next dentist visit.  I have sensitive teeth, which is why I typically have to live with it.  Whitestrips and other heavy duty teeth whiteners make my teeth throb with pain.  I received the Optic White system (paste,brush,rinse) in the Sugar and Spice VoxBox from Influenster to test out and review.  After using a few days, I have notice a subtle improvement, but nothing life changing.  I&#x27;ve used other brands that work about the same.  I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the brush.  I have bought one previously and ended up going back to another brand.  Also, I prefer to use a fluoride rinse to help prevent cavities, so I wouldn&#x27;t use this one long term.</li>
            <li> Your smile is your best accessory so use the Colgate® Optic White® Regimen to maintain it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Optic White Collection contains Colgate® Optic White® toothpaste which whitens teeth in 1 week, a toothbrush with whitening cups and polishing bristles, and new Optic White® mouthwash which protects against future stains. Colgate® Optic White(tm) has a high impact formula to make it easier to whiten as you brush your teeth. Whitens more than 3 shades*, results start in one week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the regimen and honest to god, within a week I had very noticeably whiter teeth! I&#x27;ve been an avid user of the toothpaste for about a year now but when I combined it with the mouthwash and tootbrush the results definitely intensified and were achieved a lot faster. Being a bride to be I plan on using the Colgate® Optic White® Regimen to whiten my teeth beforehand so I make sure I have a brilliant smile on my wedding day, not to mention saving a few dollars to use towards the honeymoon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster.</li>
            <li> I received 3 Colgate Optic White products (a toothbrush,toothpaste, and mouthwash) complimentary of Influenster.com for testing and review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;Having bright white teeth is important too me. I am an avid pop and tea drinker so needless to say I need a product that will remove stains from teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I was super excited to try Colgate&#x27;s Optic White product line. It claims to have a high impact formula that whitens teeth in 5 days. I actually saw results after the first use. My teeth were whiter and healthier looking and my mouth felt super clean. The sparkling mint flavor of the toothpaste and mouthwash were not overwhelmingly strong like other products out on the market. Furthermore, all 3 products are reasonably priced at a retail value of $2.99 each (4 oz toothpaste and 8 oz mouthwash).&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend the Colgate Optic White product line to anyone looking for a great inexpensive tooth whitening system.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get past the foaming of the mouthwash but the toothpaste is nice. Haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in the whitening. I guess it has to be used as a system.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t possible say enough great things about this Optic White brand of products, especially the mouthwash. See an extensive review here: [...]</li>
            <li> After brushing with this toothpaste...your teeth and gums will feel as if you just left the dentist chair!  It whitens better than other well known brands too.  Good stuff :)</li>
            <li> This toothpaste caused my bottom gums to swell and the skin to peel like a burn. Actually it probably is a burn. I do not have sensitive teeth or skin at all and never have I had a toothpaste do this. This stuff is death.</li>
            <li> I love the product. It was delivered quickly and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Colgate Optic White&lt;br /&gt;I received the Colgate Optic White toothbrush, mouthwash and toothpaste complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. My expectations were low because I suffer from extreme tooth sensitivity. I&#x27;ve tried in the past to use whitening strips and have always had to stop after one or two applications due to them causing an increase in painful tooth sensitivity. I normally use a Sonicare toothbrush on the sensitive setting and Sensodine toothpaste. I do not regularly use mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tooth brush looks weird. I&#x27;m not used to the large size, if you are familiar with a Sonicare brush the head is really tiny compared to a conventional toothbrush. I&#x27;m still not completely used to it after nearly two weeks, but it&#x27;s not a major issue. The Optic White toothbrush has a couple unique, innovative features. The brush itself has some small rubber cup type things. Hard to explain, but the package says they help hold in the toothpaste and apply it to your tooth surfaces. Makes sense I suppose. I don&#x27;t think they are necessarily due to the foaminess of the toothpaste, but more on that later. The toothbrush has some nice rubbery grips on the handle that I like and make the brush easier to hold. There is a tongue and cheek scraper on the backside on the brush head. I like that it is built in because it scrapes my cheeks for me as I brush. I normally just brush my tongue with the brush it self, so I didn&#x27;t use the scraper for that. Some might prefer the scraper, however. The only drawback to the location of the built in tongue scraper was that when I laid my toothbrush down on the counter I felt yucky letting the scraper rest on the counter. I don&#x27;t have a toothbrush holder because the Sonicare stands up on its own. I&#x27;d probably get one if I continued to use the Optic White brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste is my favorite part. It is really foamy and fills my mouth which makes my teeth feel that they are getting cleaner. It leaves me with fresherbreath for longer than the Sensodine Pronamal that I normally use. The second best part?? I haven&#x27;t had any painful sensitivity! My teeth feel normal! Now the best part is the whitening power! I&#x27;ve noticed results after only a week and a half. That is amazing to me. I have nothing bad to say about the toothpaste, it works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mouthwash tastes bad initially. If you have ever rinsed with hydrogen peroxide then you&#x27;ll know exactly what it tastes like. Once you spit it out though you taste the mint. Hydrogen peroxide may taste bad but it is a great way to whiten your teeth. Plus it kills a lot of bacteria that would cause bad breath and tooth decay. I&#x27;ve rinsed with hydrogen peroxide before so the taste really didn&#x27;t bother me, it&#x27;s totally worth it from my point of view. The mouthwash is alcohol free, but I still had a mild burn while I used it. It&#x27;s funny when you spit it out because it continues foaming on your tongue and around your gums. I like that because I feel like it is doing some extra cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the entire system as directed twice a day for nearly two weeks. I like it all. I probably won&#x27;t continue using the toothbrush because I have invested in a Sonicare, but I will definitely use the mouth wash and the toothpaste provided my tooth sensitivity doesn&#x27;t return.</li>
            <li> I adore the toothpaste and toothbrush and have already noticed a difference in my teeth! They are sparkling! (the mouth wash is a bit strong, but I will just save it for when I get my braces off in 2 weeks..) I love it though! Thanks Influenster for sending it to me in my Voxbox!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to rate anything one star because I feel that the corresponding \\&quot;I hate it\\&quot; is too strong. But I really do hate Colgate Optic White. I gagged and, honestly, nearly vomited when I used it. It was awful to the point of panic, I could not get it out of my mouth fast enough. It tasted so strongly toxic and chemical that I thought the tube must be poisoned. I am not squeamish or sensitive or melodramatic, but this is one experience I will not soon forget. After reading the other reviews I fear there must be something wrong with my tube of toothpaste, so in the trash it goes, and unfortunately I will never know how effective it might be for whitening. I do know that both my husband and myself had a terrible and shocking experience and suffered a severe aftertaste the remainder of the day. I&#x27;ll go back to my baking soda and lemon juice. This stuff is scary!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every whitening toothpaste with lackluster results until trying Colgate Optic.  Took a month, but the results are undeniable and seem exponential over time.  After a couple weeks, it kinda seemed like my teeth were whiter, but after a month, even other people noticed.  The first thing you&#x27;ll sense is that the toothpaste gets warm in your mouth when the peroxide activates.  I like this stuff even better than strips, because strips don&#x27;t give you whole tooth results, and strips hurt like fire on a couple of my worn teeth.  Try Colgate Optic, and if you don&#x27;t have results by the time you finish the first tube (and I initially bought the smaller size), then you need to try something else.  I also recommend that you include Listerine Whitening with your regiment to protect and strengthen your enamel, while adding another level of white.</li>
            <li> *I&#x27;ve been using whitening products for years. I have never, ever had tooth sensitivity before. I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for more than a month in hopes that I would see drastic results at some point. I didn&#x27;t, and a few days ago got this horrible shock in my mouth after eating a spoonful of ice cream... I nearly dropped tears. I didn&#x27;t cry during childbirth! I thought I got my first cavity... after a couple more days went by I noticed most of my teeth were sore. So I went to the trusty ol internet, and sure enough reviews of people who&#x27;ve used this toothpaste a long time said the same thing. I love the freshness it leaves more than any other toothpaste, but that&#x27;s absolutely it. Maybe I brush my teeth too long, and toothbrush is too hard, but I know one thing, this toothpaste is NOT worth the pain.</li>
