            <li>Really works well and feels wonderful!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Customer service was nice and helpful.</li>
            <li>It feels nice to put on, but doesn&#x27;t diminish puffiness.  </li>
            <li>I had hoped for some kind of results.  </li>
            <li>I received this to try in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>received this product at a discount to do an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>Extremely effective in battling morning puffiness and allergy swelling.  </li>
            <li>I am really impressed by this company as it seems that they are really taking the time to listen their customers.</li>
            <li>Good product for the price, however after using it religously for more than six months it does not help with puffy eyes or bags as it claims.</li>
            <li>whuch is rare!!!..</li>
            <li>The reason I am rating it high is because I don&#x27;t think I am in the demographic to have amazing results with this product, so let&#x27;s see if I keep using it if I can avoid aging all together!!!</li>
            <li>So far the best product that I have used to deal with eye bags.</li>
            <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE your eye serum!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 52 years old and my skin is actually very good</li>
            <li>Nothing more.</li>
            <li>I ordered more of the Epicura line as well as another bottle of the eye serum with Vitamin C.</li>
            <li>After trying many eye products, this one has given me the fastest results.</li>
            <li>I am ordering 2 more and have with me all the time.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will use it again</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more than what I need for the eye area.  </li>
            <li>Glad I took a chance and ordered it.</li>
            <li>My eyes look much better and the puffiness under my eyes are almost gone.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than anything else on the market (cheaper drug store brands).  </li>
            <li>I love the glow in my skin too</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this eye cream, it has almost no smell at all, as well as the fact it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all, unlike most eye creams do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably the best facial serum you can purchase at on amazon for anti-aging benefits.</li>
            <li>---love</li>
            <li>Love this eye cream...</li>
            <li>I love the texture and the refreshing feeling that I get from this eye cream.</li>
            <li>I HAD MANY EMAILS FROM THIS COMPANY ASKING MY OPINION OF MY RESULTS.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be looking for something else that works just as well at a better price point.  </li>
            <li>Most important - it works!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>this worked better on my eyes.</li>
            <li>I love this vitamin C serum for eyes.</li>
            <li>My skin just keep getting better the longer</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed and loved about this Vitamin C Eye Serum by Epicura Skin was that it Did Not Have A Scent.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>She has purchased many eye creams and most do work, but this product is better and faster with true results.</li>
            <li>received this Vitamin C Eye Serum at a reduced cost in exchange for testing and review and can honestly say that it is well worth the asking price.</li>
            <li>So far this is pretty good, non greasy and makes my skin feeling good.</li>
            <li>Hands and neck were easy to keep up, but no matter what I tried for my eyes</li>
            <li>Second favorite, all the wonderful natural ingredients, it really makes me feel good, and safe when using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>I have been using it for almost a month and have noticed the fine lines and beginning signs of crows feet soften noticeably.</li>
            <li>If product is half as good as the sellers&#x27; devotion to her eye serum and my happiness</li>
            <li>I purchased this product on March 5th,I just ran out on April 14th,I must say this product has made a huge difference in the the look of my under eyes,80 percent improvement.</li>
            <li>important when I am placing it so close to my nose and</li>
            <li>I was told that I looked the same as I did 15 years agoâ€¦ which was great to hear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That is the primary reason I purchased the product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll be a great present for them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a light sleeper, but my coworkers don&#x27;t need to know that just by looking at my eyes.</li>
            <li>and it is oil and paraben free.</li>
            <li>Also, they do not test on animals OR use parabens which are both important to me.</li>
            <li>So far, so good....</li>
            <li>I am 47 years old and keep in good shape</li>
            <li>/&gt;It will be interesting to see what 30 days of consistent use brings.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure she&#x27;s going to buy some herself.</li>
            <li>The eye gel goes on smoothly and disappears quickly.  </li>
            <li>This product is great to women with dark circles, crow&#x27;s feet and fine lines.</li>
            <li>It has worked very well and I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>It seems to feel cool as it goes on and the outcome feels like a Botox treatment.  </li>
            <li>but I need use more time to have a real review.</li>
            <li>and I have a full time job.  </li>
            <li>I was actually thinking about eye lid surgery, Now I&#x27;m thinking if I&#x27;m diligent with this product I&#x27;ll be good.</li>
            <li>It feels cool when I put it on my bags</li>
            <li>This product is tremendous.  </li>
            <li>I cannot wait to get my next bottle,love, love ,love, this,the puffiness is gone, the lines are fading,I have gotten a lot of comments,saying I looked better.&lt;br /&gt;Missy</li>
            <li>This is my secret to flawless silky smooth skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super emollient without being greasy.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quick, so I don&#x27;t have to add any time to my morning routine</li>
            <li>Item received quickly.</li>
            <li>This eye serum is very quick absorbing.</li>
            <li>Dark circles :-).&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>Overall, pretty good.</li>
            <li>Thanks a million!!</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more!</li>
            <li>I have tried several eye creams, and while I know there is no miracle potion, as a licensed cosmetologist I have to say that I really love this product and will continue buying it!</li>
            <li>So happy with my new product, and won&#x27;t hesitate in getting my next bottle.</li>
            <li>Some brand name drugstore products can cost as much or more than Epicura and are less effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky going on, it&#x27;s more like a clear gel that absorbs quickly</li>
            <li>It feels light and gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this light weight serum.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth trying out for yourself.</li>
            <li>The  business representative was kind to contact me after the purchase and even offered personal stories of success.</li>
            <li>What attracted me most to this line was that it was made In USA with all natural ingredients</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it for my bags under my eyes and around my mouth I have smile lines</li>
            <li>Even though receiving it at a discount, I am going to be purchasing more for family and friends in the near</li>
            <li>She loved the other Epicura skin serums, so she went ahead and bought their eye cream to try to treat the under-the-eye issues.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several days and I am impressed that the puffiness is gone and the dark circles are too.</li>
            <li>So far I love the eye serum, although I think I need more time in order to give a proper review.</li>
            <li>and it has brighten the lines which is really good and making the lines less deep.great product takes a while for results to show</li>
            <li>It feels kinda warm on my first application but somehow you could feel its working on the eye area, knowing my skin is not sensitive.</li>
            <li>you very much for the cream.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend has more or less fallen in love with this eye cream, and pretty much demanded I write this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because it does so well in reducing my bags, I am willing to overlook to tacky feeling.</li>
            <li>I finally used it 4 days/nights ago and love how it feels on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I took a while to write this review because I wanted to see if there was an improvement under my eyes first.  </li>
            <li>I also love how there is a 100% money back guarantee</li>
            <li>Thanks Epicura!</li>
            <li>When I first apply, my puffy eyes don&#x27;t seem quite as puffy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s affordable, natural and you genuinely see results after a couple applications.</li>
            <li>It really works!  </li>
            <li>I am glad I ttied this 1 because it actually worked as described...</li>
            <li>I have used other eye creams that were sticky on my lids, Eye Promise feels really clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love the bottle because you can see how much you have left.</li>
            <li>Its takes a few weeks to really start noticing difference, but I can definetly tell you that within the first two days my eyes looked very well rested and almost bright.</li>
            <li>ONE POSITIVE THING I WILL SAY</li>
            <li>First, you can&#x27;t see how much product is in the container.</li>
            <li>Second, and of great concern, you cannot possibly get a small, suitable amount out.</li>
            <li>Applying this serum is easy and it only takes a couple of drop before you began seeing a difference..</li>
            <li>My eyes certainly are not as swollen as they were.  </li>
            <li>Iv been using it for a few weeks now and love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have found a product that not only feels good on my skin, but is actually helping to reduce the small lines and creases around my eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>seem to be fading, and the skin around my eyes is definitely happier and some of the fine lines and wrinkles have lessened noticeably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I noticed that my crow&#x27;s feet are going away, the bags are slowly starting to disappear and the fine lines are going away as well.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t have a lasting feeling like some others I have tried, either so that is a huge plus!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>No matter how carefully or gently I apply pressure, this squirts out so much that I can apply to my whole face.</li>
            <li>I think you will like it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>Plus there is a cooling, tingling sensation that is very soothing.</li>
            <li>I especially like that it has a light concealer in it as well -</li>
            <li>It really works!&lt;br /&gt;Marcela</li>
            <li>It pumps way too much out at one time</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not that I was expecting too much.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Anti Aging Cream for a friend and she&#x27;s found that she really enjoys the product.</li>
            <li>The creamworks fast</li>
            <li>So this has really helped out with that.</li>
            <li>I  no longer need as much concealer, I use it twice</li>
            <li>There is no minor or significant change to the puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li>After about a week I started to see a real difference in the puffiness around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I found the content is very coagulated.</li>
            <li>It came fast.</li>
            <li>So far I love it and would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>this just adds something extra that is definitely worth it though!</li>
            <li>Epicura Skin works much better than any other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>I have used other eye creams and have found this Epicura Eye cream to be as good or better than many of the very expensive department store products.</li>
            <li>(her only saving grace was suggesting Bigelow Sweet Dreams for my insomnia).</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t go in for this kind of a thing.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see the results from using this new product!</li>
            <li>I was trying so many different creams and nothing seemed to make a noticeable difference and actually work.</li>
            <li>My two sun spots (one on each cheek) seem to have faded somewhat and my facial skin feels really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The main problems, with this product, concern the packaging.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend product and seller</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this, along with the uplift face and neck cream, for the past week and so far am loving it.</li>
            <li>my 16 year old daughter and I were taken mistaken for sisters!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After purchasing my first bottle I received an email from the co-founder asking if i received my order and what I thought of it so far.  </li>
            <li>Aging sucks, better to try reducing salt and water intake and not sleeping on your face ;)</li>
            <li>I have trouble with puffy eyes and while I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know whether it will affect that or not, it does feel great.</li>
            <li>really helps keep eye area smooth and firm and helps with eye puffiness.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>After having four kids under 5 I have dark circles and puffy eyes with huge bags as a result of sleep deprivation.</li>
            <li>If it continues to work as well as the first week, this is definitely a winner.</li>
            <li>No more puffy eyes or dark circles; the results are astounding!</li>
            <li>It took only a tiny amount on my fingertip to adequately apply it all around my eye.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>it dosnt have control to have a nice flow even if i press very slowly, it just spits it out in a blob.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting to notice that it soften my wrinkles and made my eyes look a little more refreshed.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a tiny little change for the the better, and I may purchase it again.</li>
            <li>The product is clear and virtually odorless.  </li>
            <li>After using this creme everyday over the course of a couple weeks, I noticed the lines staring to smooth out and not looking nearly as defined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The skin around my eye is soft.</li>
            <li>product also does&#x27;t have any odor and completely soaks in and disappears in just a minute.</li>
            <li>I had puffiness lately and it did get better with the serum.</li>
            <li>I like it so far</li>
            <li>It dispenses roughly three times more than I need, enough for my entire face.</li>
            <li>a 40+ year old mom with 2 children under the age of 4,</li>
            <li>Epicura leaves skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>The Serum seems old.  </li>
            <li>I have seen improvement as far as lines and wrinkles but the puffyness remains.</li>
            <li>I work full time, have a part time job and go to school full time, needless to say; I&#x27;m stressed and don&#x27;t get much sleep.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a couple months and like it better than the other, more expensive products I have tried from Elemis, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never really tried a product that I was excited enough about to do one!</li>
            <li>I started seeing a face in my mirror every morning who began to only slightly resemble the guy I was expecting to see.&lt;br /&gt;Hitting 50 was no problem emotionally, but how all of a sudden did I get my grandfather&#x27;s eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Hesitant at first, I tried a few products in creams, rollers, gels - all felt good, but wore off quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Stumbled on Epicura and gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Was astonished at the immediate and long-term effects.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>only con is that when I received it the top was not on tight and when I used it  leaked , next time I will check it before use.</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for the eye gel based on some of the reviews for this product.  </li>
            <li>i dont care for the container as when i press down on the top to get a small amount of cream, it spits out a large quanity</li>
            <li>It makes the skin under my eyes more clear and less dark.</li>
            <li>It only takes a couple of drops and the results are wow!</li>
            <li>This is still a major improvement compared to products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about two weeks and have noticed a major improvement.  </li>
            <li>I noticed after just the first application my eyes were not as puffy and the dark circles under my eyes looked brighter.</li>
            <li>am 60 years old and look younger, people ask if I had some work done, this works for me!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent way, way too much time trying to adapt the pressure I use to eject the serum.</li>
            <li>I developed severe puffiness under my eyes several years ago.  </li>
            <li>I am 40 years old and on two separate occasions last month</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks with no obvious difference and don&#x27;t know if I will have enough product left to be able to give it enough time to work, if, in fact, it does work.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing much for puffiness or dark circles but keeps my eye area hydrated and the tiny lines under my eyes are disappearing so</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Really works well and feels wonderful!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Customer service was nice and helpful.</li>
            <li> It feels nice to put on, but doesn&#x27;t diminish puffiness.  </li>
            <li> I had hoped for some kind of results.  </li>
            <li> I received this to try in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> received this product at a discount to do an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Extremely effective in battling morning puffiness and allergy swelling.  </li>
            <li> I am really impressed by this company as it seems that they are really taking the time to listen their customers.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price, however after using it religously for more than six months it does not help with puffy eyes or bags as it claims.</li>
            <li> whuch is rare!!!..</li>
            <li> The reason I am rating it high is because I don&#x27;t think I am in the demographic to have amazing results with this product, so let&#x27;s see if I keep using it if I can avoid aging all together!!!</li>
            <li> So far the best product that I have used to deal with eye bags.</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE your eye serum!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 52 years old and my skin is actually very good</li>
            <li> Nothing more.</li>
            <li> I ordered more of the Epicura line as well as another bottle of the eye serum with Vitamin C.</li>
            <li> After trying many eye products, this one has given me the fastest results.</li>
            <li> I am ordering 2 more and have with me all the time.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will use it again</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more than what I need for the eye area.  </li>
            <li> Glad I took a chance and ordered it.</li>
            <li> My eyes look much better and the puffiness under my eyes are almost gone.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than anything else on the market (cheaper drug store brands).  </li>
            <li> I love the glow in my skin too</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this eye cream, it has almost no smell at all, as well as the fact it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all, unlike most eye creams do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably the best facial serum you can purchase at on amazon for anti-aging benefits.</li>
            <li> ---love</li>
            <li> Love this eye cream...</li>
            <li> I love the texture and the refreshing feeling that I get from this eye cream.</li>
            <li> I HAD MANY EMAILS FROM THIS COMPANY ASKING MY OPINION OF MY RESULTS.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be looking for something else that works just as well at a better price point.  </li>
            <li> Most important - it works!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> this worked better on my eyes.</li>
            <li> I love this vitamin C serum for eyes.</li>
            <li> My skin just keep getting better the longer</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed and loved about this Vitamin C Eye Serum by Epicura Skin was that it Did Not Have A Scent.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> She has purchased many eye creams and most do work, but this product is better and faster with true results.</li>
            <li> received this Vitamin C Eye Serum at a reduced cost in exchange for testing and review and can honestly say that it is well worth the asking price.</li>
            <li> So far this is pretty good, non greasy and makes my skin feeling good.</li>
            <li> Hands and neck were easy to keep up, but no matter what I tried for my eyes</li>
            <li> Second favorite, all the wonderful natural ingredients, it really makes me feel good, and safe when using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> I have been using it for almost a month and have noticed the fine lines and beginning signs of crows feet soften noticeably.</li>
            <li> If product is half as good as the sellers&#x27; devotion to her eye serum and my happiness</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on March 5th,I just ran out on April 14th,I must say this product has made a huge difference in the the look of my under eyes,80 percent improvement.</li>
            <li> important when I am placing it so close to my nose and</li>
            <li> I was told that I looked the same as I did 15 years agoâ€¦ which was great to hear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That is the primary reason I purchased the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll be a great present for them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a light sleeper, but my coworkers don&#x27;t need to know that just by looking at my eyes.</li>
            <li> and it is oil and paraben free.</li>
            <li> Also, they do not test on animals OR use parabens which are both important to me.</li>
            <li> So far, so good....</li>
            <li> I am 47 years old and keep in good shape</li>
            <li> /&gt;It will be interesting to see what 30 days of consistent use brings.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure she&#x27;s going to buy some herself.</li>
            <li> The eye gel goes on smoothly and disappears quickly.  </li>
            <li> This product is great to women with dark circles, crow&#x27;s feet and fine lines.</li>
            <li> It has worked very well and I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> It seems to feel cool as it goes on and the outcome feels like a Botox treatment.  </li>
            <li> but I need use more time to have a real review.</li>
            <li> and I have a full time job.  </li>
            <li> I was actually thinking about eye lid surgery, Now I&#x27;m thinking if I&#x27;m diligent with this product I&#x27;ll be good.</li>
            <li> It feels cool when I put it on my bags</li>
            <li> This product is tremendous.  </li>
            <li> I cannot wait to get my next bottle,love, love ,love, this,the puffiness is gone, the lines are fading,I have gotten a lot of comments,saying I looked better.&lt;br /&gt;Missy</li>
            <li> This is my secret to flawless silky smooth skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super emollient without being greasy.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quick, so I don&#x27;t have to add any time to my morning routine</li>
            <li> Item received quickly.</li>
            <li> This eye serum is very quick absorbing.</li>
            <li> Dark circles :-).&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Overall, pretty good.</li>
            <li> Thanks a million!!</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more!</li>
            <li> I have tried several eye creams, and while I know there is no miracle potion, as a licensed cosmetologist I have to say that I really love this product and will continue buying it!</li>
            <li> So happy with my new product, and won&#x27;t hesitate in getting my next bottle.</li>
            <li> Some brand name drugstore products can cost as much or more than Epicura and are less effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky going on, it&#x27;s more like a clear gel that absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> It feels light and gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this light weight serum.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth trying out for yourself.</li>
            <li> The  business representative was kind to contact me after the purchase and even offered personal stories of success.</li>
            <li> What attracted me most to this line was that it was made In USA with all natural ingredients</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it for my bags under my eyes and around my mouth I have smile lines</li>
            <li> Even though receiving it at a discount, I am going to be purchasing more for family and friends in the near</li>
            <li> She loved the other Epicura skin serums, so she went ahead and bought their eye cream to try to treat the under-the-eye issues.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several days and I am impressed that the puffiness is gone and the dark circles are too.</li>
            <li> So far I love the eye serum, although I think I need more time in order to give a proper review.</li>
            <li> and it has brighten the lines which is really good and making the lines less deep.great product takes a while for results to show</li>
            <li> It feels kinda warm on my first application but somehow you could feel its working on the eye area, knowing my skin is not sensitive.</li>
            <li> you very much for the cream.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend has more or less fallen in love with this eye cream, and pretty much demanded I write this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because it does so well in reducing my bags, I am willing to overlook to tacky feeling.</li>
            <li> I finally used it 4 days/nights ago and love how it feels on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I took a while to write this review because I wanted to see if there was an improvement under my eyes first.  </li>
            <li> I also love how there is a 100% money back guarantee</li>
            <li> Thanks Epicura!</li>
            <li> When I first apply, my puffy eyes don&#x27;t seem quite as puffy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s affordable, natural and you genuinely see results after a couple applications.</li>
            <li> It really works!  </li>
            <li> I am glad I ttied this 1 because it actually worked as described...</li>
            <li> I have used other eye creams that were sticky on my lids, Eye Promise feels really clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I love the bottle because you can see how much you have left.</li>
            <li> Its takes a few weeks to really start noticing difference, but I can definetly tell you that within the first two days my eyes looked very well rested and almost bright.</li>
            <li> ONE POSITIVE THING I WILL SAY</li>
            <li> First, you can&#x27;t see how much product is in the container.</li>
            <li> Second, and of great concern, you cannot possibly get a small, suitable amount out.</li>
            <li> Applying this serum is easy and it only takes a couple of drop before you began seeing a difference..</li>
            <li> My eyes certainly are not as swollen as they were.  </li>
            <li> Iv been using it for a few weeks now and love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have found a product that not only feels good on my skin, but is actually helping to reduce the small lines and creases around my eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> seem to be fading, and the skin around my eyes is definitely happier and some of the fine lines and wrinkles have lessened noticeably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I noticed that my crow&#x27;s feet are going away, the bags are slowly starting to disappear and the fine lines are going away as well.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t have a lasting feeling like some others I have tried, either so that is a huge plus!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> No matter how carefully or gently I apply pressure, this squirts out so much that I can apply to my whole face.</li>
            <li> I think you will like it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Plus there is a cooling, tingling sensation that is very soothing.</li>
            <li> I especially like that it has a light concealer in it as well -</li>
            <li> It really works!&lt;br /&gt;Marcela</li>
            <li> It pumps way too much out at one time</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not that I was expecting too much.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Anti Aging Cream for a friend and she&#x27;s found that she really enjoys the product.</li>
            <li> The creamworks fast</li>
            <li> So this has really helped out with that.</li>
            <li> I  no longer need as much concealer, I use it twice</li>
            <li> There is no minor or significant change to the puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> After about a week I started to see a real difference in the puffiness around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I found the content is very coagulated.</li>
            <li> It came fast.</li>
            <li> So far I love it and would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> this just adds something extra that is definitely worth it though!</li>
            <li> Epicura Skin works much better than any other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have used other eye creams and have found this Epicura Eye cream to be as good or better than many of the very expensive department store products.</li>
            <li> (her only saving grace was suggesting Bigelow Sweet Dreams for my insomnia).</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t go in for this kind of a thing.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see the results from using this new product!</li>
            <li> I was trying so many different creams and nothing seemed to make a noticeable difference and actually work.</li>
            <li> My two sun spots (one on each cheek) seem to have faded somewhat and my facial skin feels really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The main problems, with this product, concern the packaging.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend product and seller</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this, along with the uplift face and neck cream, for the past week and so far am loving it.</li>
            <li> my 16 year old daughter and I were taken mistaken for sisters!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After purchasing my first bottle I received an email from the co-founder asking if i received my order and what I thought of it so far.  </li>
            <li> Aging sucks, better to try reducing salt and water intake and not sleeping on your face ;)</li>
            <li> I have trouble with puffy eyes and while I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know whether it will affect that or not, it does feel great.</li>
            <li> really helps keep eye area smooth and firm and helps with eye puffiness.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> After having four kids under 5 I have dark circles and puffy eyes with huge bags as a result of sleep deprivation.</li>
            <li> If it continues to work as well as the first week, this is definitely a winner.</li>
            <li> No more puffy eyes or dark circles; the results are astounding!</li>
            <li> It took only a tiny amount on my fingertip to adequately apply it all around my eye.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> it dosnt have control to have a nice flow even if i press very slowly, it just spits it out in a blob.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to notice that it soften my wrinkles and made my eyes look a little more refreshed.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a tiny little change for the the better, and I may purchase it again.</li>
            <li> The product is clear and virtually odorless.  </li>
            <li> After using this creme everyday over the course of a couple weeks, I noticed the lines staring to smooth out and not looking nearly as defined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The skin around my eye is soft.</li>
            <li> product also does&#x27;t have any odor and completely soaks in and disappears in just a minute.</li>
            <li> I had puffiness lately and it did get better with the serum.</li>
            <li> I like it so far</li>
            <li> It dispenses roughly three times more than I need, enough for my entire face.</li>
            <li> a 40+ year old mom with 2 children under the age of 4,</li>
            <li> Epicura leaves skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> The Serum seems old.  </li>
            <li> I have seen improvement as far as lines and wrinkles but the puffyness remains.</li>
            <li> I work full time, have a part time job and go to school full time, needless to say; I&#x27;m stressed and don&#x27;t get much sleep.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a couple months and like it better than the other, more expensive products I have tried from Elemis, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really tried a product that I was excited enough about to do one!</li>
            <li> I started seeing a face in my mirror every morning who began to only slightly resemble the guy I was expecting to see.&lt;br /&gt;Hitting 50 was no problem emotionally, but how all of a sudden did I get my grandfather&#x27;s eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Hesitant at first, I tried a few products in creams, rollers, gels - all felt good, but wore off quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Stumbled on Epicura and gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Was astonished at the immediate and long-term effects.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> only con is that when I received it the top was not on tight and when I used it  leaked , next time I will check it before use.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for the eye gel based on some of the reviews for this product.  </li>
            <li> i dont care for the container as when i press down on the top to get a small amount of cream, it spits out a large quanity</li>
            <li> It makes the skin under my eyes more clear and less dark.</li>
            <li> It only takes a couple of drops and the results are wow!</li>
            <li> This is still a major improvement compared to products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about two weeks and have noticed a major improvement.  </li>
            <li> I noticed after just the first application my eyes were not as puffy and the dark circles under my eyes looked brighter.</li>
            <li> am 60 years old and look younger, people ask if I had some work done, this works for me!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent way, way too much time trying to adapt the pressure I use to eject the serum.</li>
            <li> I developed severe puffiness under my eyes several years ago.  </li>
            <li> I am 40 years old and on two separate occasions last month</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks with no obvious difference and don&#x27;t know if I will have enough product left to be able to give it enough time to work, if, in fact, it does work.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing much for puffiness or dark circles but keeps my eye area hydrated and the tiny lines under my eyes are disappearing so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll also agree with other reviewers as far as the dispensing of the product.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is with Amazon&#x27;s choice of packing, they sent it in such a ridiculously large box when a padded envelope would have worked well.</li>
            <li> I have developed bags under my eyes over the last few months.</li>
            <li> I am a believer and now that I&#x60;ve found it I&#x27;ll stick to it for as long as it works.</li>
            <li> am using some other products as well, but definitely think this has been instrumental in helping with bags, puffiness and dark circles in the eye area (so much so that my other half has now purchased a bottle, as well...</li>
            <li> I usually use high end skin care but thought, due to the reviews, to give Epicura a try.</li>
            <li> I wish I had this 19 years ago when my flute teacher accused me of using heroin because she had never seen a teen with dark eye circles before</li>
            <li> I pat the serum under my eye where the dark circles are, then into the corner of my eye and lastly on my eyelid.</li>
            <li> , the small lines are disappearing and the under eye darkness has also lightened up considerably.</li>
            <li> Definitely helped with dark circles and puffiness around the eyes.</li>
            <li> next thing I noticed is that A Little Goes A Long Way.</li>
            <li> Or the product would just sit on top of my skin making the rest of my make up routine impossible.</li>
            <li> results.i only applied a little under eye.</li>
            <li> I actually got all of the facial creams in this line and decided to wait at least 6 weeks before reviewing.</li>
            <li> In only a few days of using it</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s really no way to regulate it.</li>
            <li> That said, I have to reapply a few times daily as my puffy eyes reappear.</li>
            <li> I notice that even after a few days of using this cream, the bags are getting smaller.  </li>
            <li> area and eyelid felt itchy and felt minimal burning sensation.</li>
            <li> Epicura eye cream has given me my old eyes back and even though I am still exhausted, it doesn&#x27;t show.  </li>
            <li> I recently started grad school so eight hours of nightly sleep is a thing of the past.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look as tired looking as it normally does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just felt that it didn&#x27;t deliver anything extra ordinary as promised.</li>
            <li> Resulting in an extremely irregular sleep pattern.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for only a few days now and can already see a difference!</li>
            <li> I plan to try some other products as well.</li>
            <li> I have dark under eye circles.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction of puffiness or dark circles.</li>
            <li> The puffiness, the dark circles are gone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dark circles</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping out after just 1 week - noticing the dark circles</li>
            <li> It did wonders for my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any difference in the dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> And the product is guaranteed so you&#x27;ve got nothing to lose by trying it, except the dark circles under your eyes.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dark circles under my eyes</li>
            <li> but I do not think it helps with dark circles which is what I bought if for.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but this really did  instaneously take away my puffs &amp; circles..  </li>
            <li> One star down for the texture that&#x27;s a bit runny and makes for some rage outbursts when it ends up in the sink instead of my skin...</li>
            <li> I pump a portion out, I would like to see less come</li>
            <li> My daughter noticed my dark circles were diminished and asked me what I was doing to my skin!  </li>
            <li> I am not familiar with the words rest and sleep...</li>
            <li> I have tried pricier products with little to no results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 45 and was getting a sunken look underneath my eyes, but my eyes looked less tired after a few days of using Eye Promise and the crow&#x27;s feet are definitely less deep after a few weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The combination of Vitamin C with healing Aloe Vera, soothing cucumber, skin brightening licorice extract and antioxidant green tea is truly benefiting my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money wit</li>
            <li> update in few weeks.</li>
            <li> This is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all, but at 34 I had no visible signs of improvement.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> Will update in a few months with results.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks and can see the results.</li>
            <li> but it takes a few weeks to see the results.</li>
            <li> you can notice  the difference in a few days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She has no wrinkles or crow&#x27;s feet, but she does have trouble sleeping and gets noticeable puffiness and saggy pouches under her eyes because of it.</li>
            <li> If this product is used everyday like recommend u will see</li>
            <li> That translates to wasted money..</li>
            <li> In my personal opinion and experience, this product proved to be ineffective and falsely advertised.</li>
            <li> so I struggled with burning sensations, redness and just plain irritation.</li>
            <li> Although this product might seem a little expensive buying Epicura means that you&#x27;ll never have to spend money on similar drugstore products again.</li>
            <li> My one complaint is the pump bottle, it is difficult to only pump half way.</li>
            <li> The darkness isn&#x27;t nearly as bad during allergies making them much easier to cover up.</li>
            <li> I usually put the&lt;br /&gt;left</li>
            <li> So much waste!</li>
            <li> I started using it a week ago because I was not happy with my eyes being puffy and dark.  </li>
            <li> The eye serum has made me look less tired.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has been a little longer of using this product and I continue to still see a difference in the puffiness around my eyes!!</li>
            <li> This serum controlled the puffiness from crying and poor sleep.</li>
            <li> I think the only thing that does diminish puffiness is, unfortunately, plastic surgery!  </li>
            <li> In just a few days, the eye cream tightened up the skin and drastically reduced the dark circles, even after a bout of crazy insomnia.</li>
            <li> I use 4 different eye drops for glaucoma and my eyelids were getting red and awful looking as a result of the eye drops.  </li>
            <li> I tend to suffer from a lack of sleep which leaves me with dark circles and terrible eyes and over the years, this has taken its toll on me and left permanent damage that I just can&#x27;t seem to get rid of.</li>
            <li> With that being accepted, they are worse during allergy season, poor sleep, stress, and illness.</li>
            <li> I have been using the eyecream for almost 2 weeks now and have seen some changes, nothing dramatic</li>
            <li> , the scent is unobtrusive and very subtle.</li>
            <li> I do like the feel of the gel, but unfortunately I see no changes in the puffiness.  </li>
            <li> When it comes to eye creams, one can just never go wrong by trying everything on the market.</li>
            <li> I am quite disappointed that I has not worked  for me</li>
            <li> Disappointed in product.</li>
            <li> I guarantee you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I ended up being disappointed and discouraged.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with this one.</li>
            <li> I have terrible insomnia and because of that my undereye area is always puffy.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> THIS MIGHT WORK FOR SOME BUT IT DID NOTHING FOR ME.  THE SELLER AGREED TO REIMBURSE ME ACCORDINGLY</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed and loved about this Vitamin C Eye Serum by Epicura Skin was that it Did Not Have A Scent.&lt;br /&gt;Very important when I am placing it so close to my nose and greatly appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;The next thing I noticed is that A Little Goes A Long Way. It took only a tiny amount on my fingertip to adequately apply it all around my eye.&lt;br /&gt;When you get to be over 60, it seems the lines increase monthly instead of yearly. It&#x27;s nice to have found a product that not only feels good on my skin, but is actually helping to reduce the small lines and creases around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;The combination of Vitamin C with healing Aloe Vera, soothing cucumber, skin brightening licorice extract and antioxidant green tea is truly benefiting my skin. In a week&#x27;s time, I am already seeing results. I look younger already!&lt;br /&gt;I received this Vitamin C Eye Serum at a reduced cost in exchange for testing and review and can honestly say that it is well worth the asking price. Great results for under 50 cents a day! 100% Money Back Guarantee if you are not fully satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try. I think you will like it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I am on my third bottle.  I usually use high end skin care but thought, due to the reviews, to give Epicura a try. It has worked very well and I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money wit 30 dollars I take my girl to red lobster</li>
            <li> I have dark under eye circles. Had them all my life and can trace them back 3 generations through photographs. They are genetic and will never go away. With that being accepted, they are worse during allergy season, poor sleep, stress, and illness. This serum controlled the puffiness from crying and poor sleep. The darkness isn&#x27;t nearly as bad during allergies making them much easier to cover up. Plus there is a cooling, tingling sensation that is very soothing. I wish I had this 19 years ago when my flute teacher accused me of using heroin because she had never seen a teen with dark eye circles before (her only saving grace was suggesting Bigelow Sweet Dreams for my insomnia).</li>
            <li> The skin around my eye is soft. I haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction of puffiness or dark circles. A great buy for the price. Good moisturizer for the skin around the eyes. Nothing more.</li>
            <li> This eye serum is very quick absorbing. It only takes a couple of drops and the results are wow! The puffiness, the dark circles are gone. The texture around my eyes feels smoother too. I use this product in the morning and before bed. Applying this serum is easy and it only takes a couple of drop before you began seeing a difference..I pat the serum under my eye where the dark circles are, then into the corner of my eye and lastly on my eyelid. I have used this product for several days and I am impressed that the puffiness is gone and the dark circles are too. I have added this serum to my daily beauty regime. It&#x27;s worth trying out for yourself. What have you got to lose? Dark circles :-).&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> I recently started grad school so eight hours of nightly sleep is a thing of the past.  When I was given the opportunity to try this Epicura eye serum at a discounted price during a promotional period to test for quality and review, I had nothing to lose but puffiness.  The serum comes in a pump dispenser, which I prefer over a jar.  The product is clear and virtually odorless.  I felt no tingling or burning sensation with the product.  It took awhile to absorb into my skin and left it somewhat tacky.  I applied my daily makeup over it with powder and the tacky feeling was gone.  I have been using this product for about a week now and I have seen the puffiness under my eyes diminish quite a bit.  I don&#x27;t have dark circles so I cannot attest to that effectiveness.  Because it does so well in reducing my bags, I am willing to overlook to tacky feeling.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.... Seems to be helping out after just 1 week - noticing the dark circles seem to be fading, and the skin around my eyes is definitely happier and some of the fine lines and wrinkles have lessened noticeably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using some other products as well, but definitely think this has been instrumental in helping with bags, puffiness and dark circles in the eye area (so much so that my other half has now purchased a bottle, as well...lol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will be interesting to see what 30 days of consistent use brings.  If it continues to work as well as the first week, this is definitely a winner.</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE your eye serum!  I finally used it 4 days/nights ago and love how it feels on my skin.  It seems to feel cool as it goes on and the outcome feels like a Botox treatment.  I ordered more of the Epicura line as well as another bottle of the eye serum with Vitamin C. It is definitely my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; face products.  Thanks a million!!</li>
            <li> This product is tremendous.  I started using it a week ago because I was not happy with my eyes being puffy and dark.  I am 47 years old and keep in good shape but this one one thing that was bothering me.  I think it is hereditary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was meeting some friends that I hadn&#x27;t seen in 15 years and just thought maybe I&#x27;d use it before we got together.  In only a few days of using it every evening-  the puffiness was gone.  When we got together I was told that I looked the same as I did 15 years agoâ€¦ which was great to hear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product also does&#x27;t have any odor and completely soaks in and disappears in just a minute.</li>
            <li> So far I love the eye serum, although I think I need more time in order to give a proper review. I have been using it only 2 weeks.  I had puffiness lately and it did get better with the serum. It makes the skin under my eyes more clear and less dark. I like the texture.&lt;br /&gt;Will update in few weeks.</li>
            <li> After trying many eye products, this one has given me the fastest results. I will definitely order more! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on March 5th,I just ran out on April 14th,I must say this product has made a huge difference in the the look of my under eyes,80 percent improvement. I cannot wait to get my next bottle,love, love ,love, this,the puffiness is gone, the lines are fading,I have gotten a lot of comments,saying I looked better.&lt;br /&gt;Missy Quinn</li>
            <li> It is good product but I need use more time to have a real review. I like it so far</li>
            <li> This the best eye cream I ever used for great price. I have puffy eyes and I am very happy with result. I am ordering 2 more and have with me all the time.</li>
            <li> This is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all, but at 34 I had no visible signs of improvement.  The reason I am rating it high is because I don&#x27;t think I am in the demographic to have amazing results with this product, so let&#x27;s see if I keep using it if I can avoid aging all together!!!</li>
            <li> I have noticed my eyes are not as puffy. My only complaint is with Amazon&#x27;s choice of packing, they sent it in such a ridiculously large box when a padded envelope would have worked well.</li>
            <li> I tend to suffer from a lack of sleep which leaves me with dark circles and terrible eyes and over the years, this has taken its toll on me and left permanent damage that I just can&#x27;t seem to get rid of. But with this product, it doesn&#x27;t only just hide the damage, but it reverses it as well and makes a big difference in the look of my eyes over time. I noticed that my crow&#x27;s feet are going away, the bags are slowly starting to disappear and the fine lines are going away as well. I can&#x27;t believe that I found something that would actually reverse the damage and not just hide it for the day! I especially like that it has a light concealer in it as well - this just adds something extra that is definitely worth it though!</li>
            <li> Really works well and feels wonderful!  I have trouble with puffy eyes and while I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know whether it will affect that or not, it does feel great.</li>
            <li> So far this is pretty good, non greasy and makes my skin feeling good. I will update my review if things change.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will use it again</li>
            <li> My eyes certainly are not as swollen as they were.  I would like to think&lt;br /&gt;that&#x27;s the product working!  It also feels good on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I pump a portion out, I would like to see less come out,&lt;br /&gt;because it&#x27;s more than what I need for the eye area.  I usually put the&lt;br /&gt;left over above my lips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a few weeks now and I like the way it goes on and absorbs in my eye area. Doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing much for puffiness or dark circles but keeps my eye area hydrated and the tiny lines under my eyes are disappearing so I&#x27;ll keep using it</li>
            <li> Finally a cream that works! Iv been using it for a few weeks now and love it! Glad I took a chance and ordered it.</li>
            <li> Just started using and seems to be a good quality product.  Will update in a few months with results.  If product is half as good as the sellers&#x27; devotion to her eye serum and my happiness then it&#x27;s worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> I took a while to write this review because I wanted to see if there was an improvement under my eyes first.  I&#x27;m starting to notice that it soften my wrinkles and made my eyes look a little more refreshed. It doesn&#x27;t look as tired looking as it normally does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer service was nice and helpful. Mia kept checking to see how it was working for me.</li>
            <li> I started seeing a face in my mirror every morning who began to only slightly resemble the guy I was expecting to see.&lt;br /&gt;Hitting 50 was no problem emotionally, but how all of a sudden did I get my grandfather&#x27;s eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Hesitant at first, I tried a few products in creams, rollers, gels - all felt good, but wore off quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Stumbled on Epicura and gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Was astonished at the immediate and long-term effects.&lt;br /&gt;Good morning bright eyes!</li>
            <li> I have been using the anti aging eye cream for almost one month now.  I do like the feel of the gel, but unfortunately I see no changes in the puffiness.  I had such high hopes for the eye gel based on some of the reviews for this product.  I am quite disappointed that I has not worked  for me like I thought it would.</li>
            <li> The eye serum has made me look less tired.  My daughter noticed my dark circles were diminished and asked me what I was doing to my skin!  I love the bottle because you can see how much you have left. I have used other eye creams that were sticky on my lids, Eye Promise feels really clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked for me. I usually don&#x27;t go in for this kind of a thing. It did wonders for my dark circles.</li>
            <li> So far the best product that I have used to deal with eye bags. I have been using it for a few weeks and can see the results. It&#x27;s not like the bags are dramatically gone, but they are probably tighter. .</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any difference in the dark circles under my eyes.  That is the primary reason I purchased the product.</li>
            <li> In my personal opinion and experience, this product proved to be ineffective and falsely advertised. I used the product twice daily for two months and saw no change in the puffiness . The  business representative was kind to contact me after the purchase and even offered personal stories of success. However, after I explained that I saw no difference/change after weeks of use, she discontinued contacting me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping the seller will honor the refund guarantee.......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of using your epicura eye promise gel, I finally see the results. My eyes look much better and the puffiness under my eyes are almost gone. It is a really good cream but it takes a few weeks to see the results. As you may know, good things in life takes time. And did I mentioned that I am a 42 years old.&#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much for the cream. It really works!&lt;br /&gt;Marcela</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks now and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than anything else on the market (cheaper drug store brands).  I&#x27;ll also agree with other reviewers as far as the dispensing of the product.  It pumps way too much out at one time and there&#x27;s really no way to regulate it. I wish I could give this product a better review because the sellers are so nice and customer service is great, but It is fair at best.  I&#x27;m 52 years old and my skin is actually very good (people say I look 40) so it&#x27;s not that I was expecting too much.  I just felt that it didn&#x27;t deliver anything extra ordinary as promised.</li>
            <li> When it comes to eye creams, one can just never go wrong by trying everything on the market. And that&#x27;s what happened to me. I was trying so many different creams and nothing seemed to make a noticeable difference and actually work. A friend of mine recommended this product and after I bought it, I could not only feel a difference in my face and eyes, but I could notice a difference as well! This is one of those eye cream purchases that you have to have and one of those that you start and never go away from either!</li>
            <li> I bought the Anti Aging Cream for a friend and she&#x27;s found that she really enjoys the product. I&#x27;m pretty sure she&#x27;s going to buy some herself. I&#x27;d recommend you buy it for your girlfriend or mother. It&#x27;ll be a great present for them.</li>
            <li> Epicura&#x27;s anti aging eye cream with vitamin c has revitalized my eyes.  After having four kids under 5 I have dark circles and puffy eyes with huge bags as a result of sleep deprivation. Epicura eye cream has given me my old eyes back and even though I am still exhausted, it doesn&#x27;t show.  The creamworks fast and I noticed immediate results after using it.  I have also noticed that some of the wrinkles and sagging skin has gone back to where they were before kids and all this in just a short amount of time of using the eye cream  I also love how there is a 100% money back guarantee so you have nothing to lose by trying this wonderful product.  I recommend all those parents out there to go try this wonderful serum.</li>
            <li> Eye&#x27;s skin absorption is very good</li>
            <li> I use this product twice a day and still have puffiness under my eyes. Disappointed in product. I wish I had only purchased 1 bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this eye gel along with the quench serum for my face and I&#x27;ve found these products very pleasant to use.  The eye gel goes on smoothly and disappears quickly.  Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all, and it&#x27;s helped to reduce my puffy eyes. I&#x27;m a light sleeper, but my coworkers don&#x27;t need to know that just by looking at my eyes. So this has really helped out with that.</li>
            <li> I got your 3  products a week ago and I am very impressed !!! you can notice  the difference in a few days. I love the glow in my skin too</li>
            <li> My skin is looking nicer around the eyes. I don&#x27;t see any help with puffiness though. My one complaint is the pump bottle, it is difficult to only pump half way. It dispenses roughly three times more than I need, enough for my entire face.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product.  She has purchased many eye creams and most do work, but this product is better and faster with true results.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this eye cream, it has almost no smell at all, as well as the fact it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all, unlike most eye creams do. Second favorite, all the wonderful natural ingredients, it really makes me feel good, and safe when using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Then come the results. Its takes a few weeks to really start noticing difference, but I can definetly tell you that within the first two days my eyes looked very well rested and almost bright. So happy with my new product, and won&#x27;t hesitate in getting my next bottle. Thanks Epicura! Finally an eye cream I can stick to.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend has more or less fallen in love with this eye cream, and pretty much demanded I write this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has no wrinkles or crow&#x27;s feet, but she does have trouble sleeping and gets noticeable puffiness and saggy pouches under her eyes because of it. She loved the other Epicura skin serums, so she went ahead and bought their eye cream to try to treat the under-the-eye issues. In just a few days, the eye cream tightened up the skin and drastically reduced the dark circles, even after a bout of crazy insomnia. She swears by it now.</li>
            <li> I have used other eye creams and have found this Epicura Eye cream to be as good or better than many of the very expensive department store products. I have very sensitive skin but this product has no odor, greasy residue or fragrance. It feels light and gentle on my skin. I noticed after just the first application my eyes were not as puffy and the dark circles under my eyes looked brighter. After using this creme everyday over the course of a couple weeks, I noticed the lines staring to smooth out and not looking nearly as defined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this to be the best price you will find anywhere for a product this effective. This product is very pleasant to use and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable, yet effective eye cream!</li>
            <li> Been using this product now for several months (3rd order just submitted) and I&#x27;m very pleased.  I&#x27;m a 40+ year old mom with 2 children under the age of 4, and I have a full time job.  I am not familiar with the words rest and sleep...this makes up for that.  I look refreshed and no longer have bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> No improvement, stings skin.</li>
            <li> This product is great to women with dark circles, crow&#x27;s feet and fine lines. Although this product might seem a little expensive buying Epicura means that you&#x27;ll never have to spend money on similar drugstore products again. Some brand name drugstore products can cost as much or more than Epicura and are less effective. Epicura leaves skin soft and moisturized. And the product is guaranteed so you&#x27;ve got nothing to lose by trying it, except the dark circles under your eyes.  Try Epicura today for softer, younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two months. It&#x27;s probably the best facial serum you can purchase at on amazon for anti-aging benefits. My two sun spots (one on each cheek) seem to have faded somewhat and my facial skin feels really soft and smooth. Of course you need to use this product along with Epicura Skin Rejuve Anti Aging Serum Moisturizer With Matrixyl 3000. ---love it!&lt;br /&gt;great birthday gift got Mom.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for awhile now. When I first apply, my puffy eyes don&#x27;t seem quite as puffy. That said, I have to reapply a few times daily as my puffy eyes reappear. Overall, pretty good.</li>
            <li> Love this eye cream...really helps keep eye area smooth and firm and helps with eye puffiness.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! No more puffy eyes or dark circles; the results are astounding! I use it day &amp; night for maximum benefit. My eyes feel rejuvenated! I use the entire line of products including the REJUVE, Anti-Aging Cream with Matrixyl and UPLIFT, Firming Cream for face &amp; neck with Retinol. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results! Even my husband says my skin looks 10 years younger. What attracted me most to this line was that it was made In USA with all natural ingredients and it is oil and paraben free. I have tried pricier products with little to no results. Epicura Skin works much better than any other products I have tried. It&#x27;s affordable, natural and you genuinely see results after a couple applications. This is my secret to flawless silky smooth skin. I guarantee you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this, along with the uplift face and neck cream, for the past week and so far am loving it. It&#x27;s super emollient without being greasy.</li>
            <li> I love the texture and the refreshing feeling that I get from this eye cream. I use 4 different eye drops for glaucoma and my eyelids were getting red and awful looking as a result of the eye drops.  This cream feels so good on my eyelids. I just started to use last friday march 14 and I already can feel the improvement.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s me.  I&#x27;ve tried all these anti-aging eye creams and they just don&#x27;t work for me.  It feels nice to put on, but doesn&#x27;t diminish puffiness.  I think the only thing that does diminish puffiness is, unfortunately, plastic surgery!  I don&#x27;t have dark circles under my eyes so maybe it works well for that.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT DO WHAT THEY CLAIM IT DOES. I PURCHASED THIS FOR UNDER EYE BAGS AND USED TWICE A DAY FOR 3 WEEKS WITH NOT ONE BIT OF RESULTS.&lt;br /&gt;THE ONE POSITIVE THING I WILL SAY IS THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS VERY GOOD. I HAD MANY EMAILS FROM THIS COMPANY ASKING MY OPINION OF MY RESULTS.&lt;br /&gt;I WILL BE RETURNING THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I actually got all of the facial creams in this line and decided to wait at least 6 weeks before reviewing. What a difference!, the small lines are disappearing and the under eye darkness has also lightened up considerably. I no longer have the bags under my eyes. I  no longer need as much concealer, I use it twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;I am 60 years old and look younger, people ask if I had some work done, this works for me!&lt;br /&gt;My only con is that when I received it the top was not on tight and when I used it  leaked , next time I will check it before use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice a day for two weeks. There is no minor or significant change to the puffiness under my eyes. I had hoped for some kind of results.  Will continue to use when product is used up. Will not purchase again unless there is a change.</li>
            <li> Great product, but not for the price of $49.95.  It does work, but upon discovering the price increase from $24.95 (sale price) to $35.95 to $49.95, it&#x27;s become unaffordable for me and I&#x27;ll be looking for something else that works just as well at a better price point.  The one star is for the price and not for the product.</li>
            <li> This is my second container and its working I&#x27;m using it for my bags under my eyes and around my mouth I have smile lines and it has brighten the lines which is really good and making the lines less deep.great product takes a while for results to show so be patient put it on twice a day.I put it on after I wash my face in the morning and at night when I wash my face again.</li>
            <li> I was actually thinking about eye lid surgery, Now I&#x27;m thinking if I&#x27;m diligent with this product I&#x27;ll be good. After about a week I started to see a real difference in the puffiness around my eyes. So far I love it and would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see the results from using this new product!</li>
            <li> The Serum seems old.  I found the content is very coagulated.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. my eyes look younger and refreshed. I am on a flexible work schedule - meaning I work when the company needs me to work. Resulting in an extremely irregular sleep pattern. After seven years of living like a college student without the party benefit, my skin started to show some wear. Hands and neck were easy to keep up, but no matter what I tried for my eyes I ended up being disappointed and discouraged. I have a very sensitive skin so I struggled with burning sensations, redness and just plain irritation. Or the product would just sit on top of my skin making the rest of my make up routine impossible. I&#x27;ve ordered the Eye promise about 3 weeks ago. It came fast. It took about a week of using it twice daily for the results being noticeable by people around me. This is still a major improvement compared to products I&#x27;ve tried. There&#x27;s no burning, or itching, no redness. Eye promise leaves the skin it touches bright and flexible. It absorbs quick, so I don&#x27;t have to add any time to my morning routine, the scent is unobtrusive and very subtle. Most important - it works! I am a believer and now that I&#x60;ve found it I&#x27;ll stick to it for as long as it works. One star down for the texture that&#x27;s a bit runny and makes for some rage outbursts when it ends up in the sink instead of my skin...</li>
            <li> I have terrible insomnia and because of that my undereye area is always puffy.  Nothing I have ever tried has helped despite the testimonials and advertisements that the products promote.  I tried this product and after about a week of using it there was a noticeable difference.  I&#x27;m definitely going to continue using it and I&#x27;m going to get some for my mother because she has the same under eye puffiness that I do (and the same insomnia-ugh!).  I&#x27;m thinking about getting some of the eye cream as well.  I received this to try in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t noticed any difference whatsoever yet</li>
            <li> I have been using the eyecream for almost 2 weeks now and have seen some changes, nothing dramatic but i think it will just take some time, im optimistic.  i dont care for the container as when i press down on the top to get a small amount of cream, it spits out a large quanity so i think i am wasting alot of it each time. it dosnt have control to have a nice flow even if i press very slowly, it just spits it out in a blob. maybe i have a defective bottle, dont know.</li>
            <li> If this product is used everyday like recommend u will see results.i only applied a little under eye.I started using it and I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for only a few days now and can already see a difference! I work full time, have a part time job and go to school full time, needless to say; I&#x27;m stressed and don&#x27;t get much sleep. I have developed bags under my eyes over the last few months. I notice that even after a few days of using this cream, the bags are getting smaller.  The texture of this serum is amazing. It feels cool when I put it on my bags and it helps wake me up some more! This product doesn&#x27;t have a lasting feeling like some others I have tried, either so that is a huge plus!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount to do an honest and unbiased review. Even though receiving it at a discount, I am going to be purchasing more for family and friends in the near future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been a little longer of using this product and I continue to still see a difference in the puffiness around my eyes!! I love it!</li>
            <li> Wonderful results in a matter of days.  Extremely effective in battling morning puffiness and allergy swelling.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with this one. Every time I used it my under eye  area and eyelid felt itchy and felt minimal burning sensation. I guess my skin was allergic to the product and I did not notice any  difference in the puffiness of my eye area even temporarily. I also bought the Body Merry  eye cream and this worked better on my eyes.</li>
            <li> Definitely helped with dark circles and puffiness around the eyes. Noticed a difference as soon as I started using it.</li>
            <li> I love this vitamin C serum for eyes. It&#x27;s not sticky going on, it&#x27;s more like a clear gel that absorbs quickly and it never stings my eye area.  I&#x27;m 45 and was getting a sunken look underneath my eyes, but my eyes looked less tired after a few days of using Eye Promise and the crow&#x27;s feet are definitely less deep after a few weeks of use.  I&#x27;ve already recommended it to my mother and girlfriends.</li>
            <li> I really like this light weight serum. It is a great moisturizer but I do not think it helps with dark circles which is what I bought if for. However I would still use it as wrinkle prevention</li>
            <li> I have noticed a tiny little change for the the better, and I may purchase it again. I plan to try some other products as well.</li>
            <li> The main problems, with this product, concern the packaging. First, you can&#x27;t see how much product is in the container. Second, and of great concern, you cannot possibly get a small, suitable amount out. I&#x27;ve spent way, way too much time trying to adapt the pressure I use to eject the serum. No matter how carefully or gently I apply pressure, this squirts out so much that I can apply to my whole face. So much waste! That translates to wasted money..I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks with no obvious difference and don&#x27;t know if I will have enough product left to be able to give it enough time to work, if, in fact, it does work.</li>
            <li> I have tried several eye creams, and while I know there is no miracle potion, as a licensed cosmetologist I have to say that I really love this product and will continue buying it! I have been using it for almost a month and have noticed the fine lines and beginning signs of crows feet soften noticeably. Also, they do not test on animals OR use parabens which are both important to me. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Item received quickly. Love this product! It really works!  Highly recommend product and seller</li>
            <li> Have not noticed any change in the puffiness around my eyes, haved used it every day since I got it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews. I&#x27;ve never really tried a product that I was excited enough about to do one! This is my favorite anti aging product I&#x27;ve ever tried!!! My eyelids are lifted and my crowsfeet have almost disappeared!!! My skin just keep getting better the longer I use it!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but this really did  instaneously take away my puffs &amp; circles..  I am glad I ttied this 1 because it actually worked as described...whuch is rare!!!..but now discontinued???....I WANT THIS BACK!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference at all.</li>
            <li> Great eye serum, and fairly priced.  I have been using it for a couple months and like it better than the other, more expensive products I have tried from Elemis, etc.</li>
            <li> Nah so so; what can I say a lie?</li>
            <li> I have tried everything to reduce under eye puffiness and nothing worked, until now!  Give it 4 weeks of day and night use and you will see a difference.</li>
            <li> I developed severe puffiness under my eyes several years ago.  I have no idea what brought this problem on and I feel like I have tried just about every product on the market to try and get rid of it.  I found this product through an Amazon search and it had great reviews so I decided to give it a try.  I have been using it for about two weeks and have noticed a major improvement.  I am 40 years old and on two separate occasions last month my 16 year old daughter and I were taken mistaken for sisters!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After purchasing my first bottle I received an email from the co-founder asking if i received my order and what I thought of it so far.  I am really impressed by this company as it seems that they are really taking the time to listen their customers.</li>
            <li> It feels kinda warm on my first application but somehow you could feel its working on the eye area, knowing my skin is not sensitive.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price, however after using it religously for more than six months it does not help with puffy eyes or bags as it claims. I have seen improvement as far as lines and wrinkles but the puffyness remains. Aging sucks, better to try reducing salt and water intake and not sleeping on your face ;)</li>
