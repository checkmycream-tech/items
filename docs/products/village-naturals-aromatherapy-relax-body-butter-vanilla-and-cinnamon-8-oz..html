            <li>What I liked best is the scent!</li>
            <li>Great to put on before bed</li>
            <li>LOVE it!!  </li>
            <li>but this one and the lavender chamomile are, to me, the most wonderful smelling!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s warm and spicy and yummy!</li>
            <li>I love the way this product feels and it smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>- oh, yes I was thrilled!  </li>
            <li>I picked this up at Target, and I am delighted with both the fragrance and the feel of the product.</li>
            <li>omg smells soooooooo good</li>
            <li>I loved this body butter.</li>
            <li>love, love, love!!!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>just ok!  </li>
            <li>Love putting this on in the winter!</li>
            <li>I love this !</li>
            <li>This stuff smells amazing, I want more!</li>
            <li>The moisture of this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>The relax aromatherapy has an amazing scent.</li>
            <li>I find that it covers nicely but that it does seem to coat the skin and not moisturize so well.  </li>
            <li>So it spreads really nicely, but it gives you the feeling of butter.</li>
            <li>The consistency of it is nice and creamy</li>
            <li>I do wish it was more cinnamon-y; it kind of makes me think of buttercream or something, like a version of vanilla, but</li>
            <li>The scent is gorgeous and rich and my husband always comments on it...</li>
            <li>It is also a great body butter in that it does not feel heavy on my skin, but still seals in the moisture to keep my skin looking a feeling wonderful since here in Colorado</li>
            <li>Non greasy and goes on very smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have no idea, but this is very moisturizing, non-greasy, beautifully scented and I enjoyed it.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, but the first ingredient is water!  </li>
            <li>And the scent lasts without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading the review below and I&#x27;m so glad that I did.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s cheaper and the consistency of this body butter is so much more luxurious than BBW.</li>
            <li>My husband comments on the lovely scent every time I use it.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE that one too.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure where to buy it</li>
            <li>I like them better</li>
            <li>Love it on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Love the combination of vanilla and cinnamon...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this every day, I use it as a treat and really love it.</li>
            <li>And I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>Left my skin feeling very smooth and it smelled great.</li>
            <li>I picked up four different butters by this company, and I am so happy with All of them...</li>
            <li>The scent of this creme is simply fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I think anyone could enjoy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>The consistency of this body butter is PERFECT- smooth, rich, and creamy (not souffle-like like a lot of body butters I&#x27;ve tried in the past).</li>
            <li>have ordered more since my first order.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not expensive either, so that makes it even better.</li>
            <li>I had very dry cracked feet this summer and this stuff worked great on them.  </li>
            <li>so I zapped her old container with my handy Amazon app, and found this..</li>
            <li>It is my first time using this product, but definitely will buy it again; smells very good and leaves my skin very soft!</li>
            <li>Its not extremely hard butter, it&#x27;s more on the creamy side.</li>
            <li>The texture is lovely and makes my skin soft all day, but the scent tends to dissipate fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Regardless, it deserves to be called \\&quot;aromatherapy\\&quot; since it will totally calm you after a hectic day.</li>
            <li>and I admit I love smelling myself, after moisturizing my bod  with this soft and smooooth butter.</li>
            <li>I can only compare this to jojoba and coconut oils which I find don&#x27;t leave a coating residue, are absorbed nicely and moisturize.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing and has a slightly sweet scent.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s nice and thick and leaves my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>Smells like more vanilla than cinnamon, but it&#x27;s nice smell doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>Also is quite moisturizing &amp; gets you all soft &amp; smooth</li>
            <li>This smells exactly like</li>
            <li>It is a bit greasy at first</li>
            <li>After bath or shower it is so pretty to smell.</li>
            <li>June 2016 - Okay, this is my THIRD time buying this.  </li>
            <li>I love body butter and especially at night before bed like to apply it.</li>
            <li>I bet we couldn&#x27;t have done better if we were actually buying from the store!</li>
            <li>I have ordered many different brands of body butter, but prefer The Village Company.  </li>
            <li>I use this at the end of the day, and it really makes me feel ready for a relaxed evening.  </li>
            <li>It is very softening</li>
            <li>It smells heavenly &amp; i really do feel relaxed when wearing it.</li>
            <li>this body butter glides on like silk, the skin just soaks it up, it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, soft fragrance, worth the price...</li>
            <li>The whole bathroom lights up with the scent.  </li>
            <li>however it leaves my skin really shiny and glossy looking.</li>
            <li>I much prefer Boots brand (mango and nectarine are my recommendations).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a super creamy formula, and a scoopful on my fingertips is enough to cover my whole body.</li>
            <li>, it works its magic on rough and dry skin perfectly, leaving a velvety touch behind!</li>
            <li>I used this on my belly while pregnant, along with stretch mark cream and only got 1 stretch mark.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why it has been rated so high.</li>
            <li>I usually do not like &amp;#34;Vanilla&amp;#34; scents, but this is a whole new story.</li>
            <li>This body butter way out performed the better known brands at the fraction of the cost and the smell is stuble and long lasting!</li>
            <li>I try to avoid them as these products are absorbed through the skin so not much different than eating them.  </li>
            <li>Nice, subtle fragrance, which is what I like...</li>
            <li>This is a very soft vanilla and cinnamon scent and applying it is so relaxing for me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t live near a Walmart or Target so bought on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It is nice and thick too!</li>
            <li>but it dries in about 10 minutes, leaving my skin soft but not slippery.</li>
            <li>I keep it near the sink for after hand washing:</li>
            <li>so far I have tested it to about 10 below in Colorado,</li>
            <li>Highly recommended and I have dry skin.</li>
            <li>This is a nice body butter; not as scented or thick as The Body Shop&#x27;s, but it&#x27;s half the price, so you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>I have used jojoba and coconut oil on my skin for quite a long time but was craving something with a natural fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend getting this lotion if you have dry skin!!!</li>

            <li> I would highly recommend getting this lotion if you have dry skin!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be using this all fall and winter, since my skin tends to get really dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t compare to Tree Hut products which I&#x27;ve used for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The product is a chemical cocktail with a few natural ingredients, similar to the majority of other products out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> our air is VERY dry.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way which my pocket loves.</li>
            <li> (I use it about every other day, after my shower).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use one or the other of these two every day.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try the other aromatherapy products.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cream, and was disappointed when it could not be found in the stores.  </li>
            <li> Just the right consistency for what I was looking for not too thick or too thin.</li>
            <li> This moisturizes extremely well and makes my skin as soft as a baby&#x27;s behind.</li>
            <li> I will check The Village Company for other products like this and when my mom runs out again!</li>
            <li> No more dry cracked feet</li>
            <li> no problems that means less medication.  </li>
            <li> a little sticky  think I will stick to delon products  </li>
            <li> Cozy Autumn Vanilla</li>
            <li> ppg18/18 dimethicone,xanthan gum, diazolidinyl urea, iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, tetradosium edta, orange 4, green</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not over-powering or heavy at all.</li>
            <li> I usually see these in the cosmetic section of Target</li>
            <li> Since I have not been using products with fragrances, I found this to be a little sickening at first.  </li>
            <li> Can hardly wait for it to arrive.  </li>
            <li> The scent of cinnamon was a bit too subtle for my taste</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s overpriced for this product and expensive shipping.  </li>
            <li> If my legs get cold it is extremely painful.  </li>
    </ol>

The scent is gorgeous and rich and my husband always comments on it...and I admit I love smelling myself, after moisturizing my bod  with this soft and smooooth butter. I go into the shower looking forward to massaging this in, afterwards! I use this at the end of the day, and it really makes me feel ready for a relaxed evening.

            <li> My boyfriend is a big fan of vanilla, and I read somewhere that the scent of cinnamon is supposed to be... er... stimulating for guys, so when I saw this cinnamon-vanilla body butter, it seemed like a win-win! This stuff is great! It&#x27;s a super creamy formula, and a scoopful on my fingertips is enough to cover my whole body. It is very softening and I&#x27;ve not noticed any breakouts on my body from it (I use it about every other day, after my shower).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is warm and delicious. It&#x27;s not a summer scent, but I don&#x27;t care. It smells darn good! I do wish it was more cinnamon-y; it kind of makes me think of buttercream or something, like a version of vanilla, but not what I would call cinnamon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, it deserves to be called \\&quot;aromatherapy\\&quot; since it will totally calm you after a hectic day. And the scent lasts without being overwhelming. Love it!</li>
            <li> This body butter way out performed the better known brands at the fraction of the cost and the smell is stuble and long lasting!</li>
            <li> omg smells soooooooo good</li>
            <li> It smells heavenly &amp; i really do feel relaxed when wearing it. Also is quite moisturizing &amp; gets you all soft &amp; smooth</li>
            <li> Nice, subtle fragrance, which is what I like...I dislike over powering ingredients...this body butter glides on like silk, the skin just soaks it up, it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, soft fragrance, worth the price...I would definitely order it again..</li>
            <li> I have a list of the toxic chemicals that are often used in personal care products.  I try to avoid them as these products are absorbed through the skin so not much different than eating them.  I needed a change from jojoba oil so decided to look for something different.  I have used jojoba and coconut oil on my skin for quite a long time but was craving something with a natural fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, the ingredients were not listed so I emailed the company who for some reason said they couldn&#x27;t tell me I would have to go to Walmart or Target and see the list there?  I don&#x27;t live near a Walmart or Target so bought on Amazon.  The product is a chemical cocktail with a few natural ingredients, similar to the majority of other products out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the ingredients if you like to know what you are buying before you buy it ... purified water, cocos nucifera oil, glycerin, ospropyl palmitate, cetearyl alcohol, gglyceryl stearate, cetyl alcohol, dimethicone, myristyl myristate, myristyl laurate, peg 100 stearate, fragrance, prunus american kernal oil, butyrospermum parkil-shea, cinamomum cassia bark extract, corylus avellano hazel seed extract, vanilla planifolia fruit extract, sodium polyacrylate, cyclopentasiloxane, trideceth-6, peg/ppg18/18 dimethicone,xanthan gum, diazolidinyl urea, iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, tetradosium edta, orange 4, green 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try the product but won&#x27;t continue to use it because of the ingredients but I had to try it. Since I have not been using products with fragrances, I found this to be a little sickening at first.  I find that it covers nicely but that it does seem to coat the skin and not moisturize so well.  I had used it on my legs and the next shower you could tell there was something still on the skin, a coating?  I can only compare this to jojoba and coconut oils which I find don&#x27;t leave a coating residue, are absorbed nicely and moisturize.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the review below and I&#x27;m so glad that I did. This smells exactly like Bath &amp; Body Works Cozy Autumn Vanilla but it&#x27;s cheaper and the consistency of this body butter is so much more luxurious than BBW. This is a very soft vanilla and cinnamon scent and applying it is so relaxing for me. The consistency of this body butter is PERFECT- smooth, rich, and creamy (not souffle-like like a lot of body butters I&#x27;ve tried in the past). This moisturizes extremely well and makes my skin as soft as a baby&#x27;s behind. It is a bit greasy at first but it dries in about 10 minutes, leaving my skin soft but not slippery. I like wearing this under my vanilla-based perfumes. I&#x27;ll definitely be using this all fall and winter, since my skin tends to get really dry. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this is that it&#x27;s in a tub, so I feel like I need to sterilize my hands before I can dip them in the jar. I didn&#x27;t take a lippie away though, since all body butters are packaged the same way.</li>
            <li> This body butter smells so wonderful!!  My husband comments on the lovely scent every time I use it.  Also, it&#x27;s nice and thick and leaves my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> I used this on my belly while pregnant, along with stretch mark cream and only got 1 stretch mark. This stuff smells amazing, I want more!</li>
            <li> It is my first time using this product, but definitely will buy it again; smells very good and leaves my skin very soft!</li>
            <li> Its not extremely hard butter, it&#x27;s more on the creamy side. So it spreads really nicely, but it gives you the feeling of butter. And it smells great!</li>
            <li> love, love, love!!! Could ask for a better product!!! I would highly recommend getting this lotion if you have dry skin!!!</li>
            <li> The scent of this creme is simply fabulous.  This is the second time buying this product. I usually do not like &amp;#34;Vanilla&amp;#34; scents, but this is a whole new story. Maybe its the Cinnamon or... I have no idea, but this is very moisturizing, non-greasy, beautifully scented and I enjoyed it.  Can hardly wait for it to arrive.  I keep it near the sink for after hand washing: Fabulous!  After bath or shower it is so pretty to smell. The whole bathroom lights up with the scent.  Highly recommended and I have dry skin. I think anyone could enjoy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update June 2016 - Okay, this is my THIRD time buying this.  Lol</li>
            <li> Great company and all aromas are wonderful.</li>
            <li> LOVE it!!  So smoothe, non greasy, heavenly scent!!  Terrific body moisturizer. Incredibly soothing!  Will definitely continue buying it.  I hope Village Naturals will bring back the Aromatherapy Soothe Rosemary and Peppermint Body Butter.  I LOVE that one too.  I use one or the other of these two every day.  The best ever!!!</li>
            <li> I love body butter and especially at night before bed like to apply it. The moisture of this product is amazing. A little goes a long way which my pocket loves. The relax aromatherapy has an amazing scent. Can&#x27;t wait to try the other aromatherapy products.</li>
            <li> This is a nice body butter; not as scented or thick as The Body Shop&#x27;s, but it&#x27;s half the price, so you get what you pay for.  The texture is lovely and makes my skin soft all day, but the scent tends to dissipate fairly quickly.  i wish the cinnamon/vanilla aroma would stick around longer!  I went through the jar in about a month using it every day after the shower.  I might repurchase, or I might just stick with my go-to Tree Hut body butters.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that it was equal parts vanilla and cinnamon scented. It turns out to be all vanilla, I can&#x27;t pick up on the cinnamon at all actually. The consistency of it is nice and creamy however it leaves my skin really shiny and glossy looking. I much prefer Boots brand (mango and nectarine are my recommendations). I usually see these in the cosmetic section of Target</li>
            <li> My mother loves this stuff..  I wasn&#x27;t sure where to buy it so I zapped her old container with my handy Amazon app, and found this.. Great price. I bet we couldn&#x27;t have done better if we were actually buying from the store! I will check The Village Company for other products like this and when my mom runs out again!</li>
            <li> I had very dry cracked feet this summer and this stuff worked great on them.  No more dry cracked feet</li>
            <li> just ok!  a little sticky  think I will stick to delon products  I like them better</li>
            <li> I bought this to help combat itchy, winter skin, which is does. What I liked best is the scent! It&#x27;s warm and spicy and yummy!</li>
            <li> Love it on my skin.  Non greasy and goes on very smooth.  will definitely buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;Glad I found this Body Butter</li>
            <li> Love the combination of vanilla and cinnamon...have ordered more since my first order.  I have ordered many different brands of body butter, but prefer The Village Company.  Just the right consistency for what I was looking for not too thick or too thin.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but the first ingredient is water!  It&#x27;s overpriced for this product and expensive shipping.  It doesn&#x27;t compare to Tree Hut products which I&#x27;ve used for a long time.  I don&#x27;t know why it has been rated so high.</li>
            <li> This cream smells delicious! It&#x27;s very moisturizing and has a slightly sweet scent. It&#x27;s not over-powering or heavy at all. It is nice and thick too! I don&#x27;t use this every day, I use it as a treat and really love it. It&#x27;s not expensive either, so that makes it even better.</li>
            <li> I loved this body butter. Left my skin feeling very smooth and it smelled great. The scent of cinnamon was a bit too subtle for my taste so I added some cinnamon oil to it.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product feels and it smells wonderful! I use it on my Reflexology Clients feet and use it on my hands.</li>
            <li> Smells like more vanilla than cinnamon, but it&#x27;s nice smell doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Love putting this on in the winter!</li>
            <li> I love this ! Great to put on before bed</li>
            <li> I deal with Fibromyalgia.  If my legs get cold it is extremely painful.  This stuff works so that no matter the temperature and so far I have tested it to about 10 below in Colorado, no problems that means less medication.  That&#x27;s a good thing!  It is also a great body butter in that it does not feel heavy on my skin, but still seals in the moisture to keep my skin looking a feeling wonderful since here in Colorado our air is VERY dry.  And I love the smell.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cream, and was disappointed when it could not be found in the stores.  Imagine my surprise when I found it on Amazon - oh, yes I was thrilled!  Not only does this cream smell divine, it works its magic on rough and dry skin perfectly, leaving a velvety touch behind!</li>
