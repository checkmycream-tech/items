            <li>Last week, I used this stuff for the first time.  </li>
            <li>It came on time and was the exact same thing sold in the salon.</li>
            <li>This keeps my skin soft and helps increase my tan when using a tanning bed.  </li>

            <li> 5 stars across the board. Smells great works great. Visible true results after first use. in response to other purchasers receiving expired lotion, I received a product that had a date that was expired also. I contacted the manufacturer and they responded within 24 hours.their response was: the date on the bottom of the bottle is the manufacture date and code. product does not expire  until after it&#x27;s been open for the stated expiration time frame (look for icon on bottle that looks like a cap with the numbers 12 18 or 24 on it)</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful. Light weight and non greasy</li>
            <li> I like the smell and feel of the lotion. Great product.</li>
            <li> Really like the lotion and it smells so good!!!</li>
            <li> The bronzer doesn&#x27;t do anything in this product</li>
            <li> Smelled great at first but after tanning I smelled like I had self tanning lotion on. Not happy about that. Never had this problem with Designer Skin products before...</li>
            <li> smells great, works great</li>
            <li> This item is watery, I don&#x27;t feel this is a genuine designer skin lotion. Disappointed</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. The scent is amazing. It is officially listed as pineapple prosecco but, it is fruity and light. No DHA after tan smell, just yummy fruity goodness. I love this lotion. It delivers a dark amazing tan with no orangeness. I would definitely re-purchase this lotion. My amazon order went perfectly. The lotion was great, in perfect condition, and arrived very quickly. Very happy about the purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! Smells nice, and leaves the skin feeling fresh &amp; hydrated!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several Designer Skin bronzers and have loved them.  Last week, I used this stuff for the first time.  When I met my husband for dinner after tanning, I thought I smelled that hideous after-tan smell on me, but I though, &amp;#34;it couldn&#x27;t be.  This has never happened to me before except with a self tanner.&amp;#34;  My husband started commenting that something smelled like burnt peanuts.  After that, I couldn&#x27;t enjoy our meal either, cuz it was kinda grossing me out.  As we were leaving the restaurant, some lady said to her friend, &amp;#34;do you smell peanut oil?&amp;#34;  Ugh!  Sooo embarrassing.  I&#x27;m dumping the rest of this bottle out.</li>
            <li> Great smell and gentle bronzers give you an excellent ta experience. Good for beginners.</li>
            <li> Great smell before and after tan, really helps my tan develop quickly and so much cheaper than the $80 the salon charges for the same product!</li>
            <li> havent used it enough to post a review</li>
            <li> This lotion has a great fresh smell. Nothing worse than leaving the tanning salon smelling like sweat and heavily perfumed product. I love citrus and this lotion has a nice light pineapple scent. It isn&#x27;t heavy or greasy. Its the same product you can buy in the tanning salon, just $80 cheaper.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE SMELL OF THIS LOTION - FRUITY AND DOESNT GIVE YOU THAT STICKY FEELING AFTER YOU LAY !!!</li>
            <li> Came faat, authentic, smells so amazing. Not expired like most lotion you&#x27;d buy off of the internet! It came with a cute little eyeshadow pallet as well, how cute lol. Good results as well :)</li>
            <li> This is bronzer goes on light and doesn&#x27;t over power your skin.  Just the right amount of bronzer to not over due it. And I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Good tanning bed lotion at a good price</li>
            <li> Love the smell. The results were definitely nice.</li>
            <li> love the results. the smell is on the fruity side but not my favorite</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this pre-tan bronzing lotion.  This keeps my skin soft and helps increase my tan when using a tanning bed.  This was a much better price than at the tanning salon!  I recommend using the Juicy After Tan Extender Lotion as well with this product to maintain your tan and moisture in your skin.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff! It came on time and was the exact same thing sold in the salon. It smells amazing and does what it is supposed to do. After using it twice in the tanning bed, I can already see my skin darker. I would definitely recommend to a friend and will be reordering at some point.</li>
            <li> Love love love it! 😊👍 great product and on time delivery! Thanks</li>
            <li> Smells amazing!!! Love the feeling of the lotion. Goes on nice and doesn&#x27;t leave streaks. You don&#x27;t smell like dead skin after you tan either.&lt;br /&gt;Prob one of my fav lotions I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> I used a sample of this at my tanning salon and loved it. Bought this on Amazon because it&#x27;s about 50% cheaper! Great for fair skinned ladies, and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Great smell and works perfectly.  I don&#x27;t tan more than 8 times a year but when I do, it is usually a &amp;#34;California Cocktail&amp;#34; which this product was made for.  The spray tan comes out very even and stays longer.</li>

            <li> This is terrible lotion! It was VERY runny, it drips off my hand when I pour it out. The scent is like sweaty pineapples. It made my skin super sticky. I should have known given that the first ingredient is pineapple juice. It&#x27;s going back...</li>
            <li> love this stuff. This seller does not mess around. 100% satisfied!</li>
            <li> Great smell, good bronzer. Long lasting bottle. Great for tanning bed</li>
            <li> I found this lotion at a hair salon, it smelt amazing but had a price tag of $42.00 so I checked Amazon right away and found it for under $30. I ordered it and it arrived very quick. It looked just like the bottle at the salon but it didn&#x27;t have that stronge amazing smell and was vey runny. This was my first time to lay In a tanning bed this year and you could not even tell I used anything.</li>
