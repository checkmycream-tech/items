    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The only complaint was a broken cap</li>
            <li> Bought the 3.4oz of this version at a actual VS store and regret buying it. I spray it on me between 6 and 8 times each timeout wear it.  After an hour or so I can&#x27;t smell it. After two hours my friends have to get very very close to barely smell it.  It smells good but does not stay long unlike other good fragrances I have.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with a cologne. I get compliments all the time about how good I smell.</li>
            <li> Pros: Amazing smell&lt;br /&gt;Fairly priced&lt;br /&gt;One bottle goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The only con is that the scent does not last all day.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this cologne.</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t look good you sure can smell good.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered on time. It was a birthday gift for a friend and he love it.</li>
            <li> Very honest ... Refund 100% on damage leak bottle very quick.&lt;br /&gt;For sure its trustable and will buy again &amp;again</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, my boyfriend Loved it.</li>
            <li> Works great everyone was complementing me on it very nice</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my boyfriend a year ago. Even now, I still walk into a room after he has applied this scent and nearly shiver. It&#x27;s a sexy, woodsy, peppery smell that everyone will notice and compliment. Never had anyone pass up the chance to tell him how yummy he smells when he&#x27;s wearing this. Worth every single penny you&#x27;ll spend on it.</li>
            <li> I bought this amazing smelling cologne for my boyfriend and we both absolutely love it. We have also received several compliments from others inquiring what scent he is wearing. Definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This product is very good and it I love it....</li>
            <li> this VS Platinum ranks up there in my top 3 favorites! women love it! Guys in a relationship. Beware!! This cologne will get you lots of complements! other women complimenting you in front of your girlfriend..... lets just say there could be some jealousy in the air ha ha. Im the type of guy who loves to smell good where ever i go. i own over 40 scents for all seasons of the year and this one is a &#x27;Must own&#x27;. what makes it so good and why women love it so much is that. it was created by &#x27;Women For Men&#x27;. ......stop reading and just buy and you&amp;#34;ll see!</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne after reading other positive reviews and thought since they liked it I would buy 3.4oz for small difference on 1.7oz bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Big mistake.&lt;br /&gt;Twenty minutes after putting it on I can&#x27;t smell it and both my nostrils work just fine.  I ask a friend about an hour later and she had to get her nose practically in my shirt to smell anything.&lt;br /&gt;Bottle weighs 11.25oz making it heavy.  I was able to weigh bottle after snapping off spray neck and pouring contents into two smaller lighter weight spray bottles.&lt;br /&gt;Save or waste your money on this cologne.&lt;br /&gt; It is unlikely, more than unlikely, I would ever purchase this cologne again, of course unless I met Kate Upton and she loved this cologne.</li>
            <li> Glad I got this for my bf he smells amazing ❤️👍</li>
            <li> My wife got me this colonge and she loves it when I use it, not to mention all the good compliments it get</li>
            <li> Good price for this size bottle shipped very fast and is a good smelling cologne.</li>
            <li> Citrus overtones and very crisp a nice addition to my collection. I keep this inside my vehicle to refresh myself when meeting clients.Its pretty strong at first so go easy on it but it dissipates quickly. The bottle is nice and the sprayer hasn&#x27;t broken yet.</li>
            <li> Great scent!  A favorite of my wife.</li>
            <li> At the moment I received this product I was excited. This Cologne has an outstanding scent that I absolute can appreciate. The customer service this distributor has is admirable. They are respectable and surely recommend further purchases.</li>
            <li> Great smell, lasts through a 12 hour work day</li>
