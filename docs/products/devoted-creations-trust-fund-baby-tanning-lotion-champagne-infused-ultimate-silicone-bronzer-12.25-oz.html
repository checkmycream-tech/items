            <li>it is more &amp;#34;perfumy&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t have the island coconut smell that most lotions do.  </li>
            <li>This Is one of my favorite tanning lotions...</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t want to leave the tanning bed smelling like a man however, once you have it on for awhile it does get better.</li>
            <li>I liked the smell, it was very light and fresh and I did not smell like burned skin afterwards.</li>

            <li>New product at a good price.  </li>
            <li>if important</li>
            <li>/&gt;Decently priced&lt;br /&gt;Nice, smooth tan&lt;br /&gt;Comes w/cute, detachable keychain</li>
            <li>; it leaves your skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It smells absolutley wonderful &amp; it makes me tan so dark!!</li>
            <li>I have spent way too much money trying to find the perfect tanning lotion</li>
            <li>Gave me GREAT color, can definitely tell after the first use.</li>
            <li>First off, I&#x27;d like to say that the smell is to die for; sweet but not too strong.</li>
            <li>After testing this out and a couple others..and a full bottle of extreme situation (smells great)</li>
            <li>Another great thing is this tanning lotion lasts a lot longer than all the other lotions.</li>
            <li>has a great smell, good bronzers and helps develop a great base tan!</li>
            <li>I have been tanning for years and have used MANY MANY different lotions, but this by far has been my favorite.</li>
            <li>Devoted Creations has been my new favorite brand after using Designer Skin for years.</li>
            <li>which is great because my legs don&#x27;t tend to get very dark.</li>
            <li>but I have really great silky soft firm skin. :)</li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift, impressed with the extras that came in the package and it arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>The price made it definitely worth buying.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definetly worth buying</li>
            <li>It gets me darker pretty quick and will keep using this till the bottles gone .</li>
            <li>It also has a bronzer that works right away</li>
            <li>The small in amazing and the shimmer is even better.</li>
            <li>The scent is very similar to the \\&quot;Viva La Juicy\\&quot; perfume, and gives an AWESOME dark tan!</li>
            <li>it smells good and it is half the price that they sell it for in tanning salons.</li>
            <li>and I love the extra hint of color you get from it after applying, the color lasts until you shower.</li>
            <li>The bottle is pretty.</li>
            <li>I feel like it soaks in pretty well and doesn&#x27;t sit on your skin.</li>
            <li>I really like the way it smells too!</li>
            <li>The only thing I dont like about this lotion is the smell; it&#x27;s not awful</li>
            <li>I have worked at numerous tanning salons with a wide variety of lotions and this is my go to tanning lotion for beginners and experienced girls.</li>
            <li>I actually smell good for hours after tanning, but everyone tans differently.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this lotion to a girl that wants to smell pretty on a date or at the club.</li>
            <li>I felt like I hit a certain point and couldn&#x27;t get any darker.</li>
            <li>It is a very light brown color that has minimal bronzing agents in it.</li>
            <li>I paid $60 for this at the tanning salon which in my opinion is way to much for any lotion</li>
            <li>Your money would be better spent on Paint</li>
            <li>Very girly.  </li>
            <li>They really need to make this a fragrance.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I feel like I use more of this than of other tanning lotions...</li>
            <li>I love this tanning lotion, however, I am definitely not willing to pay the retail pricing for it.</li>
            <li>It has a slight shimmer too, which I love.</li>
            <li>I like this particular lotion because of the scent.  </li>
            <li>; so i tried it again on my next tanning session and then right after i got out of the bed i just gave my bottle to the sales attendant and told her &amp;#34;just</li>
            <li>I poured through forums and discovered this has all the added benefits that I was searching for and smells identical to High Drama.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this seller and this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a thick consistency which is nice.</li>
            <li>It helps boost your color, feels silky going on and smells incredible, rather like a delicate perfume (not like a typical tanning lotion).</li>
            <li>It was the first actual bottle I purchased.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t enhanced my tan that much as far as I can tell</li>
            <li>It is a silicone based lotion, so it goes on very very smoothly and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>This lotion is creamy and applies really well, not much bronzer, smell is alright, decent color, overpriced, did not contain shimmer as claimed by others.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve definitely used equal or better quality tanning lotion for half the price.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d usually forget to wash my face until before bed many hours later.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this lotion...and here on Amazon it is about half the price that my tanning salon wants me to pay!</li>
            <li>and this is a pretty good lotion to start with to get a natural base tan.</li>
            <li>I am naturally pastey white</li>
            <li>After tanning i couldnt bare the smell of it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very light skinned and aftee using this and tanning a few times I am very dark</li>
            <li>so I can still look really tan without having to use a dark bronzer every time I go tanning.</li>
            <li>It really gets you dark.</li>
            <li>One small issue I had with this lotion is that it causes blemishes on my face if I don&#x27;t wash it off right after tanning.</li>

            <li> I poured through forums and discovered this has all the added benefits that I was searching for and smells identical to High Drama.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this seller and this product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick consistency which is nice.</li>
            <li> It helps boost your color, feels silky going on and smells incredible, rather like a delicate perfume (not like a typical tanning lotion).</li>
            <li> It was the first actual bottle I purchased.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t enhanced my tan that much as far as I can tell</li>
            <li> It is a silicone based lotion, so it goes on very very smoothly and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This lotion is creamy and applies really well, not much bronzer, smell is alright, decent color, overpriced, did not contain shimmer as claimed by others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely used equal or better quality tanning lotion for half the price.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d usually forget to wash my face until before bed many hours later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this lotion...and here on Amazon it is about half the price that my tanning salon wants me to pay!</li>
            <li> and this is a pretty good lotion to start with to get a natural base tan.</li>
            <li> I am naturally pastey white</li>
            <li> After tanning i couldnt bare the smell of it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very light skinned and aftee using this and tanning a few times I am very dark</li>
            <li> so I can still look really tan without having to use a dark bronzer every time I go tanning.</li>
            <li> It really gets you dark.</li>
            <li> One small issue I had with this lotion is that it causes blemishes on my face if I don&#x27;t wash it off right after tanning.</li>
            <li> I was nervous at first because most like to advise lotions with heavy bronzers and bad smells.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would suggest leaving this on for as long as you can before showering.</li>
            <li> The body-fit complex really does make a difference, it helped firm the skin on my \\&quot;back-</li>
            <li> This is a decent lotion but not nearly as good as Millenium or Designer Skins silicone bronzers.  </li>
            <li> The only down side is that it doesn&#x27;t get you as dark as some of the other tanning products that I have used.</li>
            <li> The only complaint that I have about this lotion is the smell-</li>
            <li> it Black by Millenium or</li>
            <li> Black 20X by Designer Skin</li>
            <li> I like to use it in tandem with Devoted Creations Code Select Black Bronzer</li>
            <li> No streaks, no brown hands, and because its a silicone formalization, you end up using less because it goes on</li>
            <li> I was using High Drama by Devoted Creations for a few months and unfortunately ran out of it.</li>
            <li> and I usually don&#x27;t tan well.</li>
            <li> I have used almost the entire bottle and found that it works well if you&#x27;re a casual or begining tanner.</li>
            <li> It is a luxurious thick lotion.</li>
            <li> Buy it and you will not be disappointed.</li>

            <li> I have used almost the entire bottle and found that it works well if you&#x27;re a casual or begining tanner. I liked the smell, it was very light and fresh and I did not smell like burned skin afterwards. The body-fit complex really does make a difference, it helped firm the skin on my \\&quot;back-side\\&quot;. I also liked that the bronzer has a shimmer in it.&lt;br /&gt;  The only down side is that it doesn&#x27;t get you as dark as some of the other tanning products that I have used. I am naturally pastey white and this is a pretty good lotion to start with to get a natural base tan. If you are an avid tanner this lotion might not be the best one for you. I felt like I hit a certain point and couldn&#x27;t get any darker.</li>
            <li> I loved that I could purchase this product on-line - it smells good and it is half the price that they sell it for in tanning salons.</li>
            <li> Gave me GREAT color, can definitely tell after the first use. Also smells absolutely wonderful</li>
            <li> I just started getting my tan on for the year so I wanted a lotion to help accelerate the process. I paid $60 for this at the tanning salon which in my opinion is way to much for any lotion but that&#x27;s beside the point. I like this lotion a lot. Ive been using it for about a month it smells great, goes on smoothly, and leaves your skin feeling really silky. It gives you a hint of color but not streaky or orange. I have personally had no problems with ATO (after tan odor) using this lotion I actually smell good for hours after tanning, but everyone tans differently. This lotions is great for the skin and I love the extra hint of color you get from it after applying, the color lasts until you shower. I like the firming properties of the lotion as well. It hasn&#x27;t enhanced my tan that much as far as I can tell but I have really great silky soft firm skin. :)</li>
            <li> A friend at the tanning salon recommended this.  I am not a Devoted Creations fan, and I am still not.  This is a decent lotion but not nearly as good as Millenium or Designer Skins silicone bronzers.  Your money would be better spent on Paint it Black by Millenium or Black 20X by Designer Skin</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift, impressed with the extras that came in the package and it arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> My tanning salon sells only devoted creations.  I bought a sample of this the other day and it smelled awesome before the tanning session.  Very girly.  After tanning i couldnt bare the smell of it.  to me, it didnt smell anything like it did beforehand.  I will not be buying a bottle of this.  After testing this out and a couple others..and a full bottle of extreme situation (smells great) i will be going back to designer skin.  more results.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion was recommended to me by the consultant at the tanning salon. I was nervous at first because most like to advise lotions with heavy bronzers and bad smells. However, this lotion was quite amazing. It smells great coming out of the bottle and does not smell like after tan. Also, it has bronzers but not too many so it does not stain the skin and does not leave some areas darker than others. Another great thing is this tanning lotion lasts a lot longer than all the other lotions. I have worked at numerous tanning salons with a wide variety of lotions and this is my go to tanning lotion for beginners and experienced girls.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion !! Smells amazing</li>
            <li> If you like Juicy Couture perfume, then this lotion is awesome. I like to use it when I&#x27;m going to go out later that night and want to smell &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34;. It also has a bronzer that works right away which is great because my legs don&#x27;t tend to get very dark. However, if you want a lotion that will progressively make you darker, then this isn&#x27;t one to buy. I like to use it in tandem with Devoted Creations Code Select Black Bronzer so I can still look really tan without having to use a dark bronzer every time I go tanning.</li>
            <li> I always buy my lotion online... I always look to buy from THE TANMAN... always the best deals, always on-time, always a great product!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite indoor tanning lotion. The scent is very similar to the \\&quot;Viva La Juicy\\&quot; perfume, and gives an AWESOME dark tan! Will continue to purchase this product from amazon.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion. It is a good smelling lotion that doesn&#x27;t make you stink after tanning. I thought it made my skin very smooth at applying. I liked this lotion.</li>
            <li> Best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. It smells great. I&#x27;m very light skinned and aftee using this and tanning a few times I am very dark and I usually don&#x27;t tan well.</li>
            <li> Love this tanning lotion. Smells great, applies smooth, and helps give a great color tan!</li>
            <li> This lotion is okay. The bottle is pretty. It&#x27;s a thick consistency which is nice. It glides on. The only complaint that I have about this lotion is the smell- it&#x27;s just so...PRETTY. like someone dumped a bottle of ralph lauren all over me. it&#x27;s just too much, it&#x27;s overwhelming. I thought &amp;#34;hey maybe I could give it another chance&amp;#34; so i tried it again on my next tanning session and then right after i got out of the bed i just gave my bottle to the sales attendant and told her &amp;#34;just do something with this please i can&#x27;t handle the smell&amp;#34;............I would recommend this lotion to a girl that wants to smell pretty on a date or at the club.</li>
            <li> love this lotion! has a great smell, good bronzers and helps develop a great base tan! would recommend to beginning tanners!</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling stuff I have ever gotten ahold of. I don&#x27;t tan a lot, but my friends do. All of theirs haven&#x27;t smelled as good as this one. I am fair skinned, and just began tanning. I love it, and I wish I could just wear it around all day. We&#x27;ll see what happens as my tan progresses but I definitely would recommend this to anyone asking.</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion! It smells great and has natural bronzers but doesn&#x27;t look streaky. The color of the lotion itself is brown. It has a slight shimmer too, which I love. I feel like I use more of this than of other tanning lotions...I feel like it soaks in pretty well and doesn&#x27;t sit on your skin. One small issue I had with this lotion is that it causes blemishes on my face if I don&#x27;t wash it off right after tanning. Sometimes I go tanning over my lunch and I&#x27;d usually forget to wash my face until before bed many hours later. I simply bought a travel size face wash that I keep in my purse now...problem solved. My last tanning lotion with bronzer would leave streaks on my clothes but this one does not. I&#x27;d highly recommend this lotion...and here on Amazon it is about half the price that my tanning salon wants me to pay!</li>
            <li> It smells absolutley wonderful &amp; it makes me tan so dark!! Could not be more happy with this product!! Would deffinitly recommend it to anyone!!</li>
            <li> First off I wanted to say that I am an experienced tanner, have tried a great multitude of lotions, and am very picky about what i invest in. Devoted Creations has been my new favorite brand after using Designer Skin for years. I was using High Drama by Devoted Creations for a few months and unfortunately ran out of it. Was the best smelling lotion I&#x27;ve ever put on my skin. I poured through forums and discovered this has all the added benefits that I was searching for and smells identical to High Drama. Trust Fund Baby smells identical. Words can&#x27;t begin to describe how this stuff smells. It is warm, sweet, but has a naughty hint to it which makes it perfect. They really need to make this a fragrance. it is so addicting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent if important but this lotion also is a great bronzer. It is a luxurious thick lotion. Has a sheen about it too, which looks beautiful on the skin. It really gets you dark. The best part about it is that there is zero after tan odor. It smells amazing and you can wear it all day, even if you aren&#x27;t going to tan. No streaks, no brown hands, and because its a silicone formalization, you end up using less because it goes on so smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest leaving this on for as long as you can before showering. It works its magic after you get out of the tanning bed and leaves you nice and bronzed. This is a solid investment in your tanning regime. Does what its supposed to do so you don&#x27;t have to go the salon as often. Buy it and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love the smell!!!!! Gave me great color. I will deff want to order again. I have become a fan of DC products.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product! It was the first actual bottle I purchased. The small in amazing and the shimmer is even better. It&#x27;s very smooth and not sticky at all. I don&#x27;t feel greasy after tanning and I don&#x27;t get streaks. Love love love it!</li>
            <li> It gets me darker pretty quick and will keep using this till the bottles gone . I would tell you I do mix my lotion with maximizer .</li>
            <li> Love the smell and texture! Produces a great natural tan look!&lt;br /&gt;Smells like Juicy Couture!BUY THIS! I love this lotion! I am almost done with my 1st bottle and I will be going back for a 2nd!</li>
            <li> This lotion is creamy and applies really well, not much bronzer, smell is alright, decent color, overpriced, did not contain shimmer as claimed by others. I&#x27;ve definitely used equal or better quality tanning lotion for half the price. I would not recommend this product or purchase it again myself.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Great smell&lt;br /&gt;Smooth texture&lt;br /&gt;Adorable bottle&lt;br /&gt;Decently priced&lt;br /&gt;Nice, smooth tan&lt;br /&gt;Comes w/cute, detachable keychain&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Not a great bronzer</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion, however, I am definitely not willing to pay the retail pricing for it. This is a great deal for a quality product! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  If you are looking for a good bronzer that smells good and helps you with a nice brown tan, this is it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! I really like the way it smells too! The price made it definitely worth buying.  I got a darker skin tone instantly!</li>
            <li> New product at a good price.  Fast shipping.  Highly recommend this seller and this product.  I like this particular lotion because of the scent.  it is more &amp;#34;perfumy&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t have the island coconut smell that most lotions do.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This Is one of my favorite tanning lotions...it smells AMAZING and helps you tan way faster! It&#x27;s definetly worth buying</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this about three times and I really like it; it leaves your skin silky smooth. The color is good but I&#x27;ve been using CoCo Deville for awhile and already have a nice tan so I&#x27;ll wait and see. The bottle is big so you will get plenty for your $$$$. The only thing I dont like about this lotion is the smell; it&#x27;s not awful but it smells like men&#x27;s deodorant to me and I don&#x27;t want to leave the tanning bed smelling like a man however, once you have it on for awhile it does get better.</li>
            <li> I would give this lotion 6 stars if I could. First off, I&#x27;d like to say that the smell is to die for; sweet but not too strong. It is a silicone based lotion, so it goes on very very smoothly and a little goes a long way. It is a very light brown color that has minimal bronzing agents in it. It does not stain my fingers or come off on the towel after my tanning session. I will definitely buy this lotion again. I have been tanning for years and have used MANY MANY different lotions, but this by far has been my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love the way this lotion smells and feels on my skin , it works great to  I have a beautiful deep bronze tan . thanks</li>
            <li> I have spent way too much money trying to find the perfect tanning lotion so am very pleased to say this one really does what it claims. It helps boost your color, feels silky going on and smells incredible, rather like a delicate perfume (not like a typical tanning lotion). My skin looks so good after using this; it is now my go to tanning lotion. Highly recommended.</li>
