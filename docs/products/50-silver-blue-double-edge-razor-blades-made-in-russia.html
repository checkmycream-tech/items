            <li>They also don&#x27;t cause me any irritation on my neck, which is amazing, since I used to always get razor-burn.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re simply amazing.</li>
            <li>There is no cuts,nicks or irritation of any kind and to be honest the 1st time I used it</li>

            <li>Feels good on the face compared to most blades.  </li>
            <li>These blades give a very nice and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I went through dozens of different blades to figure out which one/s would work best for my skin, and I have come to the conclusion that these are the ones that I will be sticking with, because of how well it cuts the hair and leaves my skin in good shape and non irritated.</li>
            <li>Excellent blades for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>They came from Russia, which surprised me, but they were exactly perfect.  </li>
            <li>Think I will buy in bulk, great smooth shave, getting between 6-7 really smooth shaves from each blade.</li>
            <li>I have stated that other blades were excellent, but these really have been the best I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>I get better and more</li>
            <li>Tried others and this is it for me, My favorite for now.</li>
            <li>More than met my expectations.</li>
            <li>I bought a variety pack of razors when I first started DE shaving, and I found the Gillette Blues to be the best, and most consistent blades.</li>
            <li>I have been shaving with a safety DE blade for over a year now and have tried many different blades looking for the one that will work best.  </li>
            <li>I then went to Astras which were better than the Feathers, but still sometimes I got irritation and redness.  </li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>I will reorder these again when I need more.</li>
            <li>Ok feathers are better</li>
            <li>Received in a timely manner and they are my favorite blades,I have used</li>
            <li>These are pretty good razor blades.</li>
            <li>These blades are pretty good.</li>
            <li>these are a perfect mix of being very sharp and very smooth.  </li>
            <li>It is as smooth as any 3,4 or 5 blade disposable razor I have ever used but the finished results are much better.</li>
            <li>They have a wonderful balance between sharp and smooth.  </li>
            <li>These blades are among my top blades and they look cool too.  </li>
            <li>Would highly highly recommend  giving these a try- by far the best razor I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>With good prep, I can get a very smooth and relatively irritation-free shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The blade is comfortable with the grain, against the grain, and across the grain.</li>
            <li>Interestingly enough, I also have a Merkur 20c at my girlfriend&#x27;s, and I found that - as great as these are in my Mulhe</li>
            <li>Smooth comfortable  shave,</li>
            <li>this is what i have been missing.this blade cuts so close and so smooth</li>
            <li>Smooth cuts with and against the grain.</li>
            <li>Not only does it give me a great shave it doesn&#x27;t nick my face to pieces like the 7 o&#x27;clocks tend to do.</li>
            <li>It provides an incredibly comfortable and smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>I use Proraso sandlewood shave cream and the combination is as good as it gets as far as I&#x27;m concerned and my wife would agree 100%.If</li>
            <li>All you need is a decent blade, and it doesn&#x27;t get much better than this!</li>
            <li>Its worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I purchased these razors based on there excellent reviews but they are not much better if any than my Astra blades.</li>
            <li>I am new to DE shaving and after ordering a new Feather DE razor with a 30 pack of their world renowned blades i set in trying to perfect my shaving technique and after several attempts to achieve a great shave like so many have raved about with this setup i was left with a sore,bloody,and irritated neck</li>
            <li>Out of 100 or so different brand de blades that I have tried through the years, these are by far the best.</li>
            <li>These are the best double edge blades I have tried so far.  </li>
            <li>I loaded the first blade in my razor this weekend and was so happy to finally be in a position to relax and enjoy a quality shave each time, rather than wondering each week whether the blade I selected out of the sample pack was going to be any good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re hesitant to return as quickly, but my 5 o&#x27;clock shadow doesn&#x27;t come around until after I go to bed.</li>
            <li>thing I quickly learned was the importance of matching the blade with the skin type, hair growth pattern, and beard thickness.</li>
            <li>The blades were shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I find these to be very sharp and extremely smooth with good longevity.  </li>
            <li>I have tried quite a few and most are pretty good for me.  </li>
            <li>I own, used  and have reviewed the Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock Super Platinum, which is a great little razor blade too, but my face prefers these Blue Steel razors.</li>
            <li>It requires so many fewer strokes that I think I can shave faster with the Silver Blues than I could with my old Mach 3 Turbos.</li>
            <li>This is the second order of these blades and I have to admit I was very pleased with the first order as a blade</li>
            <li>I tried a bunch of others in a sample pack which included these, and these were my favorite by far.</li>
            <li>They give me about 4 good shaves in a wide variety of razors.</li>
            <li>That has to be worth something also.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you have developed your technique before trying it.  </li>
            <li>Some blades were great, others so dull I tossed them after one use, and others so sharp they sheered the skin off my face, leaving a surprising amount of blood.</li>
            <li>Used them this morning and they more than live up to the high ratings the blades have received.  </li>
            <li>They work very, very well for me and my Merkur 33C, and in my Superspeed as well.  </li>
            <li>They are very sharp but unlike Feathers give a smooth comfortable nick free shave every time.</li>
            <li>sharp and smooth, these are one of my favorite blades.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know if it shaves closer or if it just scares the $h!</li>
            <li>some reason, I usually get the best shave on their second use.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find the words to describe how nice they effortlessly glide across my beard without any drag,</li>
            <li>Sharp and give an amazingly close shave without having to go against the grain.</li>
            <li>Each person is distinctly unique, so while a blade like Feather was way too sharp for me, it might be perfect for someone with a thicker beard and less sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Enter the Gillette Silver Blue- a true dream come true.</li>
            <li>shave is generally close and always smooth.</li>
            <li>After buying a high quality safety razor from an antique shop I wanted some authentic Gillette Blue Blades for it.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say that now my face is smoother 8 hours after i shave than it has ever been with the disposable blades i wasted so much money on was right after i shaved and my skin feels much healthier which could be a result of the Proraso shave cream or these blades</li>
            <li>I was smart.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know how long a blade will last but so far so great.</li>
            <li>They are so smooth, even the first shave is great unlike Feathers or Blue Birds that can be a little rough on the first use.</li>
            <li>without much problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really tell any difference between the yellows and the blues.</li>
            <li>STILL MUCH CHEAPER THAN MACH III</li>
            <li>I get very close shaves with these blades without any irritation.</li>
            <li>My hat goes off to the seller for getting them to me extremely fast.</li>
            <li>extremely sharp they shave very smooth.</li>
            <li>When I first adopted wet shaving and was learning this new shaving experience, I wisely purchased a twenty-five pack of various blades from around the world.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve settled on Astra, Derby, or any other non premium blade, give these a try and you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li>These blades are sharp and smooth!</li>
            <li>The product itself is great but not receiving the full order is pretty bad.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s true that the blade, the razor, your skin, and the specific pattern that your whiskers grow can all affect what razor/blade combination is optimal.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with these blades - first shave with them is very smooth compared to the Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock Blues (made in Russia) which last as long, but are very rough and sharp on first shave.</li>
            <li>so if you need a sharp blade and like keeping the skin on your face give these blades a try along with a good shave cream/soap like Proraso offers and you will never go back to the 3,4,or 5 blade money wasting blades you have been using.</li>
            <li>i thought something was wrong with how it fit my razor because i honestly couldn&#x27;t feel any tugging or pulling</li>
            <li>The Gillette Silver Blue has become my favorite double edge razor blade.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend and buy again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>you need a sharp durable blade and the feathers are just too harsh to make your DE shaving experience the joy you know it could be give these blades a try.</li>
            <li>get 3-4 shaves with a single blade before I start wondering if I should change it, but could probably get several more if I had to</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving with a single blade razor since before hipsters thought it was cool to grow beards.</li>
            <li>Smooth but not as sharp as the yellows.  </li>
            <li>These blades are smooth and sharp.</li>
            <li>I would suggest a variety pack of blades that contain (5) of these if you are new to safety shaving DE blades and haven&#x27;t found a go to blade yet.</li>
            <li>The good blades are similar to Personna, the dull blades remind me of BigBen or Derby.</li>
            <li>Started off really well, then in time I noticed more dull blades that lasted only a couple of shaves.</li>
            <li>There were others too, but these two were clearly blades</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen such a path of destruction since Sherman marched through the heart of the Confederacy and straight to the sea.</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>I tried Feathers - I can&#x27;t use them my face is red for days no matter how gently I shave with them.  </li>
            <li>I am able to get at least five, sometimes six, shaves per blade.  </li>
            <li>The first shave is always stellar, but I&#x27;ve found I usually like to toss them after 3 shaves or so.</li>
            <li>about 3-4 shaves comfortably, but I can stretch them a little further if I want to.</li>
            <li>Great blades - sharp on first shave - usually get about a week of solid shaves before I swap the out - and that&#x27;s three or four complete passes across a pretty tough beard - with, across, against, and occasionally with again.</li>
            <li>I can shave for weeks with the same blade until it&#x27;s time for a new one.</li>
            <li>One word of advice: I do not recommend this blade to somebody who is new to double edge safety razor shaving.  </li>
            <li>My primary razor is a Merkur 37c slant and even after 3-4 days of heavy beard growth, these simply take off the hair like it&#x27;s not even there.</li>
            <li>These are some of the best blades I&#x27;ve found- extremely sharp, without the harsh feel of other very sharp blades such as Feather brand.  </li>
            <li>These blades are pretty sharp.</li>
            <li>These blades are katana sword sharp, which is good for me since I have tough stubble.  </li>
            <li>They are a bit more expensive than the astras and derbys, but they last a few more shaves and remain almost as sharp as the first time.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call them as sharp as Feathers, but they are extremely sharp and still smooth.</li>
            <li>They are packaged the same and far sharper than any found at the local drug store.  </li>
            <li>So I tried blades like Derby and they were just not sharp enough...</li>
            <li>In one swipe, this blade, paired with my Edwin Jagger, will cut a clean path through five day old growth, leaving no hair behind.</li>
            <li>Another de blade worth mentioning for being sharp and smooth is Voskhod teflon blades, you won&#x27;t go wrong with either of these.</li>
            <li>They continue to be smooth after that point, but they are a little less sharp.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t wear out quickly, and last me at least 5 shaves.</li>
            <li>Sharp yet smooth with very little tugging or irritation.</li>

            <li> I use Proraso sandlewood shave cream and the combination is as good as it gets as far as I&#x27;m concerned and my wife would agree 100%.If</li>
            <li> All you need is a decent blade, and it doesn&#x27;t get much better than this!</li>
            <li> Its worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I purchased these razors based on there excellent reviews but they are not much better if any than my Astra blades.</li>
            <li> I am new to DE shaving and after ordering a new Feather DE razor with a 30 pack of their world renowned blades i set in trying to perfect my shaving technique and after several attempts to achieve a great shave like so many have raved about with this setup i was left with a sore,bloody,and irritated neck</li>
            <li> Out of 100 or so different brand de blades that I have tried through the years, these are by far the best.</li>
            <li> These are the best double edge blades I have tried so far.  </li>
            <li> I loaded the first blade in my razor this weekend and was so happy to finally be in a position to relax and enjoy a quality shave each time, rather than wondering each week whether the blade I selected out of the sample pack was going to be any good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re hesitant to return as quickly, but my 5 o&#x27;clock shadow doesn&#x27;t come around until after I go to bed.</li>
            <li> thing I quickly learned was the importance of matching the blade with the skin type, hair growth pattern, and beard thickness.</li>
            <li> The blades were shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I find these to be very sharp and extremely smooth with good longevity.  </li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few and most are pretty good for me.  </li>
            <li> I own, used  and have reviewed the Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock Super Platinum, which is a great little razor blade too, but my face prefers these Blue Steel razors.</li>
            <li> It requires so many fewer strokes that I think I can shave faster with the Silver Blues than I could with my old Mach 3 Turbos.</li>
            <li> This is the second order of these blades and I have to admit I was very pleased with the first order as a blade</li>
            <li> I tried a bunch of others in a sample pack which included these, and these were my favorite by far.</li>
            <li> They give me about 4 good shaves in a wide variety of razors.</li>
            <li> That has to be worth something also.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you have developed your technique before trying it.  </li>
            <li> Some blades were great, others so dull I tossed them after one use, and others so sharp they sheered the skin off my face, leaving a surprising amount of blood.</li>
            <li> Used them this morning and they more than live up to the high ratings the blades have received.  </li>
            <li> They work very, very well for me and my Merkur 33C, and in my Superspeed as well.  </li>
            <li> They are very sharp but unlike Feathers give a smooth comfortable nick free shave every time.</li>
            <li> sharp and smooth, these are one of my favorite blades.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know if it shaves closer or if it just scares the $h!</li>
            <li> some reason, I usually get the best shave on their second use.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find the words to describe how nice they effortlessly glide across my beard without any drag,</li>
            <li> Sharp and give an amazingly close shave without having to go against the grain.</li>
            <li> Each person is distinctly unique, so while a blade like Feather was way too sharp for me, it might be perfect for someone with a thicker beard and less sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Enter the Gillette Silver Blue- a true dream come true.</li>
            <li> shave is generally close and always smooth.</li>
            <li> After buying a high quality safety razor from an antique shop I wanted some authentic Gillette Blue Blades for it.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say that now my face is smoother 8 hours after i shave than it has ever been with the disposable blades i wasted so much money on was right after i shaved and my skin feels much healthier which could be a result of the Proraso shave cream or these blades</li>
            <li> I was smart.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how long a blade will last but so far so great.</li>
            <li> They are so smooth, even the first shave is great unlike Feathers or Blue Birds that can be a little rough on the first use.</li>
            <li> without much problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really tell any difference between the yellows and the blues.</li>
            <li> STILL MUCH CHEAPER THAN MACH III</li>
            <li> I get very close shaves with these blades without any irritation.</li>
            <li> My hat goes off to the seller for getting them to me extremely fast.</li>
            <li> extremely sharp they shave very smooth.</li>
            <li> When I first adopted wet shaving and was learning this new shaving experience, I wisely purchased a twenty-five pack of various blades from around the world.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve settled on Astra, Derby, or any other non premium blade, give these a try and you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> These blades are sharp and smooth!</li>
            <li> The product itself is great but not receiving the full order is pretty bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s true that the blade, the razor, your skin, and the specific pattern that your whiskers grow can all affect what razor/blade combination is optimal.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with these blades - first shave with them is very smooth compared to the Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock Blues (made in Russia) which last as long, but are very rough and sharp on first shave.</li>
            <li> so if you need a sharp blade and like keeping the skin on your face give these blades a try along with a good shave cream/soap like Proraso offers and you will never go back to the 3,4,or 5 blade money wasting blades you have been using.</li>
            <li> i thought something was wrong with how it fit my razor because i honestly couldn&#x27;t feel any tugging or pulling</li>
            <li> The Gillette Silver Blue has become my favorite double edge razor blade.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend and buy again.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> you need a sharp durable blade and the feathers are just too harsh to make your DE shaving experience the joy you know it could be give these blades a try.</li>
            <li> get 3-4 shaves with a single blade before I start wondering if I should change it, but could probably get several more if I had to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with a single blade razor since before hipsters thought it was cool to grow beards.</li>
            <li> Smooth but not as sharp as the yellows.  </li>
            <li> These blades are smooth and sharp.</li>
            <li> I would suggest a variety pack of blades that contain (5) of these if you are new to safety shaving DE blades and haven&#x27;t found a go to blade yet.</li>
            <li> The good blades are similar to Personna, the dull blades remind me of BigBen or Derby.</li>
            <li> Started off really well, then in time I noticed more dull blades that lasted only a couple of shaves.</li>
            <li> There were others too, but these two were clearly blades</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen such a path of destruction since Sherman marched through the heart of the Confederacy and straight to the sea.</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> I tried Feathers - I can&#x27;t use them my face is red for days no matter how gently I shave with them.  </li>
            <li> I am able to get at least five, sometimes six, shaves per blade.  </li>
            <li> The first shave is always stellar, but I&#x27;ve found I usually like to toss them after 3 shaves or so.</li>
            <li> about 3-4 shaves comfortably, but I can stretch them a little further if I want to.</li>
            <li> Great blades - sharp on first shave - usually get about a week of solid shaves before I swap the out - and that&#x27;s three or four complete passes across a pretty tough beard - with, across, against, and occasionally with again.</li>
            <li> I can shave for weeks with the same blade until it&#x27;s time for a new one.</li>
            <li> One word of advice: I do not recommend this blade to somebody who is new to double edge safety razor shaving.  </li>
            <li> My primary razor is a Merkur 37c slant and even after 3-4 days of heavy beard growth, these simply take off the hair like it&#x27;s not even there.</li>
            <li> These are some of the best blades I&#x27;ve found- extremely sharp, without the harsh feel of other very sharp blades such as Feather brand.  </li>
            <li> These blades are pretty sharp.</li>
            <li> These blades are katana sword sharp, which is good for me since I have tough stubble.  </li>
            <li> They are a bit more expensive than the astras and derbys, but they last a few more shaves and remain almost as sharp as the first time.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call them as sharp as Feathers, but they are extremely sharp and still smooth.</li>
            <li> They are packaged the same and far sharper than any found at the local drug store.  </li>
            <li> So I tried blades like Derby and they were just not sharp enough...</li>
            <li> In one swipe, this blade, paired with my Edwin Jagger, will cut a clean path through five day old growth, leaving no hair behind.</li>
            <li> Another de blade worth mentioning for being sharp and smooth is Voskhod teflon blades, you won&#x27;t go wrong with either of these.</li>
            <li> They continue to be smooth after that point, but they are a little less sharp.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t wear out quickly, and last me at least 5 shaves.</li>
            <li> Sharp yet smooth with very little tugging or irritation.</li>
            <li> but so far I have only gone through just half of them.</li>
            <li> Long story short</li>
            <li> last a long time for me.  </li>
            <li> I am a recent convert to wet shaving (about 1 year now).</li>
            <li> would say they are about as sharp as the personna lab blue blades, but a smoother shave.</li>
            <li> I take the blade out after each shave and dry the blade and razor</li>
            <li> I think the body of the blade is thinner than most other blades, and that seems to make it vibrate just a bit when it&#x27;s cutting.  </li>
            <li> Very solid everyday blade.</li>
            <li> So, be careful when using these blades with your safety razor.</li>
            <li> I have thick stubble but a sensitive face</li>
            <li> Sharp every time.</li>
            <li> No nicks, no razor burn, sharp but forgiving.  </li>
            <li> These blades are extremely smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These blades are almost as sharp as Feathers, but leave your skin intact.</li>
            <li> They will be in my cabinet along with Personna  meds,and Gillette sharp edge(yellow box).</li>
            <li> I bought a Muhle R41 razor, and other blades that worked with other razors</li>
            <li> but ill never go back to the old disposables</li>
            <li> but ill never go back to the old disposables again.</li>
            <li> Hard to beat the Russian blades made at the St. Petersburg factory.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time believing there can be alot of difference between 1 blade to the next</li>
            <li> but I do recommend you at least try these Silver Blue Steel razor blades.</li>
            <li> Using a safety razor, just take your time and don&#x27;t rush because these are VERY sharp.</li>
            <li> my technique.i have a very thick beard and need a very sharp durable blade so after reading similar reviews to what i am posting now</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few months.</li>
            <li> If you’re not sure what blade works for you, I recommend buying a sample pack, as I did, and discovering which blade works well for you.</li>
            <li> and it was unbelievable.</li>
            <li> im not sure</li>
            <li> im not sure</li>
            <li> I am not able to shave over 3 times without the blade pulling and showin signs of wear.</li>
            <li> Sharp without being irritating.  </li>
            <li> Over the course of about six months, I slowly worked my way through the pack, trying one blade a week.</li>
            <li> LITTLE EXPENSIVE BUT</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t interrupt the quality of the shave, but it gives a little audible feedback when it&#x27;s actually cutting stuff, which I like, because you can hear it working.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few years ago, these were said to be discontinued and were almost impossible to find and when they could, they were around $50-$60 per hundred.</li>
            <li> Stop throwing out plastic disposables and spending absurd amounts of cash on attachable razor heads.</li>
            <li> These are not platinum coated beware the description wrong</li>
            <li> - they were quite disappointing in the Merkur (where I prefer Feather blades).</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent blades for my sensitive skin.  Sharp every time.</li>
            <li> I used a Merkur DE and tried the Merkur blade that came with it.  Razor burn, tugging, etc. I tried these and it is the cleanest shave to date. No nicks, no razor burn, sharp but forgiving.  Would highly recommend and buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with a single blade razor since before hipsters thought it was cool to grow beards. I have tried different blades, from Astras to Derbys, Feathers to Personnas, but the Gillette Silver Blue is the ultimate blade. In one swipe, this blade, paired with my Edwin Jagger, will cut a clean path through five day old growth, leaving no hair behind. I&#x27;m not even kidding. I haven&#x27;t seen such a path of destruction since Sherman marched through the heart of the Confederacy and straight to the sea. The blade is comfortable with the grain, against the grain, and across the grain. It requires so many fewer strokes that I think I can shave faster with the Silver Blues than I could with my old Mach 3 Turbos. I really don&#x27;t know if it shaves closer or if it just scares the $h!# out of the rest of the facial hair and they&#x27;re hesitant to return as quickly, but my 5 o&#x27;clock shadow doesn&#x27;t come around until after I go to bed. I bought the 50 pack; it&#x27;ll probably last me over a year.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the reviews for me.  I wish I had only bought a ten pack.</li>
            <li> Took me a while to find the razor blade that works best for me in my Muhle R89 razor, but these are they.  They have a wonderful balance between sharp and smooth.  I think the body of the blade is thinner than most other blades, and that seems to make it vibrate just a bit when it&#x27;s cutting.  It doesn&#x27;t interrupt the quality of the shave, but it gives a little audible feedback when it&#x27;s actually cutting stuff, which I like, because you can hear it working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get 3-4 shaves with a single blade before I start wondering if I should change it, but could probably get several more if I had to without much problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true that the blade, the razor, your skin, and the specific pattern that your whiskers grow can all affect what razor/blade combination is optimal.  Interestingly enough, I also have a Merkur 20c at my girlfriend&#x27;s, and I found that - as great as these are in my Mulhe - they were quite disappointing in the Merkur (where I prefer Feather blades).</li>
            <li> Great blades for my face in my Merkur 38C. I wouldn&#x27;t call them as sharp as Feathers, but they are extremely sharp and still smooth. They are so smooth, even the first shave is great unlike Feathers or Blue Birds that can be a little rough on the first use.</li>
            <li> I get better and more shaves out of this than the astra.</li>
            <li> I like these blades. I use them in an Edwin Jagger DE89. The first shave is always stellar, but I&#x27;ve found I usually like to toss them after 3 shaves or so. Your face and preferences may differ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is generally close and always smooth. Very solid everyday blade.</li>
            <li> husband likes this product.  reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my bf and he didnt like them at all.</li>
            <li> Great blades - sharp on first shave - usually get about a week of solid shaves before I swap the out - and that&#x27;s three or four complete passes across a pretty tough beard - with, across, against, and occasionally with again. Very pleased with these blades - first shave with them is very smooth compared to the Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock Blues (made in Russia) which last as long, but are very rough and sharp on first shave.</li>
            <li> These blades are extremely smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say they are about as sharp as the personna lab blue blades, but a smoother shave. With good prep, I can get a very smooth and relatively irritation-free shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They usually last about 3-4 shaves comfortably, but I can stretch them a little further if I want to. They continue to be smooth after that point, but they are a little less sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, I usually get the best shave on their second use.</li>
            <li> sharp and smooth, these are one of my favorite blades. Hard to beat the Russian blades made at the St. Petersburg factory.</li>
            <li> These blades are perfect for my skin.  Sharp and give an amazingly close shave without having to go against the grain.</li>
            <li> Great for me I had to find out what worked for my face, and this is it. Tried others and this is it for me, My favorite for now.</li>
            <li> Best blades I ever used! extremely sharp they shave very smooth. they don&#x27;t cut they shave. can&#x27;t recommend this enough. Its worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really tell any difference between the yellows and the blues. Both are my go to blade in the R41 and Ikon slant. However don&#x27;t care for either in the feather ASD2. In the Feather I shim it with one trimmed blade and use med preps.</li>
            <li> I have found these razor blades to be perfect for my skin type. Granted I went through dozens of different blades to figure out which one/s would work best for my skin, and I have come to the conclusion that these are the ones that I will be sticking with, because of how well it cuts the hair and leaves my skin in good shape and non irritated.</li>
            <li> Based on the ratings given these blades, I gave them a try.  Used them this morning and they more than live up to the high ratings the blades have received.  Don&#x27;t know how long a blade will last but so far so great. Smooth comfortable  shave, great price. More than met my expectations.</li>
            <li> I was smart. When I first adopted wet shaving and was learning this new shaving experience, I wisely purchased a twenty-five pack of various blades from around the world. Over the course of about six months, I slowly worked my way through the pack, trying one blade a week. Some blades were great, others so dull I tossed them after one use, and others so sharp they sheered the skin off my face, leaving a surprising amount of blood. Feather was the sharpest, for those who are curious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I quickly learned was the importance of matching the blade with the skin type, hair growth pattern, and beard thickness. Each person is distinctly unique, so while a blade like Feather was way too sharp for me, it might be perfect for someone with a thicker beard and less sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two blades stood out amongst the pack as being an excellent blade for me: BlueBird and Gillette Silver Blue. There were others too, but these two were clearly blades I wanted to use moving forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I purchased a pack each of fifty BlueBird and fifty Gillette Silver Blue blades. This should last me about two years. I loaded the first blade in my razor this weekend and was so happy to finally be in a position to relax and enjoy a quality shave each time, rather than wondering each week whether the blade I selected out of the sample pack was going to be any good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can’t help but recommend this blade, but state this by qualifying my statement. This blade works great on my face and beard type. If you’re not sure what blade works for you, I recommend buying a sample pack, as I did, and discovering which blade works well for you.</li>
            <li> Out of 100 or so different brand de blades that I have tried through the years, these are by far the best. They are very sharp but unlike Feathers give a smooth comfortable nick free shave every time. I can&#x27;t find the words to describe how nice they effortlessly glide across my beard without any drag, almost feels like the razor has no blade in it at all. My primary razor is a Merkur 37c slant and even after 3-4 days of heavy beard growth, these simply take off the hair like it&#x27;s not even there. A few years ago, these were said to be discontinued and were almost impossible to find and when they could, they were around $50-$60 per hundred. If you&#x27;ve settled on Astra, Derby, or any other non premium blade, give these a try and you will be glad you did. Another de blade worth mentioning for being sharp and smooth is Voskhod teflon blades, you won&#x27;t go wrong with either of these.</li>
            <li> I bought a variety pack of razors when I first started DE shaving, and I found the Gillette Blues to be the best, and most consistent blades. They don&#x27;t wear out quickly, and last me at least 5 shaves. They also don&#x27;t cause me any irritation on my neck, which is amazing, since I used to always get razor-burn. They&#x27;re simply amazing.</li>
            <li> After buying a high quality safety razor from an antique shop I wanted some authentic Gillette Blue Blades for it.  I bought these.  They came from Russia, which surprised me, but they were exactly perfect.  They are packaged the same and far sharper than any found at the local drug store.  I will do it again when ever I run low on blades.</li>
            <li> I purchased these razors based on there excellent reviews but they are not much better if any than my Astra blades.</li>
            <li> Some inconsistency in the batch that I received. Started off really well, then in time I noticed more dull blades that lasted only a couple of shaves. About 3.5 sharpness(average). Overall forgiving. The good blades are similar to Personna, the dull blades remind me of BigBen or Derby.</li>
            <li> I am new to DE shaving and after ordering a new Feather DE razor with a 30 pack of their world renowned blades i set in trying to perfect my shaving technique and after several attempts to achieve a great shave like so many have raved about with this setup i was left with a sore,bloody,and irritated neck no matter how i varied my technique.i have a very thick beard and need a very sharp durable blade so after reading similar reviews to what i am posting now i give these blades a try.and WOW this is what i have been missing.this blade cuts so close and so smooth i couldn&#x27;t believe it.It is as smooth as any 3,4 or 5 blade disposable razor I have ever used but the finished results are much better.There is no cuts,nicks or irritation of any kind and to be honest the 1st time I used it i thought something was wrong with how it fit my razor because i honestly couldn&#x27;t feel any tugging or pulling like i had grown accustomed to until i stopped mid-shave and felt my skin and it was unbelievable.This is without a doubt the best shave i have ever experienced.I use Proraso sandlewood shave cream and the combination is as good as it gets as far as I&#x27;m concerned and my wife would agree 100%.If you need a sharp durable blade and the feathers are just too harsh to make your DE shaving experience the joy you know it could be give these blades a try.I had a hard time believing there can be alot of difference between 1 blade to the next but i stand corrected.Long story short i cant wait to shave now so if you need a sharp blade and like keeping the skin on your face give these blades a try along with a good shave cream/soap like Proraso offers and you will never go back to the 3,4,or 5 blade money wasting blades you have been using.I can honestly say that now my face is smoother 8 hours after i shave than it has ever been with the disposable blades i wasted so much money on was right after i shaved and my skin feels much healthier which could be a result of the Proraso shave cream or these blades im not sure but ill never go back to the old disposables again.these blades im not sure but ill never go back to the old disposables again.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with a safety DE blade for over a year now and have tried many different blades looking for the one that will work best.  Feather and Sharks were my favorites until I started using Silver Blue... I find these to be very sharp and extremely smooth with good longevity.  These are my go to blades.  But what works best for me might not be the best for you.  I would suggest a variety pack of blades that contain (5) of these if you are new to safety shaving DE blades and haven&#x27;t found a go to blade yet.</li>
            <li> This is the second order of these blades and I have to admit I was very pleased with the first order as a blade would usually last a week but this second order has not been the same. I am not able to shave over 3 times without the blade pulling and showin signs of wear. I take the blade out after each shave and dry the blade and razor but they are hit and miss when it comes to quality.</li>
            <li> These are great blades.  I tried a bunch of others in a sample pack which included these, and these were my favorite by far.</li>
            <li> Best razors I&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li> Sharp without being irritating.  I get a great shave and the blades last a long time for me.  Smooth cuts with and against the grain.</li>
            <li> Smooth but not as sharp as the yellows.  Good for a beginner.</li>
            <li> I tried out a variety pack of razors, and the Silver Blue blades were the sharpest and they lasted the longest. I can shave for weeks with the same blade until it&#x27;s time for a new one. Using a safety razor, just take your time and don&#x27;t rush because these are VERY sharp. You will easily cut yourself if you aren&#x27;t experienced using a safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great way to save money and resources. Stop throwing out plastic disposables and spending absurd amounts of cash on attachable razor heads. All you need is a decent blade, and it doesn&#x27;t get much better than this!</li>
            <li> I tried Feathers - I can&#x27;t use them my face is red for days no matter how gently I shave with them.  I then went to Astras which were better than the Feathers, but still sometimes I got irritation and redness.  So I tried blades like Derby and they were just not sharp enough... these are a perfect mix of being very sharp and very smooth.  Love them.</li>
            <li> These blades are almost as sharp as Feathers, but leave your skin intact. No nicks or weepers. Try them, you&#x27;ll never go back to Feathers.</li>
            <li> These are some of the best blades I&#x27;ve found- extremely sharp, without the harsh feel of other very sharp blades such as Feather brand.  They work very, very well for me and my Merkur 33C, and in my Superspeed as well.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> GREAT BLADES !!!! LITTLE EXPENSIVE BUT STILL MUCH CHEAPER THAN MACH III</li>
            <li> These are pretty good razor blades. They give me about 4 good shaves in a wide variety of razors. Vendor shipped quick and the price was excellent.</li>
            <li> These blades give a very nice and comfortable shave. I have tried a number of blades and these are one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> These blades are smooth and sharp. I get very close shaves with these blades without any irritation. The blades were shipped quickly. They will be in my cabinet along with Personna  meds,and Gillette sharp edge(yellow box). Thanks,Richard</li>
            <li> Several blades in the batch were defective. Watch out! The company has dropped the ball on this one by outsourcing IMHO.</li>
            <li> These are the best double edge blades I have tried so far.  I have tried quite a few and most are pretty good for me.  These blades are among my top blades and they look cool too.  That has to be worth something also.  Good price, prompt delivery.  Very good experience.</li>
            <li> These are now my most beloved razors. I own, used  and have reviewed the Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock Super Platinum, which is a great little razor blade too, but my face prefers these Blue Steel razors. Not only does it give me a great shave it doesn&#x27;t nick my face to pieces like the 7 o&#x27;clocks tend to do. everyone&#x27;s face and stubble is different but I do recommend you at least try these Silver Blue Steel razor blades. They may become your go to blade as they have for me.</li>
            <li> I am a recent convert to wet shaving (about 1 year now). Could not be happier. Bought an Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl and a starter variety pack of double edge razors. I thought the derbys and astras were pretty awesome (liked the feather too- but always ended up with a couple of nicks after shaving with it). Enter the Gillette Silver Blue- a true dream come true. The sharpness of the feathers without any of the nicks! They are a bit more expensive than the astras and derbys, but they last a few more shaves and remain almost as sharp as the first time. Would highly highly recommend  giving these a try- by far the best razor I&#x27;ve used. Having said that, everyone says that you should try a variety pack of razors to find which razor works best for your face/skin before committing to buying in bulk.</li>
            <li> We only received 9 boxes in our order. The product itself is great but not receiving the full order is pretty bad.</li>
            <li> I have stated that other blades were excellent, but these really have been the best I&#x27;ve found.  I bought a Muhle R41 razor, and other blades that worked with other razors cut me with the R41.  I tried the Gillette Blues, and I received an excellent close shave with this razor, and no cuts.  I will reorder these again when I need more.</li>
            <li> Ok feathers are better</li>
            <li> These blades are sharp and smooth!</li>
            <li> Had read much good about these blades and wanted to try them.  They perform as advertised and are excellent blades!</li>
            <li> Very nice blades. Sharp yet smooth with very little tugging or irritation.</li>
            <li> Had gotten a variety pack which contained these blades and worked well enough that I got this larger set.  Feels good on the face compared to most blades.  I have thick stubble but a sensitive face so these are good.</li>
            <li> These are not platinum coated beware the description wrong</li>
            <li> These blades are pretty good. My hat goes off to the seller for getting them to me extremely fast. I was going to wait till I had used all the blades before writing a review but so far I have only gone through just half of them. These blades are pretty sharp. I&#x27;ve nicked myself quite a bit.  So, be careful when using these blades with your safety razor.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few months. Think I will buy in bulk, great smooth shave, getting between 6-7 really smooth shaves from each blade.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Silver Blue has become my favorite double edge razor blade.  It provides an incredibly comfortable and smooth shave.  These blades are katana sword sharp, which is good for me since I have tough stubble.  (I think they are comparable to a Feather razor in terms of sharpness.)  I am able to get at least five, sometimes six, shaves per blade.  Using them does not require multiple strokes per pass nor is any pressure needed.  One word of advice: I do not recommend this blade to somebody who is new to double edge safety razor shaving.  Make sure you have developed your technique before trying it.  This blade is aggressive in every since of the word.</li>
            <li> Received in a timely manner and they are my favorite blades,I have used</li>
