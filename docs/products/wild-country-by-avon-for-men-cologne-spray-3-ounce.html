            <li> My husband has wore wild country since 1975 ,he likes the smell of it,but he continues to use it because I tell him he smells yummy,not only me,but friends wives,and co- workers wives say the same thing.after 39 yrs,I still won&#x27;t let him wear anything else,before 1975 he was wearing a 4 letter name brand cologne,B-- -- T, he smelled like he had poured lighter fluid all over himself,couldn&#x27;t stay closed up in the car for long periods,not no more.  One criticism though,even though I&#x27;ll always buy it for him,and I really love the scent,the pricing is going too high too fast,I&#x27;ve been a loyal and repeat customer,we really need a little break in the pricing department</li>
            <li> Smells like baby powder.</li>
            <li> We first received &amp;#34;Wild Country&amp;#34; as a Father&#x27;s Day gift for my husband. I have to confess that I loved it so much, my dear husband insisted that I keep it, since he had many others. I have been using it every day and just love it. It is now my favorite daytime&lt;br /&gt;fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is the only colon I have always used of course I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> love this old standby</li>
            <li> My husband loves this fragrance and so do I.</li>
            <li> would recommend to anyone very good and fast delivery</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for as long as I can remember. It has a very nice clean fresh scent and it&#x27;s not overpowering. I is one of my favorite colonges.</li>
            <li> My dad&#x27;s signature cologne.</li>
            <li> I have used Avon Wild Country Cologne for 32 years.&lt;br /&gt;I wish Avon still made the bottle without the spray.</li>
            <li> This colonge was my fathers favorite scent. He passed away in 2013 so I bought this for my mother to remember him...the order was the first to arrive out of 4 other same day purchases and both my mother and i are very satisfied...thank you!</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive and my husband loves it..</li>
            <li> I always buy this for my husband &#x3D; its a great soft masculine scent.&lt;br /&gt;not over powering.</li>
            <li> We order it for my wife&#x27;s father, he loves it.</li>
            <li> I really like this on my man!  Fresh, light, spicy, sweet and masculine! Oh yeah and Inexpensive:-)</li>
            <li> This is one of my fav perfumes other than YSL Body Kouros. Lasts long and my wife loves it. Its good one at 10 dollars.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping, great service, Thank you.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell but you have to watch how much you put on. 1 or 2 little squirts is all you need. It lasts for along time. Put it on in the morning and it will last you all day. I recommend this for the person thats in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Tried it on before going out and ended up taking another shower. It smells like my grandmother&#x27;s perfume. Threw it away. Spend the extra $$ on a more recognized cologne, or at least don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> I looked it very cheap, but when put this fragrance on me, I have to say smell good and last many hours, for the price is excellent</li>
            <li> My husband love this and will use nothing else.</li>
            <li> The cologne was fresh, affordable and so appreciated by someone who had loved it for many years. This type of nostalgia gift is so clever and a bargain compared to today&#x27;s scents.</li>
            <li> My sister recently became an Avon Lady.  She gave me a set of Wild Country products for my birthday including this spray cologne.  At first sniff, it reminds me most of insect repellant - which certainly is reminiscent of being outdoors in the country.  ; )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give them a try and see if I continue to feel the same and update this review.</li>
