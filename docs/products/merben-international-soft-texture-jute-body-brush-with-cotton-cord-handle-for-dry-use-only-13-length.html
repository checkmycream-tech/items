            <li>I LOVE this soft-texture jute body brush.</li>
            <li>It feels great and really works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot more bendy, flexible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I absolutely love this brush.  </li>

            <li>I think this is perfect for first timers or anyone that has sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Great only wish I could use with watet</li>
            <li>Do be sure to disinfect it periodically with a disinfectant, non-toxic spray to keep it fresh.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for detoxing and such!  :D</li>
            <li>I wanted to try dry brushing because I have heard so many good things about it.  </li>
            <li>and I can only use this brush very lightly, but it feels amazing after I do it.  </li>
            <li>This jute brush is really great and not highly abrasive.</li>
            <li>This is so nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>Makes your skin very silky, much better than a loofah or scrub.  </li>
            <li>I got it quickly and had no issues.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>So far so good - this leaves my skin super, super soft.  </li>
            <li>It has certainly helped smooth my skin</li>
            <li>My first body brush...</li>
            <li>It actually feels good rather than just barely tolerable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brush now for a couple weeks, and it is really a pleasure!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I decided to give dry brushing a try.</li>
            <li>brush is a nice size (a little larger than I expected), the cotton handle feels nice in your hands, and it looks cool hanging on a peg by the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using them for several years and they are still fabulous.  </li>
            <li>you have health issues, after you shower apply warmed coconut oil, which is very healing inside and out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush is very soft and exactly likethe description provided.</li>
            <li>The bristles are just firm enough to get your circulation moving and some good exfoliation, but not so much that your skin is scratched up and irritated.</li>
            <li>If you like a more severe brush, Merben does make  Medium and Firm versions.  </li>
            <li>After the first time my skin had a much nicer look, and I felt like my pores were open and singing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was new to body brushing when I ordered this brush.</li>
            <li>If you are new to dry brushing, you may want to try this soft brush first and increase firmness (if needed) after you are accustomed to it.  </li>
            <li>I do not find any need to change from using the soft on the majority of my body</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>In order to recover from what ails me I need to help my body naturally detoxify.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>skin is so soft now</li>
            <li>If you have really sensitive skin it would be god</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s truly amazing for getting dead skin off, and all of the other hundred things it does.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with dry brushing and I am glad I got this brush due to the previous reviews.</li>
            <li>I first learned about dry skin brushing from watching the Dr. Oz show and also reading about it in various beauty magazines.  </li>
            <li>Afterwards, your skin actually feels soft.</li>
            <li>When people complained, it was basically because the brush was too stiff/hard and therefore was not user friendly on the skin.</li>
            <li>the job well and is soft enough yet exfoliating at the same time.</li>
            <li>I purchased a similar brush at Whole Foods, which cost less than $10, and I ended up returning it.</li>
            <li>Wow, this brush is so soft and such a pleasure compared to other dry brushes I have tried.  </li>

            <li> so leaving it &#x27;in the sun to dry&#x27; just isn&#x27;t possible this time of year.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all (medium and firm, and the back strings) and all the Merbens are terrific quality.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very different from the standard brushes I&#x27;ve used in the past for dry skin brushing.</li>
            <li> I have lymphedema in my arm and have added dry brushing to all my other routines.</li>
            <li> Too soft for me that it felt like I had to scrub really hard to get benefits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a few days.  </li>
            <li> I will hang this in my spare bedroom with my other merben brushes.</li>
            <li> This, of course, leave a slight glowing to the skin - which is expected, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.  </li>
            <li> and I figured the worst case I&#x27;d have nicely exfoliated skin.  </li>
            <li> The brush bristles are a little hard, but they work on delicate skin without causing a wound or pain.</li>
            <li> I took this information to heart and purchased this product; people did not complain about the jute being too stiff or irritating.</li>
            <li> Most brushes that I have tried for dry brushing were brutal ~~ basically vicious scratching tools.  </li>
            <li> The bristles were way too stiff and using it was painful.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> So far so good - this leaves my skin super, super soft.  Although it takes days! to air dry when washed.  It&#x27;s winter here - we haven&#x27;t had sun in 3 weeks so leaving it &#x27;in the sun to dry&#x27; just isn&#x27;t possible this time of year.  May try using a blow dryer next time.</li>
            <li> Most brushes that I have tried for dry brushing were brutal ~~ basically vicious scratching tools.  If you like a more severe brush, Merben does make  Medium and Firm versions.  I&#x27;ve tried them all (medium and firm, and the back strings) and all the Merbens are terrific quality.  I was so happy to find that they made soft versions, because its perfect for me.  Definitely exfoliating but not damaging.  I&#x27;ve been using them for several years and they are still fabulous.  If you are new to dry brushing, you may want to try this soft brush first and increase firmness (if needed) after you are accustomed to it.  I do not find any need to change from using the soft on the majority of my body (I do use the medium on my feet) and doubt I ever will.  Great brand.</li>
            <li> This brush works great and is very high quality. The bristles are just firm enough to get your circulation moving and some good exfoliation, but not so much that your skin is scratched up and irritated. I purchased a similar brush at Whole Foods, which cost less than $10, and I ended up returning it. The bristles were way too stiff and using it was painful. Go with this one, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> My first body brush... and I love it! I have sensitive skin and it&#x27;s PERFECT ðŸ˜€ Now my husband is hooked too. Told him to buy one on Amazon!</li>
            <li> In order to recover from what ails me I need to help my body naturally detoxify.  After reading about dry brushing I decided to try it, it makes a lot of sense to me and I figured the worst case I&#x27;d have nicely exfoliated skin.  I have sensitive skin and I can only use this brush very lightly, but it feels amazing after I do it.

It works, and this brush feels wonderful.  I can&#x27;t imagine anything firmer, you aren&#x27;t supposed to hurt yourself!</li>
            <li> I first learned about dry skin brushing from watching the Dr. Oz show and also reading about it in various beauty magazines.  This brush is very soft but also very effective.  It has certainly helped smooth my skin and I won&#x27;t be without it.  After continued use, maybe I will try the medium textured brush.  Very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with dry brushing and I am glad I got this brush due to the previous reviews. My skin has never felt softer or smoother. I use it every morning before my shower and then follow up with coconut oil. This brush does&lt;br /&gt; the job well and is soft enough yet exfoliating at the same time. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft and exactly likethe description provided. I got it quickly and had no issues. Would purchase again!</li>
            <li> This is so nice and soft.  I wanted to try dry brushing because I have heard so many good things about it.  But I didn&#x27;t want one of those brushes that felt like sandpaper.  I think this is perfect for first timers or anyone that has sensitive skin.  It works great and I have noticed a difference in my skin (softer for sure).  I may graduate to one of their &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; brushes eventually, but I think this brand is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to start body dry brushing, in my quest to achieve the softest skin ever. This jute brush is really great and not highly abrasive. Itâ€™s not soft either, though it looks like that. This one is 13â€³ in length. I found it perfect to reach my back. If you would like a shorter version, there is a 9â€³ one. This is a perfect starterâ€™s brush, if you are thinking of starting body brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is so soft now and overall I feel great!</li>
            <li> Too soft for me that it felt like I had to scrub really hard to get benefits. If you have really sensitive skin it would be god but otherwise I&#x27;d go with something else.</li>
            <li> I really love this brush it doesn&#x27;t irritate me.  it does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> Great only wish I could use with watet</li>
            <li> Wow, this brush is so soft and such a pleasure compared to other dry brushes I have tried.  It actually feels good rather than just barely tolerable. I have lymphedema in my arm and have added dry brushing to all my other routines. I believe it is helping.  This is a great brush!</li>
            <li> LOVE this brush! I use it every day before I shower. I thought that it would hurt, but it feels soooooooo good on my skin!! Highly recommend for detoxing and such!  :D</li>
            <li> I debated as to whether or not I should try this. I&#x27;m very impressed with the results. The brush bristles are a little hard, but they work on delicate skin without causing a wound or pain. Afterwards, your skin actually feels soft. Teresa</li>
            <li> I LOVE this soft-texture jute body brush. Before I made this purchase, I read lots of reviews (from verified purchases) about different types of body brushes. When people complained, it was basically because the brush was too stiff/hard and therefore was not user friendly on the skin. I took this information to heart and purchased this product; people did not complain about the jute being too stiff or irritating. It takes me about 15-20 minutes to do a body brushing. It feels great. I hope it is helping my lymphatic system.</li>
            <li> Nice brush.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to hold in my hand</li>
            <li> I have never owned a product like this before. It&#x27;s truly amazing for getting dead skin off, and all of the other hundred things it does. It feels great and really works.</li>
            <li> I was new to body brushing when I ordered this brush. It was ther perfect choice for me. I like the longer handle on this brush and as I stated thisd is the perfect starter brush. I have since moved up to the medium brush and if I had started there I probably would not have stuck with  body brushing since the medium is a definite difference. All in all very happy with this purchase. Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very different from the standard brushes I&#x27;ve used in the past for dry skin brushing. It&#x27;s a lot more bendy, flexible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the way the bristles feels on my skin, but I do wish the handle was a bit more sturdy. Sometimes, it just slips or rolls out of my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT get this brush wet, as it&#x27;s intended for dry use only. Do be sure to disinfect it periodically with a disinfectant, non-toxic spray to keep it fresh.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush.  I&#x27;ve only had it a few days.  It feels so good on the skin.  I&#x27;ve used other brushes before and they left me red and hurting.  This, of course, leave a slight glowing to the skin - which is expected, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.  I will hang this in my spare bedroom with my other merben brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush now for a couple weeks, and it is really a pleasure!  Makes your skin very silky, much better than a loofah or scrub.  I&#x27;m glad I decided to give dry brushing a try.</li>
