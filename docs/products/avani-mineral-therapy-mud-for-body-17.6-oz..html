            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE Avani products!</li>
            <li>I love the way this mask smooths on.</li>
            <li>I have to say I was expecting a bit more out of this mask.</li>
            <li>but I was able to use it on my face with no issues or bothers.</li>
            <li>I love this mud mask</li>
            <li>Leave on for about 20 minutes and then shower with just water to remove before lathering up with your favorite shower gel and</li>
            <li>I give it 3 stars, as I think this product would be a great natural product if these ingredients were not in it.  </li>
            <li>I will buy this again as it left my skin feeling clean and beautiful.</li>
            <li>but I love the product and am sure I will like my new items.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t rinse cleanly and there are no skin benefits afterwards.</li>
            <li>Due to the drying it was balling it up almost making it more as an effective scrub rather than mud mask.</li>
            <li>It immediately brought fresh blood to my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>The Dead Sea&#x27;s minerals have been used for centuries to rejuvinate and achieve younger, more beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>It cleans my skin completely and makes it feel amazingly smooth.</li>
            <li>it was drying before I was able to lay it on evenly and properly.</li>
            <li>The reason anyone would use these mud masks is to remove toxins and impurities in the skin, so it&#x27;s pretty counter-productive to add toxins into the product.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>As a body mask it is really refreshing to the skin especially my legs and arms.</li>
            <li>It was refreshing and fast acting.  </li>
            <li>I felt no different after using this product it only made for more clean up.</li>
            <li>the 2-bromo... and the DMDM... are considered to be toxic to a certain extent and have been used in cosmetics as a preservative and antimicrobial, as I did a search on them on the internet.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t personally recommend purchasing this when you can get a  good amount of bentonite clay that can be just as effective if not better!!!</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t foresee myself doing a full-body mud treatment at home very often.</li>
            <li>It is VERY drying.</li>
            <li>Amazing price for a lot of product it helped with my live acne to reduce redness and soften my fave by removing dead skin.</li>
            <li>Was able to use my previous Avani on my face.</li>
            <li>I mainly ordered  this product for that reason.</li>
            <li>Something must have changed because the new one indicates it cannot be used on the face.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used any of my new Avani purchases</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this dead sea mineral mask!</li>
            <li>It is real mud from the Dead Sea full of minerals and salts that sooth your skin as well as your soul.</li>
            <li>Once applied, it flakes all over the place and makes a huge mess.</li>
            <li>It dries too fast for proper application.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also labeled not to use on the face and near eyes</li>
            <li>Makes your skin really soft after exfoliate.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> love it! It is not for face but I do use it occassionally to scare my kids! I call it the mummy mask</li>
            <li> [...]  The finest Dead Sea cosmetics and beauty products based on natural ingredients found only in the Dead Sea.  The Dead Sea&#x27;s minerals have been used for centuries to rejuvinate and achieve younger, more beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product at all. It dries too fast for proper application. Once applied, it flakes all over the place and makes a huge mess. Finally, it feels like dirt harvested from someone&#x27;s back yard. It doesn&#x27;t rinse cleanly and there are no skin benefits afterwards.</li>
            <li> Great! Amazing price for a lot of product it helped with my live acne to reduce redness and soften my fave by removing dead skin. I used it on my brothers and they loved it, amazing will buy again!</li>
            <li> I love the way this mask smooths on. It feels ge&#x3D;reat on my skin as it dries. It cleans my skin completely and makes it feel amazingly smooth.</li>
            <li> Great for oily or problem skin!</li>
            <li> As I began to place the product on my skin it was drying before I was able to lay it on evenly and properly. Due to the drying it was balling it up almost making it more as an effective scrub rather than mud mask. I have to say I was expecting a bit more out of this mask. It&#x27;s also labeled not to use on the face and near eyes but I was able to use it on my face with no issues or bothers. I felt no different after using this product it only made for more clean up. At it&#x27;s price I wouldn&#x27;t personally recommend purchasing this when you can get a  good amount of bentonite clay that can be just as effective if not better!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered it because it said in the description it was for the face. I don&#x27;t plan to use the mud any where else. this was useless to me. It maybe a good produce for the intended use though...</li>
            <li> Thought it was a facial mask not a body treatment</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Makes your skin really soft after exfoliate. And has a little tingly burn when you apply. I&#x27;ve seen cheaper variations that work the same. The price for the quanity is unbeatable. As well as quality.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this mineral therapy mud, and should have looked up the 2 chemical ingredients listed at the end of the 4 ingredients before I purchased it, as they are posted in the description of this product on Amazon.  Both the 2-bromo... and the DMDM... are considered to be toxic to a certain extent and have been used in cosmetics as a preservative and antimicrobial, as I did a search on them on the internet.  It is banned for use in EU cosmetics.  I looked at different sites.  I give it 3 stars, as I think this product would be a great natural product if these ingredients were not in it.  The reason anyone would use these mud masks is to remove toxins and impurities in the skin, so it&#x27;s pretty counter-productive to add toxins into the product.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment for the Avani product line with the best re-sealable containers for the mud and sea salt body treatment</li>
            <li> Have not used this particular product yet, but I have used Dead Sea mud from other companies and it leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling soft and smooth. I don&#x27;t like waiting for it to dry,  but that&#x27;s part of the process.</li>
            <li> Was able to use my previous Avani on my face. Something must have changed because the new one indicates it cannot be used on the face. I mainly ordered  this product for that reason. However, nothing was mentioned online.&lt;br /&gt;I am still giving it 3 stars because it is a good product.</li>
            <li> I got the product used it on my face after 10 mins I could see the oily pus from my face come up to the surface  of the wet mud.&lt;br /&gt;I love it!!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for a mud mask treatment for the face.  Did not know until I received it that you can NOT use it on your face.  Dissappointing since I searched &amp;#34;face mask&amp;#34; on Amazon and this popped up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 2 stars because I did use it on my body and it worked well.  I just don&#x27;t foresee myself doing a full-body mud treatment at home very often.</li>
            <li> I know it says don&#x27;t use on your face, but I had to try it. It is VERY drying. So used it on body with same results.</li>
            <li> I love this mud mask but it is not for your face but your body only. As a body mask it is really refreshing to the skin especially my legs and arms. I have been having a problem with dry skin and this mud mask helped to exfoliate my skin to prep before a moisturizing massage. It is real mud from the Dead Sea full of minerals and salts that sooth your skin as well as your soul. Generously put it all over your body but especially your legs and arms. Leave on for about 20 minutes and then shower with just water to remove before lathering up with your favorite shower gel and then a good moisturizer to follow. I will buy this again as it left my skin feeling clean and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face instead of use it on my body.  I don&#x27;t know if it is the psychological reason, I feel like my skin on my face firm after I use it.</li>
            <li> My experience with this product was good.  It immediately brought fresh blood to my face and neck.  It was refreshing and fast acting.  I purchased this product at a discount and it delivered what I expected.</li>
            <li> This mud makes my skin feel great. and It cost a lot less than going to the spa and saves me lots of money.</li>
            <li> love this! only down side, you cant use it on your face</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this dead sea mineral mask! I use it on my face 3-4 times a week and it has truly improved the appearance and overall texture of my skin! I just cannot get enough of it! Women of all ages can use this mask and see amazing results! I also recommend pairing this product with Avani&#x27;s Skin Renewal Facial Peel. This feel removes all of your dead skin and makes you face so soft! LOVE LOVE LOVE Avani products!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any of my new Avani purchases but I love the product and am sure I will like my new items.</li>
            <li> I PUT ON THIS PRODUCT AND  AFTER 10 MINUTES I START FEELING MY FACE TIGHTER AND IN 15 MINUTES  IT FEELS VERY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIGHT. I FEEL I  AM DOING A LIFT UP --SURGERY ---  I LEAVE IT ON FOR  1/2 HR TO 45 MINUTES</li>
