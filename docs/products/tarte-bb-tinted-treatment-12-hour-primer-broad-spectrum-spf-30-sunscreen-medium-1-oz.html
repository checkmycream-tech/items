            <li>Wonderful product!</li>
            <li>Tarte line of cosmetics are awesome!</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have flawless skin.  </li>
            <li>The best there is.</li>
            <li>Tarte products are generally very good.</li>
            <li>This product is GREAT.</li>
            <li>It gives great coverage.  </li>
            <li>Works great on my oily acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS GREAT FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS OILY SKIN.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it wears very nicely for about 7-8 hrs</li>
            <li>I recommend this as a good summer foundation.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this purchase and will buy again.</li>
            <li>Love how this just whisps on!</li>
            <li>Primer is really lovely on your face!  </li>
            <li>I was kind giving it two stars.</li>
            <li>It feels kind of greasy on my fingers</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say that the color tends warm.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t even feel the need to add a tinted powder on top, which I ALWAYS do when wearing BB cream or tinted moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I have good skin and like it to show through not a face full of makeup.</li>
            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s so blendable, buildable, and contains SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m more like an NC35 now.  </li>
            <li>I do use a translucent finishing powder on top</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this BB cream.</li>
            <li>It also leaves a satin matte finish and has pretty good coverage.  </li>
            <li>I do lightly dust my face with Cover FX pressed mineral foundation in N50, and I love the coverage and wear of</li>
            <li>this BB cream by tarte is the best one!i purchased 3 other brands and they can&#x27;t compare to tarte.</li>
            <li>The light was too light on me, but the medium is perfection.</li>
            <li>I use the medium shade as I&#x27;m light beige/olive skinned.</li>
            <li>Stopped using it and skin almost blemish free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s oil free and doesn&#x27;t break me out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a bit darker than Smashbox Light Medium.  </li>
            <li>Lasting power is great.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth</li>
            <li>It feels light on my skin.  </li>
            <li>goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t break me out</li>
            <li>The cheap ones are not as silky as this one and it lasts forever.</li>
            <li>the tint is just sufficient to cover without lookint too heavy and the SPF 30 sunscreen is wonderful protection from the sun.  </li>
            <li>Can be used as primer underneath your foundation for full coverage or you can wear it alone as a lightweight foundation.</li>
            <li>this is my new FAV!!!!</li>
            <li>tarte has such amazing makeup.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This wears nicely though I do not think it last 12 hours on me.  </li>
            <li>but I love the coverage and it feels so velvety soft.</li>
            <li>but it offers more coverage than a tinted moisturizer and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy once it has set.  </li>
            <li>pure magi#!</li>
            <li>Good product definitely helps keep things clear.</li>
            <li>(I use a Tarte foundation brush I already own) and it creates a perfectly smooth surface that hides blemishes and uneven skin.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth and spreads really well(so much easier than the foundations I have tried).  </li>
            <li>goes on so smooth and looks so natural the others are waxy and don&#x27;t cover well.</li>
            <li>My go-to BB cream for the past year has been Smashbox but this one leaves more coverage and has more of a silky feeling going on.</li>
            <li>I like that it has a higher SPF than some BB creams on the market.</li>
            <li>It minimizes my large pores and covers any redness.</li>
            <li>I really like the way this feels on my skin</li>
            <li>and I really like this one.  </li>
            <li>I have been using my Real Techniques Expert Face Brush to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It lasts really well.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>It goes on silky smooth and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love Smashbox too, but I like that this product has a bit more coverage.  </li>
            <li>At the moment, the Smashbox Light Medium BB cream is slightly too light, so i&#x27;m thinking that I&#x27;ll switch back to Smashbox in the dryer weather.  </li>
            <li>Normally I&#x27;m about an NC 25-30</li>
            <li>(the only Asian one I have tried, but too light for me and breaks me out)</li>
            <li>Very natural look.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Leaves a natural matte finish and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>The texture is silky and the Medium shade blends in seamlessly.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>It is the one of the few western bb creams I tried and love it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While it won&#x27;t fully conceal breakouts and redness (I use a separate concealer for any troublesome spots), this has been a wonderful &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; base product for me.</li>
            <li>Only downside is that it&#x27;s not great for on the go, because it works much better when applied by hand than with a foundation brush, and it requires soap and water to get it off your hands or everything you touch will have a make up</li>
            <li>I ordered &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; for a little color as I&#x27;m pretty fair-skinned</li>

            <li> I ordered &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; for a little color as I&#x27;m pretty fair-skinned</li>
            <li> It regularly retails for $34 and for some unknown reason, it&#x27;s almost double that on here, so save yourself some money (plus it&#x27;s sold third party on here, and those types of companies are known for diluting/altering product to make an extra buck!)</li>
            <li> big minus is that the color range has only 4 colors.  </li>
            <li> I dab a little concealer under my eyes and over any dark spots, then smooth this over my entire face (again, a small bead of product goes a long way), and then add blush/bronzer/highlighter after that depending on the occasion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time...</li>
            <li> A little too yellow for me</li>
            <li> I do wear a regular suscreen under this, because this is expensive to really slather generously all over face, neck and exposed chest.  </li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t broken out, and my skin seems very nourished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;ll be too dark for me from late Fall through early Spring.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> (I am very careful to use a hydrating serum every morning, and my skin tens towards slightly oily rather than dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too dark for me</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s way too dark</li>
            <li> It feels a little thick/greasy when you put it on, but give it a minute to penetrate your skin, and you&#x27;ll be glowing and won&#x27;t need any other powders/foundations.</li>
            <li> (usually Tarte Primed and Poreless loose powder), as I do with all foundation products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got some sun damage, a few lines and dark spots from a medication I take.  </li>
            <li> this is too heavy for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few BB creams</li>
            <li> Its feels too heavy on my face</li>
            <li> I put four small dots less than the size of a pencil eraser tip.  </li>
            <li> Only reason I gave it 4 stars was because I chose the wrong shade.</li>
            <li> Goes on like a dream and looks like expensive foundation.  </li>
            <li> and I look weird.</li>
            <li> product would recommend it  too expensive send me some coupons</li>
            <li> very disappointing:(</li>
            <li> I hate wearing it.  </li>
            <li> and I hate the way it settles into my lines.  </li>
            <li> Beware this product made my face breakout terribly.  </li>

            <li> Good product definitely helps keep things clear.</li>
            <li> this BB cream by tarte is the best one!i purchased 3 other brands and they can&#x27;t compare to tarte. this BB cream is perfect. goes on so smooth and looks so natural the others are waxy and don&#x27;t cover well. this is my new FAV!!!! i would tell anyone to try it. i truly believe in this product. tarte has such amazing makeup.</li>
            <li> Love how this just whisps on! No dragging or pulling on the skin.....pure magi#!</li>
            <li> Would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> This product is GREAT. It feels a little thick/greasy when you put it on, but give it a minute to penetrate your skin, and you&#x27;ll be glowing and won&#x27;t need any other powders/foundations. Very natural look. Only downside is that it&#x27;s not great for on the go, because it works much better when applied by hand than with a foundation brush, and it requires soap and water to get it off your hands or everything you touch will have a make up print.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this all summer and it has blocked the sun, I haven&#x27;t broken out, and my skin seems very nourished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT.... It regularly retails for $34 and for some unknown reason, it&#x27;s almost double that on here, so save yourself some money (plus it&#x27;s sold third party on here, and those types of companies are known for diluting/altering product to make an extra buck!)</li>
            <li> Tarte BB Tinted Treatment 12- hour Primer is really lovely on your face!  Goes on like a dream and looks like expensive foundation.  Has all the added benefits of sunscreen and complexion refinement.  Wonderful product! The light was too light on me, but the medium is perfection.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this feels on my skin and it dries matte but it&#x27;s non drying to me (I am very careful to use a hydrating serum every morning, and my skin tens towards slightly oily rather than dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wears nicely though I do not think it last 12 hours on me.  I&#x27;d say it wears very nicely for about 7-8 hrs and it beings to fade from there.  I do lightly dust my face with Cover FX pressed mineral foundation in N50, and I love the coverage and wear of these two together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I am out during the day I do wear a regular suscreen under this, because this is expensive to really slather generously all over face, neck and exposed chest.  I wear EltaMD&#x27;s Physical Sunscreen (SPF41)  under this bb cream and they go well together.</li>
            <li> One tube lasted over a year with almost daily use. A little goes a long way and I love that it&#x27;s so blendable, buildable, and contains SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it won&#x27;t fully conceal breakouts and redness (I use a separate concealer for any troublesome spots), this has been a wonderful &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; base product for me. I dab a little concealer under my eyes and over any dark spots, then smooth this over my entire face (again, a small bead of product goes a long way), and then add blush/bronzer/highlighter after that depending on the occasion. It goes on silky smooth and lasts all day long. I use the medium shade as I&#x27;m light beige/olive skinned.</li>
            <li> Only reason I gave it 4 stars was because I chose the wrong shade. It&#x27;s just too dark for me but I love the coverage and it feels so velvety soft. Would definitely buy again, this time though in a lighter shade</li>
            <li> This item sported a hefty price, but didn&#x27;t do anything it said it would. Moisturizing? Nope.  Softening wrinkles? Not at all- as a matter of fact seemed to accent them. Even had breakouts after I used it. Def. not a keeper.</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking I was getting what was pictured (BB cream) but I got the smallest tube of sunscreen instead.... very disappointing:(</li>
            <li> A little too yellow for me</li>
            <li> Tarte line of cosmetics are awesome! Like the BB cream, especially it coverage and that it has SPF. I ordered &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; for a little color as I&#x27;m pretty fair-skinned but it&#x27;s way too dark and I look weird. Will definitely order the lighter version next time.</li>
            <li> when I think of bb cream I think of sheer to medium consistency. this is too heavy for me. I feel like I was wearing a mask. I have good skin and like it to show through not a face full of makeup. I was kind giving it two stars.</li>
            <li> It is the one of the few western bb creams I tried and love it.  It gives great coverage.  It minimizes my large pores and covers any redness. Leaves a natural matte finish and lasts all day.  The texture is silky and the Medium shade blends in seamlessly.  Works great on my oily acne prone skin.  Can be used as primer underneath your foundation for full coverage or you can wear it alone as a lightweight foundation.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Leaves skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Beware this product made my face breakout terribly.  Stopped using it and skin almost blemish free.</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few BB creams and I really like this one.  It&#x27;s oil free and doesn&#x27;t break me out.  It also leaves a satin matte finish and has pretty good coverage.  Honestly, I don&#x27;t even feel the need to add a tinted powder on top, which I ALWAYS do when wearing BB cream or tinted moisturizer.  My go-to BB cream for the past year has been Smashbox but this one leaves more coverage and has more of a silky feeling going on. It feels kind of greasy on my fingers but once it sets, it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy on the skin.  For this \\&quot;texture\\&quot; reason, I prefer applying this product with a brush.  I have been using my Real Techniques Expert Face Brush to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not feel like Missha BB cream going on (the only Asian one I have tried, but too light for me and breaks me out) but it offers more coverage than a tinted moisturizer and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy once it has set.  I have been using the medium color.  Normally I&#x27;m about an NC 25-30 but I have tanned a bit so I&#x27;m more like an NC35 now.  I&#x27;d say that the color medium runs a touch darker than the medium in the Amazonian Clay foundation.  It&#x27;s also a bit darker than Smashbox Light Medium.  I&#x27;d say that the color tends warm.  It lasts really well.  I do use a translucent finishing powder on top (usually Tarte Primed and Poreless loose powder), as I do with all foundation products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big minus is that the color range has only 4 colors.  I think it&#x27;ll be too dark for me from late Fall through early Spring.  At the moment, the Smashbox Light Medium BB cream is slightly too light, so i&#x27;m thinking that I&#x27;ll switch back to Smashbox in the dryer weather.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love Smashbox too, but I like that this product has a bit more coverage.  Lasting power is great.  I recommend this as a good summer foundation.</li>
            <li> THIS IS GREAT FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS OILY SKIN.  PUT IT ON AND DON&#x27;T WORRY ABOUT IT.  IT STAYS WITH YOU FOR LONGER THAN 12 HOURS</li>
            <li> Wow! This works so well you don&#x27;t need to put a foundation over it. I bought it thinking it would just hold my foundation in place, but it actually has taken its place. It goes on smooth (I use a Tarte foundation brush I already own) and it creates a perfectly smooth surface that hides blemishes and uneven skin. I like that it has a higher SPF than some BB creams on the market. I will rebuy this product.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to change my foundation.  I hate wearing it.  Its feels too heavy on my face and I hate the way it settles into my lines.  I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s so I don&#x27;t have flawless skin.  I&#x27;ve got some sun damage, a few lines and dark spots from a medication I take.  I read up on this Tarte creme and decided to give it a try.  I absolutely love it.  It feels light on my skin.  Not exactly sheer, but it does give me enough coverage to blend in my imperfections without feeling caked on like my regular foundation wear.  I tend to have oily skin - especially in the T-zone and this mattes it up for about 5 hours before I start to see any shine.  The shine is no where compared to before.  I used to literally blot my skin every hour.  I maybe have to do this 2/3 times during the day now.  I have been wearing the medium color as I have a tan at this time.  I will have to go to a lighter version in winter.  It goes on so smooth and spreads really well(so much easier than the foundations I have tried).  I put four small dots less than the size of a pencil eraser tip.  And it spreads evenly across my face.  Coverage lasts me about 8 hours.  I am very pleased with this purchase and will buy again.</li>
            <li> goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t break me out&lt;br /&gt;great product would recommend it  too expensive send me some coupons thanks</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream. The best there is. The cheap ones are not as silky as this one and it lasts forever. No need for makeup especially if you use setting powder after. I only buy this brand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time...the tint is just sufficient to cover without lookint too heavy and the SPF 30 sunscreen is wonderful protection from the sun.  Tarte products are generally very good.</li>
