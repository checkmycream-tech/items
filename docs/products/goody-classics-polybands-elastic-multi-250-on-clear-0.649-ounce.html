            <li>He is very pleased with them.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these elastic bands!</li>
            <li>I used to LOVE these hair bands!</li>
            <li>Cute hair dos again!</li>
            <li>If I want to avoid ripping a clump of hair out of my girls&#x27; hair, I have to cut them out, Which avoids most pain, but is not without risk! )</li>
            <li>Love the sizing!</li>
            <li>great product, size is perfect for daughter&#x27;s braids and tying back bangs when needed.  </li>
            <li>They spontaneously break during the day.  </li>
            <li>These rubber bands are great for special hairstyles.</li>
            <li>Really hard-to-find in stores and amazing price!!</li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t snap very easily</li>
            <li>These break very easily.  </li>
            <li>They are very easy to remove/pull afterwards and we can still use them again.</li>
            <li>They work perfectly on my 8year old.</li>
            <li>Goody used to make the best clear, poly elastic hair bands - they didn&#x27;t break, could be used again, and never pulled or grabbed the hair.  </li>
            <li>These elastics snap so easily!</li>
            <li>I use them more on my barrette clasps to add &#x27;grip&#x27;</li>
            <li>they do the job, but consider them as deposable; you won&#x27;t get more than one use out of them, if that.</li>
            <li>I am baffled as to why they would ruin such a great formula, unless it was too good, and they felt they needed to make something more disposable to get more repeat purchases.</li>
            <li>Better than ones in the store</li>
            <li>When doing more intricate braids or updos, these are a must.</li>
            <li>These ones are especially nice because this package comes with various sizes.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re okay, but they&#x27;re not as stretchy as I would like.  </li>
            <li>I love these for my daughters hair.</li>
            <li>The quality of these elastics are just okay.</li>
            <li>I used to buy these all the time, they were durable, I could use them more than once, they were perfect with the different sizes.</li>
            <li>These are at best a single use hair tie.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the trendy fold-over fabric that everyone loves right now.</li>
            <li>These elastics are great for my 18 month old.</li>
            <li>I agree with other reviewers that the formula has changed from top-notch to unacceptable.  </li>
            <li>The original package I had bought my daughter a couple of years ago lasted forever because you could re-use the bands many times, and they did not &#x27;grab&#x27; her hair at all.</li>
            <li>just put an order in for the Blax bands and hope they will be more like the original Goody bands.</li>
            <li>They do not break easily.</li>
            <li>They break easily.</li>
            <li>They just stretch out too easily.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair.  </li>
            <li>They are perfect to use for when you don&#x27;t want to have a bulky and visible hair tie in your style, like for small side braids, etc. :)</li>
            <li>I use this to braid my little girls&#x27; hair and they work perfectly every time.</li>
            <li>If we find one of the old-style bands in our hair drawer, it is a guarded treasure.  </li>
            <li>They have gone the cheap route on these  </li>
            <li>that was far superior.</li>
            <li>Great price on a very useful product in several sizes.  </li>
            <li>Great for your little ones fine hair!  </li>
            <li>They hold well but remove fairly cleanly without much hair pulling since they are more plasticky than rubbery.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-They are only good for one use</li>
            <li>I bought these as a filler on a month when I didn&#x27;t have enough subscriptions to get a good S&amp;S discount.</li>
            <li>I tend to lose them fairly quickly anyways.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this multipack of clear bands!!</li>
            <li>These do not break easily and I have had them a good few months before running out.</li>
            <li>Although I like the clear look more than black for my lighter colored hair, just can&#x27;t win sometimes.</li>
            <li>and if I am able to apply the band then it snaps spontaneously within a few hours of wear.</li>
            <li>I love the clear color, so that when I put a bow in you don&#x27;t see the rubber band.</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>The other reviews are exactly right, these are not as good as they used to be.</li>
            <li>These worked great for different fun styles and come out easier than similar elastics.</li>
            <li>The last batch I bought at a store that were the same brand we&#x27;re great, I could reuse them over and over until I lost them.</li>
            <li>I wish there were more of the smaller size, but I knew that going in.</li>
            <li>The bands break during the first use almost every time, without being touched.</li>
            <li>I usually just use the medium sized ones but the larger ones work great for me!</li>
            <li>Most of these hair ties broke WHILE I was putting them in for the first time, and the of them broke shortly after being worn.</li>
            <li>(My three-year-old all but refuses to let me touch her head thanks to these bands!</li>
            <li>Some on the first wear.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the trade off for a tear free rubberband removal later.</li>
            <li>Good price, lots of bands, can use for different purposes with the different sizes.</li>
            <li>I so far have not gotten a full wear out of any band.</li>
            <li>I will say that they don&#x27;t seem as strong as the colored ones, and are made of a slightly different material, so they break easier.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t strong enough to hold anything except maybe baby hair.</li>
            <li>Worked great on my daughters really thick hair!</li>
            <li>Bobby pins don&#x27;t stay in my or my daughters hair, so these really help with certain hairstyles.</li>
            <li>I use them all the time on my little girls&#x27; hair, as well as my own.</li>
            <li>Now they stretch soooooo much that they don&#x27;t even hold her hair at all, even when doubling up.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-They stretch too much</li>
            <li>They hold your hair well and can&#x27;t really be seen.</li>
            <li>For one thing, they are much stretchier, plus, they are very grabby when you try to pull them out.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think Goody could have done a worse job at creating bands, especially since they used to make the best ones out there!  </li>
            <li>I do love that they are clear and come in different sizes (which is why I gave 2 stars instead of 1).  </li>
            <li>other clear bands will break when you tie them tight but these are awesome.</li>
            <li>I have a hard time finding clear elastics in stores, so I was excited to find these for such a great price.</li>
            <li>I really wish Goody would listen and change it back to the original, stronger bands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased other brands that are much better.</li>
            <li>This last bunch that I bought barely lasts a couple of hours before breaking and this is coming from someone who has pretty fine hair.</li>
            <li>Goody Womens Classic Polyband Elastics 52CT - Color:</li>
            <li>They are hard to get out because they kind of stick to your hair, but hey that&#x27;s the point.</li>
            <li>They are ok holding up a tiny tuft on my one year old, but my 3 year old constantly looks like she just got in a fight with a hairbrush.</li>
            <li>On my fine silver hair these tend to be too &#x27;grabby&#x27; and pull/break my hair when I remove them, and use them only occasionally when a hair tie must be hidden.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The new formula is JUNK.  </li>
            <li>I could never never never recommend these with new formula.  </li>
            <li>I bought a new package a couple of months ago.</li>
            <li>The previous set I bought lasted years, as they were reusable infinitely until I lost them all (which is easy to do).</li>
            <li>These work great for small braids and hairstyles that need hidden bands.  </li>
            <li>They are strong and stretch, plus they last a long time.  </li>
            <li>I have had several snap in my hands when first trying to put them on.  </li>
            <li>its so easy now to do the little ones hair.</li>
            <li>Once stretched out, they do not go back to their original shape.</li>
            <li>These are really hard to find for little girls hair, so I was happy to find them here.</li>
            <li>I have two little girls who have superfine hair.</li>
            <li>Because it is clear I couldn&#x27;t see that she had put it on her wrist.  </li>
            <li>WAYYY over priced, but clear &amp; functional...</li>
            <li>bought these because they were clear</li>
            <li>They stretch too much and can&#x27;t be used a second time.</li>
            <li>If your child is young and takes them out of her hair, I would recommend that you don&#x27;t use these.  </li>
            <li>After nearly a decade of of using Goody&#x27;s bands, this customer is taking her business elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised I ever said they didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>PLEASE bring back old formula!!!  </li>
            <li>I noticed a complete change in formula/quality when I bought them earlier this year.  </li>
            <li>I also use them for my young daughter and the same thing happens to her.</li>
            <li>The other Goody bands I have had in the past were way better.</li>
            <li>My son wanted clear hair bands so he could control his long hair.  </li>
            <li>Just had one pop out of my hair this morning (in a small pony with the right size elastic).</li>
            <li>Nearly every single one breaks.</li>
            <li>I thought that I just got a bad batch and gave them the benefit of the doubt since I&#x27;ve loved them forever.</li>

            <li> I really wish Goody would listen and change it back to the original, stronger bands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other brands that are much better.</li>
            <li> This last bunch that I bought barely lasts a couple of hours before breaking and this is coming from someone who has pretty fine hair.</li>
            <li> Goody Womens Classic Polyband Elastics 52CT - Color:</li>
            <li> They are hard to get out because they kind of stick to your hair, but hey that&#x27;s the point.</li>
            <li> They are ok holding up a tiny tuft on my one year old, but my 3 year old constantly looks like she just got in a fight with a hairbrush.</li>
            <li> On my fine silver hair these tend to be too &#x27;grabby&#x27; and pull/break my hair when I remove them, and use them only occasionally when a hair tie must be hidden.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The new formula is JUNK.  </li>
            <li> I could never never never recommend these with new formula.  </li>
            <li> I bought a new package a couple of months ago.</li>
            <li> The previous set I bought lasted years, as they were reusable infinitely until I lost them all (which is easy to do).</li>
            <li> These work great for small braids and hairstyles that need hidden bands.  </li>
            <li> They are strong and stretch, plus they last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have had several snap in my hands when first trying to put them on.  </li>
            <li> its so easy now to do the little ones hair.</li>
            <li> Once stretched out, they do not go back to their original shape.</li>
            <li> These are really hard to find for little girls hair, so I was happy to find them here.</li>
            <li> I have two little girls who have superfine hair.</li>
            <li> Because it is clear I couldn&#x27;t see that she had put it on her wrist.  </li>
            <li> WAYYY over priced, but clear &amp; functional...</li>
            <li> bought these because they were clear</li>
            <li> They stretch too much and can&#x27;t be used a second time.</li>
            <li> If your child is young and takes them out of her hair, I would recommend that you don&#x27;t use these.  </li>
            <li> After nearly a decade of of using Goody&#x27;s bands, this customer is taking her business elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised I ever said they didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> PLEASE bring back old formula!!!  </li>
            <li> I noticed a complete change in formula/quality when I bought them earlier this year.  </li>
            <li> I also use them for my young daughter and the same thing happens to her.</li>
            <li> The other Goody bands I have had in the past were way better.</li>
            <li> My son wanted clear hair bands so he could control his long hair.  </li>
            <li> Just had one pop out of my hair this morning (in a small pony with the right size elastic).</li>
            <li> Nearly every single one breaks.</li>
            <li> I thought that I just got a bad batch and gave them the benefit of the doubt since I&#x27;ve loved them forever.</li>
            <li> These work really well in small children&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> They do have a slight natural stretch to them, so they are accommodating.</li>
            <li> I. They used to be thick and able to hold all of my thick waist length hair up.</li>
            <li> I hope they get their crap together, I really did love these.</li>
            <li> I am white, and my hair is thick, but not excessively so.</li>
            <li> I put two in this morning and one popped an hour in then the other a couple hours later.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for to keep my thin hair back in a partial braid without seeing a large bulky hair tie.</li>
            <li> These little bands break after only one use.  </li>
            <li> but they didn&#x27;t last through a few hours of preschool without breaking.</li>
            <li> They are one time use, which is to be expected.  </li>
            <li> They are somewhat hard to work with, but only because they&#x27;re small and clear (what would you expect?).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These are cheap but not worth your time or the frustration of looking like a crazy haired fool...</li>
            <li> They look exactly the same, but unfortunately the new bands are completely useless.</li>
            <li> I try to switch to a ponytail, and the other one breaks the moment it&#x27;s touched.</li>
            <li> They work well, and are extremely inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> and the are small enough to hold what little hair she has.</li>
            <li> So far none have broken, they do stretch</li>
            <li> These broke about an hour after putting my hair up, and I have very thin, straight hair.  </li>
            <li> They only work with very small amounts of hair...</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t slip on me when I use them for half ups.</li>
            <li> These however, are one time use, and half the time they break while holding my hair.</li>
            <li> Black - 2 Packs]]</li>
            <li> These bands will stretch out and break after a few use.</li>
            <li> They have broken on me in the middle of my day leaving me stranded.  </li>
            <li> These seem like they&#x27;d only hold up for people with thin hair.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> She isn&#x27;t afraid of the pain to take them off like the old elastics.</li>
            <li> The quality of the bands seems to have changed in the past couple of years.</li>
            <li> They are slick and the band itself it rectangular.</li>
            <li> They snap randomly in the middle of the day.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> snap (sometimes hours after being placed in the hair, at the most inopportune times when you don&#x27;t have a replacement)&lt;br /&gt;-Worst of all, they are PAINFUL and DESTRUCTIVE to hair</li>
            <li> These are very stiff for hair elastics.</li>
            <li> Ones you buy in the store will stretch but hardly break.</li>
            <li> They are thick</li>
            <li> Unless you have thick hair these will fall out.</li>
            <li> Heck, I have thick curly hair and these fell out of mine!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These bands are not good for thick hair.</li>
            <li> Use with care or you will be shooting broken bands all over the place.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have thin hair, don&#x27;t even think about using these.</li>
            <li> Broken by the end of the school day</li>
            <li> Sadly, these break at least 50% of the time.</li>
            <li> Frustrating!</li>
            <li> The smallest elastic size is useless though.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> Sorry, Goody!</li>
            <li> In fact, my daughter refuses to wear a ponytail now with these bands because it&#x27;s so painful to take out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am SO disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Now they are the WORST.  </li>
            <li> The replacement box is AWFUL.</li>
            <li> Awful bands.</li>
            <li> Kids hate them, and I do too!  </li>
            <li> These are awful.  </li>
            <li> Awful!</li>
            <li> These are awful...</li>
            <li> Horrible product.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not the same as ones you buy at the local store like target or drugstore. These bands will stretch out and break after a few use. Ones you buy in the store will stretch but hardly break.</li>
            <li> On my fine silver hair these tend to be too &#x27;grabby&#x27; and pull/break my hair when I remove them, and use them only occasionally when a hair tie must be hidden.&lt;br /&gt;*If anything....I use them more on my barrette clasps to add &#x27;grip&#x27; so they don&#x27;t slip on me when I use them for half ups.</li>
            <li> These elastics snap so easily! they do the job, but consider them as deposable; you won&#x27;t get more than one use out of them, if that.</li>
            <li> These are great! I have a hard time finding clear elastics in stores, so I was excited to find these for such a great price. I wish there were more of the smaller size, but I knew that going in. Otherwise, great product and as described.</li>
            <li> Was the BEST.  Now they are the WORST.  These were the ONLY ones I would buy.  I noticed a complete change in formula/quality when I bought them earlier this year.  The elastic does not hold.  I have fine hair.  They have broken on me in the middle of my day leaving me stranded.  The new formula is JUNK.  I could never never never recommend these with new formula.  PLEASE bring back old formula!!!  Otherwise you lost a customer and recommender for life.</li>
            <li> I have two little girls who have superfine hair. These worked great for different fun styles and come out easier than similar elastics.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers that the formula has changed from top-notch to unacceptable.  The previous set I bought lasted years, as they were reusable infinitely until I lost them all (which is easy to do). The replacement box is AWFUL. The bands break during the first use almost every time, without being touched. I have a pigtail, and then suddenly I don&#x27;t.  I try to switch to a ponytail, and the other one breaks the moment it&#x27;s touched. I am baffled as to why they would ruin such a great formula, unless it was too good, and they felt they needed to make something more disposable to get more repeat purchases. Well, I won&#x27;t be repeating.</li>
            <li> These bands are not good for thick hair. I only use them to hold the tips of a braid together but they snap when applying and if I am able to apply the band then it snaps spontaneously within a few hours of wear. I have tried to double the bands for reinforcement but it doesn&#x27;t help any. I so far have not gotten a full wear out of any band.</li>
            <li> They work perfectly on my 8year old.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these elastic bands! I use them all the time! Great purchase!</li>
            <li> I use these for my toddler. They work great and hold up. I didn&#x27;t know three different sizes were included. I usually just use the medium sized ones but the larger ones work great for me!</li>
            <li> The other reviews are exactly right, these are not as good as they used to be. They stretch too much and can&#x27;t be used a second time. Frustrating!</li>
            <li> Better than ones in the store</li>
            <li> These little bands break after only one use.  Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> great product, size is perfect for daughter&#x27;s braids and tying back bangs when needed.  We used a different brand cause it was cheaper and had to go back to goody.  you can feel the difference in holding power.</li>
            <li> Great for your little ones fine hair!  I love the clear color, so that when I put a bow in you don&#x27;t see the rubber band.</li>
            <li> These rubber bands are great for special hairstyles. When doing more intricate braids or updos, these are a must. Bobby pins don&#x27;t stay in my or my daughters hair, so these really help with certain hairstyles. They are hard to get out because they kind of stick to your hair, but hey that&#x27;s the point.</li>
            <li> These elastics are great for my 18 month old. They are thick so they don&#x27;t snap very easily and the are small enough to hold what little hair she has.</li>
            <li> My grand-daughter is two.  She keeps removing these from her hair.  Twice now she has put it on her wrist.  Today when she took it out of her hair in the car, I looked all over for it.  Because it is clear I couldn&#x27;t see that she had put it on her wrist.  It was about an hour later when I saw that her hand was swollen and purple.  She didn&#x27;t seem to be in any pain but it left a mark.  If your child is young and takes them out of her hair, I would recommend that you don&#x27;t use these.  Seems like an injury and law suit waiting to happen.</li>
            <li> I used to LOVE these hair bands! Worked great on my daughters really thick hair! Now they stretch soooooo much that they don&#x27;t even hold her hair at all, even when doubling up. I really wish Goody would listen and change it back to the original, stronger bands. DON&#x27;T BUY!!!</li>
            <li> Awful bands. Nearly every single one breaks.</li>
            <li> These are really hard to find for little girls hair, so I was happy to find them here. I will say that they don&#x27;t seem as strong as the colored ones, and are made of a slightly different material, so they break easier. Next time I&#x27;ll stick with the colored ones.</li>
            <li> These break very easily.  Use with care or you will be shooting broken bands all over the place.</li>
            <li> its so easy now to do the little ones hair. She isn&#x27;t afraid of the pain to take them off like the old elastics. Cute hair dos again!</li>
            <li> Not a fan. The last batch I bought at a store that were the same brand we&#x27;re great, I could reuse them over and over until I lost them. These however, are one time use, and half the time they break while holding my hair.</li>
            <li> I use these on both of my daughter&#x27;s hair. They work well, and are extremely inexpensive.  The smallest elastic size is useless though.</li>
            <li> These break after being in my hair for a couple hours.  I also use them for my young daughter and the same thing happens to her.</li>
            <li> Most of these hair ties broke WHILE I was putting them in for the first time, and the of them broke shortly after being worn. I am white, and my hair is thick, but not excessively so. These seem like they&#x27;d only hold up for people with thin hair. If you don&#x27;t have thin hair, don&#x27;t even think about using these.</li>
            <li> These bands used to be the best, now they are the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-They are only good for one use&lt;br /&gt;-They stretch too much (yes, that is surprisingly a problem)&lt;br /&gt;-They snap (sometimes hours after being placed in the hair, at the most inopportune times when you don&#x27;t have a replacement)&lt;br /&gt;-Worst of all, they are PAINFUL and DESTRUCTIVE to hair (My three-year-old all but refuses to let me touch her head thanks to these bands! If I want to avoid ripping a clump of hair out of my girls&#x27; hair, I have to cut them out, Which avoids most pain, but is not without risk! ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think Goody could have done a worse job at creating bands, especially since they used to make the best ones out there!  I am SO disappointed.  Kids hate them, and I do too!  If we find one of the old-style bands in our hair drawer, it is a guarded treasure.  Such a sad down-grade for something we used to love and use daily.  After nearly a decade of of using Goody&#x27;s bands, this customer is taking her business elsewhere.</li>
            <li> These are great, and most importantly a great value if you get them as an add-on item for $2. There&#x27;s not a lot to say about hair ties, and you can probably find these same ones at the grocery store, too. These ones are especially nice because this package comes with various sizes. They are perfect to use for when you don&#x27;t want to have a bulky and visible hair tie in your style, like for small side braids, etc. :)</li>
            <li> I am hairstylist and use these &#x27;no show&#x27; bands all the time when I want to put hair in a band, but I don&#x27;t want the band to show.  They are strong and stretch, plus they last a long time.  Once stretched out, they do not go back to their original shape.</li>
            <li> These work really well in small children&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> We use these every day on our 2-year-old&#x27;s ponytails.</li>
            <li> They only work with very small amounts of hair... I bet they would be perfect if one was using them for Barbie hair...</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay, but they&#x27;re not as stretchy as I would like.  These are very stiff for hair elastics.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like these hairbands.  I do love that they are clear and come in different sizes (which is why I gave 2 stars instead of 1).  With Goody being the go-to hair accessory brand that I grew up with, I thought they would be a quality product.  These are at best a single use hair tie.  Often they break while trying to put in your hair.  They stretch too and stay that way instead of being elastic that gives.  Anyway, I won&#x27;t be buying this brand again.  I have bought another brand at CVS (that comes in smaller packages, though) that was far superior.</li>
            <li> WAYYY over priced, but clear &amp; functional... only reason for 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I love these for my daughters hair. They hold well but remove fairly cleanly without much hair pulling since they are more plasticky than rubbery. Sometimes they fall out when she is in her car seat but it&#x27;s worth the trade off for a tear free rubberband removal later.</li>
            <li> Broken by the end of the school day</li>
            <li> I bought these as a filler on a month when I didn&#x27;t have enough subscriptions to get a good S&amp;S discount. I should have kept looking, these are terrible, I thought these would be perfect for my 4yo&#x27;s hair but they didn&#x27;t last through a few hours of preschool without breaking.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Just what I was looking for to keep my thin hair back in a partial braid without seeing a large bulky hair tie.</li>
            <li> These do not break easily and I have had them a good few months before running out.</li>
            <li> Good price, lots of bands, can use for different purposes with the different sizes. So far none have broken, they do stretch but i haven&#x27;t found any elastic bands that don&#x27;t stretch after using. I tend to lose them fairly quickly anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dec. 11, 2015 update: These hair bands break constantly I&#x27;m surprised I ever said they didn&#x27;t. Basically every time I use them I assume they will break. I only use these when it doesn&#x27;t matter, like wearing braids to bed or wearing around the house. I had also purchased [[ASIN:B00BEWYXUQ Goody Womens Classic Polyband Elastics 52CT - Color: Black - 2 Packs]] and they work great, don&#x27;t think they have ever snapped. Although I like the clear look more than black for my lighter colored hair, just can&#x27;t win sometimes.</li>
            <li> The quality of these elastics are just okay. They do not break as often as some elastics but they are definitely not as durable as others I have purchased. Won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> these are great. other clear bands will break when you tie them tight but these are awesome. the husband even uses them to tie his mustache when he shaves!</li>
            <li> They are sturdy and don&#x27;t break.&lt;br /&gt;However they are too grippy.&lt;br /&gt;They pull out my daughters hair when we remove them.</li>
            <li> Great product. Worth the purchase. They do have a slight natural stretch to them, so they are accommodating.</li>
            <li> They hold your hair well and can&#x27;t really be seen. They do not break easily. Good buy.</li>
            <li> Goody used to make the best clear, poly elastic hair bands - they didn&#x27;t break, could be used again, and never pulled or grabbed the hair.  I just bought this 3 multi-size pack.  They have gone the cheap route on these  I just had my hair back in a ponytail using one of them and it broke without provocation.  I will never buy these again.</li>
            <li> My son wanted clear hair bands so he could control his long hair.  He wanted something inconspicuous.  These do the trick.  He is very pleased with them.</li>
            <li> These are awful.  They spontaneously break during the day.  I put two in this morning and one popped an hour in then the other a couple hours later.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price</li>
            <li> The quality of the bands seems to have changed in the past couple of years. The original package I had bought my daughter a couple of years ago lasted forever because you could re-use the bands many times, and they did not &#x27;grab&#x27; her hair at all. I bought a new package a couple of months ago. They look exactly the same, but unfortunately the new bands are completely useless. For one thing, they are much stretchier, plus, they are very grabby when you try to pull them out. It&#x27;s almost like using a regular rubber band. In fact, my daughter refuses to wear a ponytail now with these bands because it&#x27;s so painful to take out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just put an order in for the Blax bands and hope they will be more like the original Goody bands. Sorry, Goody! Wish you had kept your same quality levels.</li>
            <li> Love this multipack of clear bands!! Really hard-to-find in stores and amazing price!!</li>
            <li> great for braids.  my second pack</li>
            <li> They are one time use, which is to be expected.  But 1/2 the time they will snap while I have them in.  So if I&#x27;m at work and don&#x27;t have another...</li>
            <li> BEST for holding a ponytail in place. Much better than the trendy fold-over fabric that everyone loves right now. I&#x27;ve tried everything and I&#x27;ll always use these. They do stretch over time and eventually snap. But I can get several uses out of one before it starts to lose elasticity and degrade.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t hold up as it thought they would</li>
            <li> These work great for small braids and hairstyles that need hidden bands.  They are somewhat hard to work with, but only because they&#x27;re small and clear (what would you expect?).  Great price on a very useful product in several sizes.  I use them all the time on my little girls&#x27; hair, as well as my own.</li>
            <li> The best of the best for this kind of product.  I use them for all kinds of things besides my Hair!</li>
            <li> These broke about an hour after putting my hair up, and I have very thin, straight hair.  Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I use this to braid my little girls&#x27; hair and they work perfectly every time. They are very easy to remove/pull afterwards and we can still use them again.</li>
            <li> Good hold for silky hair</li>
            <li> Awful! They break easily. Just had one pop out of my hair this morning (in a small pony with the right size elastic). I&#x27;ve purchased other brands that are much better. If they don&#x27;t break in your hair mid-hold, they stretch out making them unusable.</li>
            <li> These are awful...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a pack of 500 multi-colored bands I bought at a department store. They were rubbery and lasted over 6 months, using daily on two girls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these because they were clear and I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about matching outfits. What a mistake! These are so flimsy. They are ok holding up a tiny tuft on my one year old, but my 3 year old constantly looks like she just got in a fight with a hairbrush. They slide out of her hair ever time. They are slick and the band itself it rectangular. Unless you have thick hair these will fall out. Heck, I have thick curly hair and these fell out of mine!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to the rubbery multi-colored ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are cheap but not worth your time or the frustration of looking like a crazy haired fool...</li>
            <li> Horrible product.  I bought these because I grew my hair out again and used to use these bands.  They are using inferior material now.  They break constantly.  I have had several snap in my hands when first trying to put them on.  They snap randomly in the middle of the day.  I have to carry several to ensure I can keep my hair back.  I will never buy these again.  Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Works so well! Love the sizing! Invisible even in Ombra hair! Terrific buy. Great for woman &amp; children!</li>
            <li> Awful. I can&#x27;t believe these are Goody. They are WAAAAAAAAY too stretchy. You have to wrap them around your hair 5 or 6 times and then they get thinner and thinner and break. They aren&#x27;t strong enough to hold anything except maybe baby hair. What a waste of money. The other Goody bands I have had in the past were way better.</li>
            <li> Goody just makes the best hair elastics!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought these multiple times for my daughter and I. They used to be thick and able to hold all of my thick waist length hair up. This last batch I received is not as sturdy and quite often they break if I try and put them in my hair. They just stretch out too easily.</li>
            <li> I used to buy these all the time, they were durable, I could use them more than once, they were perfect with the different sizes. The last three times I have bought them they have been rubbish. I thought that I just got a bad batch and gave them the benefit of the doubt since I&#x27;ve loved them forever. This last bunch that I bought barely lasts a couple of hours before breaking and this is coming from someone who has pretty fine hair. I hope they get their crap together, I really did love these.</li>
            <li> Sadly, these break at least 50% of the time. Some on the first wear. Sometimes my hair is suddenly pulled not up anymore and the elastic is nowhere to be found.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t work like I thought they would</li>
