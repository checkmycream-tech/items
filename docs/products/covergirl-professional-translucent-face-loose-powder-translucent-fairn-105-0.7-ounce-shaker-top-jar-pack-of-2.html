    <ol>
            <li>Very happy with this powder.</li>
            <li>It goes perfectly with almost all kinds of skins!</li>
            <li>Good coverage and perfectly matches my skin tone.</li>
            <li>its a great product</li>
            <li>I was happy with the price and the way the product arrived, but I will stick with the Cover Girl mineral powder.</li>
            <li>This powder has been my favorite for decades!!</li>
            <li>Very nice powder, does the job and doesn&#x27;t make my face look caked in make-up.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect color for me and does great on top of my covergirl oil controlling foundation</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it and the texture is always perfect.</li>
            <li>too!&lt;br /&gt;Besides the price is really good...</li>
            <li>Does a good job with coverage, but I cannot stand the smell.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smooth finish, doesn&#x27;t cake, and sets my liquid perfectly for the day.</li>
            <li>A more durable plastic cover would be a great improvement.</li>
            <li>Also love!)</li>
            <li>i love this powder, i have fair skin</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s sparkly at all, just adds a nice matte look to my skin.</li>
            <li>Very strong scent.</li>
            <li>I love this powder, I&#x27;ve been using it for YEARS.</li>
            <li>and I am constantly satisfied.</li>
            <li>Maybelline has a yellower tinge, which works better for me, though I still buy CoverGirl if its cheaper at the drug store.</li>
            <li>its perfect to wear outside in the sun because it is light and doesn&#x27;t clog pores. :)</li>
            <li>Good price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight, doesn&#x27;t look cakey, gives good coverage and controls oil.</li>
            <li>This powder gives a nice matte finish when first applied and lasts all day to prevent the &amp;#34;afternoon shine&amp;#34; I used to get on my forehead.</li>
            <li>I just bought it today and so far so good.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong- although not unpleasant- in the container, but it&#x27;s not noticeable once applied.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin look beautiful and soft, and the color looks completely natural.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased and will probably buy covergirl products on Amazon in the future!!</li>
            <li>It works well to set a light foundation and looks natural.</li>
            <li>Some powders have a weird smell, but this one is light and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>My skin actually isn&#x27;t that light</li>
            <li>Not enough to spill, mind you, and it&#x27;s likely my own fault, but I thought I&#x27;d note it anyway.</li>
            <li>it truly is puffy, and applies the perfect amount of powder for me (I use half the puff, and try to keep the other half clean to pinch onto, since there is no strap).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes</li>
            <li>use this (interchangeably with Maybelline&#x27;s very similar powder) to set my L&#x27;oreal True Match makeup.</li>
            <li>price is decent and the powder I have goes well with my skin tone.</li>
            <li>The product does have a very noticeable sparkle in the sun--at least to me--and it is slightly too pink for my warm undertones (though more neutral than cool).</li>
            <li>and this isn&#x27;t too light or dark.</li>
            <li>I personally carry a compact (L&#x27;oreal True Match powder, actually.</li>
            <li>This powder is very natural and soft...</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to any girl who needs a little more coverage on her face.</li>
            <li>The lid can crack if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li>The packaging isn&#x27;t bad enough to deter me away from it since it&#x27;s a really good product.</li>

            <li> Makes my skin look beautiful and soft, and the color looks completely natural.  Some powders have a weird smell, but this one is light and pleasant.  Have been using it for years and will continue to.</li>
            <li> I love this powder, I&#x27;ve been using it for YEARS. I&#x27;ve tried other powders and always come back to this one. It has a nice smooth finish, doesn&#x27;t cake, and sets my liquid perfectly for the day. The smell is strong- although not unpleasant- in the container, but it&#x27;s not noticeable once applied. I don&#x27;t use the puff, I always toss it and use a powder brush to apply. It&#x27;s not convenient to carry in the purse though. I personally carry a compact (L&#x27;oreal True Match powder, actually. Also love!) in my purse for touch-ups. The lid can crack if you&#x27;re not careful.  The packaging isn&#x27;t bad enough to deter me away from it since it&#x27;s a really good product. Very happy with this powder.</li>
            <li> I would have rated it a 5 but to me it kinda smells like medacine.&lt;br /&gt;The price is decent and the powder I have goes well with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> This powder is very natural and soft...I like the scent too!&lt;br /&gt;Besides the price is really good... It goes perfectly with almost all kinds of skins!</li>
            <li> Good price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to any girl who needs a little more coverage on her face. its perfect to wear outside in the sun because it is light and doesn&#x27;t clog pores. :)</li>
            <li> I ended up tossing mine in the trash. I have to keep blowing away the excess off my face. Has no coverage.</li>
            <li> I just bought it today and so far so good. Very lightweight, doesn&#x27;t look cakey, gives good coverage and controls oil. My only complaint is the SMELL! It smells horrid. It gives me a headache when I use it. I just hope the smell doesn&#x27;t linger on me after I use it.</li>
            <li> This powder has been my favorite for decades!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this powder for years and I am constantly satisfied. It is the perfect color for me and does great on top of my covergirl oil controlling foundation I have also used for years. I love the smell of it and the texture is always perfect. My skin actually isn&#x27;t that light but this powder still works well for me.&lt;br /&gt;I used a coupon on here and saved a lot of money rather than buying in store! I am very pleased and will probably buy covergirl products on Amazon in the future!!</li>
            <li> i love this powder, i have fair skin and this isn&#x27;t too light or dark. my sister is lighter than i am and she can use it as well.  its a great product</li>
            <li> I have been using this powder for years. Good coverage and perfectly matches my skin tone. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s sparkly at all, just adds a nice matte look to my skin.</li>
            <li> Recommended--with sparkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this (interchangeably with Maybelline&#x27;s very similar powder) to set my L&#x27;oreal True Match makeup. The product does have a very noticeable sparkle in the sun--at least to me--and it is slightly too pink for my warm undertones (though more neutral than cool). Maybelline has a yellower tinge, which works better for me, though I still buy CoverGirl if its cheaper at the drug store. I prefer the puff in this one--it truly is puffy, and applies the perfect amount of powder for me (I use half the puff, and try to keep the other half clean to pinch onto, since there is no strap).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes: It can be quite messy. There&#x27;s nothing to protect your puff in the actual container, and the lids always have a tendency to crack on me. Not enough to spill, mind you, and it&#x27;s likely my own fault, but I thought I&#x27;d note it anyway.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this loose powder for years, and find it always works well and stays put.  It helps to take the shine off my oily skin without causing any skin problems.  The sifter is not to my liking and I always remove it, but others may like it.  It works well to set a light foundation and looks natural.</li>
            <li> Very nice powder, does the job and doesn&#x27;t make my face look caked in make-up. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Very strong scent. Does a good job with coverage, but I cannot stand the smell. I was happy with the price and the way the product arrived, but I will stick with the Cover Girl mineral powder.</li>
            <li> This powder gives a nice matte finish when first applied and lasts all day to prevent the &amp;#34;afternoon shine&amp;#34; I used to get on my forehead. For some reason though the covers on the container crack and fall apart so I end up having to put the rest of the powder into a small zip lock bag and dip my brush into that. A more durable plastic cover would be a great improvement.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it may be like the usual covergirl products I&#x27;ve tried, but it smells like a dirty filthy sweaty sock putting on your clean face. It is totally DISGUSTING. My boyfriend kissed me on the cheek and asked me if I brushed my teeth yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can they sell that nasty funky smelling stuff!!!!! I couldn&#x27;t leave it on my face long enough to even notice the coverage.</li>
