            <li>This works great for all &amp;#34;walks&amp;#34; of life.</li>
            <li>This one works great for me though.</li>
            <li>also works great on knees and elbows</li>
            <li>I suspect that it would work because I have always had great results from Curel products.  </li>
            <li>Works great with lotion socks.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products on my feet and this works the best.</li>
            <li>This foot cream feels great on my feet, I use it every day after my shower, I&amp;#34;m very pleased with product.</li>
            <li>This works, but not as good as the coconut oil.</li>
            <li>In between pedicures, this is the best way to get that clean salon feeling.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>Bit of a strong smell, but works great</li>
            <li>Really amazing and LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>It works amazingly .&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cracks in my heels have healed up nicely.</li>
            <li>Just rub this on - it absorbs nicely</li>
            <li>I have tried many foot creams, but none are as good as this.</li>
            <li>This foot cream really works!!!!love it and best foot cream ever!!!</li>
            <li>Perfect to keep your feet soft.  </li>
            <li>So far, for me, the best is the petroleum jelly from Vaseline, but Vaseline is too sticky and greasy.</li>
            <li>and it even smells nice :)</li>
            <li>My feel look great for the first time in ages.  </li>
            <li>Have used for years; good for diabetics and putting on a pair of white socks for a couple of hours gives good optimal absorption for softening the feet!</li>
            <li>This lotion is really good for quick maintenance lotion every week or so.</li>
            <li>Smells ok.</li>
            <li>I love this foot lotion.  </li>
            <li>Too many chemicals in the Curel foot cream</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy like most foot lotions for cracked heels</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I have used better like Avon&#x27;s Foot Works Intensive Callus Cream.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Good cream for keeping crusty feet nice and soft.</li>
            <li>This may be the best cream for rough skin of your feet.  </li>
            <li>The smell is way too strong.</li>
            <li>I say okay because it is nothing special.</li>
            <li>I tried many foot creams before did not find any special one</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get them smooth overnight</li>
            <li>I happened upon this and was caught by the promise to smooth feet in 2 days.</li>
            <li>Keeps my feet soft and feeling good.</li>
            <li>Great for dry feet!</li>
            <li>tried and true...</li>
            <li>I love this stuff so much</li>
            <li>and it absorbs rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it (overnight with socks) there was a huge difference in the morning.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite new finds.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida and am barefoot most of the time, which means - my heals are always cracked.</li>
            <li>It is absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>It works really well on keeping your feet smooth.  </li>
            <li>Now that my heals are nice - I only need to do this a couple of times a week to maintain.</li>
            <li>More like old lady floral.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering, thankfully, but the fragrance in itself makes me not want to use it even just to get my money&#x27;s worth out of this purchase.</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth the money, and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint on it&#x27;s advertised guarantee.</li>
            <li>it hoping that it really was something special - NOT.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ordered this several times -- works great to sooth feet, especially heels.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to use very much.</li>
            <li>Like this very much</li>
            <li>I noticed a big difference in the way my heels looked I no longer saw the cracks in my heels and my feet feel more softer and supple now.</li>
            <li>Love the feel on my feet and scent - wish it came in a larger size!</li>
            <li>While I still have the deep marks on my heels they look and FEEL much better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t seem to be actually allergic to this fragrance, as I am to many, but I really dislike it.</li>
            <li>The fragrance in this lotion is so strong that I could not use it enough nights to see if it works.  </li>
            <li>and it is very nuturing for my skin.</li>
            <li>The cream workes very well.</li>
            <li>The is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>This one really works.</li>
            <li>The result is nice after a few days of use.</li>
            <li>The product is a nice thicker cream but not something so heavy</li>
            <li>Ok, but not very rich.  </li>
            <li>feet are a huge dry skin problem; this eliminated the problem.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 63 years-old and have lived in the High Desert (Albuquerque for over forty years.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and I found a lot to be watery and absorb super fast into my dry skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s MUCH MUCH better, more effective, and much less expensive AND can be used in a lot of different ways.  </li>
            <li>normally buy unscented everything and made an exception based on reviews of this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thicker than other foot creams that I&#x27;ve tried, and leaves my feet feeling smooth and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Got this and wow - within a couple of days</li>
            <li>I have tried several creams from Amazon and nothing has really worked.</li>
            <li>Makes your feet really soft.</li>
            <li>To my absolute SHOCK within 2 days my skin was almost totally transformed.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes my foot like no other product!</li>
            <li>This also worked wonders on my husband&#x27;s hobbit-esque feet that shouldn&#x27;t normally be shown in public.</li>
            <li>I have a mild case of dry, cracked feet and decided to give Curel Foot Therapy Foot Cream, for Dry, Cracked Feet a try.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t quite call it \\&quot;godawful\\&quot; as another reviewer did, but it in no way resembles some natural fragrance such as coconut oil.</li>
            <li>pat dry, slather with Curel and put on socks while sleeping and in the morning your feet are repaired and soft!!  </li>
            <li>Consistent use of the product eliminates the previously mentioned problems.</li>
            <li>Seems to work okay but smells god awful, like some kind of combination of synthetic cocoa butter smell and Axe body spray.</li>
            <li>I have found no other Curel products to have such an overpowering fragrance.</li>
            <li>I applied a small amount of the Curel Foot Therapy Cream on the first evening to the heels of my feet, this cream is a thick consistency and it did absorb quickly into my heels and cracked feet.</li>

            <li> I applied a small amount of the Curel Foot Therapy Cream on the first evening to the heels of my feet, this cream is a thick consistency and it did absorb quickly into my heels and cracked feet.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this cream to be any better or worse than various other creams and lotions I have tried.</li>
            <li> but I continued to apply the Curel Foot Therapy Foot Cream, for Dry, Cracked Feet on the second evening on my heels and feet, when I woke up the next morning</li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty well,but the tube is very small and it does not last.  </li>
            <li> If you have constant dry feet use this nightly.</li>
            <li> I keep deep crevices on my heels and they will dry to the point of cracking and bleeding.</li>
            <li> Curel Foot Therapy Cream, for Dry Cracked Feet is infused with shea butter, coconut milk and vitamin E</li>
            <li> This is my go-to lotion for my dry and cracked feet.</li>
            <li> This works well on my extremely dry feet.  </li>
            <li> This works well for feet if they tend to be dry, but need to be sitting a bit after applying so</li>
            <li> I go through spells of overly dry \\&quot;ashy\\&quot; appearing feet regardless of season.</li>
            <li> My skin is moisturized and doesn&#x27;t look or feel dry.</li>
            <li> A month later my feet are less dry and skin is no longer flaking.</li>
            <li> From the looks of all these products on line, many people must be having bad, cracked feet.</li>
            <li> at least one&#x27;s feet are fairly far away from one&#x27;s nose, but to have it on one&#x27;s hands is horrid.</li>
            <li> Minimal fragrance and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Other creams tend to be runnier, and afterward I can&#x27;t even tell that I used anything at all.  </li>
            <li> You can also find some reviews on other websites.</li>
            <li> I am trying some other products that I also like and</li>
            <li> Not only that, the other ones are not effective.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way</li>
            <li> Unable to use, too much perfume.</li>
            <li> I keep my heals filed down, but they get dried out.  </li>
            <li> they felt a  little bit smoother</li>
            <li> so I always buy a few online</li>
            <li> Waste of money on my part.</li>
            <li> Its thick and does not feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick, not perfumey and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It is a small amount and is very expensive for this amount.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find in stores</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I cannot tolerate the smell.</li>
            <li> , it made my foot itch so bad</li>
            <li> i hate the smell.  </li>
            <li> Because, of course, you end up with the scent on your hands where it is particularly annoying (and cloying!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the desert water is awful.....</li>

            <li> Great for dry feet! I love this product!</li>
            <li> I keep my heals filed down, but they get dried out.  They will get cracks, if I don&#x27;t take constant care of them.  This lotion is really good for quick maintenance lotion every week or so.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years now.  I&#x27;ve tried others but always come back to Curel.</li>
            <li> Ordered this several times -- works great to sooth feet, especially heels.</li>
            <li> I have a mild case of dry, cracked feet and decided to give Curel Foot Therapy Foot Cream, for Dry, Cracked Feet a try. I applied a small amount of the Curel Foot Therapy Cream on the first evening to the heels of my feet, this cream is a thick consistency and it did absorb quickly into my heels and cracked feet. A small amount goes a long way so you don&#x27;t have to use very much. The next day I did see some improvement in my heels they felt a  little bit smoother but I continued to apply the Curel Foot Therapy Foot Cream, for Dry, Cracked Feet on the second evening on my heels and feet, when I woke up the next morning I noticed a big difference in the way my heels looked I no longer saw the cracks in my heels and my feet feel more softer and supple now.

            <li> This is my go-to lotion for my dry and cracked feet. In between pedicures, this is the best way to get that clean salon feeling. This also worked wonders on my husband&#x27;s hobbit-esque feet that shouldn&#x27;t normally be shown in public. Now he&#x27;s presentable! This works great for all &amp;#34;walks&amp;#34; of life.</li>
            <li> This works, this works, this works.</li>
            <li> Love the feel on my feet and scent - wish it came in a larger size! One of my favorite new finds.</li>
            <li> The cream workes very well. Its thick and does not feel greasy.  The cracks in my heels have healed up nicely.</li>
            <li> Perfect to keep your feet soft.  love it!</li>
            <li> This works well on my extremely dry feet.  It doesn&#x27;t get them smooth overnight but it does work.</li>
            <li> Smells ok. It is absorbed quickly. The result is nice after a few days of use. So far, for me, the best is the petroleum jelly from Vaseline, but Vaseline is too sticky and greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this foot lotion.  It&#x27;s thicker than other foot creams that I&#x27;ve tried, and leaves my feet feeling smooth and moisturized.  Other creams tend to be runnier, and afterward I can&#x27;t even tell that I used anything at all.  This one works great for me though.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. The is very moisturizing. After 2 nights of continued use, you will notice a drastic difference. This is not like any regular lotion you use for your ashy cracked feet. This will absorb and moisturize.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products on my feet and this works the best.</li>
            <li> This foot cream feels great on my feet, I use it every day after my shower, I&amp;#34;m very pleased with product.</li>
            <li> Best foot cream ever!</li>
            <li> Too many chemicals in the Curel foot cream, it made my foot itch so bad i had to stop using it. I will never buy again!!!!</li>
            <li> This works immediately, just like the ads say in two days you see a difference.  Really amazing and LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> This product works well and I use it nightly.  I&#x27;m 63 years-old and have lived in the High Desert (Albuquerque for over forty years.  This&lt;br /&gt;keeps me going between pedicures.</li>
            <li> This may be the best cream for rough skin of your feet.  I have been using it for years and can&#x27;t praise it enough.</li>
            <li> I use this daily.  Keeps my feet soft and feeling good.</li>
            <li> Good cream for keeping crusty feet nice and soft. The first time I used it (overnight with socks) there was a huge difference in the morning. It&#x27;s very thick, not perfumey and gets the job done. After a few days of using this, my feet were ready for sandals.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and am barefoot most of the time, which means - my heals are always cracked. I&#x27;ve tried everything - buffing, scraping - pedicures, different lotions, etc. None of the lotions worked and the scraping off of dead skin is gross and has to be redone and doesn&#x27;t really fix the problem. Plus - always have to worry about infections when the cracks go deep.  Got this and wow - within a couple of days - I felt like I had gotten my feet back.  It isn&#x27;t greasy like most foot lotions for cracked heels are - so I don&#x27;t  have to wear socks to bed. Just rub this on - it absorbs nicely and I&#x27;m done.  My feel look great for the first time in ages.  Highly recommend. Now that my heals are nice - I only need to do this a couple of times a week to maintain. Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Have used for years; good for diabetics and putting on a pair of white socks for a couple of hours gives good optimal absorption for softening the feet!</li>
            <li> it works but.  but but but.  i hate the smell.  i feel like i must put on surgeon&#x27;s gloves to apply it.  always a problem with foot creams--they seem to assume that one&#x27;s feet smell and that needs to be covered up, so they over-scent their products.  ick. at least one&#x27;s feet are fairly far away from one&#x27;s nose, but to have it on one&#x27;s hands is horrid.</li>
            <li> This product works okay. I say okay because it is nothing special. It is a small amount and is very expensive for this amount. I have tried several creams from Amazon and nothing has really worked. I ordered a paraffin bath and wax from Amazon. I am now trying that. From the looks of all these products on line, many people must be having bad, cracked feet. I think it is the desert and the desert water is awful.....</li>
            <li> tried and true...shower, scrub feet with pumice stone, pat dry, slather with Curel and put on socks while sleeping and in the morning your feet are repaired and soft!!  also works great on knees and elbows</li>
            <li> I have tried many foot creams, but none are as good as this. Not only that, the other ones are not effective. This one really works. It is difficult to find in stores so I always buy a few online so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> The fragrance in this lotion is so strong that I could not use it enough nights to see if it works.  I suspect that it would work because I have always had great results from Curel products.  I have found no other Curel products to have such an overpowering fragrance.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this cream to be any better or worse than various other creams and lotions I have tried. I bought it hoping that it really was something special - NOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally buy unscented everything and made an exception based on reviews of this product. I don&#x27;t seem to be actually allergic to this fragrance, as I am to many, but I really dislike it. I wouldn&#x27;t quite call it \\&quot;godawful\\&quot; as another reviewer did, but it in no way resembles some natural fragrance such as coconut oil. More like old lady floral. It&#x27;s not overpowering, thankfully, but the fragrance in itself makes me not want to use it even just to get my money&#x27;s worth out of this purchase. Because, of course, you end up with the scent on your hands where it is particularly annoying (and cloying!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers say it&#x27;s not greasy at all and you can just apply it and forget about it. I don&#x27;t agree at all. I put socks on after using it at night and would not use it in the morning. After applying it I would definitely not pick up a book to read, because of the residue on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest reading reviews for this same product being sold in different combinations here on amazon, to get a wider variety of opinions. You can also find some reviews on other websites. Of course I did that and still bought it! Waste of money on my part.</li>
            <li> This foot cream is moisturizing and not greasy.  Makes your feet really soft.</li>
            <li> no problems, as expectted</li>
            <li> It works really well on keeping your feet smooth.  We use it at night and in the morning.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes my foot like no other product! Minimal fragrance and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty well,but the tube is very small and it does not last.  I am trying some other products that I also like and that last longer.  Doubt if I will buy this one again.</li>
            <li> works as indicated softer heel after 3 uses</li>
            <li> This works well for feet if they tend to be dry, but need to be sitting a bit after applying so it soaks in well as it is thicker.</li>
            <li> If you have constant dry feet use this nightly. I noticed improvement after one application. A month later my feet are less dry and skin is no longer flaking.</li>
            <li> I go through spells of overly dry \\&quot;ashy\\&quot; appearing feet regardless of season. I keep deep crevices on my heels and they will dry to the point of cracking and bleeding. I&#x27;ve tried everything from Eucerin, to organic olive oil shea lotions, to dr scholl, and udder cream. None of them working and I found a lot to be watery and absorb super fast into my dry skin or they didn&#x27;t feel like they sank in and just stood on the skin. I happened upon this and was caught by the promise to smooth feet in 2 days. I had no faith in that claim, but still purchased the lotion. To my absolute SHOCK within 2 days my skin was almost totally transformed. While I still have the deep marks on my heels they look and FEEL much better. My skin is moisturized and doesn&#x27;t look or feel dry. The product is a nice thicker cream but not something so heavy it&#x27;s bothersome and it absorbs rather quickly.  Others have mentioned some issues trying to find it. I&#x27;ve noticed drug stores don&#x27;t tend to carry it (I can never find it at Walgreens despite online saying it&#x27;s in stores only), but both Walmart &amp; Target do. I love this stuff so much I buy it 2 bottles at a time so I don&#x27;t run out. Absolutely worth the money, and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint on it&#x27;s advertised guarantee.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this product drying and cracking on the soles of his feet.  Consistent use of the product eliminates the previously mentioned problems.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS.  I COULDN&#x27;T FIND IT IN LOCAL STORES.</li>
            <li> Works great with lotion socks. Bit of a strong smell, but works great</li>
            <li> The smell is way too strong. I hope Curel makes an unscented version because it is the best foot cream I have ever used. Unfortunately, I cannot tolerate the smell.</li>
            <li> Seems to work okay but smells god awful, like some kind of combination of synthetic cocoa butter smell and Axe body spray. Wish it were unscented.</li>
            <li> This foot cream really works!!!!love it and best foot cream ever!!! I tried many foot creams before did not find any special one and this is the bomb!!!</li>
            <li> Product works great!!!</li>
            <li> Like this very much but now I&#x27;ve found coconut oil and nothing is comparing to that.  I recommend this to anyone, but try coconut oil.  It&#x27;s MUCH MUCH better, more effective, and much less expensive AND can be used in a lot of different ways.  This works, but not as good as the coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Ok, but not very rich.  I have used better like Avon&#x27;s Foot Works Intensive Callus Cream.  It is the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a foot crème like this one!!  AWESOME!  Just use it everyday/evening and it even smells nice :)</li>
            <li> It works amazingly .&lt;br /&gt;My feet are a huge dry skin problem; this eliminated the problem.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Will buy sgain.</li>
            <li> Unable to use, too much perfume.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Being a mother of 3 kids I don&#x27;t find time to pamper my feet. But this product works wonders. Just remember to buff your feet before putting this on and you are set.</li>
