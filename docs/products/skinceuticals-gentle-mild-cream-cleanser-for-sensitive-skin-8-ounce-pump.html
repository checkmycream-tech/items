            <li>Love love love this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like cream than a cleanser.</li>

            <li>and I love the way my skin feels after using it - a keeper.</li>
            <li>Love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I love the grapefruit scent and the micro scrubbing bits in this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Overall, very happy with this product, by the way, the texture is creamy, so I don&#x27;t recommend it if you have oily skin.</li>
            <li>I love this face wash.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve found nothing else to rival it in a more appropriate price range.  </li>

            <li>This may be mild, but it really does a good job in keeping my, hmmmm...less than youthful skin looking nice.</li>

            <li>This is a great cleanser for irritated and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Smelled wonderful (lightly orange) but really did not remove makeup very well.</li>

            <li>It works great on my sensitive skin and the fragrance is so clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Very nice product for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Silky and rich cleanser, I love it.</li>
            <li>If you are in need of this type of product, I strongly recommend Clinique&#x27;s Liquid Soap Extra-Mild.  </li>
            <li>It is very mild and I use it with my clarisonic although it works fine without it.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product prepares  the skin</li>
            <li>It is light with a touch of citrus.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s nice and gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>This cleanser smells amazing and so gentle to the skin.  </li>
            <li>It has a light lather and rinses off well.  </li>
            <li>Also has a lovely fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>I have used this for several years now and it is absolutely the best face cleanser</li>
            <li>My skin feels so clean and smooth when I&#x27;m done, and I love the light, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I use this product in conjunction with the Emollience Rich product and they work so well together.</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this cleanser by my dermotologist, and love the creamy consistency.</li>
            <li>I am considering using this cleanser with a Mia Sonic to get a deeper clean.</li>
            <li>My face feels clean and refreshed after using it twice a day.  </li>
            <li>used to buy this product directly from my local dermatologist, was very happy to find on amazon.</li>
            <li>It is great for sensitive skin and leaves my face feeling clean and smooth, not dried out.</li>
            <li>I do love it, it is gentle to my face</li>
            <li>It was recommended by my esthetician and I will continue to use it because it is such a good product.</li>
            <li>It does feel soft and have a nice smell, but didn&#x27;t do the job for me.</li>
            <li>It foams up nicely and rinses completely.</li>
            <li>Great product, works great, use as directed only need a little, would buy again, love the whole line, worth the price</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the Skinceuticals Gentle Mild Cream Cleanser and the Revitalizing Toner.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin looking fresh and feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Needed a mild cleanser for my face</li>
            <li>Nice, citrusy scent, goes on smooth, removes makeup and daily grime.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle and great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>My face feels very soft, smooth and clean with no irritation!</li>
            <li>Lovely product for very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>However, this product calmed down the irritation and it is so much better!!  </li>
            <li>I have the most sensitive skin, with rosasea and sun</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to most any product used for the face.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>Most cleansers make me break out, even ones that say for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t foam or leave my face feeling super clean, but it works very well</li>
            <li>So light, leaves my face clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>I had received samples of other SkinCeuticals products from the esthetician, at my dermatologist&#x27;s office, loved them but found them to be a bit pricey, when purchased at my doctor&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>but when you actually dry your face it feel very nice and best of all not dry and tight like when I use my old products.</li>
            <li>I also purchased their Renew Overnight Dry, which is not heavy or greasy and leaves my skin feeling great in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li>I generally don&#x27;t like any fragrances in my soaps, but I love the smell of this cleaner.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels clean and nourished after use and makes my moisturizer more effective by preparing the skin properly for other products.  </li>
            <li>Gentle, mild and no fragrance.</li>
            <li>Once I&#x27;ve removed my eye makeup, I use one pump of the Mild Cream Cleanser and use a circular motion with both hands to gently cleanse the skin.</li>
            <li>This product works well and is very gentle on my skin</li>
            <li>Very gentle cream cleanser and does the trick.</li>
            <li>Very gentle cleaser</li>
            <li>Than you very much.</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft, clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I use several of the Skin Ceutical products and love them all.</li>
            <li>i have used the clear gel cleanser from skinceuticals that is for normal skin and LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>I started to think I had Rosacea as the redness and bumps were quite evident.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve purchased it online, and not at a doctor&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>Just started using it and the smell is the first thing I noticed.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still on my first order.  </li>
            <li>The only reason why it did not receive a 5 star from my is because it doesn&#x27;t take 100% off your make up, but it does take most of it off.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t quite do the job of removing eye makeup, but overall I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Very gentle with a terrific but very mild orange scent.</li>
            <li>Such a clean fragrance!</li>
            <li>I have combination problematic skin and this is the first cleanser that has really worked for me.</li>
            <li>It is gentle; it keeps my face very clean and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  </li>
            <li>What is great about this cleanser is it takes a very little amount; rinses off thoroughly even with cool water; and contrary to its recommended &amp;#34;twice daily&amp;#34; use, a nightly cleansing is all you need, especially for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>have been used this Gentle Milk cleanser for a month</li>
            <li>Smooth and creamy going on and deep cleans without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li>I use this with my Clarisonic and really like the results.  </li>
            <li>I really like Skin Ceuticals and used to use them years ago.  </li>
            <li>It is a non drying, gentle cleanser.  </li>
            <li>It does not do much-</li>
            <li>and I really like this</li>
            <li>works yet is gentle</li>
            <li>Very gentle and no heavy fragrances...</li>
            <li>My dermatologist office stated that it does NOT remove make-up and recommended using a wash cloth or Jane Iredale&#x27;s magic mitt with water only to remove make-up prior to using SkinCeuticals Gentle Cleaner.  </li>
            <li>Since I use prescribed medicines by my Dermatologist, it was important that I use a cleanser that wouldn&#x27;t dry or irritate my skin and this meets both criteria.  </li>
            <li>I may have mild Rosacea that may need to be addressed later.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, even some soaps hurt it, but this was gentle and it has helped with acne</li>
            <li>This product really did not work well for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>this product is intended for those with VERY sensitive skin who cannot use normal cleansers.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and I cannot use OTC moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>The feel of the cleanser on the skin is very soft.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this product has not made my face break out.</li>
            <li>Perfect for cold, dry NE winter months</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too sure about this product, it is completely different than what I am use to (neutragina natural), this product feels a little greasy when I wash my face</li>
            <li>It does not dry your skin like many other facial cleansers.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be clear...</li>
            <li>Otherwise, you will find that your skin does not feel as clean as you would want, leaving a slight &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; on the face.  </li>
            <li>My face is 68 years old</li>
            <li>, I have rosesaca and am sensitive to almost everything.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My mother, an esthetician recommended it for my combination, sensitive skin</li>
            <li>, I tried SkinCeuticals sensitive cleanser out.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and supple with no residue.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend for sensitive or older skin.</li>
            <li>once I can no longer use the pump part, I take the entire bottle, turn it over and let it transfer out into the new container.</li>
            <li>Gets your skin clean without being dry or rough.</li>
            <li>Without removing the cleanser, I usually then use my Clarisonic brush to get an even deeper clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other SkinCeutical products, including another cleanser, but found this one to be much gentler on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 27 year old male that has dryer skin on my face.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t make my skin better, doesn&#x27;t make it worse.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the pump top had popped up during shipping and the cleanser was all inside the shipping box, and the bottle was half full.</li>
            <li>I tend to have dry sensitive skin, so I like this cleanser because it&#x27;s gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin!</li>
            <li>Does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>It cleans and yet it does not dry out you skin.</li>
            <li>I use this product with my Clarisonic skin brush and my face is clear &amp; soft, not dry as with some other cleansers.</li>
            <li>This is the first cleanser I have ever used that has not left my skin feeling tight and dry, afterwards.  </li>
            <li>With the combination of this and their other products I now have clear skin again!  </li>

            <li> Once you use this product you will not be able to use anything else.  </li>
            <li> Love love love this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like cream than a cleanser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that I love it.</li>
            <li> and I love the way my skin feels after using it - a keeper.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I love the grapefruit scent and the micro scrubbing bits in this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Overall, very happy with this product, by the way, the texture is creamy, so I don&#x27;t recommend it if you have oily skin.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve found nothing else to rival it in a more appropriate price range.  </li>
            <li> My favorite face cleanser ever.  </li>
            <li> Tempted to buy a lifetime supply just in case they so making it.  :-)</li>
            <li> This may be mild, but it really does a good job in keeping my, hmmmm...less than youthful skin looking nice.</li>
            <li> Does not leave my face clean!</li>
            <li> Love the light orange scent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The price was excellent and the cleanser worked as expected</li>
            <li> This is a great cleanser for irritated and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Smelled wonderful (lightly orange) but really did not remove makeup very well.</li>
            <li> A good, gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> It works great on my sensitive skin and the fragrance is so clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Very nice product for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Silky and rich cleanser, I love it.</li>
            <li> If you are in need of this type of product, I strongly recommend Clinique&#x27;s Liquid Soap Extra-Mild.  </li>
            <li> It is very mild and I use it with my clarisonic although it works fine without it.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product prepares  the skin</li>
            <li> It is light with a touch of citrus.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s nice and gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> This cleanser smells amazing and so gentle to the skin.  </li>
            <li> It has a light lather and rinses off well.  </li>
            <li> Also has a lovely fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for several years now and it is absolutely the best face cleanser</li>
            <li> My skin feels so clean and smooth when I&#x27;m done, and I love the light, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I use this product in conjunction with the Emollience Rich product and they work so well together.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this cleanser by my dermotologist, and love the creamy consistency.</li>
            <li> I am considering using this cleanser with a Mia Sonic to get a deeper clean.</li>
            <li> My face feels clean and refreshed after using it twice a day.  </li>
            <li> used to buy this product directly from my local dermatologist, was very happy to find on amazon.</li>
            <li> It is great for sensitive skin and leaves my face feeling clean and smooth, not dried out.</li>
            <li> I do love it, it is gentle to my face</li>
            <li> It was recommended by my esthetician and I will continue to use it because it is such a good product.</li>
            <li> It does feel soft and have a nice smell, but didn&#x27;t do the job for me.</li>
            <li> It foams up nicely and rinses completely.</li>
            <li> Great product, works great, use as directed only need a little, would buy again, love the whole line, worth the price</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Skinceuticals Gentle Mild Cream Cleanser and the Revitalizing Toner.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin looking fresh and feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Needed a mild cleanser for my face</li>
            <li> Nice, citrusy scent, goes on smooth, removes makeup and daily grime.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle and great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> My face feels very soft, smooth and clean with no irritation!</li>
            <li> Lovely product for very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> However, this product calmed down the irritation and it is so much better!!  </li>
            <li> I have the most sensitive skin, with rosasea and sun</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to most any product used for the face.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Most cleansers make me break out, even ones that say for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t foam or leave my face feeling super clean, but it works very well</li>
            <li> So light, leaves my face clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> I had received samples of other SkinCeuticals products from the esthetician, at my dermatologist&#x27;s office, loved them but found them to be a bit pricey, when purchased at my doctor&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> but when you actually dry your face it feel very nice and best of all not dry and tight like when I use my old products.</li>
            <li> I also purchased their Renew Overnight Dry, which is not heavy or greasy and leaves my skin feeling great in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t like any fragrances in my soaps, but I love the smell of this cleaner.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels clean and nourished after use and makes my moisturizer more effective by preparing the skin properly for other products.  </li>
            <li> Gentle, mild and no fragrance.</li>
            <li> Once I&#x27;ve removed my eye makeup, I use one pump of the Mild Cream Cleanser and use a circular motion with both hands to gently cleanse the skin.</li>
            <li> This product works well and is very gentle on my skin</li>
            <li> Very gentle cream cleanser and does the trick.</li>
            <li> Very gentle cleaser</li>
            <li> Than you very much.</li>
            <li> Skin feels soft, clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I use several of the Skin Ceutical products and love them all.</li>
            <li> i have used the clear gel cleanser from skinceuticals that is for normal skin and LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> I started to think I had Rosacea as the redness and bumps were quite evident.</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve purchased it online, and not at a doctor&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> Just started using it and the smell is the first thing I noticed.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still on my first order.  </li>
            <li> The only reason why it did not receive a 5 star from my is because it doesn&#x27;t take 100% off your make up, but it does take most of it off.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t quite do the job of removing eye makeup, but overall I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Very gentle with a terrific but very mild orange scent.</li>
            <li> Such a clean fragrance!</li>
            <li> I have combination problematic skin and this is the first cleanser that has really worked for me.</li>
            <li> It is gentle; it keeps my face very clean and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  </li>
            <li> What is great about this cleanser is it takes a very little amount; rinses off thoroughly even with cool water; and contrary to its recommended &amp;#34;twice daily&amp;#34; use, a nightly cleansing is all you need, especially for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> have been used this Gentle Milk cleanser for a month</li>
            <li> Smooth and creamy going on and deep cleans without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this with my Clarisonic and really like the results.  </li>
            <li> I really like Skin Ceuticals and used to use them years ago.  </li>
            <li> It is a non drying, gentle cleanser.  </li>
            <li> It does not do much-</li>
            <li> and I really like this</li>
            <li> works yet is gentle</li>
            <li> Very gentle and no heavy fragrances...</li>
            <li> My dermatologist office stated that it does NOT remove make-up and recommended using a wash cloth or Jane Iredale&#x27;s magic mitt with water only to remove make-up prior to using SkinCeuticals Gentle Cleaner.  </li>
            <li> Since I use prescribed medicines by my Dermatologist, it was important that I use a cleanser that wouldn&#x27;t dry or irritate my skin and this meets both criteria.  </li>
            <li> I may have mild Rosacea that may need to be addressed later.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, even some soaps hurt it, but this was gentle and it has helped with acne</li>
            <li> This product really did not work well for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> this product is intended for those with VERY sensitive skin who cannot use normal cleansers.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and I cannot use OTC moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> The feel of the cleanser on the skin is very soft.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this product has not made my face break out.</li>
            <li> Perfect for cold, dry NE winter months</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure about this product, it is completely different than what I am use to (neutragina natural), this product feels a little greasy when I wash my face</li>
            <li> It does not dry your skin like many other facial cleansers.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be clear...</li>
            <li> Otherwise, you will find that your skin does not feel as clean as you would want, leaving a slight &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; on the face.  </li>
            <li> My face is 68 years old</li>
            <li> , I have rosesaca and am sensitive to almost everything.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My mother, an esthetician recommended it for my combination, sensitive skin</li>
            <li> , I tried SkinCeuticals sensitive cleanser out.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and supple with no residue.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend for sensitive or older skin.</li>
            <li> once I can no longer use the pump part, I take the entire bottle, turn it over and let it transfer out into the new container.</li>
            <li> Gets your skin clean without being dry or rough.</li>
            <li> Without removing the cleanser, I usually then use my Clarisonic brush to get an even deeper clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other SkinCeutical products, including another cleanser, but found this one to be much gentler on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 27 year old male that has dryer skin on my face.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t make my skin better, doesn&#x27;t make it worse.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the pump top had popped up during shipping and the cleanser was all inside the shipping box, and the bottle was half full.</li>
            <li> I tend to have dry sensitive skin, so I like this cleanser because it&#x27;s gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin!</li>
            <li> Does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> It cleans and yet it does not dry out you skin.</li>
            <li> I use this product with my Clarisonic skin brush and my face is clear &amp; soft, not dry as with some other cleansers.</li>
            <li> This is the first cleanser I have ever used that has not left my skin feeling tight and dry, afterwards.  </li>
            <li> With the combination of this and their other products I now have clear skin again!  </li>
            <li> I will buy it again when this one is empty (if I live that long).</li>
            <li> Usually, my face is dry right after washing, but not with this.  </li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t clean any of my makeup and even if with no makeup, the residue&#x27;s still left behind.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time so quite affordable to use daily.</li>
            <li> You can use it multiple times a day and your face will not feel dry and irritated.</li>
            <li> Not only does it have a delicate, unoffensive scent, it works really, really well.  </li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> and I break out less when I&#x27;m using it regularly.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it did not do anything in terms of helping with my mild breakouts.</li>
            <li> My skin is not dry and tight afterwards like with other cleansers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey for the size, but since a little goes a long way, I&#x27;ll definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> My skin feels much less dry after washing it, especially in the harsh Minnesota climate.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I did not get breakouts with using it like with other products I tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely overpriced</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product hands down.</li>
            <li> If you have uneven skin tone due to age, sun exposure, etc.</li>
            <li> At the time I purchased this my skin was recovering from irritation due to a harsh exfoliant.</li>
            <li> less.  </li>
            <li> The price is significantly less on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I find a lot of the cream goes to waste because of the pump, so</li>
            <li> Actually it made it worse.</li>
            <li> I have used skinceuticals on the recommendation of my dermatologist for about the past 2 years.  </li>
            <li> I usually get it when I go to my derm, but then just decided to order it online.</li>
            <li> me it has been really hard to find a cleanser that cleans without irritating my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I have a weird smell thing</li>
            <li> Feel like I&#x27;m washing my face with cold cream.</li>
            <li> so i purchased this one and was very disappointed.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> I have used skinceuticals on the recommendation of my dermatologist for about the past 2 years.  This cleanser is the best! If you have uneven skin tone due to age, sun exposure, etc. this is a fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have combination problematic skin and this is the first cleanser that has really worked for me. It reduces redness and blemishes. And it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Use all SkinCeutical products. Love them</li>
            <li> Smelled wonderful (lightly orange) but really did not remove makeup very well.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product prepares  the skin and  feels great and ready for the rest of the skin ceutical products</li>
            <li> Great product, works great, use as directed only need a little, would buy again, love the whole line, worth the price</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Skinceuticals Gentle Mild Cream Cleanser and the Revitalizing Toner. It works great on my sensitive skin and the fragrance is so clean and refreshing. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great cleanser</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser I have ever used on my face -- I have rosacea, and this cleanser was recommended to me by my dermatologist as a good one for my temperamental skin.  It is gentle; it keeps my face very clean and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  I generally don&#x27;t like any fragrances in my soaps, but I love the smell of this cleaner.  It is light with a touch of citrus.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be clear...this product is intended for those with VERY sensitive skin who cannot use normal cleansers.  Otherwise, you will find that your skin does not feel as clean as you would want, leaving a slight &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; on the face.  My dermatologist office stated that it does NOT remove make-up and recommended using a wash cloth or Jane Iredale&#x27;s magic mitt with water only to remove make-up prior to using SkinCeuticals Gentle Cleaner.  This is a two step process.  That said, I still experienced itchiness on both my face and neck after using this product.  If you are in need of this type of product, I strongly recommend Clinique&#x27;s Liquid Soap Extra-Mild.  Same type of product, does not irritate my skin and costs $20. less.  Take it from one who has tried many products, and good luck to you!</li>
            <li> Very gentle cream cleanser and does the trick. Skin feels soft, clean and fresh. Having a rejuvenated, pampered making home treatment feel like a spa at home.</li>
            <li> I have the most sensitive skin, with rosasea and sun irritation.&lt;br /&gt;For me it has been really hard to find a cleanser that cleans without irritating my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have been used this Gentle Milk cleanser for a month and I feel my skin smooth, clean and perfect!</li>
            <li> great product i have used it for 15 years.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for almost a year and love it.  The orange blossom scent is amazing.  I use several of the Skin Ceutical products and love them all.</li>
            <li> Silky and rich cleanser, I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cleanser for years. It&#x27;s mild yet very effective. Leaves my face feeling clean and soft. Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> i have used the clear gel cleanser from skinceuticals that is for normal skin and LOVE it.  it was not availble from this seller so i purchased this one and was very disappointed.  It did not lather at all- even on my clairsonic brush.  my face still had makeup on it after using this- do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser. It is not drying and I think it&#x27;s nice and gentle on my skin. I have been using it about two years. I find a lot of the cream goes to waste because of the pump, so once I can no longer use the pump part, I take the entire bottle, turn it over and let it transfer out into the new container. I want every drop especially at this price.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin. At the time I purchased this my skin was recovering from irritation due to a harsh exfoliant.

            <li> This is the first cleanser I have ever used that has not left my skin feeling tight and dry, afterwards.  It also has a very pleasant, refreshing scent.  I had received samples of other SkinCeuticals products from the esthetician, at my dermatologist&#x27;s office, loved them but found them to be a bit pricey, when purchased at my doctor&#x27;s.

            <li> This product really did not work well for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Needed a mild cleanser for my face (I have rosacea) and bought this one based on the excellent reviews on Amazon. I do love it, it is gentle to my face and I LOVE the smell. Will definitely buy again when it runs out.</li>
            <li> I received this. thanks!</li>
            <li> Love this product and use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Lovely product for very sensitive skin. Butting her saves me driving to the dermatologist. Lasts a long time so quite affordable to use daily.</li>
            <li> Great product for cleansing your face. It cleans and yet it does not dry out you skin. I have used this product for a number of years.</li>
            <li> I am having a laser lift done and the doctor&#x27;s office recommends these products.  I got the cleanser thinking that it might make a difference on my skin but it hasn&#x27;t.  When it&#x27;s gone, I think I&#x27;ll go back to Olay cleansers.</li>
            <li> wife and daughter both love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> This is just a wonderful product as is their complete line.  It was recommended by my esthetician and I will continue to use it because it is such a good product.</li>
            <li> This may be mild, but it really does a good job in keeping my, hmmmm...less than youthful skin looking nice.</li>
            <li> Smooth and creamy going on and deep cleans without drying out my skin. Leaves my skin looking fresh and feeling clean. Very gentle and no heavy fragrances... I would definitely recommend for sensitive or older skin.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time, no damage, service was very good and I would order from this supplier again</li>
            <li> SkinCeuticals is recommended by my aesthetician.  It especially kind to sensitive skin and I have used it for more than two years.</li>
            <li> I love SkinCeuticals!!!</li>
            <li> Thank you for your great service.  SkinCeuticals is the best!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, and I love it.  First time I&#x27;ve purchased it online, and not at a doctor&#x27;s office.  Unfortunately, the pump top had popped up during shipping and the cleanser was all inside the shipping box, and the bottle was half full.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling silky!</li>
            <li> I love this wash! I usually get it when I go to my derm, but then just decided to order it online. Very speedy and really great product! I tend to have dry sensitive skin, so I like this cleanser because it&#x27;s gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin!</li>
            <li> My face is 68 years old so I don&#x27;t expect miracles from beauty products. What is great about this cleanser is it takes a very little amount; rinses off thoroughly even with cool water; and contrary to its recommended &amp;#34;twice daily&amp;#34; use, a nightly cleansing is all you need, especially for sensitive skin. I will buy it again when this one is empty (if I live that long).</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Very gentle with a terrific but very mild orange scent.</li>
            <li> This leaves my skin feeling soooo nice and supple.  Usually, my face is dry right after washing, but not with this.  I use this with my Clarisonic and really like the results.  My skin is very sensitive and I cannot use OTC moisturizers.  This does not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> Just started using it and the smell is the first thing I noticed.  It smells like orange.  The feel of the cleanser on the skin is very soft. I have very sensitive skin, even some soaps hurt it, but this was gentle and it has helped with acne</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 27 year old male that has dryer skin on my face. I tried this out and it made me break out 2 days later. Immediately returned it. It does feel soft and have a nice smell, but didn&#x27;t do the job for me.</li>
            <li> I really like Skin Ceuticals and used to use them years ago.  After a recent facial it was recommended that I try them again and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> I have used this for several years now and it is absolutely the best face cleanser there is. I&#x27;ve tried others at the recommendation of friends, but they just don&#x27;t come close to this one.</li>
            <li> Once you use this product you will not be able to use anything else.  If you have sensitive skin it is amazing!!  You can use it multiple times a day and your face will not feel dry and irritated.</li>
            <li> My #1 cleanser, love it!</li>
            <li> Love love love this product.  I have used this product for years.  It is a non drying, gentle cleanser.  Best cleanser I have used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other SkinCeutical products, including another cleanser, but found this one to be much gentler on my sensitive skin.  Nice, citrusy scent, goes on smooth, removes makeup and daily grime.  Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Just as it says. Gentle, mild and no fragrance. Probably just as good as Cetaphil for twice the price though.</li>
            <li> This product has a great light scent of orange.  It does not dry your skin like many other facial cleansers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like cream than a cleanser. Wouldn&#x27;t clean any of my makeup and even if with no makeup, the residue&#x27;s still left behind. Feel like I&#x27;m washing my face with cold cream.</li>
            <li> I use this product with my Clarisonic skin brush and my face is clear &amp; soft, not dry as with some other cleansers. Gets your skin clean without being dry or rough.</li>
            <li> A good, gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this cleanser by my dermotologist, and love the creamy consistency. My skin feels much less dry after washing it, especially in the harsh Minnesota climate. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to most any product used for the face. This works well for me when I&#x27;m on vacation and have to remove my sunblock before bed. It does not burn or irritate my face at all.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast service!</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser!  Perfect for cold, dry NE winter months</li>
            <li> It smells great. Use with a Clair I sonic for deep Genta cleaning</li>
            <li> This cleanser is simply wonderful. It&#x27;s a creamy cleanser, not a foaming cleanser, which I thought I would not like. I&#x27;ve found that I love it. Once I&#x27;ve removed my eye makeup, I use one pump of the Mild Cream Cleanser and use a circular motion with both hands to gently cleanse the skin. Without removing the cleanser, I usually then use my Clarisonic brush to get an even deeper clean. I finish by splashing my face with warm water, or sometimes using a washcloth and warm water, to remove the cleanser. My skin feels so clean and smooth when I&#x27;m done, and I love the light, fresh scent. I was very happy to discover that I could get my favorite cleanser from Amazon.</li>
            <li> It does not do much- doesn&#x27;t make my skin better, doesn&#x27;t make it worse. Indifference. Actually it made it worse. I&#x27;ll try it again later on</li>
            <li> This is another product that was recommended to me and I decided to try it out.  Very gentle cleaser and I love the way my skin feels after using it - a keeper.</li>
            <li> This cleanser smells amazing and so gentle to the skin.  My face feels very soft, smooth and clean with no irritation!</li>
            <li> Very nice product for sensitive skin, I have rosesaca and am sensitive to almost everything.  I can use this product--Yeah!</li>
            <li> Will not buy again! Does not leave my face clean!</li>
            <li> Wonderful face&lt;br /&gt;Wash! Not&lt;br /&gt;Too&lt;br /&gt;Harsh on our skin!! Well worth the money&lt;br /&gt;For&lt;br /&gt;Sure check&lt;br /&gt;It&lt;br /&gt;Out&lt;br /&gt;On amazon!</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser.  Since I use prescribed medicines by my Dermatologist, it was important that I use a cleanser that wouldn&#x27;t dry or irritate my skin and this meets both criteria.  It has a light lather and rinses off well.  My face feels clean and refreshed after using it twice a day.  It last for awhile and I&#x27;m still on my first order.  It&#x27;s a little pricey for the size, but since a little goes a long way, I&#x27;ll definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and I really like this product.&lt;br /&gt;It was recommended by my dr and now I understand why.&lt;br /&gt;I works yet is gentle and I don&#x27;t react to it.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this product again and from this seller.</li>
            <li> I love the grapefruit scent and the micro scrubbing bits in this cleanser.  My skin feels clean and nourished after use and makes my moisturizer more effective by preparing the skin properly for other products.  I look forward to washing my face at night!</li>
            <li> This cleanser felt amazing and creamy on my skin but unfortunately it did not do anything in terms of helping with my mild breakouts. If you get occasional break outs you&#x27;ll  need something additional to help with that, But I cannot say enough about how creamy this feels On your face!</li>
            <li> With the combination of this and their other products I now have clear skin again!  Very happy!!! Than you very much.</li>
            <li> I have been using this face wash since I was in college. My mother, an esthetician recommended it for my combination, sensitive skin and it is the only thing I trust. It is very mild and I use it with my clarisonic although it works fine without it. I would buy the face cream to accompany it, skinceuticals is a great brand!</li>
            <li> Most cleansers make me break out, even ones that say for sensitive skin.  Based on the reviews here, I tried SkinCeuticals sensitive cleanser out. Not only does it have a delicate, unoffensive scent, it works really, really well.  My skin is not dry and tight afterwards like with other cleansers. It foams up nicely and rinses completely. I did not get breakouts with using it like with other products I tried. I cannot recommend this product highly enough. I also purchased their Renew Overnight Dry, which is not heavy or greasy and leaves my skin feeling great in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, you will love it!</li>
            <li> This is the only product that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Love the light orange scent.&lt;br /&gt;I used to buy this product directly from my local dermatologist, was very happy to find on amazon. Product is 100% SkinCeuticals!</li>
            <li> Very gentle and great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Such a clean fragrance! It  makes washing your face a pleasure! Best face wash that I have used and I will reorder it again!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a spa...extremely happy with it and price was great.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and I have a weird smell thing and this product achieves both of my concerns.  It smells amazing.  It is a great cleanser but very gentle for my skin.  My mother used it in my shower while visiting, and now she&#x27;s a user of this product.</li>
            <li> I use this cleanser every morning. It leaves my skin soft and supple with no residue. Love it! A big fan of the entire SkinCeuticals line!</li>
            <li> The price was excellent and the cleanser worked as expected</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure about this product, it is completely different than what I am use to (neutragina natural), this product feels a little greasy when I wash my face but when you actually dry your face it feel very nice and best of all not dry and tight like when I use my old products. I have very sensitive skin and this product has not made my face break out. The only reason why it did not receive a 5 star from my is because it doesn&#x27;t take 100% off your make up, but it does take most of it off. Overall, very happy with this product, by the way, the texture is creamy, so I don&#x27;t recommend it if you have oily skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great cleanser with a very pleasant citrus aroma! It doesn&#x27;t quite do the job of removing eye makeup, but overall I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and this cleanser is perfect for me. I have been using it for years as recommended by my dermatologist. This coupled with my Glytone Step Up level 2 rejuvenation cream have kept my rosacea at bay! I would recommend this product hands down.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash.  It&#x27;s extremely overpriced but I&#x27;ve found nothing else to rival it in a more appropriate price range.  It doesn&#x27;t foam or leave my face feeling super clean, but it works very well and I break out less when I&#x27;m using it regularly.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 5 years.  My favorite face cleanser ever.  So light, leaves my face clean and soft.  Also has a lovely fresh scent.  Tempted to buy a lifetime supply just in case they so making it.  :-)</li>
            <li> This is a great cleanser for irritated and sensitive skin.</li>
