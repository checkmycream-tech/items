            <li> Just purchased it a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> Really hard to plug in but charges well.</li>
            <li> This product sucks don&#x27;t get it</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with the product.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this replacement unit and it arrived before my razor was discharged into a useless chunk of metal.  </li>

            <li> I only gave it a four for lateness of delivery...other than that fits perfectly with the razor.  It is a perfect replacement!</li>
            <li> It is slightly bigger than original, but not bad.  The adapter plug is a bonus. I&#x27;ve had it several months but only need to charge my shaver about once a month so cannot tell how long it will last.</li>
            <li> I love my Norelco for shaving my head bald. I misplaced the charger on a trip, so had to replace it.  Highly recommended.</li>

            <li> Everything went great.  I accidentally threw away the charging cord to my shaver and this saved the day.  I now don&#x27;t have to buy a new shaver.</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with the product.  However, it was not very useful because the electric razor I used had a burned circuit board.  The chord is clunky.</li>
            <li> goes to my shaver and its still working</li>

            <li> Works like a charm. Right size and everything. Bought it cuz I lost my original one and it&#x27;s a good replacement</li>
            <li> It did pretty much as expected. I guess I could have given it 5 stars, but that&#x27;s seems a reach since it&#x27;s just a power cord and it hasn&#x27;t withstood the test of time yet.</li>
            <li> Really hard to plug in but charges well.</li>

            <li> The charger works great and it came to my house quicker than expected. I would definitely recommend it to those in need..</li>

            <li> Good quality for the price. Works well and I like the extra international plug adapter.  Keeps the shaver humming along.</li>

            <li> I was told by several stores locally, that this item couldn&#x27;t be purchased anywhere.  They hoped to sell me a whole new shaver, I guess.  It does the job and at a good price.</li>

It charges my husband&#x27;s electric shaver just as well as the original cord.&lt;br /&gt;I looked around online and Amazon had the best price by far on this item. Don&#x27;t spend more - buy it here! It works! And the seller shipped it out very quickly, too.</li>

            <li> great  ..great quality</li>
            <li> my husband lost the charger and so we needed to replace it and it works just like the original charger.</li>
            <li> The charger Does work as intended. HOWEVER, one of the prongs detached from the plug the second time I removed it from the wall socket. Fortunately, these are repair friendly and I was able to open the unit and re-solder the prong to the wiring inside.</li>
            <li> Received sooner than promised. Exactly as described and product had worked flawlessly. I would buy again from this retailer. Packaging was adequate.</li>
            <li> It fits, charges and is very affordable. Compared to the OEM, this is a better option.</li>
            <li> just what i needed to get my razer working again</li>
            <li> This product sucks don&#x27;t get it I won&#x27;t charge my machine...</li>
            <li> Great Seller - great product !!!</li>
            <li> This cord was a perfect replacement for the one my backup unit needed. If you are looking for one find the model of your electronic and match it to the cord, that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> It was just that. A simple solution to my problem (power cord) and it arrive well ahead of projection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> The charger works as advertised and is more compact than the original charger. which I had lost.  I would give it five stars except that when charging a completely discharged PC it get very hot - not dangerously hot but enough that I was concerned about how long it would last. In normal use it works just fine.</li>
            <li> Somehow my HQ8505 charger for my Norelco electric razor disappeared.  I ordered this replacement unit and it arrived before my razor was discharged into a useless chunk of metal.  It seems to work as well as the original and even comes with a Euro plug adaptor for traveling abroad.  I like it that it plugs in from the side so that it does not crowd out other devices on a wall strip.  What&#x27;s not to like?  RJB.</li>
            <li> These replacement cords can be tricky.  Make sure you order the correct one as noted on your shaver.  This was perfect for us, and was at a good price.</li>
            <li> Buy with confidence. I received what I requested with no issues. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Cat chewed up my husband&#x27;s charger for his razor.  This replacement got here quickly and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product!! Customer service was Outstanding.  I will be a defiantly returning customer very soon.</li>
