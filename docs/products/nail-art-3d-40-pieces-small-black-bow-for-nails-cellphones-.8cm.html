            <li> They are very hard with no curve to them, a bit too big for nail art, so unless you can super glue it close to the cuticle they may be too cumbersome to apply...</li>

            <li> and i cant waite yo paint my nails pink and white with these black bows!</li>

            <li> what I was looking for they are plain and hard to attach.</li>
            <li> there were 40 pieces like advertised, unfortunately one had a broken tip, but it&#x27;s really not super noticeable.</li>
            <li> I tried to apply these with nail tweasers and it proved to be a difficult task.</li>

            <li> took forever to get here!!!&lt;br /&gt;But when it did arrive.... I loved it!!!&lt;br /&gt;there where exactly 40 bows! all neat!</li>
            <li> The first photo I attached is how they were packaged and the second photo is when I counted them out...there were 40 pieces like advertised, unfortunately one had a broken tip, but it&#x27;s really not super noticeable. They are very hard with no curve to them, a bit too big for nail art, so unless you can super glue it close to the cuticle they may be too cumbersome to apply...but that&#x27;s my fault for not paying attention to the measurements. I am sure I will find a use for them, so overall I am happy.</li>
            <li> Just the right size for my nail bed!  Great quality and item received earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> these bows go with every nail polish because they are black . everyone loves these. my sister always wants me to do her nails using bows. they are the right size for your nails. I recommend these for nail art and for decorating your phone case or maybe anything you can think of.</li>
            <li> Cute bows and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Very cute nail art. I wish they had a curve to them though I feel they would stay on the nail a lot better if they did</li>
            <li> Loooove these!! Came sooner than expected and definitely adds a nice touch to any design especially for the holidays . The size was just right also .</li>
            <li> the bows were cute but not what I was looking for they are plain and hard to attach. they are straight and nails are rounded.</li>
            <li> Black matte bakground, add one of these and you will have beatigul nails :p</li>

            <li> Adorable.... They stay put with a little bit of super glue.  The only down fall. Is I&#x27;m a hairdresser and it snags in the hair. But other then that. I love them.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I bought them!!!</li>
            <li> Very cute little 3d gems. However they are LITTLE. I tried to apply these with nail tweasers and it proved to be a difficult task.</li>
            <li> These are way too big for nail art. I was upset at first because they aren&#x27;t as flat as they should be so that they can stick and you HAVE to have long nails in order to make this fit. It&#x27;s too big otherwise. I&#x27;m going to use them for a phone case instead..</li>
            <li> they are great my clients love them</li>
            <li> Perfect size . Im a nail tech and i use black bows on lots of my clients.  I really love them and recommend it to anyone who is into 3d&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Actually was thinking twice about this purchase because of the rest of the reviews but when they came in the mail i was so excited! Just as the picture and i cant waite yo paint my nails pink and white with these black bows!</li>
