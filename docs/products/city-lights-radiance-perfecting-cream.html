    <ol>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have to wear foundation anymore because this cream makes my skin look naturally flawless!!!</li>
            <li>Best Skin Product on the Market&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I read the review on one website that this product is the best for 2014.</li>
            <li>Well, if you consider the time I have had to use this product and the results being said that it was so wonderful and</li>
            <li>I saw this product on some website touting how great it is.</li>
            <li>All I know is, for my skin type and with the issue that I am trying to resolve, this cream is doing a great job.</li>
            <li>Continuing to use morning and evening for the rest of the week, and the results were absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>Excellent accurate descrption on results</li>
            <li>A fair moisturizing cream, but it does nothing for my age spots on my hands after using for almost a year.</li>
            <li>THAT GOOD....</li>
            <li>It is a bit greasy for my taste in moisturizers, but it does a good job with that also.</li>
            <li>I was thinking of Consumer&#x27;s Report, which I thought was a good endorsement.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light, creamy consistency with a very pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product since November (along with City Syn and City Views Rapid Eye Repair Cream) and am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I have not seen any difference in the hyperpigmentation that I experienced after laser treatment of the lines over my top lip.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product feels amazing</li>
            <li>If you looking for spot removal, buy their spot treatment, which is also incredibly effective.</li>
            <li>but it is a nice moisturizer and did not clog my pores.</li>
            <li>The cream is nice as a moisturizer but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems like a nice moisturizer</li>
            <li>radiance perfecting cream is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I had been wearing my blouses buttoned up to the top because I was ashamed of the sun damage on my chest.  </li>
            <li>I think most items like this are &amp;#34;poof</li>
            <li>I bought three jars of this product and have been using it for more than 4 weeks</li>
            <li>I really want to try this product but haven&#x27;t seen great reviews.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know that you can realistically ask for more.</li>
            <li>Lots of the products that claim they fade age spots are nothing more than sun block.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice creamy product that goes on well, absorbs quickly and leaves the skin moisturized.</li>
            <li>and I think of it as my special CC cream, but better.</li>
            <li>I purchased the City Light and have used for about 3 months.</li>
            <li>The cream does make my skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li>However, I haven&#x27;t seen any lightening results after using it for a couple of months, so I really can&#x27;t tout that it has been effective.</li>
            <li>After you get the spots as light as they will get, I found that I needed to continue to use twice a week to maintain the lightening---and always use sunblock.</li>
            <li>YOU HAVE FREE SAMPLES.</li>
            <li>I have no idea if it is because of my skin type or color, but this product is doing a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>The manufacturers add that the product is cruelty-free, and has not been tested on animals, an important consideration for some of us.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is smooth and creamy and you can feel the cream tightening your skin.</li>
            <li>The formula does contain alcohol, some familiar names like sorbitol and glycerin, also fruit and flower extracts.</li>
            <li>CITY LIGHTS RADIANCE PERFECTING CREAM is, seemingly, a fairly new, fairly controversial product from a fairly new, controversial cosmetics company, City Beauty.  </li>
            <li>so be aware if you decide to buy this product!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have &amp;#34;brown spots&amp;#34; so much as brownish generalized discoloring from too much sun and too many years (I&#x27;m 60).  </li>
            <li>worth 4$.</li>
            <li>It took over a month to work, but many of the spots are barely visible now.  </li>
            <li>I have clear skin, darkened spots are fading, it doesn&#x27;t clog pores, and my skin feels and looks smooth and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I like this cream very much.  </li>
            <li>So, like a fool, without first looking for reviews, I fell for the ploy.</li>
            <li>I wish I had checked out Amazon&#x27;s reviews first</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t really absorb all the way into your skin.</li>
            <li>I really wished that this would&#x27;ve worked.</li>
            <li>This was a whole lot of money, for a whole lot of nothing.</li>
            <li>on it goes, poof nothing happens&amp;#34;&#x27; but this product really seems to work.  </li>
            <li>Very pricey product for something that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Has not made that much of a difference,Will finish the jar before I decide to repurchase.</li>
            <li>I am really liking the results of City Lights.</li>
            <li>I not only noticed a difference after just a week, but with continued use my spots are now just lightly visible.</li>
            <li>This product removes the sun spots on my shoulders fast.</li>
            <li>BECAUSE IT REALLY WORKS.I USE IT TWICE A DAY</li>
            <li>THANKS AGAIN....</li>
            <li>it is soft goes right into the skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many expensive creams and lasers and this product is by far my favorite!  </li>
            <li>I have seen some improvement with my dark spots and hopefully will see even more when I finish up the jar.  </li>
            <li>After using a very recognizable name brand for over a year with no noticeable change, I switched to City Lights and within a month I am seeing a big change.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes.</li>
            <li>More wasted money.  </li>
            <li>All the spots had lightened so much that they were barely noticeable!  </li>
            <li>City Cosmetics has a DIFFERENT product just for that This product works EXACTLY as they say it does.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this!  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on this company when you can get better products from real companies with actual clinic studies.</li>
            <li>Too early to tell if the product is living up to its PR.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your time or money on this product.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t tell the difference since starting to use it, which was about 3 weeks ago.  </li>
            <li>It took much longer to remove the smaller spots on my face, and did not fix that spot on my temple that I got it for.</li>
            <li>the reviews of their various products suggest 4 weeks of use but that results are seen much sooner, the fact that the same language, more or less in the same words, comes up over and over again in &amp;#34;independent&amp;#34; reviews suggests that they are posted by the same people&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have noticed though all the bad reviews are people only trying it out for a couple of weeks, I would like to hear more comments on people who have stuck with it for more than a month or two.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure but this cream is not working for me it clear my skin but not my dark spots I&#x27;m not going to give more time</li>
            <li>Reminds me of the old &amp;#34;Ponds&amp;#34; hand cream from back in the day.</li>
            <li>No sun damage on my face in the near future.</li>
            <li>I had dark large spots on my arm---I applied this cream at night, and by morning the spots had lightened by 50%.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much difference in my dark spots since I started using the cream.</li>
            <li>one very dark large one is diminishing beyond what I thought it would</li>

            <li> Reminds me of the old &amp;#34;Ponds&amp;#34; hand cream from back in the day.</li>
            <li> No sun damage on my face in the near future.</li>
            <li> I had dark large spots on my arm---I applied this cream at night, and by morning the spots had lightened by 50%.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much difference in my dark spots since I started using the cream.</li>
            <li> one very dark large one is diminishing beyond what I thought it would</li>
            <li> I dont know if my results are different than others because my complextion is dark naturally.</li>
            <li> To make a long story short, I bought two extra jars for a lower promotional price.</li>
            <li> The makers suggest that the product be applied directly to aging or dark spots for intensive treatment, or, on the face and neck with a circular motion for preventive care.  </li>
            <li> I can only testify for myself, this product is staying on my shelf for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> I have been using the cream for months only on the age spots, so it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on this junk back in 2006 and the formulas haven&#x27;t changed since then.</li>
            <li> I have read other reviews on this cream, some negative, some slightly positive.</li>
            <li> I have ordered products like this before to find that they do not live up to expectations.  </li>
            <li> It promises that its new high performance formula will combat dullness, uneven skin tone, and discoloration, if you&#x27;ve got those sun spots, or liver spots, as they used to call them, big ugly freckles that pop out, particularly on older people, after a surfeit of sun.  </li>
            <li> The reason I say that is I love playing tennis but hate the sun spots it brought me, so once a year I go to my dermatologist for a simple laser impulse procedure to remove/lighten up my sun spots, but I now just realized I haven&#x27;t been going for the last two years and looks like no need to.</li>
            <li> Dark spots on hands diminishing to pale color so far and</li>
            <li> and I did see some improvement on the smaller less dark spots but for the most part, it did not do what it claimed to do for a very expensive price.</li>
            <li> The effect of this product is none, not only my brown spot become lighter, but it become a little darker than before.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars on creams at neiman marcus and saks.  </li>
            <li> After using 3/4 of the jar, there really is no change.  </li>
            <li> Topical creams are a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know where the Internet before and after photos come from, but they are definitely not real.</li>
            <li> Have noticed only a very slight diference.</li>
            <li> I even used other product to hopefully compliment the results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the site for the product even contradicts itself, sometimes noting a 30 day and other times a 60 day guarantee for its products&lt;</li>
            <li> Several dark spots have lightened a bit, and some nasty new wrinkles that were appearing around my mouth seem to be appearing more slowly.  </li>
            <li> I did notice that new blemishes do not leave dark marks behind.</li>
            <li> I would say that my complexion seems smoother and brighter, but I still have pronounced dark spots.  </li>
            <li> I bought this thinking that it could help with some of my dark spots (sun damage) in my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I purchased the product to help even skin tone and fade dark patches on my face and it did not do either</li>
            <li> I have used this product for two months on a slightly dark age spot.</li>
            <li> Bit pricy for an item that is suppose to lighten dark spots.  </li>
            <li> I have used one and a half jars and my dark spots have not faded whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product one month and can see a slight difference in one brown splot.  </li>
            <li> Half the jar is gone and I see no change in my skin.  </li>
            <li> You must use sunblock on the treated areas--if you don&#x27;t and the treated area is exposed to sun, the dark spots will immediately return!</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream itself is a little heavy</li>
            <li> My skin tone was uneven, it was somewhat blotchy in places</li>
            <li> Its for women with uneven skin and areas of dullness.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money...</li>
            <li> I have used this product everyday since I recieved it.  </li>
            <li> I already order one from a dermatologist to replace this waste of money on city lights</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Still gimmicky junk that is way over priced.</li>
            <li> Lights, you should be ashamed of yourself for false advertising and for your grossly inflated prices.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money!</li>
            <li> In fact I bought and used this product to treat my small brown spot on my cheek since 11/07/2013 until now 03/11/2014.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to waste my time to use the remaining of this product again!</li>

            <li> For all of you that are using this cream for spot removal...City Cosmetics has a DIFFERENT product just for that This product works EXACTLY as they say it does. My skin tone was uneven, it was somewhat blotchy in places and I had patches of dryness. This cream literally made my skin radiant! I don&#x27;t even have to wear foundation anymore because this cream makes my skin look naturally flawless!!! If you looking for spot removal, buy their spot treatment, which is also incredibly effective. This product feels amazing and I think of it as my special CC cream, but better. Its for women with uneven skin and areas of dullness. This cream made my skin come back to life! Thank you City Cosmetics!!! You saved me from buying all kinds of expensive pore-clogging foundations to hide my uneven, dull skin tone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product one month and can see a slight difference in one brown splot.  I was disappointed since this product was highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I purchased the City Light and have used for about 3 months. It does nothing to the brown spots on my face. I was trusting the review web site, bought 2 bottles. Waste of money. Can&#x27;t get even refund for the unopened bottle.</li>
            <li> Such a disappoint since it did nothing for me after using it faithfully.  I bought 3 bottles from City Cosmetics at a discount and they will not give me a refund since it was past the 60 days that I finished my first bottle.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money!</li>
            <li> Too early to tell if the product is living up to its PR.  Takes a while to work, I&#x27;m told.</li>
            <li> City Lights has not done a thing for the brown spots on my face.  I have used the product 3 times a day.  More wasted money.  I had high hopes.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for about 2 weeks, but I have not noticed any improvement in the age spots on my face.  I will continue to use it to see if I notice any improvement at all.  I would say that my complexion seems smoother and brighter, but I still have pronounced dark spots.  I have never found any product that works on reducing the appearance of brown spots.</li>
            <li> Half the jar is gone and I see no change in my skin.  I could be that I just have stubborn spots.</li>
            <li> Best Skin Product on the Market&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;city lights radiance perfecting cream does everything that was stated by the company.  I have clear skin, darkened spots are fading, it doesn&#x27;t clog pores, and my skin feels and looks smooth and fresh.  it&#x27;s a terrific product.  i&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars on creams at neiman marcus and saks.  radiance perfecting cream is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since November (along with City Syn and City Views Rapid Eye Repair Cream) and am very pleased with the results.  I feel that it has improved my skin tone, elasticity and over all appearance.  I was recently at the grocery store and was asked to show my ID, when the check out clerk looked at my age she said that I looked much younger - That&#x27;s enough proof for me!!!</li>
            <li> I saw this product on some website touting how great it is. So, like a fool, without first looking for reviews, I fell for the ploy. I&#x27;ve used this cream for 3 months now under my eyes. Despite City Lights&#x27; claim of lightening and brightening, the age-related darker skin tone under my eyes has not changed. Not one iota.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;City Lights, you should be ashamed of yourself for false advertising and for your grossly inflated prices.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking that it could help with some of my dark spots (sun damage) in my cheeks. I used this product for 3 months and I did see some improvement on the smaller less dark spots but for the most part, it did not do what it claimed to do for a very expensive price. I even used other product to hopefully compliment the results. I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream itself is a little heavy and it doesn&#x27;t really absorb all the way into your skin. It left an oily film on my face. I really wished that this would&#x27;ve worked. Now, back to the drawing board to see what else would work for me.</li>
            <li> Product is a scam&lt;br /&gt;Have been using it continuously (daily) for months and no change in coloration of brown spots. Do not waste your time or money on this product. It does not work</li>
            <li> I like this cream, it definitely lightened the spots on my face from sun and age. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have &amp;#34;brown spots&amp;#34; so much as brownish generalized discoloring from too much sun and too many years (I&#x27;m 60).  After using 3/4 of the jar, there really is no change.  If you want your skin to lose brown mask, or brown spots, you need laser and/or chemical peel.  Topical creams are a waste of money.  This was a whole lot of money, for a whole lot of nothing.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much difference in my dark spots since I started using the cream. The cream does make my skin feel smooth. I did notice that new blemishes do not leave dark marks behind. I dont know if my results are different than others because my complextion is dark naturally.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. It does not do anything. I read false reviews. And of course I called to get my money back but was outside the refund period.</li>
            <li> I purchased the product to help even skin tone and fade dark patches on my face and it did not do either but it is a nice moisturizer and did not clog my pores.</li>
            <li> I had been wearing my blouses buttoned up to the top because I was ashamed of the sun damage on my chest.  I think most items like this are &amp;#34;poof on it goes, poof nothing happens&amp;#34;&#x27; but this product really seems to work.  I am ordering another for my daughter who loves to go to Mexico and sun herself.</li>
            <li> This is a nice creamy product that goes on well, absorbs quickly and leaves the skin moisturized. However, I haven&#x27;t seen any lightening results after using it for a couple of months, so I really can&#x27;t tout that it has been effective.</li>
            <li> Waste of money...didn&#x27;t  help at all go to dollar store and spend your money ... I&#x27;m mad at myself for buying it...bought all of their products...none did what they claim Ugh!!,</li>
            <li> i like it it is soft goes right into the skin, the effects of clarity is shown immedialtely would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> I have used this product everyday since I recieved it.  No fading.  No difference what so ever. Save yourself the money and time</li>
            <li> I had dark large spots on my arm---I applied this cream at night, and by morning the spots had lightened by 50%. Continuing to use morning and evening for the rest of the week, and the results were absolutely amazing! All the spots had lightened so much that they were barely noticeable!  NOTE:  You must use sunblock on the treated areas--if you don&#x27;t and the treated area is exposed to sun, the dark spots will immediately return! After you get the spots as light as they will get, I found that I needed to continue to use twice a week to maintain the lightening---and always use sunblock.</li>
            <li> I used this cream nightly for about three months and saw no fading of discolored areas whatsoever.  The cream is nice as a moisturizer but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> I bought three jars of this product and have been using it for more than 4 weeks and I have noticed no lightening of the age spots on my hands and arms and no lightening of the brown areas on my face.  Do not waste your money on this!  I wish I had checked Amazon reviews before purchasing this.  I did not purchase this from Amazon.  It was purchased from City Lights manufacturer.  Like a fool, I believed the glowing reviews on their website.</li>
            <li> Stuff does not work way over priced it nothing but a bottle of lotion worth 4$. Please any buyers stay away from this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure but this cream is not working for me it clear my skin but not my dark spots I&#x27;m not going to give more time I already order one from a dermatologist to replace this waste of money on city lights maybe is my type if skin but the only thing I know is not doing nothing for me so be aware if you decide to buy this product!</li>
            <li> I have ordered products like this before to find that they do not live up to expectations.  This actually works!  Dark spots on hands diminishing to pale color so far and one very dark large one is diminishing beyond what I thought it would I will continue use and see what happens!</li>
            <li> Excellent accurate descrption on results</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see results and it is really expensive!</li>
            <li> Product was reviewed as one that would eliminate hyper pigmentation. I have not seen any difference in the hyperpigmentation that I experienced after laser treatment of the lines over my top lip.&lt;br /&gt;It seems like a nice moisturizer but that was not the reason for my purchasing the product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for two months on a slightly dark age spot. Have noticed only a very slight diference. Very pricey product for something that doesn&#x27;t work. I don&#x27;t know where the Internet before and after photos come from, but they are definitely not real.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t tell the difference since starting to use it, which was about 3 weeks ago.  Does it take longer to work?</li>
            <li> Been using it for two months. Has not made that much of a difference,Will finish the jar before I decide to repurchase.</li>
            <li> I really want to try this product but haven&#x27;t seen great reviews. I have noticed though all the bad reviews are people only trying it out for a couple of weeks, I would like to hear more comments on people who have stuck with it for more than a month or two. Rome wasn&#x27;t built in a day! Let&#x27;s not expect overnight miracles but a change in our skin. It takes time for your skin cells to turn over.until proven otherwise I will give 5 stars just from ingredients alone</li>
            <li> I am really liking the results of City Lights. After a week you can defiantly see a lightning of my age spots.</li>
            <li> A fair moisturizing cream, but it does nothing for my age spots on my hands after using for almost a year. Reminds me of the old &amp;#34;Ponds&amp;#34; hand cream from back in the day. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many expensive creams and lasers and this product is by far my favorite!  I not only noticed a difference after just a week, but with continued use my spots are now just lightly visible.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 3 weeks and havent noticed any improvement yet.  I hoping for some changes soon.</li>
            <li> I read the review on one website that this product is the best for 2014. In fact I bought and used this product to treat my small brown spot on my cheek since 11/07/2013 until now 03/11/2014. The effect of this product is none, not only my brown spot become lighter, but it become a little darker than before. I don&#x27;t want to waste my time to use the remaining of this product again! It goes in the trash.</li>
            <li> Well, if you consider the time I have had to use this product and the results being said that it was so wonderful and all.... I&#x27;d say (in my opinion) Don&#x27;t waist your money.</li>
            <li> This product removes the sun spots on my shoulders fast. It took much longer to remove the smaller spots on my face, and did not fix that spot on my temple that I got it for. Still, it works.</li>
            <li> I have seen some improvement with my dark spots and hopefully will see even more when I finish up the jar.  It&#x27;s a light, creamy consistency with a very pleasant smell.  Also works well as just a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> one of the questions answered mentions that this was #1 on Consumer Reports: that is FALSE, it was #1 on Consumer&#x27;s Guides, an unreliable website&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the site for the product even contradicts itself, sometimes noting a 30 day and other times a 60 day guarantee for its products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all the reviews of their various products suggest 4 weeks of use but that results are seen much sooner, the fact that the same language, more or less in the same words, comes up over and over again in &amp;#34;independent&amp;#34; reviews suggests that they are posted by the same people&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only review i found where there were several products compared with narrative-as opposed to their check mark graph (there were 5) listed it at the bottom</li>
            <li> City cosmetics,  or *hity cosmetics as I call them, make false claims about the results of their products. I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on this junk back in 2006 and the formulas haven&#x27;t changed since then. Still gimmicky junk that is way over priced. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this company when you can get better products from real companies with actual clinic studies.</li>
            <li> Bit pricy for an item that is suppose to lighten dark spots.  It did not work for me and now I have another cream on my night stand that does not work.</li>
            <li> BECAUSE IT REALLY WORKS.I USE IT TWICE A DAY AND  I CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE.THANKS.&lt;br /&gt;DO YOU HAVE FREE SAMPLES. I WORK IN THE CASINOS IN ATLANTIC CITY AND TOLD FRIENDS ABOUT&lt;br /&gt;IT.4 OF THE BOUGHT IT AND CANOT BELIEVE IT WORKS THAT GOOD....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  THANKS AGAIN....FRANK DISCIASCIO</li>
            <li> I have read other reviews on this cream, some negative, some slightly positive. All I know is, for my skin type and with the issue that I am trying to resolve, this cream is doing a great job. I have some sun damage that I want to lighten.  After using a very recognizable name brand for over a year with no noticeable change, I switched to City Lights and within a month I am seeing a big change. I have no idea if it is because of my skin type or color, but this product is doing a fantastic job. It is a bit greasy for my taste in moisturizers, but it does a good job with that also. I can only testify for myself, this product is staying on my shelf for a long time to come. No sun damage on my face in the near future.</li>
            <li> just another &amp;#34;snake oil&amp;#34; remedy, total ripoff--I used this for weeks, saw no results (except my money flying out the window)--p</li>
            <li> CITY LIGHTS RADIANCE PERFECTING CREAM is, seemingly, a fairly new, fairly controversial product from a fairly new, controversial cosmetics company, City Beauty.  It promises that its new high performance formula will combat dullness, uneven skin tone, and discoloration, if you&#x27;ve got those sun spots, or liver spots, as they used to call them, big ugly freckles that pop out, particularly on older people, after a surfeit of sun.  The makers suggest that the product be applied directly to aging or dark spots for intensive treatment, or, on the face and neck with a circular motion for preventive care.  The formula does contain alcohol, some familiar names like sorbitol and glycerin, also fruit and flower extracts. The manufacturers add that the product is cruelty-free, and has not been tested on animals, an important consideration for some of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have about used up a 17 oz. jar, it has lasted several months, even though I have used it night and morning, under my moisturizers.  And I believe that it has helped my skin tone.  Several dark spots have lightened a bit, and some nasty new wrinkles that were appearing around my mouth seem to be appearing more slowly.  Don&#x27;t know that you can realistically ask for more.</li>
            <li> This product does work but you need to be patient.  I have been using the cream for months only on the age spots, so it lasts a long time.  It took over a month to work, but many of the spots are barely visible now.  Lots of the products that claim they fade age spots are nothing more than sun block.  The City Lights actually does fade them.</li>
            <li> I like this cream very much.  It is smooth and creamy and you can feel the cream tightening your skin.</li>
            <li> This product does not work on age spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for a couple of years, and believe it definitely helped lightening my sun spots. The reason I say that is I love playing tennis but hate the sun spots it brought me, so once a year I go to my dermatologist for a simple laser impulse procedure to remove/lighten up my sun spots, but I now just realized I haven&#x27;t been going for the last two years and looks like no need to.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this product through Amazon, I bought it through their advertisement recommended #1 by Consumer Guide. I was thinking of Consumer&#x27;s Report, which I thought was a good endorsement. To make a long story short, I bought two extra jars for a lower promotional price. I have used one and a half jars and my dark spots have not faded whatsoever. I wish I had checked out Amazon&#x27;s reviews first, I would have saved myself a ton of money.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a darn thing.</li>
    </ol>
