            <li>I had huge beautiful lashes!</li>
            <li>good experience all around.</li>
            <li>this is a good product.</li>
            <li>Mascara purgatory, but in a good way.</li>
            <li>and I am good</li>
            <li>Not as good as it was presented.  </li>
            <li>This product is good</li>
            <li>(Again, this is a superior product</li>
            <li>Good idea...</li>
            <li>My wife loved these lashes and mascara.</li>
            <li>I gave it four stars because if you don&#x27;t have a good lash comb to separate and define your lashes</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t as good as Younique one.</li>
            <li>For me, this product was comparable to a good mascara with added steps.</li>
            <li>It might of been good but the Brush broke off n</li>
            <li>But, it is a good learning process like a winged liner, so here is my learning</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>My daughter tried and loved it.</li>
            <li>Not at good as the Veronique that I thought I was ordering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as good as the so called name brand.</li>
            <li>Good good product.</li>
            <li>I have worked out with it on and it stays looking just as good after as it did before.</li>
            <li>but it did not look good at all.  </li>
            <li>It was good but not as good as the Younique brand</li>
            <li>A perfect combination and well worth the price!</li>
            <li>Use a clean lash wand to comb thru any clumps but this works great!</li>
            <li>Makes my eyes beautiful and sexy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most beautiful thing ever.</li>
            <li>Quick &amp; perfect quality!</li>
            <li>Was extremely impressed with the length it built on the lashes rather quickly.</li>
            <li>This is an exceptional product.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, easy to use and good product!</li>
            <li>Great product for an ok price üíô</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Length was great ..but looked sparse and &amp;#34;spider legish&amp;#34; :)</li>

            <li>The fiber lashes are amazing.</li>
            <li>I purchased product after seeing the amazing results on a friend.  </li>

            <li>but over all its amazing</li>

            <li>This mascara is amazing.</li>
            <li>The lashes are amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m too cheap to spend $100/month on eyelash extensions, and although doing my mascara can sometimes become time consuming, I&#x27;m happy to spend the time if it&#x27;s saving me almost $100/month.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t own</li>
            <li>(honestly)....</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;d rather not have to worry about that kind of stuff all day at work</li>
            <li>I think it is as good as most of the fiber lashes.</li>
            <li>I did everything to make sure they came out good</li>
            <li>Mascara is nice.</li>
            <li>I am being completely honest.</li>
            <li>Nice case.</li>
            <li>My advice is be sure to put on a good amount of gel after the layer of fiber lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not crazy impressed, but I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Nice idea in theory but not working out for me.</li>
            <li>Came in a nice box.</li>
            <li>does a nice job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this product.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions and it didn&#x27;t do anything spectacular for my lashes.</li>
            <li>I also order this product for my Daughter and she liked it as well and would order this again.</li>
            <li>I got lots of compliments on how nice I looked.</li>
            <li>I really liked the mascara</li>
            <li>Apply your own mascara, then gel (which looks like mascara), fiber, then gel again.</li>
            <li>I would recommend that you use a coat of your own mascara after applying this product to seal the deal.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice and the mascara doesn&#x27;t stick like others it kind of just glides on.</li>
            <li>Best thing since sliced bread...fabulous, and it really works,  longest</li>
            <li>RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE TO TRY OUT IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.</li>
            <li>EVERYTHING IN THIS REVIEW IS MY OWN AND IN NO WAY INFLUENCED.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love my 3d lashes, my lashes have never looked so good.</li>
            <li>I made one mistake where I didnt finish by applying my own mascara after I was done and as a result I had fiber flakes all over my face.</li>
            <li>but it takes a lot of time and effort to get looking nice.</li>
            <li>Additional tools are requited to get it looking nice like you see in ads</li>
            <li>I use my own mascara instead of the gel.</li>
            <li>I liked the product</li>
            <li>Thickened nicely.</li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars because honestly my eyelashes stuggle to keep mascara of anykind...</li>
            <li>Fast delivery..  Excellent products..</li>
            <li>Put in your pocket or a cup of warm water.  </li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>but I really, really liked the look.</li>
            <li>Not overly thrilled with it considering the price.  </li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY WORKS WONDERFULLY!!!!!  </li>
            <li>but you can also use with your own mascara as well</li>
            <li>They REALLY are just beautiful!</li>
            <li>They are working nicely for me.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice if it came in brown.  </li>
            <li>If you follow the directions they are just as full and beautiful as they advertise.  </li>
            <li>I just thought it&#x27;d be nice to have longer lashes than I had without it, and the 300x does help to make them noticeably longer in minutes.</li>
            <li>Product provided at a promotional price for testing and review purposes, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li>I had used another brand of fiber lashes before and really liked them and their look....</li>
            <li>Love love love this product!!  </li>
            <li>Definitely a very nice product and make a huge difference in lashes.</li>
            <li>This product is very easy to use, doesn&#x27;t wear off or smudge, and almost looks like real but incredible lashes!!</li>
            <li>I received my order sooner than the the date originally,  so that was great.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Yes I LOVE this product so much, it works brilliantly!</li>
            <li>The product is awesome it really does work love it</li>
            <li>Comes off very easily with face wipes.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>but the fibers get inside your eye very easily</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and it stays on well.</li>
            <li>It is also very easy to remove.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to apply, and stays on all day.  </li>
            <li>Honestly... it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Amazing I love it</li>
            <li>I tried it once as directed, applied a layer of my own mascara, transplant gel, fibers, and transplant gel once more.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best mascara I have ever used!</li>
            <li>I bought these because they were the most popular.</li>
            <li>This IS by FAR the best mascara ever!!</li>
            <li>I feel so confident wearing my OWN lashes now.</li>

            <li>Love, love, LOVE it!</li>
            <li>Love, love love!</li>
            <li>Great product, easy to apply, huge lashes :)</li>
            <li>I was really hoping that this product would be good because the reviews were good.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend using mascara first; it causes a great deal of clumping.</li>
            <li>Really works with extending your eyelashes, making them look beautiful.</li>
            <li>The first time I ordered this product it was great, ordered again.</li>
            <li>It looks great when you first apply it</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and stays fresh for good 8 hours.</li>
            <li>You just have to have a steady hand, and Its NOT something you can do in a hurry if you want good results ladies!</li>
            <li>Very cheap for what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to apply and the effect is simply amazing.</li>
            <li>I thought it was easy to use and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s super easy to apply and has very amazing results.</li>
            <li>It definitely works, but it is best to follow the instructions (I didn&#x27;t the first time LOL).</li>
            <li>Huge difference!</li>
            <li>Makes a huge difference in my lashes!</li>
            <li>I would for sure recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li>Wasnt any better than store bought thickening mascara but will work.</li>
            <li>when I want more &amp;#34;umph&amp;#34; to my lashes I use it.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I also ordered a cheaper one and it works better ththan this one.</li>
            <li>However,  you have to make sure you put some mascara after the fibers,  so they don&#x27;t fall off.</li>
            <li>I have tryed so many others with crappie results.  </li>
            <li>It gives my eyelashes more volume and length</li>
            <li>would never recommend 3D to anyone &amp; will gladly pay more for Younique.</li>
            <li>I really love this.</li>
            <li>I love 3D Fiber Lash Mascara, 300X,</li>
            <li>Love this product.looks</li>
            <li>LOVE..</li>
            <li>This product was okay.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>Love It.</li>
            <li>well many years ago.  </li>
            <li>My lashes have never looked better.</li>
            <li>Love this product..</li>
            <li>all of and/ tangles them more.</li>
            <li>I am very upset because i heard really, really great things about this.</li>
            <li>This is better.</li>
            <li>Totally satisfied with this product,nice concept.</li>
            <li>Purchased this for my grand daughter</li>
            <li>and then I start on one eye with the gel, then the fiber and then gel over the top.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I used lots of the transfer gel to make sure the fibers were locked into place</li>
            <li>I feel like I look more awake</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This is an okay product.</li>
            <li>I love the look.</li>
            <li>Its ok with Just one layer,</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>This mascara is better than lash extensions, which I have also tried.  </li>
            <li>This is a good mascara if you want your lashes to look great, but would not buy as a daily use item.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really okay.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t use an eyelash curler or a comb to get out clumps, I suggest that. :)</li>
            <li>I love the web mascara</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS.  </li>

            <li>Love it..</li>

            <li>I love this product but if you do happen to accidentally get some in your eye...</li>
            <li>I have a couple of suggestions to get the most out of this mascara.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to do one eye at a time</li>
            <li>and you have to commit more time and care with application.</li>
            <li>You will love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>I love strips but who has the time...</li>

            <li>Cheap knock off, not Younique!</li>
            <li>I have been told by so many people that I need to try 3D fiber mascara.</li>
            <li>It says apply as many coats as needed.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>

            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I am going to experiment this weekend with both brands to see if I can make the 2 together give better results.</li>
            <li>and the end result is so much better and fuller.</li>
            <li>Simply love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>so this stuff is the next best thing!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>and I get so many compliments on my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Outstanding product.</li>
            <li>and I would say that the Younique one is more noticeable.</li>
            <li>but I feel that the eyelashes get tangle a lot more than with the Younique one.</li>
            <li>I realized I needed to re-up on some more</li>
            <li>but I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Most of the time I don&#x27;t need the comb.  </li>
            <li>My Cover Girl mascara works 10 times better.</li>
            <li>I have gotten the lashes and absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>and I get so many compliments when I use them.</li>
            <li>One tip I would add is apply gel and then fibers to top AND bottom of top lashes</li>
            <li>but when I do I love it.</li>
            <li>love the case the two product tubes come in.</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>

            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>If you have a better way to apply it, let me know.</li>
            <li>Really made my eyelashes look great.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>n don&#x27;t use any more</li>
            <li>I was impressed that this actually works.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need eyeliner which I love.</li>
            <li>Love how this makes my lashes look.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>the more they clumped up.</li>
            <li>It comes with instructions on how to use it, works better</li>
            <li>Love these 3D lashes.</li>
            <li>not a horrible product</li>
            <li>They love it</li>
            <li>Love the way that this makes my eyes look.  </li>

            <li>LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>absolutely love itttt. &#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>but you need mascara on top of using this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I love it.</li>
            <li>Love love love</li>
            <li>This the most expensive/worst mascara I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I am glad I purchased this product</li>
            <li>Great look lt really look like falsiesüòä</li>
            <li>I got so many fibers in my eyes that I threw it out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m  in love.</li>
            <li>but now I love my lashes.</li>
            <li>LOVE  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting better at applying it.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not in love with it, but I like it.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to get better results for the price.</li>
            <li>Too many steps:</li>
            <li>Be sure to coat good.&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;7) apply one more coat of transplanting gel to set the fibers (this will prevent fall</li>
            <li>I love the 3 D fiber lash.</li>
            <li>Love how my eyelashes look.  </li>
            <li>Sheds more than Younique does...</li>
            <li>I love it even more than the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The one tip I would give is just be sure to take your time, and don&#x27;t try to glob it on.</li>
            <li>Now that I have mastered how to apply the lashes I love this product.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be purchasing it again for sure.</li>
            <li>It took me awhile to figure it out, but with practice the look has gotten better.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff ..</li>
            <li>You are easily able to control the density of your lashes just based upon the number of times you apply it.  </li>
            <li>Works even better.</li>
            <li>YET I&#x27;m confident I will get there soon)</li>
            <li>My drugstore mascaras did better..</li>
            <li>Also, I would make sure not to sleep with it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>make sure not to forget this step or you will have fibers falling off all day.  </li>
            <li>so I just make sure to take it off every night.  </li>
            <li>It takes more time to build the lash than just putting it on.</li>
            <li>I was so impressed with the final look.</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>I love the results and you will too :)</li>
            <li>My Lanc√¥me mascara has better effect.</li>
            <li>Love the 3-D fiber mascara</li>
            <li>I LOVE the  Younique Moodstruck 3D Fiber Lash mascara, but this generic off-brand is nothing like the awesome original products!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, sealed very nicely.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this product</li>
            <li>I can honestly say there&#x27;s a significant improvement.</li>
            <li>and I love looking forward to putting it on every day and see how long and beautiful I can get them!</li>
            <li>Great product, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Great product,  I highly recommend everyone try this.</li>
            <li>I am super glad I did!</li>
            <li>It really works and is amazing!</li>
            <li>It makes my lashes look pretty good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as good as Younique, but much cheaper!</li>
            <li>Long beautiful lashes on all of us!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it promises, follow the instructions and you get gorgeous longer lashes.</li>
            <li>Did a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>Looks good at first but the fibers keep falling off throughout the day and seemed to irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>But, I took the lashes off of one eye and tried this product and it is actually pretty good.  </li>
            <li>As long as you apply these correctly and remember to use a generous amount of gel after you put the fibers on these are awesome.</li>
            <li>Makes a huge difference and washes off easily!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited!</li>
            <li>I love how easy is to take it off because the mascara doesn&#x27;t take my eyelashes off.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply (apply gel, then fibres, then more gel to seal them in and stop them falling out).</li>
            <li>Love how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li>Fiber lash mascara is an easy way to give more volume to my sparce lashes.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply just like mascara with one more step.</li>
            <li>Great, tried others not happy with them, lash factory is the best I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>It is fun to play with how many coats I want to add depending on the look I am going for!</li>
            <li>Both of them have good points, no fake lashes, length, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>But this stuff is amazing and does exactly what it says!</li>
            <li>Very very cool.  </li>
            <li>and, most importantly, fuller.</li>
            <li>I get better volume/length with a cheap drugstore mascara.  </li>
            <li>One tip, when putting the fiber on the lashes after the wet, press the fiber into the lashes for best results.  </li>
            <li>Best $20 I&#x27;ve spent.</li>
            <li>and I think it works better if you don&#x27;t put your own mascara on first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on looking for the perfect Mascara and this one is it.  </li>
            <li>Great product doesn&#x27;t flake gives lashes a natural look.</li>
            <li>My cheap mascara is better.</li>
            <li>The fibers don&#x27;t stay on good no matter how much gel I apply.</li>
            <li>It can fit in your purse and you will be able to remove them easily.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with the product, it does what is says it will and their customer service is exceptional.</li>
            <li>It consistently smudges ether on top of eye or on the bottom leaving fiber residue even after applying as per instruction!</li>
            <li>I was nervous about applying the fibers, but it was super easy!</li>
            <li>IT IS SUPER EASY!  </li>
            <li>I find it easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This product was not too easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on my daughter too, no irritation and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, a bit time consuming though.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s really easy to see the results.</li>
            <li>and the fibers didnt stick to lashes as easy as the youniquebrand that i had purchased before..</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Really easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>It wipes off fairly easily but can ruin face/under-eye makeup.</li>
            <li>FIBERS DID NOT GO ON EASILY.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Its so easy to put on, easy as one two three.</li>
            <li>I am very picky about my eyelash products and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>and I was even able to just touch them up the next day and look great all over again.</li>
            <li>Easy to useüòÄ</li>
            <li>The Mascara clumps easily &amp; you get a lot of fall out product (creates a raccoon looking effect underneath the eye)  </li>
            <li>I like how easy it is to tell the difference between each Lash applicator.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply and take off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to use, lasts all day, and easy to remove at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>So easy to use.</li>
            <li>With them being so easy to apply, they save me time in the mornings when applying my makeup</li>
            <li>AND easy to remove.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply if you pay attention to the instructions.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply and remove.</li>
            <li>Mascara tends to become raccoon eyes very quickly on my face.  </li>
            <li>The fiber debris comes off easy but every time I looked in the mirror, I saw the fallen debris on my face.  </li>
            <li>And it comes off easily with soap and water which is a must for my makeup.</li>
            <li>After that, works like a charm and comes off easily when you take a shower.</li>
            <li>although it is easy to apply after 30minutes of wear</li>
            <li>It does not bother my eyes and is easy to remove at night.</li>
            <li>The product is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>product is easy to use, and stayed on all day.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and stays on.</li>
            <li>I find that with any makeup, it&#x27;s easy to overdo it.</li>
            <li>and this is even easy for me.</li>
            <li>It came very quickly on the mail.</li>
            <li>It does increase the length of my lash and is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>I save mine for special occasions and LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s ok for special occasions?</li>
            <li>Beyond amazing product, the 3D lash mascara works wonders and makes my eyelashes look so much longer and fuller!</li>
            <li>However, I did not understand that I was to use my own mascara first, and I need a lash comb.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done it both with and without my own mascara first</li>
            <li>It was the first time using any product of this kind</li>
            <li>and my mascara is Mac Haute and Naughty which by itself is freakiin awesome!!!</li>
            <li>Hands down the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for years for the perfect mascara, and was always let down.</li>
            <li>but I love it other wise!</li>
            <li>after that they were fine.  </li>
            <li>This one works fine, but not in comparison.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting half the effect, great!</li>
            <li>This time it seems not as good, the gel is much dryer and the fiber wand isn&#x27;t as full.</li>
            <li>Works just fine with 1-2 coats.</li>
            <li>not the best brand and dryer and seemed like less product inside then yopuniques</li>
            <li>But after awhile it was fine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to be able to do this using the passengers side vanity mirror for a quick &amp;#34;on-the-way-there&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Came quickly!</li>
            <li>I like this product so much :)!</li>
            <li>I got so much compliments and also recommended to many others re this product!</li>
            <li>I bought these because I wanted quick free shipping which I got from being a Prime member, instead of ordering from a brand website, paying shipping and and waiting more than 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Look how long and full my lashes r!!!!</li>
            <li>I love love love this mascara make my lashes nice, long and full.</li>
            <li>The videos people have posted in the reviews are accurate.</li>
            <li>The ease of it going on and not even flaking while putting it on, is a huge selling point for me.  </li>
            <li>I see a huge difference in the before and after of my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>To accurately use these &amp;#34;fiber&amp;#34; mascaras you do the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I enjoy wearing 3D Fiber Lash Mascara.  </li>
            <li>Great product for some extra volume to your lashes.</li>
            <li>Effective in length but very clumpy results.</li>
            <li>I used the actual brand and it was great</li>
            <li>So over all some of this product is great but a bit pricey for only using the fibers that came for the set</li>
            <li>I only use one coat of each per eye and it comes out great.</li>
            <li>I enjoy having longer lashes.</li>
            <li>She has light colored lashes and says this helps her out.</li>
            <li>Fantastic if you&#x27;re patient and follow the instructions properly&lt;</li>
            <li>I should have paid the extra $7 and went with the younique 3D Fiber lashes, they work great and make your eyes pop.</li>
            <li>I have fallen in love with this mascara definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I had to repurchase the item, but Amazon did upgrade to overnight shipping for free.</li>
            <li>This is not as great as the Cherry Bloom will go back to the Cherry Bloom.</li>
            <li>You then reapply the transplanting gel onto the eyelashes to secure it all</li>
            <li>Very pricey would have liked to return it.</li>
            <li>Now I can wear mascara and my lashes look long and beautiful.</li>
            <li>3D fibers have a natural tendency to want to stick together so dedicate a good 5-10 minutes in the morning.</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>and they are beautiful and long again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Was not a bit impressed smearing was a big issue stopped using after a week...who wants raccoon eyes??</li>
            <li>Great does a great job looks like you have false eyelashes on</li>
            <li>results were good after the 1st application and were a lot better after the second application.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily, stays on and comes off at the end of the day without any special treatment.</li>
            <li>They come with full instructions which are quite easy to follow</li>
            <li>Super easy to use and lasts as long as you need them too &amp; comes off easily with soap and water!!!&#x27;</li>
            <li>Thanks you 3D people!!!  </li>
            <li>Will be starting My very own YouTube channel soon and will be doing a tutorial on the 3d Fiber lashes.</li>
            <li>The product is awesome though, and very much what I expected.</li>
            <li>I have it for a while now and its perfect for everyday wear or just for special occasions.</li>
            <li>Clean smooth application and removal.</li>
            <li>That said I gave this product to my daughter and she loved it and made her lashes look lush and full</li>
            <li>It is super easy to apply you just put a coat of the transplanting gel and then follow with the fibers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to apply and remove.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite mascara!</li>
            <li>she looked so amazing that I got some for my 21 yr old dtr and myself!!</li>
            <li>So easy and fast for fabulous lashes!</li>
            <li>For longer lashes it works okay, but it doesn&#x27;t create much volume and it flakes off easily.</li>
            <li>I was excited about this product.</li>
            <li>Made a significant difference in the way my lashes looked.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s THE first time I have been completely satisfied with a mascara.</li>
            <li>First, I tried it with the gel that comes with it &amp; then the fibers and more coats of the gel.</li>
            <li>Excited when I got it on</li>
            <li>I was excited for it</li>
            <li>I love it thank you so much!</li>
            <li>but nothing I was significant.</li>
            <li>I think this 3D Mascara is so much fun!</li>
            <li>I have pretty sparse eyelashes, but with this they look fabulous!</li>
            <li>It is worth the price!</li>
            <li>It does make a significant difference in the length and thickness of my lashes.</li>
            <li>I was so excited for this mascara.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get this product as I have been wearing lash extensions for a while and want to opt for something i could do at home.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>I have received sooo many compliments on how pretty my eyes are.</li>
            <li>I even used a clean mascara wand to try and separate the lashes, but still no luck.  </li>
            <li>Love using a light eye shadow to show how much fuller my eyes look.</li>
            <li>it looks like you just stepped out of a salon from getting your bangs trimmed and they didnt clean the hair around your face.</li>
            <li>This mascara is fabulous , really does what it says, love it..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not the most talented make-up gal, so at times I have difficulty, but more often than not I love the outcome.</li>
            <li>but so far I love it!</li>
            <li>eyelashes are normally &#x27;dinky&#x27; but with this mascara they look so full and natural and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I have used other more pricey brands, (Younique and Benefit), and I felt this product was superior to the others.  </li>
            <li>My daughter loves this and priced right!</li>
            <li>and long it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>I am happy with the product and once i get the hang of it, may try to wean myself off of the individuals which have left my lashes very sparse!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how it improved my natural lashes.    </li>
            <li>So that was cool.</li>
            <li>You just have to practice a few times to get it to look more natural, but once you learn how it looks great!</li>
            <li>Overall good results, no complaints.</li>
            <li>Now my eye lashes look full and volumed.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara - does sometimes clump but with a eyelash brush before and gently after applying fixes that problem.  </li>
            <li>i followed the directions and gave this product multiple chances without good results.</li>
            <li>so you get everything off much easier and more</li>
            <li>Love the product so much and the service I will order it and recommend it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok... not what I really hoped for</li>
            <li>Overall a good product but wouldnt buy again because the fibers do fall off.</li>
            <li>, it didn&#x27;t met my expectations, I was hoping getting something better results for that much money I paid.</li>
            <li>Tried the product for a week straight, hoping it would get better.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I was stoked to get this , not so much</li>
            <li>(If you love eyelashes as much as I do) 2.</li>
            <li>SO COOL.</li>
            <li>Not as good as Younique a similar product.  </li>
            <li>It really works, although it seemed to make my lashes thicker more than longer.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping this product would be better, because of the price</li>
            <li>Also, the gel, although goopy (lack of better term) just didn&#x27;t seen to make the lashed stick or come on easily on my real lases.</li>
            <li>Really, nothing more to say about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li>Honestly, not that impressed.</li>
            <li>but I really love it makes your lashes look so much fuller.</li>
            <li>I love the case and the product what I did not care for too much and it takes getting used to is sometimes</li>
            <li>The price of this stuff bothered me because I&#x27;m cheap, but it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>It provides a full set of lashes.</li>
            <li>and they look full.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easy and makes my lashes look so much thicker and longer!</li>
            <li>pretty easy to use</li>
            <li>I am very new to 3D Fiber lashes since I&#x27;ve heard so many conflicting reviews</li>
            <li>It was very pretty and made my lashes look soooo full</li>
            <li>Other than that, I&#x27;m really happy with the product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love my new 3D mascara!</li>
            <li>I love my new 3d mascara!</li>
            <li>Different - take a bit more time - seems to work ok</li>
            <li>I just make sure I have the extra time to be sure it doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li>Love my mascara surely makes my short lashes look longer!</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly ....</li>
            <li>I really love this product it definitely helps my eyelashes stand out even more.  </li>
            <li>Not any better than regular mascara, and way more time consuming.</li>
            <li>You can make it as bold as you want by layering it.</li>
            <li>It lasts pretty long and looks great.</li>
            <li>Quickly apply the gel mascara again</li>
            <li>I can even choose to have &amp;#34;Bambi&amp;#34; lashes if I am so bold to do so.  </li>
            <li>This product is a quick fix if you&#x27;re looking for longer, fuller lashes temporarily.  </li>
            <li>, if you go too quickly they will fall into your eye and all over your lower lashes.  </li>
            <li>They really look good and natural</li>
            <li>I only used it on the top lashes and that felt much better.</li>
            <li>I also think the price is very reasonable for the fantastic results.  </li>
            <li>Not only was it very easy to put on but with only one coat my eyelashes looked amazing!  </li>
            <li>Looks amazing and natural; more natural without any mascara.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery!</li>
            <li>This is the first fiber mascara I have purchased, and it fit my needs.</li>
            <li>even 30 minutes after using this product my eyes started becoming really irritated, and there was fibers everywhere in my eye.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>it works amazingly and its works a lot better than other mascara products.</li>
            <li>I was amazed the very first time I saw the product.  </li>
            <li>I tried to buy this 3D fiber mascara instead of the other more popular brand</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with not only the speed of delivery, but the product itself.  </li>
            <li>(in a good way) I had girls asking me at work how my eyelashes looked so long</li>
            <li>Make sure your natural lashes are clean and separated.</li>
            <li>This product is super easy and very noticeable.</li>
            <li>Just as great as the other brands people sell!</li>
            <li>I watched a few YouTube videos to see how other people liked it, and the best way to apply it</li>
            <li>My sister had purchased a similar product from her salon at a much higher price and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Love the mascara!!!so many people commenting on how long my lashes look.</li>
            <li>What helped me even out my fibers was putting another coat of the first liquid mascara on, and then I used an eyebrown/eye lash brush to make my lashes really pop more.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first about this brand of fiber lashes, but after using it only once I loved it.</li>
            <li>other than the color I love it because it is very EASY to remove.</li>
            <li>thank you so much!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times, but I love the 3d fiber lashes!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same concept but better!</li>
            <li>First off, this mascara works miracles so please don&#x27;t hesitate!</li>
            <li>and this really helps!!  </li>
            <li>get the real thing!!  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it will!</li>
            <li>Watch YouTube videos first!</li>
            <li>May be back for more!</li>
            <li>Just read the directions first!</li>
            <li>Same as Younique but MUCH more affordable!</li>
            <li>:) just make sure to use a lot of the adhesive gel before the fiber lashes go on, or you&#x27;ll get lots of loose fibers in your eyes.  </li>
            <li>I ended up being mildly allergic to this mascara, (my eyes would consistently water &amp; my throat would mildly swell)</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product comes impressively presented in a smart retro case (similar size to prescription spectacles case) and has inside it the gel and fibres in a pen sized tube which are in fact a similar size to mascara.</li>
            <li>To see with my own eyes how my little tiny eyelashes became long and beautiful was amazing...</li>
            <li>Mascara is the only makeup that I wear and this stuff makes my eyelashes look amazing.</li>
            <li>Really makes ur eyelashes huge.</li>
            <li>I have very short lashes and this product gives them amazing length and volume.</li>
            <li>A couple weeks later I ended up getting the semi-permanent eyelash extensions and they look AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>Not crazy about it</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the $.</li>
            <li>I liked how it looked initially...</li>
            <li>I love my 3D lash fiber mascara, I am 50 yrs old</li>
            <li>When you apply the fiber lashes the get kind of wadded up, and when you add the second coat of transplanting gel to keep the fibers from falling off, it just pulls them</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>If used correctly it will make your lashes look longer and more lush.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, worth the cost.</li>
            <li>But for the price it isn&#x27;t worth</li>
            <li>Nice email sent telling me how to use, when shipped, etc. will definitely purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li>In addition, trying to figure out the most gentle way to remove it  when I&#x27;m ready.</li>
            <li>The pain isn&#x27;t worth having longer eyelashes , plus they looked like spider legs.</li>
            <li>but I believe a picture is worth a thousand words.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are very short and kind of sparse.  </li>
            <li>I found that if I took more time to brush lashes carefully straight with each stroke it worked better than how we can sometimes rush applying our regular mascara.</li>
            <li>Mascara is all natural, vegan, gluten free, &amp; made in the USA!</li>
            <li>overall it worked nice, just don&#x27;t like the way it irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li>I used a lash brush to make the result look more natural.</li>
            <li>Love it so far.</li>
            <li>Wow I love it.</li>
            <li>a few times honestly I bought 3D mascara for a fraction of the price of Lash Factory that worked better.</li>
            <li>I only was nice gave it 1 star because it did make some difference</li>
            <li>I used a lash brush to ensure they didn&#x27;t clump and kept them separated for a more &#x27;natural&#x27; look.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>Fun to put on.</li>
            <li>Overall, happy to find a mascara that makes my eyelashes longer and thicker naturally.</li>
            <li>Believe me it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>, it is definitely worth the price.  </li>
            <li>but when she do totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Its totally worth every penny..</li>
            <li>overall it worked well although I didn&#x27;t expect customers to need to use their own mascara and for it to be a 4 step process.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the month if you want your eyelashes to look longer and thicker.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about this product.</li>
            <li>This is a fun product to try out that will give you longer lashes for the day.</li>
            <li>I love that it looks natural and lasted until i washed my face.</li>
            <li>In the fraction of the time it would take you to attempt to put false lashes on u can have a great look!</li>
            <li>Best alternative to false eyelashes</li>
            <li>final, completed look on the eyes is surprisingly very nice and somewhat professional looking.</li>
            <li>I personally think it&#x27;s better than the unique 3d fiber ..</li>
            <li>I feel like the fibers always run out pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I only wear this product for 3-4 hours top but very easy to apply, not mess at all.</li>
            <li>I tried it but didn&#x27;t really  notice that significant of a difference</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m putting it on right.</li>
            <li>You can literally use just water and it will come right off.</li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>I posted a picture with 3d lashes on right eye</li>
            <li>If you do it right they will stay on all day.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get it to work right..</li>
            <li>Most of the problems people face with this product are simply from not applying it correctly..or can be fixed easily!</li>
            <li>One hint from my own experience - I find it helps to apply one coat of your regular mascara first before you begin the gel/fiber application then</li>
            <li>I have previously used Younique and this product is every bit as good, and not nearly as expensive!</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply with instant results.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply and actually makes my lashes longer.  </li>
            <li>and this is the first mascara that has made them really stand out!!</li>
            <li>One very long term customer here...very pleased!</li>
            <li>It comes off easily when removing the rest of your makeup WITHOUT pulling out your natural eyelashes!</li>
            <li>you cannot just apply it quickly like most regular mascaras.</li>
            <li>in researching this mascara I never saw where it said you had to use your own mascara first; I was thinking this was going to replace my mascara - seems pretty costly to buy regular mascara and this mascara as well.</li>
            <li>I thought I was ordering the Younique fiber mascara system, so I&#x27;m not sure how I ended up with this one, but I&#x27;m definitely happy with it.</li>
            <li>so that was pretty exciting</li>
            <li>Clumps excessively so that even trying to use the comb does not do a great job of de-clumping.</li>
            <li>This product was not bad but it also did not work as much as I was hoping.</li>
            <li>It works good, but getting an eye infection when using this product is not fun at all...very unsatisfied</li>
            <li>Perhaps this could be remedied by a second coat of gel or regular mascara, I just haven&#x27;t tried because I feel there&#x27;s a fine line between beautiful, natural looking lashes, and spider leg lashes with this product.  </li>
            <li>its pretty good gel applies very sparsely even though it does not look dry.</li>
            <li>At first when you put it on it looks really nice and your lashes look long, but Once the fiber is on it comes off within minutes.</li>
            <li>I am surprised by how easy it is to apply.  </li>
            <li>It takes several coats to notice much difference, but it does look nice once its on.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I can wear one coat for a day look and add one or two more for a more dramatic evening look.</li>
            <li>I use on top and bottom lashes and it really gives a great and dramatic look.</li>
            <li>I actually have long, beautiful lashes now.</li>
            <li>Id rather pay a few bucks more for a better product.</li>
            <li>Ultimately, it didn&#x27;t even look that great when initially applied.</li>
            <li>My new fave makeup staple!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, NO mess like some reviews are saying, maybe one or two fibers fall on my cheek during application but those are easily brush off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I applied the fiber lash mascara early in the day and they looked just as amazing later that night even when I was out running errands in the hot Oklahoma heat and humidity!</li>
            <li>I love the way it looks but save it for special occasions and be careful.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will definitely be ordering again.</li>
            <li>I love it, the only thing is if you do re-applay the gel , the fibers fell all over you face,,, otherwise..</li>
            <li>with it, i will buy it again;)</li>
            <li>it makes my lashes so much thicker!</li>
            <li>wanted to try this because after I applied my first coat of &amp;#34;regular mascara&amp;#34; (Lancome) I could never seem to get a richer, fuller look on my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>Works pretty well. .</li>
            <li>I had never used any 3D Fiber Mascara before and was nervous to try it out, but the first experience went off without a hitch at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am a first time customer to 3d lash.</li>
            <li>so the fibers more likely to fall in my eyes - which they did - and felt like a miniature knife in my eye!</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are tricky to use at first but with practice, I&#x27;ve definitely seen thicker lashes with two coats and longer lashes if I do three coats or more.</li>
            <li>Which is great since my eyeliner in always a thick cat eye.</li>
            <li>Works really well!</li>
            <li>This mascara works pretty well.</li>
            <li>It really makes my eyes pop!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>REALLY made her eyes POP!</li>
            <li>It makes a big difference :)</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used fiber lashes.</li>
            <li>I especially like how the company takes a vested interest by making sure you know how to use the mascara before it arrives.  </li>
            <li>but the fibers are great and work amazing and def fill and lengthen my lashes which are very short and thin...  </li>
            <li>Absolutely recommend to anyone !</li>
            <li>Does exactly as it is described.</li>
            <li>The mascara irritated my eyes at first</li>
            <li>The mascara only eye looked much better, not clumpy.</li>
            <li>Make sure the gel is the last application on your eyes to seal the fibers.</li>
            <li>I would remind anyone to follow the instructions exactly when applying.</li>
            <li>does exactly as it says....</li>
            <li>I find that regular mascara does a better job.  </li>
            <li>So glad I found this and didn&#x27;t pay higher prices for a product with a different name brand!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>The fibers did fall off the first time I tried it, but I read to apply gel after the fibers to lock them in place and it worked.</li>
            <li>Try the REAL 3D Fiber Lashes+ Mascara!</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>Love this product use it daily!!!  </li>
            <li>When I received it, it was at first trial and error.</li>
            <li>Really thickens and lengthens!</li>
            <li>this considering I had to put mascara on first</li>
            <li>If you are interested in a mascara like this, please seek out a Younique representative or visit the Younique website.</li>
            <li>I will join the majority of reviewers here in saying that I highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li>I will most likely order another pair soon!</li>
            <li>First of all, curl your lashes.  </li>
            <li>The fact that this product indeed delivers exactly as it says it will, should always lend itself to a 5 star rating in my book.  </li>
            <li>It costs a bit more than traditional mascara</li>
            <li>As I first mentioned, application is a process and this takes time.</li>
            <li>I have fairly short lashes and have tried many products to get the length and volume I want and</li>
            <li>Definitely better results than regular mascaras, and does not flake.</li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered a second one to have on hand in my car :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is my first review ever on a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>I like a different brand more but thought I would try this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve always had pretty eyelashes</li>
            <li>First day using it, followed the instructions exactly</li>
            <li>Tried 2 coats but didn&#x27;t lengthen much more then regular mascara</li>
            <li>and I ordered this through Amazon because there was Prime free shipping and a lower price than buying directly from YouNique.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately what I don&#x27;t love is the all day irritation of the tiny fibers that are not sticking to the lash.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time yesterday and was in 110 degree heat for over 5 hours sweating and there was no issues.</li>
            <li>This really does work!  </li>
            <li>The first shipment did not reach me.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how real my lashes look!</li>
            <li>Younique also offers FREE SHIPPING for all orders of $100+, and you can earn Hostess Freebies, and support your friends so why would people buy this imposter brand?</li>
            <li>but the primer gel really keeps them in place!</li>
            <li>AFTER RECEIVING MY PRODUCT AND TRYING IT THE FIRST TIME....</li>
            <li>I have never had much luck with mascara, but this was a dream!  </li>
            <li>but i think that relates more to my skill level then the actual product.</li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing this product and it truly lengthens my lashes.</li>
            <li>Warning: it does shed at first, so you will need to wipe your finger under your eye to catch stray fibers.</li>
            <li>Use it FIRST or you will wreck your make-up.</li>
            <li>AND I SEE MY LASHES FOR THE FIRST TIME.</li>
            <li>My regular mascara works better than this junk</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a bit tricky at first</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>(It was in the manual, I just didn&#x27;t pay attention the first time).</li>
            <li>I will absolutely continue to use it!</li>
            <li>but first impressions weren&#x27;t favorable</li>
            <li>Love how big it makes my lashes look!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so pretty</li>
            <li>Love this product, use it daily.  </li>
            <li>However, I have found that you need to be sure that you place a lot of the second coat of gel after applying the fibers or the fibers will fall off and irritate you eye.  </li>
            <li>I will most definitely buy again when I run out!</li>
            <li>&amp; fast delivery!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I didn&#x27;t follow the gel-fiber-gel directions on each eye.</li>
            <li>First, you apply some mascara, then gel, then fibers...to add length and volume, continue to add coats of gel alternating with fiber.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Absolutely luv this product!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even do all the stuff I was supposed to like put mascara on first and curl my lashes.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Beautiful long lashes all day long</li>
            <li>Then work quickly and apply the gel about 21 strokes then lightly apply the fibers from mid lash to the ends.  </li>
            <li>strange product, not easy to apply, used it once and wasn&#x27;t impressed, I will probably use it again</li>
            <li>I think I can get almost the same results with a very good mascara and avoid having the little fibers flake off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool doesn&#x27;t give you that clean look, it gave my the clumpy mascara look, but it does last all day</li>
            <li>Other than that, for day-to-day and for evenings outs, this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Love love how this product makes my lashes look fuller and extra long</li>
            <li>No need for me to spend money on any other kind of mascara.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try and spend a little less money, however, I feel it is worth it to spend the money and buy the best.</li>
            <li>This works very well and the company actually emailed me ways to keep it from clumping and ways that I can get the most out of the product.</li>
            <li>I am astonished at the length of them, I wear falsies daily and have come to love them, so as I give the Fiber lashes a chance I am really liking them...</li>
            <li>Certainly worth trying given that you have the free 30 day guarantee to fall back on.</li>
            <li>all my lashes were pretty much gone.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first to buy this product when a coworker told me about, but boy did it brighten my eyes and made my lashes look so much fuller and longer.</li>
            <li>so long I love it</li>
            <li>The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like about it is that the fibers would fall of but other than that it works great.</li>
            <li>and when I wear it my whole family has commented on how pretty my eyes look.  </li>
            <li>Thanks much lash factory!</li>
            <li>and I saw first hand that it really does work.  </li>
            <li>It really works and I&#x27;d recommend the product to anyone interested in buying it.</li>
            <li>gives full thick lashes,, love it!</li>
            <li>It did make my lashes look a little more full, but they didn&#x27;t look any longer,</li>
            <li>It adheres, makes long great looking lashes, does not have the tendency to clump, but if you get too much with out letting it dry, it can clump.  </li>
            <li>It takes a few layers and you must be patient while creating the &amp;#34;layers&amp;#34; other wise it will clump a bit but just make sure you have a eyelash comb or spoolie.</li>
            <li>You can get the same look with a lot of  mascara, but it&#x27;s cool to have!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy enough to take off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a nice shade of black.</li>
            <li>Wears like regular mascara removes easily.</li>
            <li>Easy enough to avoid clumps.</li>
            <li>The product is easy enough to apply.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied, seems like the more expensive brand.  </li>
            <li>wonderful product for those of us not endowed with long thick curly eyelashes</li>
            <li>all honesty, I did expect to experience a certain degree of:&lt;br /&gt;Smudging&lt;br /&gt;Flaking&lt;</li>
            <li>You have to do it a certain way or it won&#x27;t come out how you want it to.</li>
            <li>it‚Äôs good, but not as rich and dramatic as the others.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect when I bought it, but I saw lots of positive reviews, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li>My lashes are very short and fine.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are already somewhat long &amp; with this they look great &amp; very long!!!</li>
            <li>Definitely saw a huge difference and it does work</li>
            <li>and I think it did well for some extra volume, but I don&#x27;t see a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I notice the huge difference and now can&#x27;t go back.</li>
            <li>You have to practice using this product like any fiberlash product ( putting to much of the fibers can make the lashes appear spidery)</li>
            <li>I really like what this mascara can do in theory; in practice, no so much.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product</li>
            <li>the eyelashes really look longer than just with mascara.</li>
            <li>Makes the eyes very irriated.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are very curly and skimpy.</li>
            <li>I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone unless you don&#x27;t mind the clumpy spider leg look.</li>
            <li>and this really lengthens them.</li>
            <li>Fiber lashes add so much volume, I can&#x27;t go without this mascara.</li>
            <li>The  fiber brush in Younique&#x27;s really made the difference for me.</li>
            <li>I was worried I wouldn&#x27;t be skillful at application, or it would look very unnatural.  </li>
            <li>Thanks lash factory.</li>
            <li>It doesnt really work.</li>
            <li>and she really likes it.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a reason that you haven&#x27;t really heard about this from the makeup gurus.</li>
            <li>I know this sounds weird,but it really has boosted my confidence.</li>
            <li>and you can really see my eyes.</li>
            <li>I really like the mascara</li>
            <li>Then when I took the mascara off that night, I went through the whole little-fibers-getting-into-my-eyes thing all over again.  </li>
            <li>but the fiber one makes my lashes a massy look as if I applied one too much coat</li>
            <li>and it is too much.  </li>
            <li>No matter how much gel I put on.</li>
            <li>This product works really well for lengthening and thickening lashes.</li>
            <li>I thought it would really extend my lashes.</li>
            <li>It is very clunky and sticky and it causes your lashes to stick together</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s obvious this is a cheap knock off of Younique</li>
            <li>and there was a very noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>By the end of the day, it became very flaky and caused irritation to my eyes.</li>
            <li>Too much information is far better than not enough.</li>
            <li>Works very well...had to try a couple times to get the hang of it....</li>
            <li>I think it clumped way too fast</li>
            <li>wouldnt be purchasing again really..</li>
            <li>I have very skimpy eyelashes</li>
            <li>and this mascara really does make them look fuller and longer.</li>
            <li>you know she really studies me ‚Äì said ‚Äú</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really care for the brush that comes with the mascara.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even use it on my bottom lashes because for me, that&#x27;s a bit much for work, but if I were going to party or out to dinner, I&#x27;d add the bottom</li>
            <li>This mascara really does give the effect of extensions without the pain, cost, and inconvenience of going to a salon.</li>
            <li>Thanks lash factory.  </li>
            <li>The real 3D Fiber Lashes+</li>
            <li>and I really like the traveling case.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t have that much time in the mornings</li>
            <li>My lashes were longer and fuller thanks to the fiber lash mascara.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t really give me the look I was hoping for</li>
            <li>Get the real thing.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I really like this Lash Factory 3D Fiber Lash Mascara.  </li>
            <li>After you have done those two steps you are ready to begin application.  </li>
            <li>That said, there are some  challenges; while reasonable, they do exist.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not used to spending much time with make-up, but using this two-piece mascara did increase the length of my eyelashes as well as thickness - noticeably.  </li>
            <li>I really like the whole fiber systems</li>
            <li>I really like this product. .</li>
            <li>but I did not have any flaking or smudging through out the whole day</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>they your real eyelashes&amp;#34</li>
            <li>so I was spending so much on falsies</li>
            <li>Also this mascara doesn&#x27;t really add as much length as it says it does.</li>
            <li>This is a knock off product of the REAL 3D Fiber Lash Mascara</li>
            <li>haha)</li>
            <li>really like this product</li>
            <li>but it really does make lashes look longer and thicker.</li>
            <li>I have light blonde lashes and can&#x27;t go without mascara</li>
            <li>and it goes on very well.  </li>
            <li>but i dont, the fibers dont really stick -_-</li>
            <li>Like I said before, I tried their leading competitors product and it was by far money well worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 51 and have straight eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>If you have fibers under your eyes or on your cheeks, you are using too much.  </li>
            <li>The company sends tips on how to use the product when you order, which has been very beneficial as well.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how I really feel about this.</li>
            <li>(are they straight, even etc . . )</li>
            <li>and mascaras that really don&#x27;t thicken or lengthen.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really lengthen my lashes and the fibers tend to be 1.</li>
            <li>but not much, the more i tried to make them longer</li>
            <li>am also very convinced because of the weight of the product.  </li>
            <li>Cons are it is way too time consuming and lashes can appear lumpy if you apply too much of the synthetic lash application.</li>
            <li>From now on I&#x27;ll buy the real thing at [...]</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that this is just a one-time occurrence because I really like it. üòü</li>
            <li>The fibers really do fill in the lashes.  </li>
            <li>I really like this mascara</li>
            <li>It is much easier to apply than I thought.</li>
            <li>This mascara is absolute magic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but when i tried it on my lashes it really  extends my lashes</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really irritated with how clumpy the mascara makes my lashes.</li>
            <li>Better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much</li>
            <li>I received my order extremely fast.  </li>
            <li>but it can also make your eyelashes very clumpy if u use to much</li>
            <li>I really like the 3D Mascara.</li>
            <li>Makes my unnoticeable lashes very noticiable.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the tips.</li>
            <li>does make my eyelashes look much longer.  </li>
            <li>Whatever you are using to &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; it could be more like regular mascara, which I put over the top of it after the sealer coat and that seems to make it last longer without having to reapply later in the day.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping Quality merchandise.</li>
            <li>is that you really have to take it off every day.  </li>
            <li>Makes my lashes look much thicker - would like them to look longer.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased several fiber lashes and these have been my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>Great solution to having to put false eye lashes on.</li>
            <li>Love these, I actually look like I have naturally luxurious lashes.  </li>
            <li>I do like this product a lot, the only problem is that if you don&#x27;t put it on perfectly then the fibers will sometimes get in to your eyes and it is irritating to get out.</li>
            <li>this product is totally different as it involves a 4 step process which actually involves using your own mascara as the 1st</li>
            <li>Lashes appeared longer and more defined love this product was tempted to get false lashes now that is no longer a option thanks to this product</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are long and full when using the 3D Fiber Lash mascara!</li>
            <li>lasts all day long and is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I have lots of long lashes and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>My niece was selling the other brand of 3D fiber lashes last year when I tried it &amp; loved it.</li>
            <li>It comes in a super cute little hard case, which is nice because I tend to have things &amp;#34;hide&amp;#34; from me in my makeup drawer.  </li>
            <li>Application is super easy and a few of my friends have purchased as well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with it and have absolutely no complaints!</li>
            <li>I repeat this process on the other eye and then wait a minute before applying mascara over the top</li>
            <li>Works better than any other mascara that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>By following the directions (and being sure to put my regular mascara on first)</li>
            <li>Not the same as the original product from &amp;#34;youngnique&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>But other then that I think the product it pretty cool!</li>
            <li>and therefore she&#x27;s going back to the original.</li>
            <li>Have used a more expensive brand in the past and these are just as great!</li>
            <li>Never using normal mascara again!</li>
            <li>but at the same time it is very clumpy and a recent update is that she has stopped wearing it and ordered a new kind</li>
            <li>I only want to wear it for special occasions they really increase length thickness</li>
            <li>This is a very cool product and a much better and cheaper alternative to false eyelashes.</li>
            <li>This mascara does as it advertises, it definitely makes lashes significantly more apparent, and longer.  </li>
            <li>I feel that this gel tube does not have as much gel as usual, and I have been using my own mascara 1st.</li>
            <li>I was honestly a bit sad because everything else was cool but the end result pretty much fell apart after 10 minutes and your lashes will be straight.  </li>
            <li>I used a circular motion (gently) around my lashes with facial wash soap, a scrubby, and the fiber-gel-mascara washes off easily and completely.</li>
            <li>Once you use it a few times, it is actually very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The only reason it wouldn&#x27;t work well is if you&#x27;re not using it right!</li>
            <li>It takes a lot of time to apply and its not that much of a difference from normal mascara.</li>
            <li>Used to use two to three different mascara to get full lashes.</li>
            <li>I saw these eyelashes in Baltimore for Sweet Adelines International competition.</li>
            <li>I actually went a whole second afternoon with the 3D Fiber Lash applied more than 24 hours</li>
            <li>It worked, but I didn&#x27;t care for it as much as another brand I normally use.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping that it would be a good replacement for my false lashes -- not so much.</li>
            <li>And that last bit is very important, because I don&#x27;t want to do anything to temporarily beautify my lashes that ultimately deteriorates the volume I already have.</li>
            <li>I have to admit I was more than a little excited to try this fiber last mascara, this was provided to me as a sample for review.</li>
            <li>Really like the 3D Fiber lash Mascara, I don&#x27;t have long lashes and this really make my eyes look bigger, just love it</li>
            <li>Gives my sparse eyelashes a whole new look.</li>
            <li>and then you put the black mascara over on top.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always having to check my face to make sure I don&#x27;t have black hairs everywhere.  </li>
            <li>, you get a more drastic look with less applications.  </li>
            <li>Mia Adora is much better with less effort.</li>
            <li>At shower time that night I was curious if it came off easily</li>
            <li>Now they are just simple and short and I&#x27;ve tried everything to serum &amp; using more then 5 mascara at a time.</li>
            <li>The mascara really did make my eyelashes full and long but the fibers irritated my eyes all day.</li>
            <li>It works decently.</li>
            <li>and it takes no longer than my older mascara did.</li>
            <li>Just apply a coat of the gel to the top half of your lashes (I tend to focus mainly on the tips) then apply the fibers and then apply gel again.  </li>
            <li>So for me, I will still need to have traditional mascara on hand for quick applications.  </li>
            <li>The only time I&#x27;ve had irritation was on a super humid day where I walked and biked a ton.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, the only thing I could wish for would maybe be an eyelash seperater to be included inside.</li>
            <li>As I have gotten older I have found my lashes have been thinning.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product and will continue to use as my only mascara in the future!</li>
            <li>so it makes them look vibrant</li>
            <li>I have found that if I use a coat of regular mascara as the final coat, the fibers hide better.  </li>
            <li>My lashes are already a decent length</li>
            <li>Not the results promised and the fiber smaller tube is messy leaving my lashes looking clumpy and not looking good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty easy to use, it gets a little clumpy for me</li>
            <li>It really works was nervous because of the mixed reviews but over all very happy made my lash ridiculous long.</li>
            <li>I have fairly long lashes anyway with just regular mascara, but this really makes them pop and does lengthen them even more.  </li>
            <li>Was very skeptical trying these new form of mascaras, but happy I did!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li>not.... Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying this product....</li>
            <li>I highly recommend 3D Fiber Lash Mascara</li>
            <li>I get the effect i have been searching for, highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>It is very light and does not clump or feel heavy on your eyes.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I have too high expectations</li>
            <li>Recommened highly to my coworkers</li>
            <li>I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Although, my expectations weren&#x27;t that high.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To summarise the steps you firstly add your own mascara and leave it to dry, you then add the transplanting gel to your lashes and then apply the natural fibres to your eyelashes whilst the gel is wet.</li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>I purchased another brand that I felt was a little better.  </li>
            <li>My wife says makes her almost nonexistant eyelashes look lush!!</li>
            <li>Takes a little more time to do eye make.</li>
            <li>Product works as advertised, but I found that the Younique product works a little better.  </li>
            <li>works great and the price is right compared to others that are so expensive!</li>
            <li>but this mascara doesnt weigh them down!:)</li>
            <li>I could really feel my old mascara like crunch up and stick</li>
            <li>You HAVE to have a clean and dry mascara brush to eliminate the &#x27;clumping&#x27; effect.</li>
            <li>I had advanced ovarian cancer and took 16 months of chemo, which has caused my hair to barely grow throughout my entire body.</li>
            <li>I get full, long eyelashes.</li>
            <li>But i think it looks a bit messy when i Try to apply more layers.</li>
            <li>Makes lashes full and long</li>
            <li>I also hear that Younique Mood Fiberlashes has had similar success and will probably try that</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if that is normal with fiber lash but not planning on using anymore.</li>
            <li>i have never seen my eye lashes so long and full</li>
            <li>I will never ever wear normal mascara again.</li>
            <li>apply your normal mascara.</li>
            <li>so I add a few drops of saline solution (for contacts) and find it works much better.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make my lashes as long and full as i wanted and the fibers get in my eyes throughout the day</li>
            <li>But they did make my lashes look full and long, as good as if I was wearing false lashes.</li>
            <li>And doesn&#x27;t last very long my Loreal mascara works better than this.</li>
            <li>Never had tried to do something with my lashes like this product before but after the initial try it was easy and simple.</li>
            <li>Here is a picture of my eyes, on the right side I have no mascara at all, on the left side I&#x27;m wearing the 3D Fiber Lash Mascara, and I took a picture of just one eye done so you guys cans see the difference.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not fun, but it happens and is easily taken care of).</li>
            <li>You‚Äôre lashes look super long today‚Äù.</li>
            <li>My lashes are long but straight and thin, this product works great to make my eyes pop.  </li>
            <li>My lashes are lengthened and a little thicker but so much more natural looking.</li>
            <li>It lifts your lashes to new heights.  </li>
            <li>I live the length I can build.</li>
            <li>I find it feels like it gets in my eyes, but I&#x27;m new to the product</li>
            <li>I see why my friends like it as a few of them have very sparse lashes, so it helps them, but I don&#x27;t see a huge difference for myself.</li>
            <li>I may not be putting enough layers on, because I don&#x27;t really notice much of a difference with my lashes.</li>
            <li>I recommend watching several of the available youtube videos on how to apply (just search for Moodstruck and several</li>
            <li>So many fibers fall off during application; and since mascara is the last step in applying eye make up you have to carefully remove the fibers without ruining your shadow or liner.</li>
            <li>They go on thick and actually look good, HOWEVER, if you are in the heat or warmer weather (at an event) and begin to perspire a bit.....</li>
            <li>but I have contacts and very sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>I have very short, very straight eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got very little eye lashes and this product has changed that I love it</li>
            <li>It is very simple to use &amp; left my lashes looking longer and much fuller, but not fake!</li>
            <li>Exactly the same as the home party brand that every one else uses.  </li>
            <li>, I do not usually take the time to write this lengthy (yes, I do consider this lengthy) a review.</li>
            <li>You put your regular mascara on first, then you &amp;#34;sweep&amp;#34; on the fibers from one of the tubes with the mascara type wand inside.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget to use your mascara first and last!</li>
            <li>I even recommended it to my friend and she had the same issue for the first couple of weeks but now loves it too.</li>
            <li>Just received my 2nd supply after 4 months of using the first.</li>
            <li>I have used many mascaras in the past but this takes the cake.</li>
            <li>Thank you, this 65 year old lady has eye lashes again!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>So, I then tried what another reviewer said and start the first coat with your regular mascara, fibers and then the gel provided.</li>
            <li>toss your regular mascara, you apply one coat of it as the first step in using this</li>
            <li>Since you have to use regular mascara first before applying, I might have to find one that thickens when I use this</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a lot of fun, and my eye lashes were long.  </li>
            <li>Never thought my scanty lashes can be made to look naturally fuller!</li>
            <li>There were barely any fibers on it and the ones that were was very clumped.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alright, don&#x27;t get near moisture!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I was a skeptic at first especially since it was on amazon</li>
            <li>One day I&#x27;m going to have to try all 3 steps and see how really lush my lashes get!</li>
            <li>Then, they &amp;#34;discount&amp;#34; the $29 price, but charge shipping of $6, which is the same exact price Younique sells for.  </li>
            <li>This gives the exact same effect without any hassles.</li>
            <li>Definitely improvement in lashes - more than any other product I&#x27;ve tried, and</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>One review says to use it properly, the gel tube should be put in hot water.</li>
            <li>Works exactly the same and bonus points that it&#x27;s 15 dollars cheaper and has 2-day shipping!</li>
            <li>open the fibers tube and then grab the transplanting gel from hot water</li>
            <li>It is the natural fibers!</li>
            <li>But so far I like it!</li>
            <li>And Wow!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the small tube - just the big one, and love it all by itself!</li>
            <li>The transplanting gel dries out fairly quick when you use it frequently, but I have resolved this by placing 1-2 drops of eye lubricant into the container once it starts to dry up.</li>
            <li>This removes easily with soapy facial cleanser and water provided you&#x27;re not using a waterproof mascara to seal the whole deal down.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use daily but extra oomph for special occasion</li>
            <li>When I first got this product it worked fantastic, the only downside is, it does not last long at all!  </li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because the process is a bit tedious and takes longer than I&#x27;m used to, but the results are pretty amazing</li>
            <li>; portion just seems like regular mascara and not nearly as thick as younique therefore it didn&#x27;t have as much holding power of the fibers.</li>
            <li>It might sound like a long procedure but it only takes a minute.</li>
            <li>Great over your mascara lashes makes them long as false eyelashes</li>
            <li>I got my product earlier than expected and received a few follow up emails about how best you use the product, how to apply and other tips.    </li>
            <li>I could not get it to stop clumping and made a huge mess of my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>Not only are they pretty much 99% the same, when compared side by side you can&#x27;t tell the difference in packaging, design and the product.</li>
            <li>Overall good product and does make your lashes look big and fluffy!</li>
            <li>Kind of sucks!</li>
            <li>You also need to take care to apply the fibers only to the top half of your lashes.  </li>
            <li>I have super short blonde eyelashes</li>
            <li>After trying 300X Fiber Lashes, I will not go back to the more expensive product, that is no better than 300X.  Great product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump any more than any other mascara and doesn&#x27;t take long to apply.</li>
            <li>I have been using them more than I even anticipated since they are so easy to use and make such a difference in my thin eyelashes!</li>
            <li>its alright, just pretty much like any other mascara.</li>
            <li>I have blonde, very sparce lashes, wow I had visible lashes!</li>
            <li>I just wish it was a little cheaper so that I could use it every day for fabulous lashes.</li>
            <li>My wife used this and said while it works as well as the original Younique brand, it doesn&#x27;t last anywhere near as long</li>
            <li>I actually look like I have beautiful long thick  eyelashes!</li>
            <li>It makes my lashes a lot fuller the only issue I had was the fibers falling but after understanding the product a little more I no longer have that problem.</li>
            <li>My lashes have started to thin and this product is amazing at making my lashes fuller and longer.  </li>
            <li>You could improve your info by making that clear.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and received much sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, irritate easier and wear contacts.  </li>
            <li>It does extend your lashes, but it takes forever to get the fibers to attach to your lashes in a way that looks natural.</li>
            <li>I would appreciate any tips, because trying to put on mascara for 10 minutes is a bit much to do on the regular.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this.  </li>
            <li>I feel Younique far surpasses the rest.</li>
            <li>(but she has some natural curl to her lashes.</li>
            <li>I was very dissapointed with this product, especially after paying 26 dollars for it.</li>
            <li>I even used it on my 8 year old daughter for pictures.</li>
            <li>The fibers frequently fall in your eyes.</li>
            <li>I tried it a second time another day, and still it came out very spidery and clumped together.</li>
            <li>yet they still looked natural not clumpy.</li>
            <li>I was torn between 3 or 4 stars because overall I do really like the way this mascara looks...</li>
            <li>Almost need to comb it thru to create a natural look.  </li>
            <li>It would add the finishing touch to the product for a complete finish.</li>
            <li>I also typically only wear on nights out or weekends because I feel it&#x27;s a bit too much eyelash for a work day.  </li>
            <li>I went from indistinct lashes to lush lashes.</li>
            <li>Does thicken but clumps and the fibers go on in wild directions.  </li>
            <li>Having blonde eyelashes, this product really helps my eyes to &#x27;POP&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>literally hurt so much that I had to shut my eyes and have my husband help me to bathroom seeing as I couldn&#x27;t even OPEN MY EYES.</li>
            <li>I am so surprised on how they advertise it works so well.</li>
            <li>and I also have sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>It was unexpected, and I wouldn&#x27;t have worn this product</li>
            <li>and I end up having to take off the mascara completely, after picking out 400 fibers from my eyeballs.</li>
            <li>It is a four step process that takes all of maybe a min to complete if that.</li>
            <li>Much easier for me than gluing them on which I can never do properly.</li>
            <li>So you need to keep checking the mirror frequently.</li>
            <li>My eyes are too sensitive for lash extensions with glue</li>
            <li>Bought some for my 18 yr old dtr for Christmas...</li>
            <li>(It looks like a soft Felt)</li>
            <li>This is going straight back to the factory it came from</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe they were foolish enough to send me a product that isn&#x27;t even completely whole.</li>
            <li>And so much faster than putting on multiple coats of mascara.  </li>
            <li>and I appreciated this extra bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>especially if you try to do another coat of the 3D, if you do they go completely straight.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes and does not irritate my eyes at all.</li>
            <li>I like to look natural</li>
            <li>so if you&#x27;re going for an all natural look,  this product may not be for you.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s the only con I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>and even though I have sensitive eyes, these do not bother me at all.</li>
            <li>I have pretty long eyelashes</li>
            <li>I did like my natural lashes before his</li>
            <li>How do I complete a return?</li>
            <li>but I personally found all the information on the product page, instructions and the additional instructions I received via E-Mail to overcomplicate the whole process.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really makes a noticable difference as compared to regular mascara.</li>
            <li>I was ready to send it back.</li>
            <li>Used this for the first time today and let me tell you, combining this with the Fuchsia deluxe eyelash curler AND grandelash MD eyelash enhancer has just made me think about tossing my falsies...which is HUGE because I&#x27;m OBSESSED with falsies and used them everyday!</li>
            <li>I like it to look natural and just apply 1-2</li>
            <li>I was really hesitant and waited until I had a lot of time to try it and now, it&#x27;s part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see the difference from using 3D fiber kash mascara then from my regular mascara.</li>
            <li>It arrived early.</li>
            <li>Even though I think it is expensive, honestly love it and think is worth it.</li>
            <li>I have applied this a few times hoping they would get better if I applied it differently</li>
            <li>Apply dry synthetic lashes with dry flat brush - this can be rather difficult at first and lashes may look lumpy, but I have found practice makes perfect.</li>
            <li>The first time I applied it as directed and my lashes looked super clumpy and within two hours I had tons of tiny dried flakes under my eyes, which wouldn&#x27;t come off.  </li>
            <li>Applying it of course is simple and comes with specific directions,  although I found that I needed to apply it for about a week to get it right.</li>
            <li>left side has regular mascara and the right has 3d lashes (not that that needed explaining</li>
            <li>Love love 3d fiber lash mascara 300x, I will never go back to fake lashes again!</li>
            <li>wish the fiber brush had a better filter, and thicker comb because I feel that the application would adhere better, waste less fibers, and be less clumpy</li>
            <li>Makes my eyelashes look very long and pretty.</li>
            <li>I think it is a fairly natural look also, at least more natural than extensions, because no one has really commented on my really long lashes.</li>
            <li>theres small little pieces of... lint essentially that you&#x27;re gluing onto your lashes lolol.</li>
            <li>Very easy to remove and so far, I have not experienced smudging or flaking from this brand.</li>
            <li>It is a great alternative to false lashes!!</li>
            <li>I have very short, very straight Asian eyelashes and this type of product</li>
            <li>My lashes are not very dark and this give my lashes a full and dark look.  </li>
            <li>I am allergic to most mascaras, there are only a few I can wear!  </li>
            <li>I used to spend so much money having eyelash extensions applied, just to have them grow out and look funny for a few days before they could be removed and reapplied.</li>
            <li>unfortunately age makes them not so pretty and much more space.  </li>
            <li>I did see small flakes on my eyelids and cheeks, but i&#x27;m sure those are there because I didn&#x27;t apply enough gel to seal the lash.  </li>
            <li>will then put the lid back on gel and place back into hot water, let my lashes set approx.</li>
            <li>It certainly does make a difference if you do not have naturally long lashes.  </li>
            <li>Will use no other product but this!</li>
            <li>I wear it everyday and it washes off easy with facial cloths.</li>
            <li>It was at least $10 less than what I paid for the Younique fiber stuff and just as good.  </li>
            <li>This is essential because you apply the gel then quickly apply the fibers while the gel is still wet, wait about 20 seconds for the fibers to set then apply the gel again to seal in the fibers.</li>
            <li>It‚Äôs a long story ‚Äì Very smitten with it.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I got frustrated to figure out how to get beautiful lashes and no flakiness.</li>
            <li>One looks like regular Mascara, and I just applied that normally, and then I used the Fiber Brush</li>
            <li>‚Ä¶ Also it‚Äôs a little cheaper on Amazon, I think my friend spent about $12 more buying from someone</li>
            <li>My friends are always looking to find a local sales person to buy it from and act like they just can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>It really makes my lashes look very very long.  </li>
            <li>: In the evening, gently PAT your lashes dry with water.</li>
            <li>The only downfall of this product is that it takes much longer to apply than regular mascara and once on</li>
            <li>I attached 3 photos to show, one with nothing, one with my regular lash extension mascara, and the other with this applied for the very first time.</li>
            <li>The whole process is very simple and only takes a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>Not as amazing as I expected - it lengthens a little but not a considerable amount.  </li>
            <li>Right down to the case that they come in.  </li>
            <li>Would NOT recommend this mascara, ESPECIALLY if you have sensitive eyes!</li>
            <li>Just seemed a little messy and then kept reapplying only to never see that much of a difference from my favorite Lorel Telescopic Mascara.</li>
            <li>Other than that it does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>I posted two photos, the first darker one is the product and the other</li>
            <li>I have no other makeup on in the photos.  </li>
            <li>and they last through my evening face wash, but not past the morning shower.</li>
            <li>I put my regular mascara on first, let it dry, then use the fiber lash.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are very light and thin</li>
            <li>Only downside the gel dried very quickly and it took multiple applications to get the desire look.</li>
            <li>Other than that I love this product and still wear it everyday.</li>
            <li>but as I grew older, they were not as long as they were when I was in my twentiesand</li>
            <li>The home sole brings out my blonde lashes more, but is a little more expensive.  </li>
            <li>My eye lashes are naturally pretty long and thick, so I will probably only use this for special occasions bc</li>
            <li>I made the mistake once of applying it to my whole lash (was just on auto pilot and forgot), and all day long fibers were falling into my eyes, causing massive irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have naturally straight but long eyelashes which can be such a pain tocurl and get to stay</li>
            <li>As it is, I can barely make out the writing below the &amp;#34;300x.&amp;#34;  Since you&#x27;re going back and forth between tubes, it would be easier if it&#x27;s clearly labeled.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work well on me which I attribute to my type of lashes - they aren&#x27;t curly but more straight, almost like Asian lashes can be, do not hold a curl with an eyelash curler, and</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not careful it will get clumpy.</li>
            <li>I was a bit surprised to find out that you use it along with regular mascara.</li>
            <li>Look natural, almost if I didn&#x27;t wear make up, only thing is you need patience.</li>
            <li>I only used it twice so far</li>
            <li>I barely saw a difference for when I apply two kinds of mascara.</li>
            <li>The fibers are soft, but if you do not apply enough gel they will fall on your cheek or in your eye.</li>
            <li>And it really doesn&#x27;t take much longer to apply then putting on a few extra coats of mascara.</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised by the results (initially).</li>
            <li>I really do not have much lashes and this adds volume, length and glamour to my eyes which I am not use to.</li>
            <li>I decided to try it again and follow the directions completely and only one eye at a time.</li>
            <li>Some of the lashes have fallen out but that&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t put enough of the wet stuff on first.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of silly.</li>
            <li>Get compliments everyday definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>the feel, better than false eye lashes.</li>
            <li>Do keep in mind, my lashes are on the short stubby side (at least my right eye is), but isn&#x27;t this supposed to work on all lengths, especially short lashes (otherwise why would i need this product?&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more expensive, but it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty black.</li>
            <li>It is no harder to apply than any other type of mascara and I will absolutely recommend it to all my &amp;#34;lashless&amp;#34; friends, and will order again.</li>
            <li>It really does work vs all the other mascara i have tried out there.</li>
            <li>Also, removal is so much easier than other mascaras.</li>
            <li>) take a small cup and put very hot water in it.</li>
            <li>By loose I mean as many that get on my lashes fall on my face.</li>
            <li>At first I was disappointed because I thought it looked too clumpy, but once you get used to it and watch some videos online about how to use it, it has amazing results.</li>
            <li>I use when I want a more dramatic evening look.</li>
            <li>but with the dramatic change in my eyes now I have been :)</li>
            <li>To make this work for me and the look I wanted, I applied 2 coats and my lashes were thicker and looked more dramatic.  </li>
            <li>it would have an even more dramatic look....</li>
            <li>This will go along way with making your lashes look more dramatic.  </li>
            <li>Noticeable difference on my lashes makes my makeup look more dramatic.</li>
            <li>My eye lashes are already long, just not thick enough.  </li>
            <li>The black fibers really thicken the width of the lashes and the wet gel really lengthens them.</li>
            <li>I felt compelled to exchange the same professional courtesy back to the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will never go back to the old traditional mascara.</li>
            <li>Many of the fiber lash mascaras seem to shed and hit my eyes, irritating them and making them red.</li>
            <li>Also I suggest going one eye at a time so that the gloss does not dry up before you put the fibers on.</li>
            <li>Little tricky to use at first, until you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>No more multiple applications of the regular stuff, long, beautiful, thick eye popping lashes in one and done!</li>
            <li>It seemed like after about three weeks of use, it became super clumpy and not able to disburse enough product for the lash fibers to adhere to.</li>
            <li>It gives you full long lashes without ask the trouble of false lashes and washes off easily.</li>
            <li>I have fairly long lashes, but like them full (not spidery) and lush, I am also always running late.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Whilst applying standard mascara is generally a 1 step process involving just adding liquid to your eyelashes via a brush</li>
            <li>Really long and lush.</li>
            <li>The wand barely scraped fibers off prior to coming out tube</li>
            <li>There was no real difference in my normal mascara and the fiber mascara.</li>
            <li>If it wasn&#x27;t too late I would return for a full refund.  </li>
            <li>The application process takes a while ladies, so don&#x27;t rush yourself for the first few applications, or you will end up looking clumped.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the first came and was unusable as one of the items had completely dried out.  </li>
            <li>Instructions included say to use your regular mascara, let that dry, then apply the Mascara and quickly apply the fibers, then apply the Mascara again, this is where your clean dry mascara wand comes in, I usually blow upwards as I am un-clumping and keeping the weight of all the product from pulling my eyelashes down.</li>
            <li>But it is hard to apply, since the gel tends to dry up pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I have not had it flake off..or irritate my eyes..or any clumping that can&#x27;t be fixed with a dry mascara brush.</li>
            <li>It looked okay... not a huge difference from my usual mascara.</li>
            <li>You really get what u pay for...... a mess.</li>
            <li>After getting lash extensions my real lashes were a mess.</li>
            <li>Gel was very runny and did not work properly, the fibers would not attach to the gel so more of them ended up on my eyeball, which is very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how you can possibly put this on without some landing in your eye, but if you manage to do so (it really stings btw), the &amp;#34;fiber/dust&amp;#34; will flake off throughout the day leaving a dusting of black under your eyes that will smudge when you try to remove it leaving you with a raccoon like effect.</li>
            <li>Although it does make your lashes look bigger and is easy to put on, it cannot replace false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t live up to the endless IG posts  I reviewed and the fibers got in my eyes.</li>
            <li>good product ..maybe a little expensive</li>
            <li>I guess if you have thin eye lashes it will help out a lot, but I didn&#x27;t see a huge length difference.</li>

            <li> The 3D Fiber Lash Mascara is the best cosmetic purchase I have ever made, and I feel like my eyelashes look too good to be true!</li>
            <li> I had huge beautiful lashes!</li>
            <li> good experience all around.</li>
            <li> this is a good product.</li>
            <li> Mascara purgatory, but in a good way.</li>
            <li> and I am good</li>
            <li> Not as good as it was presented.  </li>
            <li> This product is good</li>
            <li> (Again, this is a superior product</li>
            <li> Good idea...</li>
            <li> My wife loved these lashes and mascara.</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because if you don&#x27;t have a good lash comb to separate and define your lashes</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t as good as Younique one.</li>
            <li> For me, this product was comparable to a good mascara with added steps.</li>
            <li> It might of been good but the Brush broke off n</li>
            <li> But, it is a good learning process like a winged liner, so here is my learning</li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> My daughter tried and loved it.</li>
            <li> Not at good as the Veronique that I thought I was ordering.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as good as the so called name brand.</li>
            <li> Good good product.</li>
            <li> I have worked out with it on and it stays looking just as good after as it did before.</li>
            <li> but it did not look good at all.  </li>
            <li> It was good but not as good as the Younique brand</li>
            <li> A perfect combination and well worth the price!</li>
            <li> Use a clean lash wand to comb thru any clumps but this works great!</li>
            <li> Makes my eyes beautiful and sexy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most beautiful thing ever.</li>
            <li> Quick &amp; perfect quality!</li>
            <li> Was extremely impressed with the length it built on the lashes rather quickly.</li>
            <li> This is an exceptional product.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, easy to use and good product!</li>
            <li> Great product for an ok price üíô</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Length was great ..but looked sparse and &amp;#34;spider legish&amp;#34; :)</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s so amazing</li>
            <li> Omg his is sooooo amazing , I orderd it on Monday and got it Wednesday</li>
            <li> but over all its amazing</li>
            <li> Amazing my lashes look great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing.</li>
            <li> The lashes are amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too cheap to spend $100/month on eyelash extensions, and although doing my mascara can sometimes become time consuming, I&#x27;m happy to spend the time if it&#x27;s saving me almost $100/month.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t own</li>
            <li> (honestly)....</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;d rather not have to worry about that kind of stuff all day at work</li>
            <li> I think it is as good as most of the fiber lashes.</li>
            <li> I did everything to make sure they came out good</li>
            <li> Mascara is nice.</li>
            <li> I am being completely honest.</li>
            <li> Nice case.</li>
            <li> My advice is be sure to put on a good amount of gel after the layer of fiber lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not crazy impressed, but I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Nice idea in theory but not working out for me.</li>
            <li> Came in a nice box.</li>
            <li> does a nice job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this product.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and it didn&#x27;t do anything spectacular for my lashes.</li>
            <li> I also order this product for my Daughter and she liked it as well and would order this again.</li>
            <li> I got lots of compliments on how nice I looked.</li>
            <li> I really liked the mascara</li>
            <li> Apply your own mascara, then gel (which looks like mascara), fiber, then gel again.</li>
            <li> I would recommend that you use a coat of your own mascara after applying this product to seal the deal.</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice and the mascara doesn&#x27;t stick like others it kind of just glides on.</li>
            <li> Best thing since sliced bread...fabulous, and it really works,  longest</li>
            <li> RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE TO TRY OUT IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.</li>
            <li> EVERYTHING IN THIS REVIEW IS MY OWN AND IN NO WAY INFLUENCED.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love my 3d lashes, my lashes have never looked so good.</li>
            <li> I made one mistake where I didnt finish by applying my own mascara after I was done and as a result I had fiber flakes all over my face.</li>
            <li> but it takes a lot of time and effort to get looking nice.</li>
            <li> Additional tools are requited to get it looking nice like you see in ads</li>
            <li> I use my own mascara instead of the gel.</li>
            <li> I liked the product</li>
            <li> Thickened nicely.</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because honestly my eyelashes stuggle to keep mascara of anykind...</li>
            <li> Fast delivery..  Excellent products..</li>
            <li> Put in your pocket or a cup of warm water.  </li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> but I really, really liked the look.</li>
            <li> Not overly thrilled with it considering the price.  </li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY WORKS WONDERFULLY!!!!!  </li>
            <li> but you can also use with your own mascara as well</li>
            <li> They REALLY are just beautiful!</li>
            <li> They are working nicely for me.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice if it came in brown.  </li>
            <li> If you follow the directions they are just as full and beautiful as they advertise.  </li>
            <li> I just thought it&#x27;d be nice to have longer lashes than I had without it, and the 300x does help to make them noticeably longer in minutes.</li>
            <li> Product provided at a promotional price for testing and review purposes, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> I had used another brand of fiber lashes before and really liked them and their look....</li>
            <li> Love love love this product!!  </li>
            <li> Definitely a very nice product and make a huge difference in lashes.</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use, doesn&#x27;t wear off or smudge, and almost looks like real but incredible lashes!!</li>

            <li> Very easy to apply.</li>

            <li> Amazing I love it</li>
            <li> I tried it once as directed, applied a layer of my own mascara, transplant gel, fibers, and transplant gel once more.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best mascara I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I bought these because they were the most popular.</li>
            <li> This IS by FAR the best mascara ever!!</li>
            <li> I feel so confident wearing my OWN lashes now.</li>

            <li> Great product, easy to apply, huge lashes :)</li>
            <li> I was really hoping that this product would be good because the reviews were good.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend using mascara first; it causes a great deal of clumping.</li>
            <li> Really works with extending your eyelashes, making them look beautiful.</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered this product it was great, ordered again.</li>
            <li> It looks great when you first apply it</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and stays fresh for good 8 hours.</li>
            <li> You just have to have a steady hand, and Its NOT something you can do in a hurry if you want good results ladies!</li>
            <li> Very cheap for what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to apply and the effect is simply amazing.</li>
            <li> I thought it was easy to use and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s super easy to apply and has very amazing results.</li>
            <li> It definitely works, but it is best to follow the instructions (I didn&#x27;t the first time LOL).</li>
            <li> Huge difference!</li>
            <li> Makes a huge difference in my lashes!</li>
            <li> I would for sure recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> Wasnt any better than store bought thickening mascara but will work.</li>
            <li> when I want more &amp;#34;umph&amp;#34; to my lashes I use it.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I also ordered a cheaper one and it works better ththan this one.</li>
            <li> However,  you have to make sure you put some mascara after the fibers,  so they don&#x27;t fall off.</li>
            <li> I have tryed so many others with crappie results.  </li>
            <li> It gives my eyelashes more volume and length</li>
            <li> would never recommend 3D to anyone &amp; will gladly pay more for Younique.</li>
            <li> I really love this.</li>
            <li> I love 3D Fiber Lash Mascara, 300X,</li>
            <li> Love this product.looks</li>
            <li> LOVE..</li>
            <li> This product was okay.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> Love It.</li>
            <li> well many years ago.  </li>
            <li> My lashes have never looked better.</li>
            <li> Love this product..</li>
            <li> all of and/ tangles them more.</li>
            <li> I am very upset because i heard really, really great things about this.</li>
            <li> This is better.</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied with this product,nice concept.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my grand daughter</li>
            <li> and then I start on one eye with the gel, then the fiber and then gel over the top.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I used lots of the transfer gel to make sure the fibers were locked into place</li>
            <li> I feel like I look more awake</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> This is an okay product.</li>
            <li> I love the look.</li>
            <li> Its ok with Just one layer,</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> This mascara is better than lash extensions, which I have also tried.  </li>
            <li> This is a good mascara if you want your lashes to look great, but would not buy as a daily use item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really okay.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use an eyelash curler or a comb to get out clumps, I suggest that. :)</li>
            <li> I love the web mascara</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS.  </li>
            <li> but this brand is MUCH better.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> This mascara is just okay</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> Love these..</li>
            <li> Maybe for someone else it would be better.</li>
            <li> Younique is much better quality.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara</li>
            <li> These are fantastic; make my eyes pop like I&#x27;ve never seen!</li>
            <li> Ok product for the price.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s an ok product.</li>
            <li> I have never tried more than one coat.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> LOVE,LOVE, LOVE  made my eyes pop as if I had extensions..</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> Love this mascara..</li>
            <li> If you administer one eye (top then bottom) at a time rotating the gel then fibers etc.</li>
            <li> Lancome easier and lashes much better.</li>
            <li> Love it..</li>
            <li> Not my favorite after a week of use.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product have sent it to two of my friends who also love this product</li>
            <li> Have had more compliments on my mascara than ever before.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not - it&#x27;s not terrible but Younique is MUCH better.</li>

            <li> This stuff is so much better.</li>
            <li> I love the product, it takes a bit of finesse</li>
            <li> It was ok, it lasted for like 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I feel like I should&#x27;ve gotten more for my money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> I like the concept and most of the results I get.</li>
            <li> I would love to give this product</li>
            <li> You can redo the lashes as many times as you want to add to the length or do just once to have a fuller lash.</li>
            <li> Okay product.  </li>
            <li> The pic is after a whole day of running errands, still looks great.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>

            <li> I love this product but if you do happen to accidentally get some in your eye...</li>
            <li> I have a couple of suggestions to get the most out of this mascara.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to do one eye at a time</li>
            <li> and you have to commit more time and care with application.</li>
            <li> You will love it.</li>

            <li> I have been told by so many people that I need to try 3D fiber mascara.</li>
            <li> It says apply as many coats as needed.</li>

            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I am going to experiment this weekend with both brands to see if I can make the 2 together give better results.</li>
            <li> and the end result is so much better and fuller.</li>
            <li> Simply love it.</li>

            <li> Outstanding product.</li>
            <li> and I would say that the Younique one is more noticeable.</li>
            <li> but I feel that the eyelashes get tangle a lot more than with the Younique one.</li>
            <li> I realized I needed to re-up on some more</li>
            <li> but I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Most of the time I don&#x27;t need the comb.  </li>
            <li> My Cover Girl mascara works 10 times better.</li>
            <li> I have gotten the lashes and absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> and I get so many compliments when I use them.</li>
            <li> One tip I would add is apply gel and then fibers to top AND bottom of top lashes</li>
            <li> but when I do I love it.</li>
            <li> love the case the two product tubes come in.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m  in love.</li>
            <li> but now I love my lashes.</li>
            <li> LOVE  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting better at applying it.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not in love with it, but I like it.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to get better results for the price.</li>
            <li> Too many steps:</li>
            <li> Be sure to coat good.&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;7) apply one more coat of transplanting gel to set the fibers (this will prevent fall</li>
            <li> I love the 3 D fiber lash.</li>
            <li> Love how my eyelashes look.  </li>
            <li> Sheds more than Younique does...</li>
            <li> I love it even more than the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The one tip I would give is just be sure to take your time, and don&#x27;t try to glob it on.</li>
            <li> Now that I have mastered how to apply the lashes I love this product.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be purchasing it again for sure.</li>
            <li> It took me awhile to figure it out, but with practice the look has gotten better.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff ..</li>
            <li> You are easily able to control the density of your lashes just based upon the number of times you apply it.  </li>
            <li> Works even better.</li>
            <li> YET I&#x27;m confident I will get there soon)</li>
            <li> My drugstore mascaras did better..</li>
            <li> Also, I would make sure not to sleep with it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> make sure not to forget this step or you will have fibers falling off all day.  </li>
            <li> so I just make sure to take it off every night.  </li>
            <li> It takes more time to build the lash than just putting it on.</li>
            <li> I was so impressed with the final look.</li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> I love the results and you will too :)</li>
            <li> My Lanc√¥me mascara has better effect.</li>
            <li> Love the 3-D fiber mascara</li>
            <li> I LOVE the  Younique Moodstruck 3D Fiber Lash mascara, but this generic off-brand is nothing like the awesome original products!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, sealed very nicely.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product</li>
            <li> I can honestly say there&#x27;s a significant improvement.</li>
            <li> and I love looking forward to putting it on every day and see how long and beautiful I can get them!</li>
            <li> Great product, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product,  I highly recommend everyone try this.</li>
            <li> I am super glad I did!</li>
            <li> It really works and is amazing!</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look pretty good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as good as Younique, but much cheaper!</li>
            <li> Long beautiful lashes on all of us!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it promises, follow the instructions and you get gorgeous longer lashes.</li>
            <li> Did a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> Looks good at first but the fibers keep falling off throughout the day and seemed to irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> But, I took the lashes off of one eye and tried this product and it is actually pretty good.  </li>
            <li> As long as you apply these correctly and remember to use a generous amount of gel after you put the fibers on these are awesome.</li>
            <li> Makes a huge difference and washes off easily!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited!</li>
            <li> I love how easy is to take it off because the mascara doesn&#x27;t take my eyelashes off.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply (apply gel, then fibres, then more gel to seal them in and stop them falling out).</li>
            <li> Love how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li> Fiber lash mascara is an easy way to give more volume to my sparce lashes.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply just like mascara with one more step.</li>
            <li> Great, tried others not happy with them, lash factory is the best I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> It is fun to play with how many coats I want to add depending on the look I am going for!</li>
            <li> Both of them have good points, no fake lashes, length, easy to use.  </li>
            <li> But this stuff is amazing and does exactly what it says!</li>
            <li> Very very cool.  </li>
            <li> and, most importantly, fuller.</li>
            <li> I get better volume/length with a cheap drugstore mascara.  </li>
            <li> One tip, when putting the fiber on the lashes after the wet, press the fiber into the lashes for best results.  </li>
            <li> Best $20 I&#x27;ve spent.</li>
            <li> and I think it works better if you don&#x27;t put your own mascara on first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on looking for the perfect Mascara and this one is it.  </li>
            <li> Great product doesn&#x27;t flake gives lashes a natural look.</li>
            <li> My cheap mascara is better.</li>
            <li> The fibers don&#x27;t stay on good no matter how much gel I apply.</li>
            <li> It can fit in your purse and you will be able to remove them easily.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased with the product, it does what is says it will and their customer service is exceptional.</li>
            <li> It consistently smudges ether on top of eye or on the bottom leaving fiber residue even after applying as per instruction!</li>
            <li> I was nervous about applying the fibers, but it was super easy!</li>
            <li> IT IS SUPER EASY!  </li>
            <li> I find it easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This product was not too easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on my daughter too, no irritation and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply, a bit time consuming though.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s really easy to see the results.</li>
            <li> and the fibers didnt stick to lashes as easy as the youniquebrand that i had purchased before..</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Really easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> It wipes off fairly easily but can ruin face/under-eye makeup.</li>
            <li> FIBERS DID NOT GO ON EASILY.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> Its so easy to put on, easy as one two three.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about my eyelash products and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> and I was even able to just touch them up the next day and look great all over again.</li>
            <li> Easy to useüòÄ</li>
            <li> The Mascara clumps easily &amp; you get a lot of fall out product (creates a raccoon looking effect underneath the eye)  </li>
            <li> I like how easy it is to tell the difference between each Lash applicator.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply and take off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to use, lasts all day, and easy to remove at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> So easy to use.</li>
            <li> With them being so easy to apply, they save me time in the mornings when applying my makeup</li>
            <li> AND easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply if you pay attention to the instructions.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply and remove.</li>
            <li> Mascara tends to become raccoon eyes very quickly on my face.  </li>
            <li> The fiber debris comes off easy but every time I looked in the mirror, I saw the fallen debris on my face.  </li>
            <li> And it comes off easily with soap and water which is a must for my makeup.</li>
            <li> After that, works like a charm and comes off easily when you take a shower.</li>
            <li> although it is easy to apply after 30minutes of wear</li>
            <li> It does not bother my eyes and is easy to remove at night.</li>
            <li> The product is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> product is easy to use, and stayed on all day.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and stays on.</li>
            <li> I find that with any makeup, it&#x27;s easy to overdo it.</li>
            <li> and this is even easy for me.</li>
            <li> It came very quickly on the mail.</li>
            <li> It does increase the length of my lash and is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I save mine for special occasions and LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s ok for special occasions?</li>
            <li> Beyond amazing product, the 3D lash mascara works wonders and makes my eyelashes look so much longer and fuller!</li>
            <li> However, I did not understand that I was to use my own mascara first, and I need a lash comb.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done it both with and without my own mascara first</li>
            <li> It was the first time using any product of this kind</li>
            <li> and my mascara is Mac Haute and Naughty which by itself is freakiin awesome!!!</li>
            <li> Hands down the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for years for the perfect mascara, and was always let down.</li>
            <li> but I love it other wise!</li>
            <li> after that they were fine.  </li>
            <li> This one works fine, but not in comparison.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting half the effect, great!</li>
            <li> This time it seems not as good, the gel is much dryer and the fiber wand isn&#x27;t as full.</li>
            <li> Works just fine with 1-2 coats.</li>
            <li> not the best brand and dryer and seemed like less product inside then yopuniques</li>
            <li> But after awhile it was fine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to be able to do this using the passengers side vanity mirror for a quick &amp;#34;on-the-way-there&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Came quickly!</li>
            <li> I like this product so much :)!</li>
            <li> I got so much compliments and also recommended to many others re this product!</li>
            <li> I bought these because I wanted quick free shipping which I got from being a Prime member, instead of ordering from a brand website, paying shipping and and waiting more than 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Look how long and full my lashes r!!!!</li>
            <li> I love love love this mascara make my lashes nice, long and full.</li>
            <li> The videos people have posted in the reviews are accurate.</li>
            <li> The ease of it going on and not even flaking while putting it on, is a huge selling point for me.  </li>
            <li> I see a huge difference in the before and after of my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> To accurately use these &amp;#34;fiber&amp;#34; mascaras you do the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I enjoy wearing 3D Fiber Lash Mascara.  </li>
            <li> Great product for some extra volume to your lashes.</li>
            <li> Effective in length but very clumpy results.</li>
            <li> I used the actual brand and it was great</li>
            <li> So over all some of this product is great but a bit pricey for only using the fibers that came for the set</li>
            <li> I only use one coat of each per eye and it comes out great.</li>
            <li> I enjoy having longer lashes.</li>
            <li> She has light colored lashes and says this helps her out.</li>
            <li> Fantastic if you&#x27;re patient and follow the instructions properly&lt;</li>
            <li> I should have paid the extra $7 and went with the younique 3D Fiber lashes, they work great and make your eyes pop.</li>
            <li> I have fallen in love with this mascara definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I had to repurchase the item, but Amazon did upgrade to overnight shipping for free.</li>
            <li> This is not as great as the Cherry Bloom will go back to the Cherry Bloom.</li>
            <li> You then reapply the transplanting gel onto the eyelashes to secure it all</li>
            <li> Very pricey would have liked to return it.</li>
            <li> Now I can wear mascara and my lashes look long and beautiful.</li>
            <li> 3D fibers have a natural tendency to want to stick together so dedicate a good 5-10 minutes in the morning.</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> and they are beautiful and long again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was not a bit impressed smearing was a big issue stopped using after a week...who wants raccoon eyes??</li>
            <li> Great does a great job looks like you have false eyelashes on</li>
            <li> results were good after the 1st application and were a lot better after the second application.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily, stays on and comes off at the end of the day without any special treatment.</li>
            <li> They come with full instructions which are quite easy to follow</li>
            <li> Super easy to use and lasts as long as you need them too &amp; comes off easily with soap and water!!!&#x27;</li>
            <li> Thanks you 3D people!!!  </li>
            <li> Will be starting My very own YouTube channel soon and will be doing a tutorial on the 3d Fiber lashes.</li>
            <li> The product is awesome though, and very much what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have it for a while now and its perfect for everyday wear or just for special occasions.</li>
            <li> Clean smooth application and removal.</li>
            <li> That said I gave this product to my daughter and she loved it and made her lashes look lush and full</li>
            <li> It is super easy to apply you just put a coat of the transplanting gel and then follow with the fibers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to apply and remove.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite mascara!</li>
            <li> she looked so amazing that I got some for my 21 yr old dtr and myself!!</li>
            <li> So easy and fast for fabulous lashes!</li>
            <li> For longer lashes it works okay, but it doesn&#x27;t create much volume and it flakes off easily.</li>
            <li> I was excited about this product.</li>
            <li> Made a significant difference in the way my lashes looked.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s THE first time I have been completely satisfied with a mascara.</li>
            <li> First, I tried it with the gel that comes with it &amp; then the fibers and more coats of the gel.</li>
            <li> Excited when I got it on</li>
            <li> I was excited for it</li>
            <li> I love it thank you so much!</li>
            <li> but nothing I was significant.</li>
            <li> I think this 3D Mascara is so much fun!</li>
            <li> I have pretty sparse eyelashes, but with this they look fabulous!</li>
            <li> It is worth the price!</li>
            <li> It does make a significant difference in the length and thickness of my lashes.</li>
            <li> I was so excited for this mascara.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this product as I have been wearing lash extensions for a while and want to opt for something i could do at home.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny!  </li>
            <li> I have received sooo many compliments on how pretty my eyes are.</li>
            <li> I even used a clean mascara wand to try and separate the lashes, but still no luck.  </li>
            <li> Love using a light eye shadow to show how much fuller my eyes look.</li>
            <li> it looks like you just stepped out of a salon from getting your bangs trimmed and they didnt clean the hair around your face.</li>
            <li> This mascara is fabulous , really does what it says, love it..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the most talented make-up gal, so at times I have difficulty, but more often than not I love the outcome.</li>
            <li> but so far I love it!</li>
            <li> eyelashes are normally &#x27;dinky&#x27; but with this mascara they look so full and natural and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I have used other more pricey brands, (Younique and Benefit), and I felt this product was superior to the others.  </li>
            <li> My daughter loves this and priced right!</li>
            <li> and long it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> I am happy with the product and once i get the hang of it, may try to wean myself off of the individuals which have left my lashes very sparse!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how it improved my natural lashes.    </li>
            <li> So that was cool.</li>
            <li> You just have to practice a few times to get it to look more natural, but once you learn how it looks great!</li>
            <li> Overall good results, no complaints.</li>
            <li> Now my eye lashes look full and volumed.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara - does sometimes clump but with a eyelash brush before and gently after applying fixes that problem.  </li>
            <li> i followed the directions and gave this product multiple chances without good results.</li>
            <li> so you get everything off much easier and more</li>
            <li> Love the product so much and the service I will order it and recommend it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok... not what I really hoped for</li>
            <li> Overall a good product but wouldnt buy again because the fibers do fall off.</li>
            <li> , it didn&#x27;t met my expectations, I was hoping getting something better results for that much money I paid.</li>
            <li> Tried the product for a week straight, hoping it would get better.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I was stoked to get this , not so much</li>
            <li> (If you love eyelashes as much as I do) 2.</li>
            <li> SO COOL.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Younique a similar product.  </li>
            <li> It really works, although it seemed to make my lashes thicker more than longer.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this product would be better, because of the price</li>
            <li> Also, the gel, although goopy (lack of better term) just didn&#x27;t seen to make the lashed stick or come on easily on my real lases.</li>
            <li> Really, nothing more to say about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li> Honestly, not that impressed.</li>
            <li> but I really love it makes your lashes look so much fuller.</li>
            <li> I love the case and the product what I did not care for too much and it takes getting used to is sometimes</li>
            <li> The price of this stuff bothered me because I&#x27;m cheap, but it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> It provides a full set of lashes.</li>
            <li> and they look full.  </li>
            <li> It goes on easy and makes my lashes look so much thicker and longer!</li>
            <li> pretty easy to use</li>
            <li> I am very new to 3D Fiber lashes since I&#x27;ve heard so many conflicting reviews</li>
            <li> It was very pretty and made my lashes look soooo full</li>
            <li> Other than that, I&#x27;m really happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my new 3D mascara!</li>
            <li> I love my new 3d mascara!</li>
            <li> Different - take a bit more time - seems to work ok</li>
            <li> I just make sure I have the extra time to be sure it doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li> Love my mascara surely makes my short lashes look longer!</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly ....</li>
            <li> I really love this product it definitely helps my eyelashes stand out even more.  </li>
            <li> Not any better than regular mascara, and way more time consuming.</li>
            <li> You can make it as bold as you want by layering it.</li>
            <li> It lasts pretty long and looks great.</li>
            <li> Quickly apply the gel mascara again</li>
            <li> I can even choose to have &amp;#34;Bambi&amp;#34; lashes if I am so bold to do so.  </li>
            <li> This product is a quick fix if you&#x27;re looking for longer, fuller lashes temporarily.  </li>
            <li> , if you go too quickly they will fall into your eye and all over your lower lashes.  </li>
            <li> They really look good and natural</li>
            <li> I only used it on the top lashes and that felt much better.</li>
            <li> I also think the price is very reasonable for the fantastic results.  </li>
            <li> Not only was it very easy to put on but with only one coat my eyelashes looked amazing!  </li>
            <li> Looks amazing and natural; more natural without any mascara.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery!</li>
            <li> This is the first fiber mascara I have purchased, and it fit my needs.</li>
            <li> even 30 minutes after using this product my eyes started becoming really irritated, and there was fibers everywhere in my eye.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> it works amazingly and its works a lot better than other mascara products.</li>
            <li> I was amazed the very first time I saw the product.  </li>
            <li> I tried to buy this 3D fiber mascara instead of the other more popular brand</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with not only the speed of delivery, but the product itself.  </li>
            <li> (in a good way) I had girls asking me at work how my eyelashes looked so long</li>
            <li> Make sure your natural lashes are clean and separated.</li>
            <li> This product is super easy and very noticeable.</li>
            <li> Just as great as the other brands people sell!</li>
            <li> I watched a few YouTube videos to see how other people liked it, and the best way to apply it</li>
            <li> My sister had purchased a similar product from her salon at a much higher price and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Love the mascara!!!so many people commenting on how long my lashes look.</li>
            <li> What helped me even out my fibers was putting another coat of the first liquid mascara on, and then I used an eyebrown/eye lash brush to make my lashes really pop more.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first about this brand of fiber lashes, but after using it only once I loved it.</li>
            <li> other than the color I love it because it is very EASY to remove.</li>
            <li> thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times, but I love the 3d fiber lashes!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same concept but better!</li>
            <li> First off, this mascara works miracles so please don&#x27;t hesitate!</li>
            <li> and this really helps!!  </li>
            <li> get the real thing!!  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it will!</li>
            <li> Watch YouTube videos first!</li>
            <li> May be back for more!</li>
            <li> Just read the directions first!</li>
            <li> Same as Younique but MUCH more affordable!</li>
            <li> :) just make sure to use a lot of the adhesive gel before the fiber lashes go on, or you&#x27;ll get lots of loose fibers in your eyes.  </li>
            <li> I ended up being mildly allergic to this mascara, (my eyes would consistently water &amp; my throat would mildly swell)</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product comes impressively presented in a smart retro case (similar size to prescription spectacles case) and has inside it the gel and fibres in a pen sized tube which are in fact a similar size to mascara.</li>
            <li> To see with my own eyes how my little tiny eyelashes became long and beautiful was amazing...</li>
            <li> Mascara is the only makeup that I wear and this stuff makes my eyelashes look amazing.</li>
            <li> Really makes ur eyelashes huge.</li>
            <li> I have very short lashes and this product gives them amazing length and volume.</li>
            <li> A couple weeks later I ended up getting the semi-permanent eyelash extensions and they look AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> Not crazy about it</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the $.</li>
            <li> I liked how it looked initially...</li>
            <li> I love my 3D lash fiber mascara, I am 50 yrs old</li>
            <li> When you apply the fiber lashes the get kind of wadded up, and when you add the second coat of transplanting gel to keep the fibers from falling off, it just pulls them</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> If used correctly it will make your lashes look longer and more lush.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, worth the cost.</li>
            <li> But for the price it isn&#x27;t worth</li>
            <li> Nice email sent telling me how to use, when shipped, etc. will definitely purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> In addition, trying to figure out the most gentle way to remove it  when I&#x27;m ready.</li>
            <li> The pain isn&#x27;t worth having longer eyelashes , plus they looked like spider legs.</li>
            <li> but I believe a picture is worth a thousand words.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are very short and kind of sparse.  </li>
            <li> I found that if I took more time to brush lashes carefully straight with each stroke it worked better than how we can sometimes rush applying our regular mascara.</li>
            <li> Mascara is all natural, vegan, gluten free, &amp; made in the USA!</li>
            <li> overall it worked nice, just don&#x27;t like the way it irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li> I used a lash brush to make the result look more natural.</li>
            <li> Love it so far.</li>
            <li> Wow I love it.</li>
            <li> a few times honestly I bought 3D mascara for a fraction of the price of Lash Factory that worked better.</li>
            <li> I only was nice gave it 1 star because it did make some difference</li>
            <li> I used a lash brush to ensure they didn&#x27;t clump and kept them separated for a more &#x27;natural&#x27; look.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> Fun to put on.</li>
            <li> Overall, happy to find a mascara that makes my eyelashes longer and thicker naturally.</li>
            <li> Believe me it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> , it is definitely worth the price.  </li>
            <li> but when she do totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Its totally worth every penny..</li>
            <li> overall it worked well although I didn&#x27;t expect customers to need to use their own mascara and for it to be a 4 step process.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the month if you want your eyelashes to look longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about this product.</li>
            <li> This is a fun product to try out that will give you longer lashes for the day.</li>
            <li> I love that it looks natural and lasted until i washed my face.</li>
            <li> In the fraction of the time it would take you to attempt to put false lashes on u can have a great look!</li>
            <li> Best alternative to false eyelashes</li>
            <li> final, completed look on the eyes is surprisingly very nice and somewhat professional looking.</li>
            <li> I personally think it&#x27;s better than the unique 3d fiber ..</li>
            <li> I feel like the fibers always run out pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I only wear this product for 3-4 hours top but very easy to apply, not mess at all.</li>
            <li> I tried it but didn&#x27;t really  notice that significant of a difference</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m putting it on right.</li>
            <li> You can literally use just water and it will come right off.</li>
            <li> just right.  </li>
            <li> I posted a picture with 3d lashes on right eye</li>
            <li> If you do it right they will stay on all day.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get it to work right..</li>
            <li> Most of the problems people face with this product are simply from not applying it correctly..or can be fixed easily!</li>
            <li> One hint from my own experience - I find it helps to apply one coat of your regular mascara first before you begin the gel/fiber application then</li>
            <li> I have previously used Younique and this product is every bit as good, and not nearly as expensive!</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply with instant results.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to apply and actually makes my lashes longer.  </li>
            <li> and this is the first mascara that has made them really stand out!!</li>
            <li> One very long term customer here...very pleased!</li>
            <li> It comes off easily when removing the rest of your makeup WITHOUT pulling out your natural eyelashes!</li>
            <li> you cannot just apply it quickly like most regular mascaras.</li>
            <li> in researching this mascara I never saw where it said you had to use your own mascara first; I was thinking this was going to replace my mascara - seems pretty costly to buy regular mascara and this mascara as well.</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering the Younique fiber mascara system, so I&#x27;m not sure how I ended up with this one, but I&#x27;m definitely happy with it.</li>
            <li> so that was pretty exciting</li>
            <li> Clumps excessively so that even trying to use the comb does not do a great job of de-clumping.</li>
            <li> This product was not bad but it also did not work as much as I was hoping.</li>
            <li> It works good, but getting an eye infection when using this product is not fun at all...very unsatisfied</li>
            <li> Perhaps this could be remedied by a second coat of gel or regular mascara, I just haven&#x27;t tried because I feel there&#x27;s a fine line between beautiful, natural looking lashes, and spider leg lashes with this product.  </li>
            <li> its pretty good gel applies very sparsely even though it does not look dry.</li>
            <li> At first when you put it on it looks really nice and your lashes look long, but Once the fiber is on it comes off within minutes.</li>
            <li> I am surprised by how easy it is to apply.  </li>
            <li> It takes several coats to notice much difference, but it does look nice once its on.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I can wear one coat for a day look and add one or two more for a more dramatic evening look.</li>
            <li> I use on top and bottom lashes and it really gives a great and dramatic look.</li>
            <li> I actually have long, beautiful lashes now.</li>
            <li> Id rather pay a few bucks more for a better product.</li>
            <li> Ultimately, it didn&#x27;t even look that great when initially applied.</li>
            <li> My new fave makeup staple!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, NO mess like some reviews are saying, maybe one or two fibers fall on my cheek during application but those are easily brush off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I applied the fiber lash mascara early in the day and they looked just as amazing later that night even when I was out running errands in the hot Oklahoma heat and humidity!</li>
            <li> I love the way it looks but save it for special occasions and be careful.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will definitely be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I love it, the only thing is if you do re-applay the gel , the fibers fell all over you face,,, otherwise..</li>
            <li> with it, i will buy it again;)</li>
            <li> it makes my lashes so much thicker!</li>
            <li> wanted to try this because after I applied my first coat of &amp;#34;regular mascara&amp;#34; (Lancome) I could never seem to get a richer, fuller look on my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. .</li>
            <li> I had never used any 3D Fiber Mascara before and was nervous to try it out, but the first experience went off without a hitch at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am a first time customer to 3d lash.</li>
            <li> so the fibers more likely to fall in my eyes - which they did - and felt like a miniature knife in my eye!</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are tricky to use at first but with practice, I&#x27;ve definitely seen thicker lashes with two coats and longer lashes if I do three coats or more.</li>
            <li> Which is great since my eyeliner in always a thick cat eye.</li>
            <li> Works really well!</li>
            <li> This mascara works pretty well.</li>
            <li> It really makes my eyes pop!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> REALLY made her eyes POP!</li>
            <li> It makes a big difference :)</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used fiber lashes.</li>
            <li> I especially like how the company takes a vested interest by making sure you know how to use the mascara before it arrives.  </li>
            <li> but the fibers are great and work amazing and def fill and lengthen my lashes which are very short and thin...  </li>
            <li> Absolutely recommend to anyone !</li>
            <li> Does exactly as it is described.</li>
            <li> The mascara irritated my eyes at first</li>
            <li> The mascara only eye looked much better, not clumpy.</li>
            <li> Make sure the gel is the last application on your eyes to seal the fibers.</li>
            <li> I would remind anyone to follow the instructions exactly when applying.</li>
            <li> does exactly as it says....</li>
            <li> I find that regular mascara does a better job.  </li>
            <li> So glad I found this and didn&#x27;t pay higher prices for a product with a different name brand!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> The fibers did fall off the first time I tried it, but I read to apply gel after the fibers to lock them in place and it worked.</li>
            <li> Try the REAL 3D Fiber Lashes+ Mascara!</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Love this product use it daily!!!  </li>
            <li> When I received it, it was at first trial and error.</li>
            <li> Really thickens and lengthens!</li>
            <li> this considering I had to put mascara on first</li>
            <li> If you are interested in a mascara like this, please seek out a Younique representative or visit the Younique website.</li>
            <li> I will join the majority of reviewers here in saying that I highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li> I will most likely order another pair soon!</li>
            <li> First of all, curl your lashes.  </li>
            <li> The fact that this product indeed delivers exactly as it says it will, should always lend itself to a 5 star rating in my book.  </li>
            <li> It costs a bit more than traditional mascara</li>
            <li> As I first mentioned, application is a process and this takes time.</li>
            <li> I have fairly short lashes and have tried many products to get the length and volume I want and</li>
            <li> Definitely better results than regular mascaras, and does not flake.</li>
            <li> This really works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered a second one to have on hand in my car :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is my first review ever on a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> I like a different brand more but thought I would try this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had pretty eyelashes</li>
            <li> First day using it, followed the instructions exactly</li>
            <li> Tried 2 coats but didn&#x27;t lengthen much more then regular mascara</li>
            <li> and I ordered this through Amazon because there was Prime free shipping and a lower price than buying directly from YouNique.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately what I don&#x27;t love is the all day irritation of the tiny fibers that are not sticking to the lash.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time yesterday and was in 110 degree heat for over 5 hours sweating and there was no issues.</li>
            <li> This really does work!  </li>
            <li> The first shipment did not reach me.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how real my lashes look!</li>
            <li> Younique also offers FREE SHIPPING for all orders of $100+, and you can earn Hostess Freebies, and support your friends so why would people buy this imposter brand?</li>
            <li> but the primer gel really keeps them in place!</li>
            <li> AFTER RECEIVING MY PRODUCT AND TRYING IT THE FIRST TIME....</li>
            <li> I have never had much luck with mascara, but this was a dream!  </li>
            <li> but i think that relates more to my skill level then the actual product.</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing this product and it truly lengthens my lashes.</li>
            <li> Warning: it does shed at first, so you will need to wipe your finger under your eye to catch stray fibers.</li>
            <li> Use it FIRST or you will wreck your make-up.</li>
            <li> AND I SEE MY LASHES FOR THE FIRST TIME.</li>
            <li> My regular mascara works better than this junk</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit tricky at first</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> (It was in the manual, I just didn&#x27;t pay attention the first time).</li>
            <li> I will absolutely continue to use it!</li>
            <li> but first impressions weren&#x27;t favorable</li>
            <li> Love how big it makes my lashes look!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so pretty</li>
            <li> Love this product, use it daily.  </li>
            <li> However, I have found that you need to be sure that you place a lot of the second coat of gel after applying the fibers or the fibers will fall off and irritate you eye.  </li>
            <li> I will most definitely buy again when I run out!</li>
            <li> &amp; fast delivery!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I didn&#x27;t follow the gel-fiber-gel directions on each eye.</li>
            <li> First, you apply some mascara, then gel, then fibers...to add length and volume, continue to add coats of gel alternating with fiber.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Absolutely luv this product!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even do all the stuff I was supposed to like put mascara on first and curl my lashes.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Beautiful long lashes all day long</li>
            <li> Then work quickly and apply the gel about 21 strokes then lightly apply the fibers from mid lash to the ends.  </li>
            <li> strange product, not easy to apply, used it once and wasn&#x27;t impressed, I will probably use it again</li>
            <li> I think I can get almost the same results with a very good mascara and avoid having the little fibers flake off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool doesn&#x27;t give you that clean look, it gave my the clumpy mascara look, but it does last all day</li>
            <li> Other than that, for day-to-day and for evenings outs, this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Love love how this product makes my lashes look fuller and extra long</li>
            <li> No need for me to spend money on any other kind of mascara.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try and spend a little less money, however, I feel it is worth it to spend the money and buy the best.</li>
            <li> This works very well and the company actually emailed me ways to keep it from clumping and ways that I can get the most out of the product.</li>
            <li> I am astonished at the length of them, I wear falsies daily and have come to love them, so as I give the Fiber lashes a chance I am really liking them...</li>
            <li> Certainly worth trying given that you have the free 30 day guarantee to fall back on.</li>
            <li> all my lashes were pretty much gone.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first to buy this product when a coworker told me about, but boy did it brighten my eyes and made my lashes look so much fuller and longer.</li>
            <li> so long I love it</li>
            <li> The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like about it is that the fibers would fall of but other than that it works great.</li>
            <li> and when I wear it my whole family has commented on how pretty my eyes look.  </li>
            <li> Thanks much lash factory!</li>
            <li> and I saw first hand that it really does work.  </li>
            <li> It really works and I&#x27;d recommend the product to anyone interested in buying it.</li>
            <li> gives full thick lashes,, love it!</li>
            <li> It did make my lashes look a little more full, but they didn&#x27;t look any longer,</li>
            <li> It adheres, makes long great looking lashes, does not have the tendency to clump, but if you get too much with out letting it dry, it can clump.  </li>
            <li> It takes a few layers and you must be patient while creating the &amp;#34;layers&amp;#34; other wise it will clump a bit but just make sure you have a eyelash comb or spoolie.</li>
            <li> You can get the same look with a lot of  mascara, but it&#x27;s cool to have!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy enough to take off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a nice shade of black.</li>
            <li> Wears like regular mascara removes easily.</li>
            <li> Easy enough to avoid clumps.</li>
            <li> The product is easy enough to apply.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied, seems like the more expensive brand.  </li>
            <li> wonderful product for those of us not endowed with long thick curly eyelashes</li>
            <li> all honesty, I did expect to experience a certain degree of:&lt;br /&gt;Smudging&lt;br /&gt;Flaking&lt;</li>
            <li> You have to do it a certain way or it won&#x27;t come out how you want it to.</li>
            <li> it‚Äôs good, but not as rich and dramatic as the others.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect when I bought it, but I saw lots of positive reviews, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> My lashes are very short and fine.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are already somewhat long &amp; with this they look great &amp; very long!!!</li>
            <li> Definitely saw a huge difference and it does work</li>
            <li> and I think it did well for some extra volume, but I don&#x27;t see a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I notice the huge difference and now can&#x27;t go back.</li>
            <li> You have to practice using this product like any fiberlash product ( putting to much of the fibers can make the lashes appear spidery)</li>
            <li> I really like what this mascara can do in theory; in practice, no so much.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product</li>
            <li> the eyelashes really look longer than just with mascara.</li>
            <li> Makes the eyes very irriated.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are very curly and skimpy.</li>
            <li> I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone unless you don&#x27;t mind the clumpy spider leg look.</li>
            <li> and this really lengthens them.</li>
            <li> Fiber lashes add so much volume, I can&#x27;t go without this mascara.</li>
            <li> The  fiber brush in Younique&#x27;s really made the difference for me.</li>
            <li> I was worried I wouldn&#x27;t be skillful at application, or it would look very unnatural.  </li>
            <li> Thanks lash factory.</li>
            <li> It doesnt really work.</li>
            <li> and she really likes it.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason that you haven&#x27;t really heard about this from the makeup gurus.</li>
            <li> I know this sounds weird,but it really has boosted my confidence.</li>
            <li> and you can really see my eyes.</li>
            <li> I really like the mascara</li>
            <li> Then when I took the mascara off that night, I went through the whole little-fibers-getting-into-my-eyes thing all over again.  </li>
            <li> but the fiber one makes my lashes a massy look as if I applied one too much coat</li>
            <li> and it is too much.  </li>
            <li> No matter how much gel I put on.</li>
            <li> This product works really well for lengthening and thickening lashes.</li>
            <li> I thought it would really extend my lashes.</li>
            <li> It is very clunky and sticky and it causes your lashes to stick together</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s obvious this is a cheap knock off of Younique</li>
            <li> and there was a very noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> By the end of the day, it became very flaky and caused irritation to my eyes.</li>
            <li> Too much information is far better than not enough.</li>
            <li> Works very well...had to try a couple times to get the hang of it....</li>
            <li> I think it clumped way too fast</li>
            <li> wouldnt be purchasing again really..</li>
            <li> I have very skimpy eyelashes</li>
            <li> and this mascara really does make them look fuller and longer.</li>
            <li> you know she really studies me ‚Äì said ‚Äú</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really care for the brush that comes with the mascara.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use it on my bottom lashes because for me, that&#x27;s a bit much for work, but if I were going to party or out to dinner, I&#x27;d add the bottom</li>
            <li> This mascara really does give the effect of extensions without the pain, cost, and inconvenience of going to a salon.</li>
            <li> Thanks lash factory.  </li>
            <li> The real 3D Fiber Lashes+</li>
            <li> and I really like the traveling case.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have that much time in the mornings</li>
            <li> My lashes were longer and fuller thanks to the fiber lash mascara.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t really give me the look I was hoping for</li>
            <li> Get the real thing.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this Lash Factory 3D Fiber Lash Mascara.  </li>
            <li> After you have done those two steps you are ready to begin application.  </li>
            <li> That said, there are some  challenges; while reasonable, they do exist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not used to spending much time with make-up, but using this two-piece mascara did increase the length of my eyelashes as well as thickness - noticeably.  </li>
            <li> I really like the whole fiber systems</li>
            <li> I really like this product. .</li>
            <li> but I did not have any flaking or smudging through out the whole day</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> This really works.</li>
            <li> they your real eyelashes&amp;#34</li>
            <li> so I was spending so much on falsies</li>
            <li> Also this mascara doesn&#x27;t really add as much length as it says it does.</li>
            <li> This is a knock off product of the REAL 3D Fiber Lash Mascara</li>
            <li> haha)</li>
            <li> really like this product</li>
            <li> but it really does make lashes look longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> I have light blonde lashes and can&#x27;t go without mascara</li>
            <li> and it goes on very well.  </li>
            <li> but i dont, the fibers dont really stick -_-</li>
            <li> Like I said before, I tried their leading competitors product and it was by far money well worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 51 and have straight eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> If you have fibers under your eyes or on your cheeks, you are using too much.  </li>
            <li> The company sends tips on how to use the product when you order, which has been very beneficial as well.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I really feel about this.</li>
            <li> (are they straight, even etc . . )</li>
            <li> and mascaras that really don&#x27;t thicken or lengthen.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really lengthen my lashes and the fibers tend to be 1.</li>
            <li> but not much, the more i tried to make them longer</li>
            <li> am also very convinced because of the weight of the product.  </li>
            <li> Cons are it is way too time consuming and lashes can appear lumpy if you apply too much of the synthetic lash application.</li>
            <li> From now on I&#x27;ll buy the real thing at [...]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that this is just a one-time occurrence because I really like it. üòü</li>
            <li> The fibers really do fill in the lashes.  </li>
            <li> I really like this mascara</li>
            <li> It is much easier to apply than I thought.</li>
            <li> This mascara is absolute magic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but when i tried it on my lashes it really  extends my lashes</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really irritated with how clumpy the mascara makes my lashes.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much</li>
            <li> I received my order extremely fast.  </li>
            <li> but it can also make your eyelashes very clumpy if u use to much</li>
            <li> I really like the 3D Mascara.</li>
            <li> Makes my unnoticeable lashes very noticiable.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the tips.</li>
            <li> does make my eyelashes look much longer.  </li>
            <li> Whatever you are using to &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; it could be more like regular mascara, which I put over the top of it after the sealer coat and that seems to make it last longer without having to reapply later in the day.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping Quality merchandise.</li>
            <li> is that you really have to take it off every day.  </li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look much thicker - would like them to look longer.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased several fiber lashes and these have been my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> Great solution to having to put false eye lashes on.</li>
            <li> Love these, I actually look like I have naturally luxurious lashes.  </li>
            <li> I do like this product a lot, the only problem is that if you don&#x27;t put it on perfectly then the fibers will sometimes get in to your eyes and it is irritating to get out.</li>
            <li> this product is totally different as it involves a 4 step process which actually involves using your own mascara as the 1st</li>
            <li> Lashes appeared longer and more defined love this product was tempted to get false lashes now that is no longer a option thanks to this product</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are long and full when using the 3D Fiber Lash mascara!</li>
            <li> lasts all day long and is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> I have lots of long lashes and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> My niece was selling the other brand of 3D fiber lashes last year when I tried it &amp; loved it.</li>
            <li> It comes in a super cute little hard case, which is nice because I tend to have things &amp;#34;hide&amp;#34; from me in my makeup drawer.  </li>
            <li> Application is super easy and a few of my friends have purchased as well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with it and have absolutely no complaints!</li>
            <li> I repeat this process on the other eye and then wait a minute before applying mascara over the top</li>
            <li> Works better than any other mascara that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> By following the directions (and being sure to put my regular mascara on first)</li>
            <li> Not the same as the original product from &amp;#34;youngnique&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> But other then that I think the product it pretty cool!</li>
            <li> and therefore she&#x27;s going back to the original.</li>
            <li> Have used a more expensive brand in the past and these are just as great!</li>
            <li> Never using normal mascara again!</li>
            <li> but at the same time it is very clumpy and a recent update is that she has stopped wearing it and ordered a new kind</li>
            <li> I only want to wear it for special occasions they really increase length thickness</li>
            <li> This is a very cool product and a much better and cheaper alternative to false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This mascara does as it advertises, it definitely makes lashes significantly more apparent, and longer.  </li>
            <li> I feel that this gel tube does not have as much gel as usual, and I have been using my own mascara 1st.</li>
            <li> I was honestly a bit sad because everything else was cool but the end result pretty much fell apart after 10 minutes and your lashes will be straight.  </li>
            <li> I used a circular motion (gently) around my lashes with facial wash soap, a scrubby, and the fiber-gel-mascara washes off easily and completely.</li>
            <li> Once you use it a few times, it is actually very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The only reason it wouldn&#x27;t work well is if you&#x27;re not using it right!</li>
            <li> It takes a lot of time to apply and its not that much of a difference from normal mascara.</li>
            <li> Used to use two to three different mascara to get full lashes.</li>
            <li> I saw these eyelashes in Baltimore for Sweet Adelines International competition.</li>
            <li> I actually went a whole second afternoon with the 3D Fiber Lash applied more than 24 hours</li>
            <li> It worked, but I didn&#x27;t care for it as much as another brand I normally use.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping that it would be a good replacement for my false lashes -- not so much.</li>
            <li> And that last bit is very important, because I don&#x27;t want to do anything to temporarily beautify my lashes that ultimately deteriorates the volume I already have.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was more than a little excited to try this fiber last mascara, this was provided to me as a sample for review.</li>
            <li> Really like the 3D Fiber lash Mascara, I don&#x27;t have long lashes and this really make my eyes look bigger, just love it</li>
            <li> Gives my sparse eyelashes a whole new look.</li>
            <li> and then you put the black mascara over on top.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always having to check my face to make sure I don&#x27;t have black hairs everywhere.  </li>
            <li> , you get a more drastic look with less applications.  </li>
            <li> Mia Adora is much better with less effort.</li>
            <li> At shower time that night I was curious if it came off easily</li>
            <li> Now they are just simple and short and I&#x27;ve tried everything to serum &amp; using more then 5 mascara at a time.</li>
            <li> The mascara really did make my eyelashes full and long but the fibers irritated my eyes all day.</li>
            <li> It works decently.</li>
            <li> and it takes no longer than my older mascara did.</li>
            <li> Just apply a coat of the gel to the top half of your lashes (I tend to focus mainly on the tips) then apply the fibers and then apply gel again.  </li>
            <li> So for me, I will still need to have traditional mascara on hand for quick applications.  </li>
            <li> The only time I&#x27;ve had irritation was on a super humid day where I walked and biked a ton.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, the only thing I could wish for would maybe be an eyelash seperater to be included inside.</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older I have found my lashes have been thinning.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product and will continue to use as my only mascara in the future!</li>
            <li> so it makes them look vibrant</li>
            <li> I have found that if I use a coat of regular mascara as the final coat, the fibers hide better.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are already a decent length</li>
            <li> Not the results promised and the fiber smaller tube is messy leaving my lashes looking clumpy and not looking good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty easy to use, it gets a little clumpy for me</li>
            <li> It really works was nervous because of the mixed reviews but over all very happy made my lash ridiculous long.</li>
            <li> I have fairly long lashes anyway with just regular mascara, but this really makes them pop and does lengthen them even more.  </li>
            <li> Was very skeptical trying these new form of mascaras, but happy I did!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend 3D Fiber Lash Mascara.</li>
            <li> not.... Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying this product....</li>
            <li> I highly recommend 3D Fiber Lash Mascara</li>
            <li> I get the effect i have been searching for, highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> It is very light and does not clump or feel heavy on your eyes.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I have too high expectations</li>
            <li> Recommened highly to my coworkers</li>
            <li> I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Although, my expectations weren&#x27;t that high.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To summarise the steps you firstly add your own mascara and leave it to dry, you then add the transplanting gel to your lashes and then apply the natural fibres to your eyelashes whilst the gel is wet.</li>
            <li> Wow!!</li>
            <li> I purchased another brand that I felt was a little better.  </li>
            <li> My wife says makes her almost nonexistant eyelashes look lush!!</li>
            <li> Takes a little more time to do eye make.</li>
            <li> Product works as advertised, but I found that the Younique product works a little better.  </li>
            <li> works great and the price is right compared to others that are so expensive!</li>
            <li> but this mascara doesnt weigh them down!:)</li>
            <li> I could really feel my old mascara like crunch up and stick</li>
            <li> You HAVE to have a clean and dry mascara brush to eliminate the &#x27;clumping&#x27; effect.</li>
            <li> I had advanced ovarian cancer and took 16 months of chemo, which has caused my hair to barely grow throughout my entire body.</li>
            <li> I get full, long eyelashes.</li>
            <li> But i think it looks a bit messy when i Try to apply more layers.</li>
            <li> Makes lashes full and long</li>
            <li> I also hear that Younique Mood Fiberlashes has had similar success and will probably try that</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that is normal with fiber lash but not planning on using anymore.</li>
            <li> i have never seen my eye lashes so long and full</li>
            <li> I will never ever wear normal mascara again.</li>
            <li> apply your normal mascara.</li>
            <li> so I add a few drops of saline solution (for contacts) and find it works much better.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my lashes as long and full as i wanted and the fibers get in my eyes throughout the day</li>
            <li> But they did make my lashes look full and long, as good as if I was wearing false lashes.</li>
            <li> And doesn&#x27;t last very long my Loreal mascara works better than this.</li>
            <li> Never had tried to do something with my lashes like this product before but after the initial try it was easy and simple.</li>
            <li> Here is a picture of my eyes, on the right side I have no mascara at all, on the left side I&#x27;m wearing the 3D Fiber Lash Mascara, and I took a picture of just one eye done so you guys cans see the difference.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not fun, but it happens and is easily taken care of).</li>
            <li> You‚Äôre lashes look super long today‚Äù.</li>
            <li> My lashes are long but straight and thin, this product works great to make my eyes pop.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are lengthened and a little thicker but so much more natural looking.</li>
            <li> It lifts your lashes to new heights.  </li>
            <li> I live the length I can build.</li>
            <li> I find it feels like it gets in my eyes, but I&#x27;m new to the product</li>
            <li> I see why my friends like it as a few of them have very sparse lashes, so it helps them, but I don&#x27;t see a huge difference for myself.</li>
            <li> I may not be putting enough layers on, because I don&#x27;t really notice much of a difference with my lashes.</li>
            <li> I recommend watching several of the available youtube videos on how to apply (just search for Moodstruck and several</li>
            <li> So many fibers fall off during application; and since mascara is the last step in applying eye make up you have to carefully remove the fibers without ruining your shadow or liner.</li>
            <li> They go on thick and actually look good, HOWEVER, if you are in the heat or warmer weather (at an event) and begin to perspire a bit.....</li>
            <li> but I have contacts and very sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> I have very short, very straight eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got very little eye lashes and this product has changed that I love it</li>
            <li> It is very simple to use &amp; left my lashes looking longer and much fuller, but not fake!</li>
            <li> Exactly the same as the home party brand that every one else uses.  </li>
            <li> , I do not usually take the time to write this lengthy (yes, I do consider this lengthy) a review.</li>
            <li> You put your regular mascara on first, then you &amp;#34;sweep&amp;#34; on the fibers from one of the tubes with the mascara type wand inside.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to use your mascara first and last!</li>
            <li> I even recommended it to my friend and she had the same issue for the first couple of weeks but now loves it too.</li>
            <li> Just received my 2nd supply after 4 months of using the first.</li>
            <li> I have used many mascaras in the past but this takes the cake.</li>
            <li> Thank you, this 65 year old lady has eye lashes again!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> So, I then tried what another reviewer said and start the first coat with your regular mascara, fibers and then the gel provided.</li>
            <li> toss your regular mascara, you apply one coat of it as the first step in using this</li>
            <li> Since you have to use regular mascara first before applying, I might have to find one that thickens when I use this</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a lot of fun, and my eye lashes were long.  </li>
            <li> Never thought my scanty lashes can be made to look naturally fuller!</li>
            <li> There were barely any fibers on it and the ones that were was very clumped.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright, don&#x27;t get near moisture!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I was a skeptic at first especially since it was on amazon</li>
            <li> One day I&#x27;m going to have to try all 3 steps and see how really lush my lashes get!</li>
            <li> Then, they &amp;#34;discount&amp;#34; the $29 price, but charge shipping of $6, which is the same exact price Younique sells for.  </li>
            <li> This gives the exact same effect without any hassles.</li>
            <li> Definitely improvement in lashes - more than any other product I&#x27;ve tried, and</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> One review says to use it properly, the gel tube should be put in hot water.</li>
            <li> Works exactly the same and bonus points that it&#x27;s 15 dollars cheaper and has 2-day shipping!</li>
            <li> open the fibers tube and then grab the transplanting gel from hot water</li>
            <li> It is the natural fibers!</li>
            <li> But so far I like it!</li>
            <li> And Wow!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the small tube - just the big one, and love it all by itself!</li>
            <li> The transplanting gel dries out fairly quick when you use it frequently, but I have resolved this by placing 1-2 drops of eye lubricant into the container once it starts to dry up.</li>
            <li> This removes easily with soapy facial cleanser and water provided you&#x27;re not using a waterproof mascara to seal the whole deal down.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use daily but extra oomph for special occasion</li>
            <li> When I first got this product it worked fantastic, the only downside is, it does not last long at all!  </li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because the process is a bit tedious and takes longer than I&#x27;m used to, but the results are pretty amazing</li>
            <li> ; portion just seems like regular mascara and not nearly as thick as younique therefore it didn&#x27;t have as much holding power of the fibers.</li>
            <li> It might sound like a long procedure but it only takes a minute.</li>
            <li> Great over your mascara lashes makes them long as false eyelashes</li>
            <li> I got my product earlier than expected and received a few follow up emails about how best you use the product, how to apply and other tips.    </li>
            <li> I could not get it to stop clumping and made a huge mess of my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> Not only are they pretty much 99% the same, when compared side by side you can&#x27;t tell the difference in packaging, design and the product.</li>
            <li> Overall good product and does make your lashes look big and fluffy!</li>
            <li> Kind of sucks!</li>
            <li> You also need to take care to apply the fibers only to the top half of your lashes.  </li>
            <li> I have super short blonde eyelashes</li>
            <li> After trying 300X Fiber Lashes, I will not go back to the more expensive product, that is no better than 300X.  Great product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump any more than any other mascara and doesn&#x27;t take long to apply.</li>
            <li> I have been using them more than I even anticipated since they are so easy to use and make such a difference in my thin eyelashes!</li>
            <li> its alright, just pretty much like any other mascara.</li>
            <li> I have blonde, very sparce lashes, wow I had visible lashes!</li>
            <li> I just wish it was a little cheaper so that I could use it every day for fabulous lashes.</li>
            <li> My wife used this and said while it works as well as the original Younique brand, it doesn&#x27;t last anywhere near as long</li>
            <li> I actually look like I have beautiful long thick  eyelashes!</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes a lot fuller the only issue I had was the fibers falling but after understanding the product a little more I no longer have that problem.</li>
            <li> My lashes have started to thin and this product is amazing at making my lashes fuller and longer.  </li>
            <li> You could improve your info by making that clear.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and received much sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, irritate easier and wear contacts.  </li>
            <li> It does extend your lashes, but it takes forever to get the fibers to attach to your lashes in a way that looks natural.</li>
            <li> I would appreciate any tips, because trying to put on mascara for 10 minutes is a bit much to do on the regular.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this.  </li>
            <li> I feel Younique far surpasses the rest.</li>
            <li> (but she has some natural curl to her lashes.</li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed with this product, especially after paying 26 dollars for it.</li>
            <li> I even used it on my 8 year old daughter for pictures.</li>
            <li> The fibers frequently fall in your eyes.</li>
            <li> I tried it a second time another day, and still it came out very spidery and clumped together.</li>
            <li> yet they still looked natural not clumpy.</li>
            <li> I was torn between 3 or 4 stars because overall I do really like the way this mascara looks...</li>
            <li> Almost need to comb it thru to create a natural look.  </li>
            <li> It would add the finishing touch to the product for a complete finish.</li>
            <li> I also typically only wear on nights out or weekends because I feel it&#x27;s a bit too much eyelash for a work day.  </li>
            <li> I went from indistinct lashes to lush lashes.</li>
            <li> Does thicken but clumps and the fibers go on in wild directions.  </li>
            <li> Having blonde eyelashes, this product really helps my eyes to &#x27;POP&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> literally hurt so much that I had to shut my eyes and have my husband help me to bathroom seeing as I couldn&#x27;t even OPEN MY EYES.</li>
            <li> I am so surprised on how they advertise it works so well.</li>
            <li> and I also have sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> It was unexpected, and I wouldn&#x27;t have worn this product</li>
            <li> and I end up having to take off the mascara completely, after picking out 400 fibers from my eyeballs.</li>
            <li> It is a four step process that takes all of maybe a min to complete if that.</li>
            <li> Much easier for me than gluing them on which I can never do properly.</li>
            <li> So you need to keep checking the mirror frequently.</li>
            <li> My eyes are too sensitive for lash extensions with glue</li>
            <li> Bought some for my 18 yr old dtr for Christmas...</li>
            <li> (It looks like a soft Felt)</li>
            <li> This is going straight back to the factory it came from</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe they were foolish enough to send me a product that isn&#x27;t even completely whole.</li>
            <li> And so much faster than putting on multiple coats of mascara.  </li>
            <li> and I appreciated this extra bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> especially if you try to do another coat of the 3D, if you do they go completely straight.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes and does not irritate my eyes at all.</li>
            <li> I like to look natural</li>
            <li> so if you&#x27;re going for an all natural look,  this product may not be for you.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s the only con I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> and even though I have sensitive eyes, these do not bother me at all.</li>
            <li> I have pretty long eyelashes</li>
            <li> I did like my natural lashes before his</li>
            <li> How do I complete a return?</li>
            <li> but I personally found all the information on the product page, instructions and the additional instructions I received via E-Mail to overcomplicate the whole process.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really makes a noticable difference as compared to regular mascara.</li>
            <li> I was ready to send it back.</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time today and let me tell you, combining this with the Fuchsia deluxe eyelash curler AND grandelash MD eyelash enhancer has just made me think about tossing my falsies...which is HUGE because I&#x27;m OBSESSED with falsies and used them everyday!</li>
            <li> I like it to look natural and just apply 1-2</li>
            <li> I was really hesitant and waited until I had a lot of time to try it and now, it&#x27;s part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see the difference from using 3D fiber kash mascara then from my regular mascara.</li>
            <li> It arrived early.</li>
            <li> Even though I think it is expensive, honestly love it and think is worth it.</li>
            <li> I have applied this a few times hoping they would get better if I applied it differently</li>
            <li> Apply dry synthetic lashes with dry flat brush - this can be rather difficult at first and lashes may look lumpy, but I have found practice makes perfect.</li>
            <li> The first time I applied it as directed and my lashes looked super clumpy and within two hours I had tons of tiny dried flakes under my eyes, which wouldn&#x27;t come off.  </li>
            <li> Applying it of course is simple and comes with specific directions,  although I found that I needed to apply it for about a week to get it right.</li>
            <li> left side has regular mascara and the right has 3d lashes (not that that needed explaining</li>
            <li> Love love 3d fiber lash mascara 300x, I will never go back to fake lashes again!</li>
            <li> wish the fiber brush had a better filter, and thicker comb because I feel that the application would adhere better, waste less fibers, and be less clumpy</li>
            <li> Makes my eyelashes look very long and pretty.</li>
            <li> I think it is a fairly natural look also, at least more natural than extensions, because no one has really commented on my really long lashes.</li>
            <li> theres small little pieces of... lint essentially that you&#x27;re gluing onto your lashes lolol.</li>
            <li> Very easy to remove and so far, I have not experienced smudging or flaking from this brand.</li>
            <li> It is a great alternative to false lashes!!</li>
            <li> I have very short, very straight Asian eyelashes and this type of product</li>
            <li> My lashes are not very dark and this give my lashes a full and dark look.  </li>
            <li> I am allergic to most mascaras, there are only a few I can wear!  </li>
            <li> I used to spend so much money having eyelash extensions applied, just to have them grow out and look funny for a few days before they could be removed and reapplied.</li>
            <li> unfortunately age makes them not so pretty and much more space.  </li>
            <li> I did see small flakes on my eyelids and cheeks, but i&#x27;m sure those are there because I didn&#x27;t apply enough gel to seal the lash.  </li>
            <li> will then put the lid back on gel and place back into hot water, let my lashes set approx.</li>
            <li> It certainly does make a difference if you do not have naturally long lashes.  </li>
            <li> Will use no other product but this!</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday and it washes off easy with facial cloths.</li>
            <li> It was at least $10 less than what I paid for the Younique fiber stuff and just as good.  </li>
            <li> This is essential because you apply the gel then quickly apply the fibers while the gel is still wet, wait about 20 seconds for the fibers to set then apply the gel again to seal in the fibers.</li>
            <li> It‚Äôs a long story ‚Äì Very smitten with it.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I got frustrated to figure out how to get beautiful lashes and no flakiness.</li>
            <li> One looks like regular Mascara, and I just applied that normally, and then I used the Fiber Brush</li>
            <li> ‚Ä¶ Also it‚Äôs a little cheaper on Amazon, I think my friend spent about $12 more buying from someone</li>
            <li> My friends are always looking to find a local sales person to buy it from and act like they just can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> It really makes my lashes look very very long.  </li>
            <li> : In the evening, gently PAT your lashes dry with water.</li>
            <li> The only downfall of this product is that it takes much longer to apply than regular mascara and once on</li>
            <li> I attached 3 photos to show, one with nothing, one with my regular lash extension mascara, and the other with this applied for the very first time.</li>
            <li> The whole process is very simple and only takes a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> Not as amazing as I expected - it lengthens a little but not a considerable amount.  </li>
            <li> Right down to the case that they come in.  </li>
            <li> Would NOT recommend this mascara, ESPECIALLY if you have sensitive eyes!</li>
            <li> Just seemed a little messy and then kept reapplying only to never see that much of a difference from my favorite Lorel Telescopic Mascara.</li>
            <li> Other than that it does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> I posted two photos, the first darker one is the product and the other</li>
            <li> I have no other makeup on in the photos.  </li>
            <li> and they last through my evening face wash, but not past the morning shower.</li>
            <li> I put my regular mascara on first, let it dry, then use the fiber lash.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are very light and thin</li>
            <li> Only downside the gel dried very quickly and it took multiple applications to get the desire look.</li>
            <li> Other than that I love this product and still wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> but as I grew older, they were not as long as they were when I was in my twentiesand</li>
            <li> The home sole brings out my blonde lashes more, but is a little more expensive.  </li>
            <li> My eye lashes are naturally pretty long and thick, so I will probably only use this for special occasions bc</li>
            <li> I made the mistake once of applying it to my whole lash (was just on auto pilot and forgot), and all day long fibers were falling into my eyes, causing massive irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have naturally straight but long eyelashes which can be such a pain tocurl and get to stay</li>
            <li> As it is, I can barely make out the writing below the &amp;#34;300x.&amp;#34;  Since you&#x27;re going back and forth between tubes, it would be easier if it&#x27;s clearly labeled.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work well on me which I attribute to my type of lashes - they aren&#x27;t curly but more straight, almost like Asian lashes can be, do not hold a curl with an eyelash curler, and</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not careful it will get clumpy.</li>
            <li> I was a bit surprised to find out that you use it along with regular mascara.</li>
            <li> Look natural, almost if I didn&#x27;t wear make up, only thing is you need patience.</li>
            <li> I only used it twice so far</li>
            <li> I barely saw a difference for when I apply two kinds of mascara.</li>
            <li> The fibers are soft, but if you do not apply enough gel they will fall on your cheek or in your eye.</li>
            <li> And it really doesn&#x27;t take much longer to apply then putting on a few extra coats of mascara.</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised by the results (initially).</li>
            <li> I really do not have much lashes and this adds volume, length and glamour to my eyes which I am not use to.</li>
            <li> I decided to try it again and follow the directions completely and only one eye at a time.</li>
            <li> Some of the lashes have fallen out but that&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t put enough of the wet stuff on first.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of silly.</li>
            <li> Get compliments everyday definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> the feel, better than false eye lashes.</li>
            <li> Do keep in mind, my lashes are on the short stubby side (at least my right eye is), but isn&#x27;t this supposed to work on all lengths, especially short lashes (otherwise why would i need this product?&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more expensive, but it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty black.</li>
            <li> It is no harder to apply than any other type of mascara and I will absolutely recommend it to all my &amp;#34;lashless&amp;#34; friends, and will order again.</li>
            <li> It really does work vs all the other mascara i have tried out there.</li>
            <li> Also, removal is so much easier than other mascaras.</li>
            <li> ) take a small cup and put very hot water in it.</li>
            <li> By loose I mean as many that get on my lashes fall on my face.</li>
            <li> At first I was disappointed because I thought it looked too clumpy, but once you get used to it and watch some videos online about how to use it, it has amazing results.</li>
            <li> I use when I want a more dramatic evening look.</li>
            <li> but with the dramatic change in my eyes now I have been :)</li>
            <li> To make this work for me and the look I wanted, I applied 2 coats and my lashes were thicker and looked more dramatic.  </li>
            <li> it would have an even more dramatic look....</li>
            <li> This will go along way with making your lashes look more dramatic.  </li>
            <li> Noticeable difference on my lashes makes my makeup look more dramatic.</li>
            <li> My eye lashes are already long, just not thick enough.  </li>
            <li> The black fibers really thicken the width of the lashes and the wet gel really lengthens them.</li>
            <li> I felt compelled to exchange the same professional courtesy back to the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will never go back to the old traditional mascara.</li>
            <li> Many of the fiber lash mascaras seem to shed and hit my eyes, irritating them and making them red.</li>
            <li> Also I suggest going one eye at a time so that the gloss does not dry up before you put the fibers on.</li>
            <li> Little tricky to use at first, until you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> No more multiple applications of the regular stuff, long, beautiful, thick eye popping lashes in one and done!</li>
            <li> It seemed like after about three weeks of use, it became super clumpy and not able to disburse enough product for the lash fibers to adhere to.</li>
            <li> It gives you full long lashes without ask the trouble of false lashes and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> I have fairly long lashes, but like them full (not spidery) and lush, I am also always running late.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whilst applying standard mascara is generally a 1 step process involving just adding liquid to your eyelashes via a brush</li>
            <li> Really long and lush.</li>
            <li> The wand barely scraped fibers off prior to coming out tube</li>
            <li> There was no real difference in my normal mascara and the fiber mascara.</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t too late I would return for a full refund.  </li>
            <li> The application process takes a while ladies, so don&#x27;t rush yourself for the first few applications, or you will end up looking clumped.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the first came and was unusable as one of the items had completely dried out.  </li>
            <li> Instructions included say to use your regular mascara, let that dry, then apply the Mascara and quickly apply the fibers, then apply the Mascara again, this is where your clean dry mascara wand comes in, I usually blow upwards as I am un-clumping and keeping the weight of all the product from pulling my eyelashes down.</li>
            <li> But it is hard to apply, since the gel tends to dry up pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I have not had it flake off..or irritate my eyes..or any clumping that can&#x27;t be fixed with a dry mascara brush.</li>
            <li> It looked okay... not a huge difference from my usual mascara.</li>
            <li> You really get what u pay for...... a mess.</li>
            <li> After getting lash extensions my real lashes were a mess.</li>
            <li> Gel was very runny and did not work properly, the fibers would not attach to the gel so more of them ended up on my eyeball, which is very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how you can possibly put this on without some landing in your eye, but if you manage to do so (it really stings btw), the &amp;#34;fiber/dust&amp;#34; will flake off throughout the day leaving a dusting of black under your eyes that will smudge when you try to remove it leaving you with a raccoon like effect.</li>
            <li> Although it does make your lashes look bigger and is easy to put on, it cannot replace false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t live up to the endless IG posts  I reviewed and the fibers got in my eyes.</li>
            <li> good product ..maybe a little expensive</li>
            <li> I guess if you have thin eye lashes it will help out a lot, but I didn&#x27;t see a huge length difference.</li>
            <li> , I do not think it is too hard to apply but it is not easy, just takes time with this type of product but definitely gives much more lashes.</li>
            <li> You need to apply regular mascara FIRST, then one layer of the wet mascara, a layer of dry fiber, then another wet layer...</li>
            <li> No need to use your mascara before applying 3D Fiber Lash unless you are going for super thick or long lashes.</li>
            <li> I like it about as much as I live the Loreal product with the white mascara on one end to extend and the black to cover...</li>
            <li> The look does not match the advertisement it looks ok but not as dramatic as I expected</li>
            <li> I wore it and my friend ‚Äì who is more crazy than I am and has a strange fixation with the fact that I have young looking eyes, so</li>
            <li> This product is a rip-off of the original Younique 3D Fiber Lashes.</li>
            <li> They look so full and thick when I&#x27;m done!</li>
            <li> Next time I am going out in the evening, I am going to try for an even more dramatic look!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tricky, but it&#x27;s worth it once you&#x27;ve got it down.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, no more hastle of applying and wearing false lashes for this girl anymore,  I will be using 3D mascara always.</li>
            <li> I like to build on the fibers by going through the process several times for each eye to have extra long</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t need regular mascara and if you re-apply with several coats you can make eyelashes look rediculously long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent product, but don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I got it back into the tube but was real messy and lost a liot of the first coat tube.</li>
            <li> I start off by applying a little bit of my normal mascara, just for color.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are very thin, this product makes it look like I have eyelashes, not hard to use, just remember to clean off every night or the fibers start to clump and fall, this is to be expected if not removed regularly</li>
            <li> I ultimately returned the product because it was causing eye irritation from the dry tiny flakes that got into my eyes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to purchase some for a long time and now that it&#x27;s finally here</li>
            <li> I use do have long eye lashes until my friend poured gas into a fire and it came back at me,</li>
            <li> Yes it would stay on all day, but It only made my eyelashes look long for about two weeks</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last all day and flakes is long pieces.  </li>
            <li> But even if they do it&#x27;s no biggie to get them out and only a minor irritation.</li>
            <li> The Loreal product sometimes requires a minor touchup to the tips as the goop that extends them is white and once in awhile it wears off the tips.</li>
            <li> Your lashes not only look long but thicker.&lt;br /&gt;Buy</li>
            <li> Looks similar to name brand, although I can&#x27;t get as long of lashes as pictures show.  </li>
            <li> I always wondered how celebrities (Kim Kardashian, etc.) had such long eyelashes.</li>
            <li> instant long lashes.  </li>
            <li> I have short eyelashes, and I have yet to find a mascara that makes my lashes stay and appear large and thick.</li>
            <li> I have really short lashes and with 3 coats my lashes are long!</li>
            <li> It did not last very long at all</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are straight/not very long so this actually works to make them fuller and longer.</li>
            <li> I have been on a quest to find eye makeup that won&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes half way through the day.  </li>
            <li> This product really does make your eye lashes appear longer, only complaint is that it flakes immediately after use</li>
            <li> so the gel doesn‚Äôt dry prior to applying the fibers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I even used my dry wand to remove clumps and my eye lashes were still left stuck together.</li>
            <li> Dont get the dry fibers in your your eyes or your eyes will turn red.</li>
            <li> Apply regular masacara and let dry fully,  2.</li>
            <li> One thing I would suggest is to make the dry wand a different color.</li>
            <li> I have dry eye disease and must use prescription medication daily.  </li>
            <li> The real key to not having the fibers fall onto your face (or anywhere else) is to not let the transplanting gel dry.  </li>
            <li> I curled my lashes, applied my regular mascara and let it dry.</li>
            <li> Apply wet application to lashes, which is similar to applying regular mascara, 3.</li>
            <li> I love the length I achieve,  but the few things listed can get frustrating.  </li>
            <li> It is super irritating.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all natural green tea fibers and healthier for long lasting eye lashes.</li>
            <li> I am curious to see how long these tubes last with daily application?  </li>
            <li> I actually think they look better than my fake eyelashes!</li>
            <li> I have tried other Fiber Lash Mascara, all more expensive than this brand.</li>
            <li> I tried it once without that step and was seriously unimpressed; it didn&#x27;t last as long and was really flaky all day.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that I have issue with is that the &#x27;fiber&#x27; particles in the second tube will fall off as the day goes on, creating dark spots of fiber under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Not natural at all.</li>
            <li> People complemented me on how long my lashes were when I was wearing it.</li>
            <li> Both brands need to be de-clumped with a pin, but overall it stays put with minimal flaking as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are naturally long but this mascara makes them longer</li>
            <li> my eyelashes have never been so long...</li>
            <li> I like the product a lot and like the long lashes it gives me.</li>
            <li> so you end up have 5 long fat lashes.</li>
            <li> Stays on all day long.</li>
            <li> The packaging was not professional.</li>
            <li> Too long of a process and lashes fall out on eye and smuge&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have long eyelashes.</li>
            <li> BONNIE STRANGE</li>
            <li> You can make your eyelash as long as you want with the fibers.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are so long and fuller when I use the 3D Fiber Lash Mascara.  </li>
            <li> I have had several eye surgeries and have to be careful what I use.  </li>
            <li> WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW LONG IT WILL LAST.WHEN</li>
            <li> Complete waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Wish u had bought it long ago.</li>
            <li> I have long lashes anyway</li>
            <li> I should have spent the extra $8 and stuck with it&#x27;s competitor&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s because my lashes are already long.  </li>
            <li> and I plan on using them for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have naturally long eyelashes.</li>
            <li> how abnormally long my lashes look is when I&#x27;d change my 3 star rating into 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have naturally long lashes</li>
            <li> but if long lashes is something that you struggle with like myself you won&#x27;t regret trying this stuff.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this it is not made with natural green tea fibers and go to Younique and buy 3D fiber mascara</li>
            <li> Then, it flaked all day long.</li>
            <li> Everyone always asks me how I get my lashes so long</li>
            <li> do extend lashes long but these stink</li>
            <li> I feel my eyelash long.</li>
            <li> my lashes looked so long after using this product.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve found that sticking the tube in a cup of hot water for about a min warms it up enough to thin it out and make it easier to apply.  </li>
            <li> I really like the way they make my lashes look so long and thick, and have never found a product that worked so well.</li>
            <li> I would prefer my regular mascara over the 3D mascara simply because my mascara holds my curl and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Will use this when I want more dramatic eyes, but will still use the fake lashes for large stage productions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Younique brand and love it but was looking for a less expensive alternative.  </li>
            <li> After several attempts, I tried using a pin to remove the clumps and separate my lashes, still within a couple of hours I had tons of tiny black flakes under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> In my pictures below one is posted this the mascara on both eyes and the other shows the difference between my old mascara (on one eye) and fiberlash on the other!</li>
            <li> The fibers constantly got into my eyes and caused extreme burning.</li>
            <li> Also, it has a strange odor!  </li>
            <li> Long and voluminous!</li>
            <li> I will never go back to any other brand.</li>
            <li> Next you add a coat of the mascara-like coating in the other tube.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think I will purchase this or any other similar item.</li>
            <li> It was delivered earlier than expected too!</li>
            <li> I think it looks extremely clumpy - and that is with only one coat.</li>
            <li> The only possible complaint I would have is that the lashes sometimes fall in my eye while I&#x27;m putting them on, but that&#x27;s barely an issue for me because I have no issues getting them out-</li>
            <li> Just one coat and look how long they look!</li>
            <li> I put regular mascara on one eye and used the 3D on the other.</li>
            <li> they are insanely long when I use this!</li>
            <li> because it looked like long eyelashes were falling out!</li>
            <li> My thin short eyelashes went from boring and unnoticeable to bold and eye catching!</li>
            <li> it is very minor-</li>
            <li> The gel mascara was too dry to even try putting the fibers on afterwards.</li>
            <li> I really like the subtle extension look.</li>
            <li> The fibers go on dry and this cause them to fall off the brush, getting into the eyes.  </li>
            <li> Also while applying the dry fibers, they fall on your foundation.</li>
            <li> Crazy fast shipping, very helpful instructions.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work was really dry and the fibers got in my eyes.  </li>
            <li> While those dry</li>
            <li> I have gone back to using my regular mascara and feel I have wasted my money on this product.</li>
            <li> cannot believe how full and long it makes my naturally thin and blond lashes!</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t bother me in the least and is WAY better than false lashes.  </li>
            <li> This product does not live up to it&#x27;s advertising.</li>
            <li> This mascara did not live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying it is not good, but I really did not like it.</li>
            <li> Simply put, definitely not worth the price of three drugstore mascaras.</li>
            <li> It is NOT safe, buy direct from a Younique presenter, please...</li>
            <li> Ive tried all kinds of brands and very expensive mascaras but have seen the most results from this brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never give my secret away to those who know me;)</li>
            <li> I have never once tried using false eye lashes before, but have always thought they looked so pretty when I&#x27;ve seen people wear them.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and lashes have never looked this thick and long...definitely would buy again!!!</li>
            <li> Really loose.</li>
            <li> I was worried about getting loose fibers in my eyes or all over my face</li>
            <li> Big fat thumbs down.</li>
            <li> but when I use this stuff people always compliment how long my eyes lashes look!!</li>
            <li> Did mascara only on one eye, added the 3x on the other in my picture!</li>
            <li> Sends pricy, but this product lasts a very long time!</li>
            <li> AND IT WAS ALREADY DRY!</li>
            <li> When do you comb your eyelashes when everything is dry or when it still wet.</li>
            <li> -- Lash Factory is the same thing but about $15 less.</li>
            <li> However application and occasionally throughout the day,  the fibers flake off leaving black underneath eyes.  </li>
            <li> You put on regular mascara, then a coat of the gel (black like mascara)</li>
            <li> I just use one coat of mascara, a coat of the get, a coat of fibers, and a last coat of gel, no more time consuming than putting on multiple coats of just mascara</li>
            <li> I can not stand something in my eye, and other the other product I tried had tiny fibers that would end up in my eyes just trying to put it on.  </li>
            <li> Was a bit skeptical at first when I ordered, but now that I&#x27;ve been using it religiously I&#x27;m hooked.  </li>
            <li> FINALLY  found something that makes me appear to have fuller lashes and wear less eye liner.</li>
            <li> does not make lashes as long as other brands</li>
            <li> I forgot the 2nd gel and my eyes were flaked, and a mess.</li>
            <li> Apply the wet coat, then the dry fiber coat, then the wet coat to seal again.</li>
            <li> Might be fine in cold weather....</li>
            <li> But it sheds little tiny hairs in my eyes all day.</li>
            <li> The problem is later in the day if I touch my lashes, even accidently by removing my contacts, the little fibers fall into my eye and cause a lot of irritation.</li>
            <li> My actual lashes are just a little longer than 1/8 inch.</li>
            <li> They do make your eyes bigger but not significantly</li>
            <li> Maybe it worked for the people on YouTube , but even after carefully following directions and applying several coats it looked no more extreme than if I added a few coats of my regular mascara.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to get completely off, and my make up remover is in a moist pad form, I recommend using a lotion/cream based eye make up remover</li>
            <li> This mascara was a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> Not what was expected.</li>
            <li> Did not work like I expected.</li>
            <li> Once I got all the tiny fibers out of my eyes and off my cheeks, I didn&#x27;t have any trouble for about 5 hours.  </li>
            <li> Dissatisfied, not what I expected</li>
            <li> Pressing into the wet application works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Plus, this didn&#x27;t do what I expected.  </li>
            <li> The fibers was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clump unless the brush dries out than it&#x27;s harder to apply.  </li>
            <li> put the wet gel on and then the powder, then gel again, so it doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
            <li> so it is to be expected )</li>
            <li> I used a eyebrow comb to help separate the lashes while they were still wet</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> Got here sooner than expected</li>
            <li> Careful.  </li>
            <li> But not what I expected and a bit clumpy.</li>
            <li> and I spent days trying to get them all out.</li>
            <li> Both of us returned after trying it for over a week and would highly NOT recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> While the product worked well, after a few hours my eyes became extremely red and irritated.</li>
            <li> The mascara was as I had expected it.</li>
            <li> but this gave me lush, dark, thick, long lashes.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> The bottle that didn&#x27;t have mascara in it was empty</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t informed I had to wet the brush for the mascara to work.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look as long as the advertisement, but my eyelashes are way shorter than average.  </li>
            <li> However, I only use it when I&#x27;m going out because it&#x27;s not very practical for everyday.</li>
            <li> but this made them wow and thick.</li>
            <li> It makes your natural lashes thick and beautiful..worth every cent.</li>
            <li> I did use it in conjunction with the the false eyelashes and that worked out very well.  </li>
            <li> (I am a contact lens wearer) and it is a long process to apply it the proper way, which is bad if I&#x27;m trying to get out the door quick.</li>
            <li> My eye lashes look bold and dramatic!</li>
            <li> But, if you follow their instructions to apply it on the upper half of the eyelashes there is no problem!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to especially slow down when working with the fibers, because they can get loose and into your eye.</li>
            <li> The only down side (minimal) is that it smudges a little under my eyes during the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using less of my regular mascara, or more, every time my lashes look clumpy thick and overall bad.</li>
            <li> I reordered thinking I just got a bad one, and on receiving the second order, had the exact same experience.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard on your lashes and makes them look so thick!</li>
            <li> I have short lashes, this product made them thick and long looking.</li>
            <li> As you get older your lashes thin out.  </li>
            <li> A little of the fibers goes a long way and it stays put all day.</li>
            <li> It has taken over the beauty world and given an entire new twist to mascara and fake lashes (</li>
            <li> #34;one came and it was dried out&amp;#34; even in the picture it says one is wet and the other is DRY s</li>
            <li> I have used bought it three times already and for the price it does not even compare to the other name brand fiber lashes.</li>
            <li> Lashes plus other brands.</li>
            <li> Also, it does need to be applied once a day due to coming off when sleeping.</li>
            <li> The other mascaras would flake off, smudge, and just not give me the intensity I was looking for.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s due to this mascara.  </li>
            <li> None other compares</li>
            <li> The product is extremely flakey and within an hour</li>
            <li> BUT when I applied the mascara over the gel, the mascara brush left little fibers (that look like little eyelashes)</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d love to have eye lashes like everyone else :(</li>
            <li> I will now not use any other mascara.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> I have only used this product a few times, but I like it a lot!</li>
            <li> It makes my small eyelashes big which I like!</li>
            <li> I do the other eye.  </li>
            <li> As suggested by other users, apply 1 coat of your mascara  </li>
            <li> When it started to dry up this year, I looked on Amazon for something comparable but a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> The down side is even being extremely careful you can end up with clumpy lashes or that &amp;#34;spider leg&amp;#34; looking eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am extremely dissatisfied with the product as I expected it to be comparable to another lash product I had used previously.  </li>
            <li> It is an imitation.</li>
            <li> Secondly, put one base coat of your regular mascara on first.  </li>
            <li> So far, I am finding it very hard to use without clumping.</li>
            <li> It is not a problem with this brand it is the same with the other one--you just can&#x27;t do &amp;#34;second day&amp;#34; with them--my lashes looked thick and goopy</li>
            <li> I took one star off because it seems to clump a little, so I have to be careful during application to prevent weirdo spider leg lashes.</li>
            <li> and I found this product to flake less than the other brands.</li>
            <li> I have very blonde eyelashes, and it is hard to even tell that they are there.</li>
            <li> but this brand sucks and when I orignally purchased the item I thought it was the actual Moodstruck 3D Fiber</li>
            <li> really like the fiber lashes , but sometimes the fibers get in my eyes and its a uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> only negative I would say is that they do flake just a bit‚Ä¶but this happens with ALL these type of lashes</li>
            <li> (Not worth the hype).</li>
            <li> does it come in dark brown or brown</li>
            <li> Not worth it at all.</li>
            <li> They have been so much easier than using fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money</li>
            <li> It really works and does not appear fake.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is it come out</li>
            <li> But you need to be real careful with the fibers.  </li>
            <li> I would say this would be more like a base coat type of mascara, which is how I will use it.</li>
            <li> Ever since missing a fiber lash party thrown by a friend of a friend, I&#x27;ve been curious about products like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was born with long thick lashes but as I aged they got shorter.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it a five star because I wanted longer lashes not such thick ones and because of the flakes of fiber....</li>
            <li> Also, I have had to use a regular lash brush as the brushes get way to goopy and clumpy and thick.  </li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t like it that thick</li>
            <li> I put my base mascara on both eyes-top and bottom, then I put the gel on the top lashes of 1 eye and immediatly put on the fibers, then I do the bottom lashes of that eye.  </li>
            <li> So, when I bought this product I expected what all the other reviews claimed:  my actual lashes to look so long that others would expect them to be fake.</li>
            <li> Fibers may fall down on your face.</li>
            <li> I think the Younique brand has it beat hands down.</li>
            <li> in fact, what I dislike about this item is that I feel like the mascara, the gel, and the fibers weigh down my lashes,</li>
            <li> that fell/shed down my face upon applying and throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> It does not weigh my eye lids down with the product and I have put a lot on a couple of times now.  </li>
            <li> This really does improve the thickness of your lashes, I have very thin lashes</li>
            <li> It requires your original mascara as a type of base coat, then several additional coats and clumps VERY easily no matter how carefully you are during application.</li>
            <li> This was a mess and not worth the price even though it was cheaper .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a slight difference, though, which is why I&#x27;m not giving them 1 star, but 3.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way to expensive to only have enough for two weeks...</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes half way through the day.  </li>
            <li> fast,,,,leaving black specks all over my face and burning my eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;$7.00 less than company website.</li>
            <li> Mistake, once opened it looked like my previous product after 2 1/2 months of use.</li>
            <li> I expected it to make my lashes longer... &amp; the fibers get into your eyes a lot its basically the same as any of them just with the irritating fibers</li>
            <li> It does extend eye lash appearance and the black mascara enhances the depth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> apply black flaky stuff that falls off all day.  </li>
            <li> Except the 3 D is less costly.  </li>
            <li> I had no idea that I could purchase this item for much less money.</li>
            <li> it does take a little practice to get the technique down</li>
            <li> Its not worth saving a few dollars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a mess</li>
            <li> I typically only do one coat of this, any more and it looks too heavy and your lashes clump together terribly.</li>
            <li> leaves a lot of little black flakes on your face.</li>
            <li> The little pieces fell off a couple times before I got the gel on and fell in my eye, which didn&#x27;t hurt too bad, so try and move quickly and not blink.</li>
            <li> The little fibers go everywhere, including inside my eye, when trying to stick them to my lashes.</li>
            <li> A little flakey</li>
            <li> It makes my eyes irritate a little when this happens.</li>
            <li> It takes a while to put on and the little fibers get everywhere, including in your eyes when you&#x27;re putting them on your lashes.</li>
            <li> It was a little clumpier than I like, but when I tried to de-clump my lashes the little wads of fibers came off.</li>
            <li> (If a little fiber piece gets in your eye</li>
            <li> Lengthens and thickens however, the little fibers flake off and end up all over my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> May look a little clumpy sometimes.</li>
            <li> Hoping in time I can apply it and make them look a little longer as well.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price!</li>
            <li> I wish it would make my lashes look a little thicker in addition to looking longer.</li>
            <li> It makes them look a little feathery, which might be what you are looking for.</li>
            <li> , it can be a little clumpy.  </li>
            <li> Once you add the fibers it can get a little crumpy</li>
            <li> Seems to help if the liquid tube is warmed up a little.  </li>
            <li> a little clumpy and almost gone after 3-4 uses</li>
            <li> This product did make your lashes seem a little longer</li>
            <li> Doesnt make my lashes longer, maybe a little thicker</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clumpy and little fibers get all over the place.</li>
            <li> a little clumpy</li>
            <li> I also freaked out a little when I took a shower and began cleaning my eyelashes</li>
            <li> Only drawback is that some of the fibers ended up flaking off under my eyes for the first few times--nothing horribly noticable--but I solved it by applying extra gel after I applied the fibers.  </li>
            <li> It looks clumpy and little particles fall in my eye throughout the day as well as under my eyes creating a messy look.</li>
            <li> It did make my lashes look longer, but was a little messy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little messy putting it on</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just that sometimes it&#x27;s gets a little messy.</li>
            <li> I am used to wearing individual lashes (I&#x27;m a little addicted to them).  </li>
            <li> Dried out within a week</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always had short thin lashes</li>
            <li> I just had trouble with it flaking off into my eyes and under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It gives you that fake eyelashes look, but in a natural way.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear it everyday, but on occasion.</li>
            <li> Ugh waste of $30</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> but after a few weeks I got used to it.  </li>
            <li> My product arrived with the fiber tube opened and it was dried out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a dead giveaway that you&#x27;re using fiber lashes.  </li>
            <li> It does appear to flake off a bit and is a tad messy, but then that could be user error.</li>
            <li> what really annoyed me was the entire time I wore it</li>
            <li> The fiber is made from green tea leaves, I believe.</li>
            <li> I do one round of application for work and two for evenings out.</li>
            <li> It took a few days to get the technique for me figured out.</li>
            <li> One of the tubes came in completely dried up.</li>
            <li> This is not genuine Younique product.  </li>
            <li> This is now my everyday go to mascara.</li>
            <li> I use everyday.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money</li>
            <li> The gel mascara is completely  dried out</li>
            <li> I followed instructions and still a waste.</li>
            <li> The tops were off of this product and it was dried out.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all total scam</li>
            <li> One of the tubes was completely dried out.</li>
            <li> I feel like i wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I have to curl them everyday.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the product everyday</li>
            <li> After a few hours it starts to flake off as well</li>
            <li> dont waste your money on these.</li>
            <li> Tends to flake after a few hours</li>
            <li> The product I received was dried out and did not work.  </li>
            <li> I do not have trouble with the fibers flaking or getting into my eyes.  </li>
            <li> it looks really heavy -</li>
            <li> Feel like I&#x27;ve wasted money.</li>
            <li> I totally wasted my money on your product.</li>
            <li> I have short thin lashes.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product  - messy, clumpy.</li>
            <li> I feel like it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> my fault for trying to save a few dollars.</li>
            <li> it can get kinda messy though</li>
            <li> but it is around the same level as false lashes which cost 25-100$.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of product.</li>
            <li> Each day I have black lash fibers on my face and under my eyes every time I look in a mirror!</li>
            <li> I usually wear black brown.</li>
            <li> Other than that I&#x27;m completely obsessed with this product and will never go back to another mascara!</li>
            <li> It really gives you the fake lash look and makes your eyes pop!</li>
            <li> Whenever i wear it i always get compliments and sometimes people even ask if I&#x27;m wearing false lashes i can get them so long!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve had this for a few days now, and overall I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> There is a visible difference in the length and thickness, but I&#x27;m careful  not to cake it on too much because I hate clumps.</li>
            <li> the try might as well just stay buying 6 dollar mascara at your drug store seriously not worth the price at all !!</li>
            <li> Need to be real careful or it will go in your eyes!!.</li>
            <li> I tried this one time and threw it in my waste basket!  </li>
            <li> Having used a similar product before, I was sad to see that this didn&#x27;t compare at all.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You have the same issue with the expensive stuff.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t complicated to use, it takes me all of about 3-5 minutes extra time to apply.</li>
            <li> I didnt put my usual mascara on</li>
            <li> I was not sure it would work</li>
            <li> It is a four star because I am not sure if I like the fiber</li>
            <li> Wear it everyday!</li>
            <li> I am really not pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Can be messy if you don&#x27;t brush lashes out but def gives a noticeable added length!</li>
            <li> (I use a small brush on my lashes to prevent any clumpy appearances.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I tried several attempts to use it and each one failed the fibers fall into your eyes causing tearing and burning threw out the day.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I prefer regular mascara</li>
            <li> I have to say I am not pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> And no, i didnt apply them wrong, all of the sales people that post pictures of their lashes on facebook look the same way.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I like it.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I get some fibers in my eyes but that usually when I over do it.</li>
            <li> I followed all of the instructions to the letter and still getting small flaking of the fibers falling off, and into my eye causing redness and irritation.</li>
            <li> I was ordering from Younique but this works just as well, if not better.</li>
            <li> but i prefer the small thinner fibbers to avoid it looking so chuinky</li>
            <li> I have used Latisse in the past to increase lash growth , but this is an expensive prescription that only irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li> Which I am never able to apply appropriately so I do not wear them).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, My eyelashes are blonde so without mascara, they look non-existent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a klutz with all eye makeup and usually get EVERYTHING in my eye</li>
            <li> She loves the way it give her lashes some extra length because she hates fake lashes.  </li>
            <li> I use 2-3 very thin layers and my lashes actually touch my eyeglasses.</li>
            <li> I have very thin and short eyelashes plus oily skin.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin and short lashes.  </li>
            <li> I seriously have little to no eye lashes</li>
            <li> So I went a little crazy last week and ordered 3 mascaras.</li>
            <li> This was a big disappointment and waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I noticed the negative reviews complained about one tube being dried out.</li>
            <li> Sorry, not worth the eye irritation &amp; messy makeup look.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product did not live up to its hype for me.</li>
            <li> It is clumpy, flaky and hard to apply neatly.</li>
            <li> This mascara is extremely hard to apply without getting clumpy lashes.</li>
            <li> When you has your glasses off it&#x27;s hard to tell which wand is which.</li>
            <li> It at least arrived on time.</li>
            <li> any negative reviews are probably because they aren&#x27;t&#x27; using it correctly.</li>
            <li> Latisse is at least a monthly commitment of $100.00 and has substantial side effects.</li>
            <li> The only disappointment that I have is regarding the mascara itself.</li>
            <li> Once after I started using the fiber lashes, I got home late and did not take it off before I went to bed.  </li>
            <li> This mascara at least triples the length and makes them appear thicker, but they do extend my makeup regimen by about 10 minutes to get them to the length I want.</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look thick.</li>
            <li> Try not to touch your eyelashes throughout the day and apply it slowly so it doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li> It does increase the length and you can make them as thick as you want.</li>
            <li> Not to mention 2 weeks after i took it off, that crap is STILL stuck to my lashes and ruined my real lashes.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes look twice as thick; I highly&lt;br /&gt;recommend</li>
            <li> No more trying to mess with false eyelashes!</li>
            <li> Literally looks like you&#x27;re wearing fake eyelashes, minus all the fumbling with them!</li>
            <li> I for one do not appreciate &amp;#34;spidey lashes&amp;#34; but I mean...</li>
            <li> Burns and hurts like mad, especially with contacts.</li>
            <li> I mean i like it</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this was nothing like the other product that I purchased.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy and stays on all day!!</li>
            <li> Total waste of my money :(</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use fake lashes due to the glue and shaky hands</li>
            <li> No more thin lashes.</li>
            <li> My lashes are so long and thick, they look fake!</li>
            <li> Small, thin layers is what you need.</li>
            <li> Use it every day, no more wrestling with false eyelashes</li>
            <li> Was a little disappointed because it clumped my eyelashes and made them look bulky instead of long.</li>
            <li> It gives you some serious eyelashes</li>
            <li> Less expensive than some I have seen.</li>
            <li> She said she bought it for me because she knows how unhappy I am with my short thin eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Seriously, though.</li>
            <li> This is a mess, the fibers are gonna make me go blind</li>
            <li> Also, the little fibers without fail always get in my eye.</li>
            <li> Overall bad experience with this product and would not reccomend.</li>
            <li> No good.</li>
            <li> The wrong brand with the transplanting gel missing.</li>
            <li> Not a good experience</li>
            <li> The fibers get all over your cheeks and so hard to get off!</li>
            <li> My mac mascara does the same thing I was disappointed</li>
            <li> Horrible, at first I thought I wasn&#x27;t applying it correctly</li>
            <li> You cannot use a curling tool after the Mascara and fibres go on, it will leave a deep mark and you will have to start all over :(&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> P.S. very hard to please.  </li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because the gel is very thick and can cause clumping.  </li>
            <li> Also go very slowly when applying the fiber coat</li>
            <li> The transplanting gel with both brands is very thick.  </li>
            <li> This one did not stay on as well and the fibers were very thick.</li>
            <li> Doesnt show any difference , NOT satisfied !!</li>
            <li> Gotta be the worst 23.99 i have wasted my money on can get the same effect using 2 or 3 coats of mascara</li>
            <li> I do wear contacts, and I haven&#x27;t found it irritating.</li>
            <li> It made my eyelashes look worse.</li>
            <li> I have always had a problem with thin eyelashes</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the worst fiber lash mascara EVER.  </li>
            <li> I have thin and sparse eyelashes</li>
            <li> I usually only wear it out when I&#x27;m spending a night downtown or something, and you should note not to get the fibers to close to the eyeball or base of eyelashes because it tends to irritate the eye.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the fibres falling out, or getting into eyes and irritating them.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I are addicted.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t cause any harm, but was irritating.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have tired both</li>
            <li> Yes I guess but not great and not for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li> I get asked at least 3x per week if I have fake eyelashes</li>
            <li> No need for false eyelashes</li>
            <li> this produce gives you the fullness and length of false lashes, but without the hassle.</li>
            <li> like I have false eyelashes..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never mastered false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I use it sparingly as I do not want to look like I am wearing false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> After a fellow chorus member said she knew of singers who used this instead of wearing false eyelashes, I had to give it a try as I dislike attaching false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> No need to false lash anymore.</li>
            <li> I have never had the patience for glue and false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> If you like the look of false lashes this mascara is for you.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> some think I have on false lashes.</li>
            <li> I was trying to simplify my make-up routine and had been experimenting with just false eyelashes and some attention to my brows in order to streamline the time and effort.</li>
            <li> False eyelashes did not save me any time</li>
            <li> Id rather wear false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t see any signs of false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> so false lashes just aren&#x27;t my thing.</li>
            <li> I no longer think about applying false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I tried wearing false eyelashes, but never had luck putting them on.</li>
            <li> very thin and even thick mascara was not helping.  </li>
            <li> THE SMELL OF THE MASCARA IS ALSO NOT GOOD!</li>
            <li> Besides how it looks, it takes a considerable amount of time to apply and worst of all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found that even when not getting close to the base of my lashes my eyes become extremely irritated</li>
            <li> One tube was dried up:(</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed and out several dollars  Chris Wilhelm</li>
            <li> IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY!!!!</li>
            <li> Will use sparingly, kinda expensive.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m doing It wrong.</li>
            <li> This product is difficult to apply, cakes on the lashes, and then flakes all day.  </li>
            <li> the only thing is I had to use a waterproof mascara withe the fibers because the gel stuff that comes with this is just horrible all around</li>
            <li> No was not impressed at all</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I accidentally purchased this product thinking it was the 3d fiber lash mascara by Younique.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to put game lashes on again!</li>
            <li> Everybody thinks my lashes are fake.</li>
            <li> Don‚Äôt get me wrong</li>
            <li> People often ask now if I&#x27;m wearing fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li> There is some irritation when you take it off with makeup remover later but nothing terrible.</li>
            <li> Too complicated</li>
            <li> someone asked if i had fake lashes on.</li>
            <li> Awful .. gave me watery and red eyes!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t  wear fake lashes.</li>
            <li> and they are difficult to put on even though I&#x27;ve been doing it for years.</li>
            <li> So obsessed.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like the hassle of fake eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> &quot; look that fake eyelashes can give.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, the product itself is just mediocre.  </li>
            <li> I WAS SKEPTICAL, BUT</li>
            <li> Was skeptical about this product</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to buy a mascara that was so pricey.</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all!</li>
            <li> It gave my lashes a fuller look; as if I were wearing fake ones.</li>
            <li> I feel like I look tired when I don&#x27;t have my 3d fiber lash on!</li>
            <li> for a fail proof method:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would say the product fails at lengthening.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to tell them my secret!  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product but purchased it anyway.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if its me doing something wrong or if it just dust off through the day.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this at all.</li>
            <li> IT IS NOT GOOD!!!</li>
            <li> Sorry I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I was asked If I had on false eyelashes!</li>
            <li> The little fibers get all over your lower lids and are impossible to get off!  </li>
            <li> but it does work and no more fake lashes!!</li>
            <li> It was very irritating.</li>
            <li> Clumps terribly and is a long stressful process just getting the mascara on.</li>
            <li> THE DRY MASCARA(short one) IS HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> Sorry this was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Makes me feel like I have fake eyelashes without it looking fake!</li>
            <li> This does not make them look fake or over exaggerated!</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely horrible and is not worth your time, money and effort.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in the poor quality of this product.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t that crazy about it and would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Call me crazy</li>
            <li> And quality just like the expensive ones!</li>
            <li> My sister introduced this to me, and let me say - you need to put this on over your mascara, but once you do, your eyelashes will look like they are fake!</li>
            <li> SO SAD ABOUT THIS!</li>
            <li> Looks just like false lashes, without the hassle of applying falsies!!</li>
            <li> And, they look very fake after applied.</li>
            <li> Very frustrating!</li>
            <li> This stuff is bad it gets in your eyes and is almost impossible to get out</li>
            <li> Flakes bad as you blink</li>
            <li> It looks so bad and clumpy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It took two minutes to read the instructions and execute the application and when I looked in the mirror I was shocked my the length and fullness of my lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Disappointed  with the results of the lash fiber.</li>
            <li> it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed with this product and wish to return it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have lots of gel, but the fibers are basically gone after a week&#x27;s use :(</li>
            <li> I have seen photos of people getting horrible eye irritation from these fake products.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the application.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> IT SMELLS LIKE A CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE. :(</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> Everyone asks if my eyelashes are fake!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Worth purchasing can&#x27;t go wrong!!</li>
            <li> Sorry, but not for me.&lt;br /&gt;Constantly flaking into eyes causing irritation!!</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t hate it either.</li>
            <li> I will rank them, in order, in case</li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> This serves as a base coat and works wonders</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. :(</li>
            <li> My eyes haven&#x27;t burned this badly in years!  </li>
            <li> What I absolutely  hated is the fibers got in my eyes</li>
            <li> Hated it and returned it.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed that I didn&#x27;t even get to try it once.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Even casual days in beach town!!!</li>
            <li> And worst of all, it looked horrible.</li>
            <li> Horrible product, makes your eyes lashes clumpy and all the fiber falls off all over your face.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible.  </li>
            <li> So sick of using glue on my eyes!!!</li>
            <li> Awful stuff, doesn&#x27;t work as promised!</li>

            <li> Worst product ever!!!</li>
            <li> Sticky and terrible to apply before a week was up.</li>
            <li> and it smells awful.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to those who told me it was awful.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this!</li>
            <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t flak at all! I love this product and will definitely be ordering again.</li>
            <li> This does what it said it would do I am iimpressed.  P.S. very hard to please.  No need for false eyelashes</li>
            <li> Will use sparingly, kinda expensive.</li>
            <li> Exactly the same as the home party brand that every one else uses.  Right down to the case that they come in.  The only difference is the name on the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim thinking it would be easier than doing strip lashes. It is not easier and I&#x27;m actually scared to use it again. The little fibers go everywhere, including inside my eye, when trying to stick them to my lashes. And worst of all, it looked horrible. I will stick to strip lashes or regular mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m returning this product it did not work well for me, and I had purchase a second one for a friend and she could not use it either . It bother my eyes.</li>
            <li> I tried this one time and threw it in my waste basket!  The little fibers get all over your lower lids and are impossible to get off!  And, they look very fake after applied. Not natural at all.</li>
            <li> Having used a similar product before, I was sad to see that this didn&#x27;t compare at all.  The &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; product is runny and comes out of the tube all stringy. The &amp;#34;fiber&amp;#34; part of the product flakes off the wand in clumps to my cheeks and the floor. What does land on my eyelashes is clumped into balls.  Spend the extra money and buy the one whose brand name starts with a &amp;#34;Y&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Different - take a bit more time - seems to work ok</li>
            <li> I wore this on one eye and one eye with a similar product that is &amp;#34;home sold&amp;#34;.  The home sole brings out my blonde lashes more, but is a little more expensive.  I have sensitive skin, irritate easier and wear contacts.  This product didn&#x27;t bother me in the least and is WAY better than false lashes.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this product! You have to practice using this product like any fiberlash product ( putting to much of the fibers can make the lashes appear spidery) but once you figure it out it looks great! I would for sure recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> Honestly... it&#x27;s okay. Not crazy about it but I don&#x27;t hate it either. People complemented me on how long my lashes were when I was wearing it. So that was cool. If you&#x27;re unsure of what this is: Theres mascara that has a &amp;#34;primer&amp;#34; thats usually white and then you put the black mascara over on top. Same concept. Only instead of liquid-- theres small little pieces of... lint essentially that you&#x27;re gluing onto your lashes lolol. It&#x27;s kind of silly. But if you want longer looking lashes then the product does the job.</li>
            <li> Wasnt any better than store bought thickening mascara but will work.</li>
            <li> A nice product! You just have to practice a few times to get it to look more natural, but once you learn how it looks great!</li>
            <li> I enjoy wearing 3D Fiber Lash Mascara.  I find it easy to use.  I apply it in the morning and it lasts all day.  I haven&#x27;t had issues with eye irritation.  It makes my lashes look thicker and longer. I recommend it to my &amp;#34;eyelash challenged&amp;#34; friends and family.</li>
            <li> Overall good results, no complaints.</li>
            <li> I love it, the only thing is if you do re-applay the gel , the fibers fell all over you face,,, otherwise.. Im&lt;br /&gt;Happy with it, i will buy it again;)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as it&#x27;s advertised. It does extend your lashes, but it takes forever to get the fibers to attach to your lashes in a way that looks natural. Maybe I&#x27;m doing It wrong. I would appreciate any tips, because trying to put on mascara for 10 minutes is a bit much to do on the regular.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my new 3D mascara! I&#x27;ve been wanting to purchase some for a long time and now that it&#x27;s finally here I&#x27;m impressed. It only took 2 days to get here, too!</li>
            <li> I use do have long eye lashes until my friend poured gas into a fire and it came back at me, all my lashes were pretty much gone. Now they are just simple and short and I&#x27;ve tried everything to serum &amp; using more then 5 mascara at a time. Now my eye lashes look full and volumed. I highly recommend this product. Every girls dream lashes!</li>
            <li> The gel mascara was too dry to even try putting the fibers on afterwards. Very disappointed. :(</li>
            <li> Dried out within a week</li>
            <li> Disappointed  with the results of the lash fiber.</li>
            <li> I really like what this mascara can do in theory; in practice, no so much. It caused severe irritation for me. The fibers constantly got into my eyes and caused extreme burning. I really wanted to like this product but I ended up sending it back for a refund.</li>
            <li> Love it! It works great it makes my lashes so much thicker!</li>
            <li> Worked great for about 2 weeks. Know is kinda gummy. Only had it for not even a month.</li>
            <li> the fibers flack and got in my eyes..i will not be using it anymore</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to apply and the effect is simply amazing.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the more epesive stuff!!!</li>
            <li> The mascara makes your eyes so itchy</li>
            <li> I bought this product in place of a slightly more expensive brand. I have never used the more expensive brand, so I can&#x27;t compare the two products.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to try this because after I applied my first coat of &amp;#34;regular mascara&amp;#34; (Lancome) I could never seem to get a richer, fuller look on my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;In all honesty, I did expect to experience a certain degree of:&lt;br /&gt;Smudging&lt;br /&gt;Flaking&lt;br /&gt;Difficulty removing&lt;br /&gt;Clumping, Clumping, Clumping....(instructions said to use an eyelash brush....I don&#x27;t own one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise...I did not experience any of the above. Clean smooth application and removal. Looks great. No clumping or flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very impressed and happy with this product and I would definitely recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note, I do not usually take the time to write this lengthy (yes, I do consider this lengthy) a review. But....the emails I received after ordering and then again receiving this product, impressed me.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Did you receive your mascara yet? If not let us know&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Are you experiencing any difficulties? If so, let us know so we can assist you&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, when I received the email asking me if I would go to Amazon and rate their product (honestly)....I felt compelled to exchange the same professional courtesy back to the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. . God&#x27;s alternative to getting eyelash extensions put on.</li>
            <li> Quick &amp; perfect quality!</li>
            <li> Works just like the more expensive &amp;#34;3D&amp;#34; mascara.  Both of them have good points, no fake lashes, length, easy to use.  The down side is even being extremely careful you can end up with clumpy lashes or that &amp;#34;spider leg&amp;#34; looking eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have the same issue with the expensive stuff.  I bought both to see what the difference is.  The difference?  The logo, and the packaging, even though they are very similar, the expensive stuff&#x27;s embossing has more texture.  But that is the box, not the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I want more &amp;#34;umph&amp;#34; to my lashes I use it.  I just make sure I have the extra time to be sure it doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li> the eyelashes really look longer than just with mascara.</li>
            <li> Amazing! My lashes never looked so great. I didn&#x27;t have the hassle of putting on and taking off false lashes which is a huge plus. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my wife and she loves it.  Need I say more!</li>
            <li> This is NOT what it is being sold as. This is a knock off of the fiberlash brand that everyone is selling. The  fibers make lashes look fuzzy, not any longer or thicker. I am extremly dissatisfied with this product. Ripoff!!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara - does sometimes clump but with a eyelash brush before and gently after applying fixes that problem.  Makes my eyes beautiful and sexy.</li>
            <li> I like it.  Time consuming to make it unclumpy</li>
            <li> Love it. What a difference it made.</li>
            <li> This was a big disappointment and waste of money for me. This just seemed like gloppy mascara. I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> The fibers don&#x27;t stay on good no matter how much gel I apply. Makes the eyes very irriated. I also ordered a cheaper one and it works better ththan this one. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Even though I think it is expensive, honestly love it and think is worth it. However,  you have to make sure you put some mascara after the fibers,  so they don&#x27;t fall off. I love how easy is to take it off because the mascara doesn&#x27;t take my eyelashes off. I love it!</li>
            <li> Horrible product, makes your eyes lashes clumpy and all the fiber falls off all over your face.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I feel like the fibers fall off during the day.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it is great.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look pretty good. But it sheds little tiny hairs in my eyes all day. And on my cheeks. I&#x27;m always having to check my face to make sure I don&#x27;t have black hairs everywhere.  I guess I&#x27;d rather not have to worry about that kind of stuff all day at work</li>
            <li> Fibers get in your eyes. Creates problems with eyes especially for contact wearers. Not what was expected.</li>
            <li> The mascara really did make my eyelashes full and long but the fibers irritated my eyes all day. It felt like I had sand in the eyes.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I was amazed how this product made my eyelashes look. It isn&#x27;t complicated to use, it takes me all of about 3-5 minutes extra time to apply. I am very happy with this product and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Love my mascara surely makes my short lashes look longer!</li>
            <li> It works decently. I think it is as good as most of the fiber lashes.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I have purchased.  Definitely worth the $. I have tryed so many others with crappie results.  But this stuff is amazing and does exactly what it says!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! Shipped quickly .... good experience all around. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love it!!!!  It gives my eyelashes more volume and length</li>
            <li> in researching this mascara I never saw where it said you had to use your own mascara first; I was thinking this was going to replace my mascara - seems pretty costly to buy regular mascara and this mascara as well. I tried it but didn&#x27;t really  notice that significant of a difference</li>
            <li> This product does not live up to it&#x27;s advertising. It compares itself to Younique, which outperforms 3D Fiber Lash by a mile. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed with this product and wish to return it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I would never recommend 3D to anyone &amp; will gladly pay more for Younique.</li>
            <li> I really love this. My eyelashes are very curly and skimpy. I saw a big change in my eyelashes.The first time I used this I was some what not satisfied because it felt like fibers were in my eyes. After time, I leaned not to put the mascara too close to my eye line. I wear it everyday and it washes off easy with facial cloths. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> A little flakey but I love it other wise!</li>
            <li> Did not work like I expected.</li>
            <li> I liked how it looked initially... def made my skimpy lashes fuller looking - however, even with applying the second coat of gel, I couldn&#x27;t deal with the fibers getting in my eyes, and also dropping to my skin below my eyes. Also tried to apply fibers with my fav mascara. That didn&#x27;t work in any way. Sorry, not worth the eye irritation &amp; messy makeup look.</li>
            <li> I may not be putting enough layers on, because I don&#x27;t really notice much of a difference with my lashes. It&#x27;s a slight difference, though, which is why I&#x27;m not giving them 1 star, but 3.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several fiber lashes and these have been my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. I didnt put my usual mascara on like it said and it still turned out great! You just have to have a steady hand, and Its NOT something you can do in a hurry if you want good results ladies!</li>
            <li> This works very well and the company actually emailed me ways to keep it from clumping and ways that I can get the most out of the product. I have used bought it three times already and for the price it does not even compare to the other name brand fiber lashes.</li>
            <li> Just Looove it!!! You are not going to regret buying this!</li>
            <li> LOVE my 3D Fiber Lash Mascara! I had never used any 3D Fiber Mascara before and was nervous to try it out, but the first experience went off without a hitch at all.&lt;br /&gt;I am enclosing a photo of a before and after for everyone to see also!  This is a must have for makeup lovers and those looking to improve their lashes.</li>
            <li> I love 3D Fiber Lash Mascara, 300X, this produce gives you the fullness and length of false lashes, but without the hassle. I use 3D Fiber Lash Mascara every day.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible.  I followed the instructions exactly and have put this on three different days in the past week.  Each day I have black lash fibers on my face and under my eyes every time I look in a mirror! Do not waste your money on this.  It doesn&#x27;t do what it says and doesn&#x27;t stay on well at all.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping that this product would be good because the reviews were good. It is not. I did everything to make sure they came out good and they were still clumpy and unattractive. I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone unless you don&#x27;t mind the clumpy spider leg look.</li>
            <li> Fibers were constantly in my eye</li>
            <li> After researching the fiber lash products and checking out the youtube videos on how to apply, I decided to try this product instead of the more expensive Moodstruck one because the reviews for this were equivalent to the more expensive brands.  It is indeed amazing!  It works just as promised.  I recommend watching several of the available youtube videos on how to apply (just search for Moodstruck and several come up) so you can get the hang of the application technique.  It does require time and patience to apply or it will just clump up, so I don&#x27;t wear it every day.</li>
            <li> Love this product.looks like I have false eyelashes..but feels like nothing. No glue or falling off lashes!!!</li>
            <li> Most of the problems people face with this product are simply from not applying it correctly..or can be fixed easily! I&#x27;m in love with it and have absolutely no complaints! I have not had it flake off..or irritate my eyes..or any clumping that can&#x27;t be fixed with a dry mascara brush. Definitely will buy again!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and looks great</li>
            <li> its pretty good gel applies very sparsely even though it does not look dry.</li>
            <li> I like this product it works just like it says it does .</li>
            <li> Love it! Thank you for creating this! I had advanced ovarian cancer and took 16 months of chemo, which has caused my hair to barely grow throughout my entire body. You are a God-send &amp; blessing!</li>
            <li> My eyes haven&#x27;t burned this badly in years!  Also, it has a strange odor!  Would NOT recommend this mascara, ESPECIALLY if you have sensitive eyes!</li>
            <li> I have short eyelashes and this really lengthens them. Comes off very easily with face wipes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this often because it&#x27;s time-consuming to me. But very very nice.</li>
            <li> LOVE..LOVE..LOVE!!!! Easy to use and lashes have never looked this thick and long...definitely would buy again!!!</li>
            <li> I thought I was purchasing Younique mascara but bought this brand instead. Works great. Both brands need to be de-clumped with a pin, but overall it stays put with minimal flaking as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> This product was okay. It did not last very long at all and the Fiber kept falling off all throughout the day- I have used&lt;br /&gt;Younique Lashes plus other brands. I wanted to try and spend a little less money, however, I feel it is worth it to spend the money and buy the best. I feel Younique far surpasses the rest.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter who always dresses dramatically when she goes out and she loves them. Actually I was using her as a tester because she wears makeup every day. Now I will be ordering mine this week.</li>
            <li> I bought this product February 12,2015 and I am in love! I always get asked am I wearing lashes! Great product. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> i followed the directions and gave this product multiple chances without good results. Simply put, definitely not worth the price of three drugstore mascaras. So many fibers fall off during application; and since mascara is the last step in applying eye make up you have to carefully remove the fibers without ruining your shadow or liner. Not to mention all the fibers that fall into your eye.</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised</li>
            <li> Fiber lashes add so much volume, I can&#x27;t go without this mascara. Great product and great responsiveness from the seller.</li>
            <li> I tried this after trying Younique 3D lash mascara,,,, please don&#x27;t waist ur money!!! This was a mess and not worth the price even though it was cheaper . You really get what u pay for...... a mess. The  fiber brush in Younique&#x27;s really made the difference for me.</li>
            <li> It consistently smudges ether on top of eye or on the bottom leaving fiber residue even after applying as per instruction! Very frustrating!</li>
            <li> I was excited about this product. It didn&#x27;t live up to the endless IG posts  I reviewed and the fibers got in my eyes.</li>
            <li> Works great and very happy with the product!</li>
            <li> Love them. Makes my eyelashes look very long and pretty.</li>
            <li> I like it but there needs to be some improvement.  When do you comb your eyelashes when everything is dry or when it still wet.</li>
            <li> I love my 3D lash fiber mascara, I am 50 yrs old and I&#x27;ve always had short thin lashes, I&#x27;ve tried every mascara on the market just about and nothing has ever made my lashes stand out like this product, I will definitely be buying this again!! thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> Great experience for my order. Mascara is nice.I use when I want a more dramatic evening look.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  Made a significant difference in the way my lashes looked.  Love It.</li>
            <li> I am a first time customer to 3d lash. I can honestly say there&#x27;s a significant improvement. I will definitely suggest this product to family and friends.</li>
            <li> Someone raved about this to me and showed me on her lashes so I had to get some. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work well on me which I attribute to my type of lashes - they aren&#x27;t curly but more straight, almost like Asian lashes can be, do not hold a curl with an eyelash curler, and so the fibers more likely to fall in my eyes - which they did - and felt like a miniature knife in my eye! That said I gave this product to my daughter and she loved it and made her lashes look lush and full (but she has some natural curl to her lashes. You do have to apply according to directions.</li>
            <li> Beautiful.  I use Lasisse also.  With the mascara, looks like I have extensions.</li>
            <li> I was unsure that I would like this.  But OMG. Can&#x27;t imagine being without. I was worried I wouldn&#x27;t be skillful at application, or it would look very unnatural.  It&#x27;s easy! And looks great.  Lots of compliments and my lashes look like they used to...well many years ago.  Will definitely recommend and buy again</li>
            <li> I love it! My lashes have never looked better. Thanks lash factory.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!! Get compliments everyday definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I wanted quick free shipping which I got from being a Prime member, instead of ordering from a brand website, paying shipping and and waiting more than 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are tricky to use at first but with practice, I&#x27;ve definitely seen thicker lashes with two coats and longer lashes if I do three coats or more. The cleansing them off is why I give them four stars...with any mascara it&#x27;s hard to get completely off, and my make up remover is in a moist pad form, I recommend using a lotion/cream based eye make up remover so you get everything off much easier and more soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, NO mess like some reviews are saying, maybe one or two fibers fall on my cheek during application but those are easily brush off. They last ALL day and I wear contacts and there&#x27;s no irritation to my eyes at all. definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this product..the best things that&#x27;s ever invented for lashes</li>
            <li> It doesnt really work. I am being completely honest. I was very dissapointed with this product, especially after paying 26 dollars for it. You are supposed to apply a coat of mascara then a coat of transplanting gel then the fiber lashes hen another coat of transplanting gel. When you apply the fiber lashes the get kind of wadded up, and when you add the second coat of transplanting gel to keep the fibers from falling off, it just pulls them all of and/ tangles them more. I am very upset because i heard really, really great things about this. It at least arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I bought this by accident thinking I was buying Younique. This is better. My lashes are lengthened and a little thicker but so much more natural looking.</li>
            <li> In love with this mascara! Beyond amazing product, the 3D lash mascara works wonders and makes my eyelashes look so much longer and fuller! Which is great since my eyeliner in always a thick cat eye. Would recomend this product to anyone. Only had one tiny problem with them, and that was sometimes the fibers don&#x27;t stick properly and tend to fall on to my face or eyelids. Other than that I love this product and still wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> My teen daughter loves this!</li>
            <li> I love my 3D fiber mascara! My eyelashes are naturally long but this mascara makes them longer and, most importantly, fuller. It doesn&#x27;t clump any more than any other mascara and doesn&#x27;t take long to apply. Definitely worth the money. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> Great product for an ok price üíô</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied with this product,nice concept.</li>
            <li> Great product! Works really well!</li>
            <li> Great product for some extra volume to your lashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright. It seems like it works best the first week.. and then it starts to not be as &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t like all the coats you have to apply or the way the fiber stuff flakes onto your face.</li>
            <li> This product works great when used as directed. It doesn&#x27;t clump and makes my lashes look great. I have very short lashes that I never would put mascara on because they were just to short. Now I can wear mascara and my lashes look long and beautiful.</li>
            <li> 300X Fiber Lashes are the greatest.  If you have short lashes, this is the product to use.  It lifts your lashes to new heights.  No one will ever know you&#x27;re wearing fiber mascara.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my grand daughter and she really likes it. Thinking of ordering one for myself.</li>
            <li> They look and feel great! I love them and I would order again!</li>
            <li> I curl my eyelashes with an eyelash curler and then I start on one eye with the gel, then the fiber and then gel over the top. I repeat this process on the other eye and then wait a minute before applying mascara over the top (if I need to, I will use a lash brush to separate the lashes). Once I put a layer (or two) of mascara over the 3D fiber lash mascara, BAM my lashes look awesome! Long and voluminous! Love it. THANK YOU!!</li>
            <li> This product is tricky. I&#x27;ve applied it multiple times but i&#x27;ve only gotten it to work once. It takes a lot of time to apply and its not that much of a difference from normal mascara. There&#x27;s a reason that you haven&#x27;t really heard about this from the makeup gurus.</li>
            <li> I love it !! It will be my #1 mascara....my eyelashes have never been so long...so happy my granddaughter told me about it !</li>
            <li> Love the product so much and the service I will order it and recommend it</li>
            <li> This mascara works pretty well. If used correctly it will make your lashes look longer and more lush. It&#x27;s easy enough to take off. I just had trouble with it flaking off into my eyes and under my eyes. I used lots of the transfer gel to make sure the fibers were locked into place but I still have fallout from it. This fact makes the mascara a bit unpractical to use daily but it&#x27;s a hassle to constantly be wiping away fibers from under the eye or to have them go into your eye.</li>
            <li> This product is a Lash MAX! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> looks great on my now fabulous eyelashes</li>
            <li> Very very cool.  I don&#x27;t wear mascara daily but with the dramatic change in my eyes now I have been :)</li>
            <li> i loved it! my eyelashes are amazing. my boyfriend loves it almost more than i do !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok... not what I really hoped for</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never mastered false eyelashes. Used to use two to three different mascara to get full lashes. The fiber lashes are amazing. I get full, long eyelashes. Love it!</li>
            <li> Effective in length but very clumpy results.</li>
            <li> My package came on time. The product was great! I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times, but I love the 3d fiber lashes!</li>
            <li> I could not get it to stop clumping and made a huge mess of my eyelashes.  I tried several times and followed the instructions to a tee, even watched videos. The first time I applied it as directed and my lashes looked super clumpy and within two hours I had tons of tiny dried flakes under my eyes, which wouldn&#x27;t come off.  After several attempts, I tried using a pin to remove the clumps and separate my lashes, still within a couple of hours I had tons of tiny black flakes under my eyes.  I ultimately returned the product because it was causing eye irritation from the dry tiny flakes that got into my eyes and I didn&#x27;t like the clumpy look my lashes had.</li>
            <li> Not as amazing as I expected - it lengthens a little but not a considerable amount.  My biggest issue is that the fibers will fall on your face throughout the day (even when sealing it with a gel coat).  And the couple of times I fell asleep without washing it off - I woke up with scratched eyes.</li>
            <li> Amazing I love it I have short blonde lashes well not anymore everyone comments on my eyes now</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite mascara! I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect when I bought it, but I saw lots of positive reviews, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It really makes my eyes pop! I know this sounds weird,but it really has boosted my confidence. I feel like I look more awake and you can really see my eyes. It gives you that fake eyelashes look, but in a natural way. I actually think they look better than my fake eyelashes! It is super easy to apply you just put a coat of the transplanting gel and then follow with the fibers. It is fun to play with how many coats I want to add depending on the look I am going for! I will definitely be purchasing this again! In my pictures below one is posted this the mascara on both eyes and the other shows the difference between my old mascara (on one eye) and fiberlash on the other! Huge difference!</li>
            <li> After the 3rd use, it stopped working .</li>
            <li> I love this product. The best part is that is washes off easy, leaving no residue. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I ordered. Nice case. Little tricky to use at first, until you get the hang of it. I even used it on my 8 year old daughter for pictures. REALLY made her eyes POP! No odor.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like it. Constantly have the fibers under my eyes</li>
            <li> I really like the mascara and it makes my eyelashes look a lot longer than they actually are. However, the fibers come off throughout the day and go on to my cheeks or they fall into my eyes. It makes my eyes irritate a little when this happens. Overall a good product but wouldnt buy again because the fibers do fall off.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the 3D fiber lash mascara! I have super short blonde eyelashes and it has been a battle trying to find mascara that I like. I will never go back to any other brand. You will love it to! Here&#x27;s my before and after pic!</li>
            <li> This product was not too easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The fibers frequently fall in your eyes.</li>
            <li> I ordered my 3D lash mascara and I absolutely love it!!! I was nervous about applying the fibers, but it was super easy! My lashes have never been longer! Awesome product and will be purchasing it again!</li>
            <li> This is an okay product. It takes a while to put on and the little fibers get everywhere, including in your eyes when you&#x27;re putting them on your lashes. For some reason, I thought the fibers were in the mascara. They aren&#x27;t. You put your regular mascara on first, then you &amp;#34;sweep&amp;#34; on the fibers from one of the tubes with the mascara type wand inside. Some stick, some don&#x27;t. Next you add a coat of the mascara-like coating in the other tube. This is supposed to stick the fibers on your lashes. On the plus side, the coating did seem to stick the fibers onto my lashes. It was a little clumpier than I like, but when I tried to de-clump my lashes the little wads of fibers came off. Once I got all the tiny fibers out of my eyes and off my cheeks, I didn&#x27;t have any trouble for about 5 hours.  At that point they started flaking off. Then when I took the mascara off that night, I went through the whole little-fibers-getting-into-my-eyes thing all over again.  It may work for some people, but not me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product did not live up to its hype for me. I tried it once as directed, applied a layer of my own mascara, transplant gel, fibers, and transplant gel once more. It came out spidery and clumped together. I tried it a second time another day, and still it came out very spidery and clumped together. I even used a clean mascara wand to try and separate the lashes, but still no luck.  Do keep in mind, my lashes are on the short stubby side (at least my right eye is), but isn&#x27;t this supposed to work on all lengths, especially short lashes (otherwise why would i need this product?&amp;#34;). I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> This mascara make my eyelashes look so beautiful. I love it!</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE MONEY</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to use your mascara first and last! It makes a big difference :)</li>
            <li> The product works great.  I love the look.</li>
            <li> Feels as though there are tiny particles in my eyes while wearing. It caused eye irritation.</li>
            <li> Its ok with Just one layer, But i think it looks a bit messy when i Try to apply more layers.</li>
            <li> I like it. My eyelashes are straight/not very long so this actually works to make them fuller and longer. I was not sure it would work but it is around the same level as false lashes which cost 25-100$. So this is GREAT! Also, it does need to be applied once a day due to coming off when sleeping. Don&#x27;t rub eyes because the fibers will come off! Otherwise, worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Works great! It made my girlfriends lashes nearly double in length yet they still looked natural not clumpy.</li>
            <li> I have tried every mascara out there, and this is the best mascara I have ever used.  I absolutely love it.  This mascara is better than lash extensions, which I have also tried.  I highly recommend 3D Fiber Lash Mascara.</li>
            <li> Loveeeee these! Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Fibers get into your eyes causing irritation.</li>
            <li> Works but sometimes those fibers fall off and get into my eyes.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best mascara I have ever used! I have been searching for years for the perfect mascara, and was always let down. The other mascaras would flake off, smudge, and just not give me the intensity I was looking for. My aunt used this mascara for her wedding, and raved about how great it was. I decided to order some, and will never use anything else! This mascara was everything I have been looking for. It&#x27;s a little more expensive, but it&#x27;s worth every penny! I&#x27;m completely satisfied!!!</li>
            <li> I was torn between 3 or 4 stars because overall I do really like the way this mascara looks...BUT it does irritate my eyes sometimes (I am a contact lens wearer) and it is a long process to apply it the proper way, which is bad if I&#x27;m trying to get out the door quick. You need to apply regular mascara FIRST, then one layer of the wet mascara, a layer of dry fiber, then another wet layer...which is a lot of layers and time! If you&#x27;re not careful it will get clumpy. This is a good mascara if you want your lashes to look great, but would not buy as a daily use item.</li>
            <li> Gotta be the worst 23.99 i have wasted my money on can get the same effect using 2 or 3 coats of mascara</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really okay. This is the first time I&#x27;ve used fiber lashes. I don&#x27;t wear it everyday, but on occasion. I do wear contacts, and I haven&#x27;t found it irritating. (If a little fiber piece gets in your eye it&#x27;s the same as getting an eyelash in your eye--it&#x27;s not fun, but it happens and is easily taken care of). There is a visible difference in the length and thickness, but I&#x27;m careful  not to cake it on too much because I hate clumps. My advice is be sure to put on a good amount of gel after the layer of fiber lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not crazy impressed, but I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase. If you don&#x27;t use an eyelash curler or a comb to get out clumps, I suggest that. :)</li>
            <li> It is a four star because I am not sure if I like the fiber/dry one. I love the web mascara but the fiber one makes my lashes a massy look as if I applied one too much coat and it is too much.  Almost need to comb it thru to create a natural look.  I am not 100 percent happy with this product.  Nice idea in theory but not working out for me.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS.  I tried the &amp;#34;lash party&amp;#34; brand on FB but this brand is MUCH better.  It&#x27;s the same concept but better!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I especially like how the company takes a vested interest by making sure you know how to use the mascara before it arrives.  My eyelashes look great!  I do need to reapply later in the day.  My only suggestion would be - that the packaging include lash comb.  It would add the finishing touch to the product for a complete finish.</li>
            <li> Great quality! Came in a nice box. Love it!</li>
            <li> Will never buy this I used the actual brand and it was great but this brand sucks and when I orignally purchased the item I thought it was the actual Moodstruck 3D Fiber lashes not a knock off........</li>
            <li> Fibers don&#x27;t last for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li> At first when you put it on it looks really nice and your lashes look long, but Once the fiber is on it comes off within minutes.</li>
            <li> This product is difficult to apply, cakes on the lashes, and then flakes all day.  I get better volume/length with a cheap drugstore mascara.  Save your money, do not purchase this product.</li>
            <li> This mascara is just okay, it didn&#x27;t met my expectations, I was hoping getting something better results for that much money I paid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but not something I would buy again.  I think I can get almost the same results with a very good mascara and avoid having the little fibers flake off.</li>
            <li> The product works well. Not as well as the reviews made it out to be.  I think you can get basically the same result by applying multiple layers of drug store bought mascara. I&#x27;m happy to use it but I don&#x27;t think I will purchase this or any other similar item. It is what it is ladies.....we just need to be grateful for the lashes we have!</li>
            <li> I bought these because they were the most popular. However, I&#x27;m not a fan. I can&#x27;t get the fibers to stick  to the gel. No matter how much gel I put on. If yiu have the extra money I&#x27;d definitely  invest in Younique</li>
            <li> Love the look they give my lashes!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery! Not a huge fan of product. It does work. Lengthens and thickens however, the little fibers flake off and end up all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I just need to practice</li>
            <li> Love these..it looks like im wearing lashes</li>
            <li> I like the product a lot and like the long lashes it gives me. I&#x27;ve used it on my daughter too, no irritation and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this purchase. It made my eyelashes look worse. Maybe for someone else it would be better. But for the price it isn&#x27;t worth the try might as well just stay buying 6 dollar mascara at your drug store seriously not worth the price at all !!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the looks. Younique is much better quality.</li>
            <li> Awesome, awesome product. Pricing and delivery was great. Nice email sent telling me how to use, when shipped, etc. will definitely purchase from this seller again. Great length it adds to my lashes.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara the only thing is I had to use a waterproof mascara withe the fibers because the gel stuff that comes with this is just horrible all around but the fibers are great and work amazing and def fill and lengthen my lashes which are very short and thin...  So over all some of this product is great but a bit pricey for only using the fibers that came for the set</li>
            <li> These are fantastic; make my eyes pop like I&#x27;ve never seen! No more trying to mess with false eyelashes! Amazing!</li>
            <li> good product ..maybe a little expensive</li>
            <li> This product works really well for lengthening and thickening lashes. It&#x27;s also a nice shade of black. I had two problems. Once the lashes get longer they touch your upper lids and leave smudges. It also smudges under the eye even though I don&#x27;t use it on the lower lashes. So for about 5 hours after you put in the product it smudges constantly. Also the fibers do flake off from time to time. I decided to go with a different brand after trying this one. I can&#x27;t handle the smudging all day.</li>
            <li> Dissatisfied, not what I expected</li>
            <li> Ok product for the price. May look a little clumpy sometimes. Make sure your natural lashes are clean and separated. Fibers may fall down on your face. But it&#x27;s an ok product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me, may be user error, but I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Works just as well as my &amp;#34;younique&amp;#34; 3d mascara!! Wear it everyday! It was delivered earlier than expected too!</li>
            <li> I just got this and Wow!! These fibers rock!!! What a difference it makes!!</li>
            <li> Loving this product! It&#x27;s THE first time I have been completely satisfied with a mascara. I even use just the gel part for day and add the fibers for night.</li>
            <li> For me, it worked great and easy to use. It made a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> Very good.  does a nice job.</li>
            <li> Great mascara. Great service!</li>
            <li> best mascara I&#x27;ve ever bought</li>
            <li> No was not impressed at all I thought it would really extend my lashes. And doesn&#x27;t last very long my Loreal mascara works better than this.</li>
            <li> This mascara is awesome. I never want to leave home without it. Application is super easy and a few of my friends have purchased as well</li>
            <li> AMAZING product!!!! This is the only mascara I will ever buy! Love, love, LOVE it!</li>
            <li> The product burned my eyes. I have returned the product for refund.</li>
            <li> Yes I LOVE this product so much, it works brilliantly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to everything, so it may not irritate you</li>
            <li> This mascara does as it advertises, it definitely makes lashes significantly more apparent, and longer.  I have fairly long lashes anyway with just regular mascara, but this really makes them pop and does lengthen them even more.  It takes a bit of practice to apply.  I recommend starting with a coat of your regular mascara, as it says in the instructions.  I tried it once without that step and was seriously unimpressed; it didn&#x27;t last as long and was really flaky all day.  You also need to take care to apply the fibers only to the top half of your lashes.  I made the mistake once of applying it to my whole lash (was just on auto pilot and forgot), and all day long fibers were falling into my eyes, causing massive irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left off one star because I do have to occasionally wipe under my eyes through the day, as some of the fibers tend to fall off as time goes by with the product on.  Perhaps this could be remedied by a second coat of gel or regular mascara, I just haven&#x27;t tried because I feel there&#x27;s a fine line between beautiful, natural looking lashes, and spider leg lashes with this product.  I have never tried more than one coat.  I also typically only wear on nights out or weekends because I feel it&#x27;s a bit too much eyelash for a work day.  Hope that helps if you&#x27;re trying to decide to purchase!</li>
            <li> Love this !! Absolutely recommend to anyone !</li>
            <li> This is a pic with and without the fiber lashes. There&#x27;s a huge difference!!! It&#x27;s super easy to apply and remove. It&#x27;s also very reasonably priced. I absolutely LOVE this product!!!</li>
            <li> I am very new to 3D Fiber lashes since I&#x27;ve heard so many conflicting reviews but I wanted to try it out for myself and see how it would work for me since everyone is different. I was very happy with the Lash Factory 3D Fiber Lash Mascara. You do need to read the instructions and follow them for the most part word for word! Adding a coat of regular mascara is the one that is probably up to the user to decide if they want to do it. I did put a layer of my regular mascara just to see the results from following word for word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s super easy to apply and has very amazing results. My thin short eyelashes went from boring and unnoticeable to bold and eye catching! I applied the fiber lash mascara early in the day and they looked just as amazing later that night even when I was out running errands in the hot Oklahoma heat and humidity! I would definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> I like this product so much :)!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I accidentally purchased this product thinking it was the 3d fiber lash mascara by Younique. The name is almost the same, the packaging is even almost identical to youniques, but in actuality it&#x27;s nothing like it. It is very clunky and sticky and it causes your lashes to stick together so you end up have 5 long fat lashes. Ugh waste of $30</li>
            <li> Great for making your lashes look longer and thicker. I love it. Stays on all day long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this product. I went from indistinct lashes to lush lashes. Thank you for the tips and great product!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product. Does exactly as it is described. My eyelashes are long and full when using the 3D Fiber Lash mascara!</li>
            <li> Makes lashes full and long</li>
            <li> When I first got this product it worked fantastic, the only downside is, it does not last long at all!  Yes it would stay on all day, but It only made my eyelashes look long for about two weeks then it seemed as though I ran out!  It&#x27;s way to expensive to only have enough for two weeks...</li>
            <li> I love it!!  I am hooked and will be making additional purchases.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Second time ordering it</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!!!!! I have always had a problem with thin eyelashes</li>
            <li> Great product! Lashes are thicker and longer and it takes no longer than my older mascara did.</li>
            <li> Flakes bad as you blink</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking it would be like the younique lashes but it is not... the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; portion just seems like regular mascara and not nearly as thick as younique therefore it didn&#x27;t have as much holding power of the fibers. It did not give me 3d lash look at all..&lt;br /&gt;I will be going back to younique brand.</li>
            <li> LOVE,LOVE, LOVE  made my eyes pop as if I had extensions.. THANK YOU !!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most beautiful thing ever. I use it everyday. Only thing about it is getting it off. It&#x27;s bet to use a towel and water.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first to buy this product when a coworker told me about, but boy did it brighten my eyes and made my lashes look so much fuller and longer. I&#x27;m gonna buy this again.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  The mascara irritated my eyes at first but after a few weeks I got used to it.  I have eyelashes now and it&#x27;s due to this mascara.  I even recommended it to my friend and she had the same issue for the first couple of weeks but now loves it too.</li>
            <li> Great solution to having to put false eye lashes on. My eye lashes look bold and dramatic! Good product!</li>
            <li> Love this mascara, won&#x27;t wear another!</li>
            <li> My product arrived with the fiber tube opened and it was dried out. I would like a replacement as I know this is a good product. The packaging was not professional.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply, a bit time consuming though. I am really not pleased with the product. I think it looks extremely clumpy - and that is with only one coat. I had one eye with just mascara on, and noticed no difference in length with they eye that had mascara as well as this product. The mascara only eye looked much better, not clumpy. Tried the product for a week straight, hoping it would get better. It didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this but after looking at the reviews about the &#x27;marker odor&#x27; - it&#x27;s obvious this is a cheap knock off of Younique and I do not recommend anyone buy this.  It is NOT safe, buy direct from a Younique presenter, please...</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.. any negative reviews are probably because they aren&#x27;t&#x27; using it correctly. If you administer one eye (top then bottom) at a time rotating the gel then fibers etc. you can establish the look you want. Make sure the gel is the last application on your eyes to seal the fibers. Truly makes the eyes pop. Purchased from 2 separate sellers and both work the same.. flawless~!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool doesn&#x27;t give you that clean look, it gave my the clumpy mascara look, but it does last all day</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it! Too long of a process and lashes fall out on eye and smuge&#x27;s. Lancome easier and lashes much better.</li>
            <li> I love the way it looks but save it for special occasions and be careful. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for daily use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mascara in lieu of the Younique brand. These make some damn big lashes. I live the length I can build. I&#x27;m not the most talented make-up gal, so at times I have difficulty, but more often than not I love the outcome. Also, another thing to add, once I wore the mascara for two days without reapplyibg and my lashes still looked descent considering the circumstances of beach activities.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING! One of my friends is a hairdresser and she also gets all kinds of beauty products and she always posts about this mascara. I gave it a shot and there was a very noticeable difference. The only possible complaint I would have is that the lashes sometimes fall in my eye while I&#x27;m putting them on, but that&#x27;s barely an issue for me because I have no issues getting them out- just a warning for others.</li>
            <li> I am surprised by how easy it is to apply.  It truly looks great.</li>
            <li> Total satisfaction!  Highly recommended! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I really like the subtle extension look. I would remind anyone to follow the instructions exactly when applying.</li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing! It lengthens my short lashes and volumizes them. No mascara I have used before has been this great. I love it!</li>
            <li> Fibers got in my eyes and on my contacts</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister.  She didn&#x27;t have any problems with it, so I&#x27;m going to assume that loves it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.. Love it.. does exactly as it says....</li>
            <li> Can be messy if you don&#x27;t brush lashes out but def gives a noticeable added length!</li>
            <li> Does thicken but clumps and the fibers go on in wild directions.  I&#x27;m going back to getting lash extensions.</li>
            <li> I LOVE my 3D Fiber Lash!! it actually works. My lashes are longer and fuller</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! If you follow the directions it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Wish I had received the helpful hints with the mascara. So far, I am finding it very hard to use without clumping. Not my favorite after a week of use.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product have sent it to two of my friends who also love this product</li>
            <li> I did not care for this product. By the end of the day, it became very flaky and caused irritation to my eyes.</li>
            <li> Love these, I actually look like I have naturally luxurious lashes.  My lashes are long but straight and thin, this product works great to make my eyes pop.  I use it sparingly as I do not want to look like I am wearing false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever purchased ! My sister had purchased a similar product from her salon at a much higher price and loved it.  I immediately went to amazon and started doing the research.  Reviews were very good on this so I went ahead and purchased.  Have had more compliments on my mascara than ever before.  Just received my 2nd supply after 4 months of using the first.</li>
            <li> I was fooled into thinking thi swas the same as Younique. It&#x27;s not - it&#x27;s not terrible but Younique is MUCH better.</li>
            <li> Was extremely impressed with the length it built on the lashes rather quickly. But you need to be real careful with the fibers.  You don&#x27;t want to get them in your eyes.  The item stayed in all day. Did not smudge.  Very impressive and I&#x27;ve used every brand out on the market.  I&#x27;d rate this as excellent!</li>
            <li> I love my fiberlash! Its great. I don&#x27;t have to put game lashes on again!</li>
            <li> I love this product and it&#x27;s stay put power. I&#x27;m learning to apply it so that the fibers don&#x27;t end up on my under-eye and cheek area. In addition, trying to figure out the most gentle way to remove it  when I&#x27;m ready. I haven&#x27;t mastered the latter, but I will. I would be happy to hear suggestions.</li>
            <li> I really love this product it definitely helps my eyelashes stand out even more.  It makes them look thicker which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Having blonde eyelashes, this product really helps my eyes to &#x27;POP&#x27;.  Works better than any other mascara that I&#x27;ve tried.  The only thing that I have issue with is that the &#x27;fiber&#x27; particles in the second tube will fall off as the day goes on, creating dark spots of fiber under my eyes.  I won&#x27;t notice it till I catch a glimpse in the mirror to wipe them off.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!! I seriously have little to no eye lashes but when I use this stuff people always compliment how long my eyes lashes look!! The after picture I took in a car so it&#x27;s really easy to see the results. Definitely recommend this product. Now I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> Fabulous!!!  I have eyelashes again.  I kept thinking about lash extensions, but couldn&#x27;t justify the price or upkeep.  This looks like I have extensions, but not.... Highly recommend this product.  One tip, when putting the fiber on the lashes after the wet, press the fiber into the lashes for best results.  I was stroking the fiber on like mascara, but found it didn&#x27;t get the desired effect.  Pressing into the wet application works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I love love love love this product!!! It really works and is amazing!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last all day and flakes is long pieces.  It&#x27;s a dead giveaway that you&#x27;re using fiber lashes.  I find that regular mascara does a better job.  Try Benefit!</li>
            <li> It takes several coats to notice much difference, but it does look nice once its on. The problem is later in the day if I touch my lashes, even accidently by removing my contacts, the little fibers fall into my eye and cause a lot of irritation.</li>
            <li> Works great!! Even casual days in beach town!!!</li>
            <li> I have long eyelashes. This product made them pop! Beautiful long lashes all day long</li>
            <li> Still trying to get the hang of applying.Makes my lashes look thick. Hoping in time I can apply it and make them look a little longer as well. It takes a few layers and you must be patient while creating the &amp;#34;layers&amp;#34; other wise it will clump a bit but just make sure you have a eyelash comb or spoolie. Takes some practice.</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this product! By following the directions (and being sure to put my regular mascara on first) my lashed were transformed! So glad I found this and didn&#x27;t pay higher prices for a product with a different name brand! I love the fact that I can wear one coat for a day look and add one or two more for a more dramatic evening look. 5 stars for sure!</li>
            <li> I purchased product after seeing the amazing results on a friend.  However, I did not understand that I was to use my own mascara first, and I need a lash comb.  You could improve your info by making that clear. Too much information is far better than not enough. Thus the two stars.</li>
            <li> I wear contacts and it tends to flake off during the day and gets in my eyes.</li>
            <li> My lashes look AMAZING! This product is very easy to use, doesn&#x27;t wear off or smudge, and almost looks like real but incredible lashes!!</li>
            <li> Awesome! It works so great! People cannot believe its mascara that has been making my eyelashes POP!</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and it didn&#x27;t do anything spectacular for my lashes. They look the same as when I use regular mascara.</li>
            <li> I love love love this mascara make my lashes nice, long and full. Everybody thinks my lashes are fake. This is a must have ladies you won&#x27;t regret it. Best $20 I&#x27;ve spent.</li>
            <li> Eye lashes never looked better. I love this product.</li>
            <li> No good. Did not work well for me</li>
            <li> The product causes irritation Only if some fibers get in your eyes.  Otherwise, easy to use and good product!</li>
            <li> Amazing! I&#x27;m never using anything else. Sends pricy, but this product lasts a very long time!</li>
            <li> I am happy with the product! I will buy it again in the future.</li>
            <li> I have been on a quest to find eye makeup that won&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes half way through the day.  After my mom and a trusted friend raved about another brand of this product, I had the chance to try it.  It didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes half way through the day.  It irritated them immediately upon application of the fibers and continued through the day even after removing product with makeup remover and a shower.  The next morning, my eyes were still watery and gunky.  My quest continues...</li>
            <li> Works very well...had to try a couple times to get the hang of it....after that they were fine.  Would buy again</li>
            <li> Not the same as the original product from &amp;#34;youngnique&amp;#34;. The lash fibers do not apply in the fashion that lengthen your lashes although it did give you a look of fuller lashes...I gave this one away and bought Youngnique. Wont but again.</li>
            <li> I purchased another brand that I felt was a little better.  This one works fine, but not in comparison.</li>
            <li> I love love this product</li>
            <li> Best mascara I have ever purchased. I don&#x27;t even use regular mascara now.</li>
            <li> I think it clumped way too fast and the fibers didnt stick to lashes as easy as the youniquebrand that i had purchased before.. the quality wasnt the same even tho it was the same ingredients i had compared.. wouldnt be purchasing again really..</li>
            <li> Life saver!! So sick of using glue on my eyes!!!</li>
            <li> Gave my short lashes lots of volume and length</li>
            <li> I like it. I haven&#x27;t had any flaking or eyes burning issues. It goes on easy and makes my lashes look so much thicker and longer! I took one star off because it seems to clump a little, so I have to be careful during application to prevent weirdo spider leg lashes. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Did amazing things for my lashes. Look thicker, longer, and last all day no matter what I&#x27;m doing. Very cheap for what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li> This Product is Different , it takes time to get use to it and the feel, better than false eye lashes. I would order this again. I also order this product for my Daughter and she liked it as well and would order this again.</li>
            <li> I have very skimpy eyelashes and this mascara really does make them look fuller and longer.</li>
            <li> I was incredibly amazed with the results. So beautiful.</li>
            <li> I followed the instruction and applied it onto my eyelash. It didn&#x27;t work out as well as I thought. The fiber was causing irritation with my eyes. I couldn&#x27;t stop rubbing my eyes because of the fiber that got into my eye. It didn&#x27;t make my eyelashes longer..but I will keep trying till I got it.</li>
            <li> After a fellow chorus member said she knew of singers who used this instead of wearing false eyelashes, I had to give it a try as I dislike attaching false eyelashes.  Although it does make your lashes look bigger and is easy to put on, it cannot replace false eyelashes.  I did use it in conjunction with the the false eyelashes and that worked out very well.  Will use this when I want more dramatic eyes, but will still use the fake lashes for large stage productions.</li>
            <li> Made a big difference in the length and fullness of my lashes. This is the first fiber mascara I have purchased, and it fit my needs.</li>
            <li> Clumpy and caked lashes. The &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; was alright, went on well, however, the &amp;#34;fiber&amp;#34;, was just dust on a mascara brush. I don&#x27;t know how you can possibly put this on without some landing in your eye, but if you manage to do so (it really stings btw), the &amp;#34;fiber/dust&amp;#34; will flake off throughout the day leaving a dusting of black under your eyes that will smudge when you try to remove it leaving you with a raccoon like effect. If all that works for you, than yes, this will make your lashes look fuller, gross, but fuller. As for as I&#x27;m concern, this is trash for me.</li>
            <li> Love my lashes! Would recomend</li>
            <li> My mac mascara does the same thing I was disappointed</li>
            <li> At first I was disappointed because I thought it looked too clumpy, but once you get used to it and watch some videos online about how to use it, it has amazing results. The only reason it wouldn&#x27;t work well is if you&#x27;re not using it right!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the worst fiber lash mascara EVER.  I bought one for my daughter and one for me.  We both will never ever purchase it or recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> So I went a little crazy last week and ordered 3 mascaras. I will rank them, in order, in case anyone else has a severe mascara anxiety meltdown.&lt;br /&gt;1. Lash Factory 3D Fiber - It was at least $10 less than what I paid for the Younique fiber stuff and just as good.  Love it.&lt;br /&gt;2. Arbonne It‚Äôs a long story ‚Äì Very smitten with it.  I would say this is the best non 3D/Fiber mascara out there. I wore it and my friend ‚Äì who is more crazy than I am and has a strange fixation with the fact that I have young looking eyes, so you know she really studies me ‚Äì said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lashes look super long today‚Äù. I actually consider this to be like a middle ground between regular mascara and the fiber stuff.  Mascara purgatory, but in a good way. Sometimes you don‚Äôt want to be all decked out but you want that intensity or definition‚Ä¶ Also it‚Äôs a little cheaper on Amazon, I think my friend spent about $12 more buying from someone else.&lt;br /&gt;3. Elizabeth Mott It‚Äôs so big ‚Äì last place. Don‚Äôt get me wrong it‚Äôs good, but not as rich and dramatic as the others.  I would say this would be more like a base coat type of mascara, which is how I will use it. And it was the cheapest, so I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> works great and everything goes on great</li>
            <li> Clumps terribly and is a long stressful process just getting the mascara on.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I was stoked to get this , not so much anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Not even 30 minutes after using this product my eyes started becoming really irritated, and there was fibers everywhere in my eye.&lt;br /&gt;It literally hurt so much that I had to shut my eyes and have my husband help me to bathroom seeing as I couldn&#x27;t even OPEN MY EYES. Also to help me take off the product.&lt;br /&gt;I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. The pain isn&#x27;t worth having longer eyelashes , plus they looked like spider legs.</li>
            <li> First off, this mascara works miracles so please don&#x27;t hesitate! I have used many mascaras in the past but this takes the cake. I have very fine lashes but this gives the appearance of thickness AND length. One application in the morning and I am good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP 1: Try not to touch your eyelashes throughout the day and apply it slowly so it doesn&#x27;t clump. 3D fibers have a natural tendency to want to stick together so dedicate a good 5-10 minutes in the morning. (I use a small brush on my lashes to prevent any clumpy appearances.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP 2: In the evening, gently PAT your lashes dry with water. This mascara has not damaged my lashes at all because gentility is key.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could rave about this on and on but I believe a picture is worth a thousand words. People often ask now if I&#x27;m wearing fake eyelashes. Picture 1 is with regular Maybelline mascara. Picture 2 is with 300x fiber lashes.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to most mascaras, there are only a few I can wear!  I am not allergic to these!  Super happy about it since I love the Fiber Lash!!  I have thin and sparse eyelashes and this really helps!!  Will be ordering again.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got very little eye lashes and this product has changed that I love it I will never use anything else I highly recommend buying this product.... Very very happy üòç</li>
            <li> Great product! Makes me feel like I have fake eyelashes without it looking fake!</li>
            <li> This is the only fiber mascara I have tried so I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re all like this one.  The fibers go on dry and this cause them to fall off the brush, getting into the eyes.  Plus, this didn&#x27;t do what I expected.  My eyelashes are very short and kind of sparse.  After applying this mascara, my eyes looked about the same as with regular mascara.  I won&#x27;t buy any more of this.  My daughter raves about the Younique brand, so maybe these are not all the same..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really care for the brush that comes with the mascara. But other then that I think the product it pretty cool! It gives you some serious eyelashes</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! The videos people have posted in the reviews are accurate. I only use one coat of each per eye and it comes out great. I don&#x27;t even use it on my bottom lashes because for me, that&#x27;s a bit much for work, but if I were going to party or out to dinner, I&#x27;d add the bottom lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I follow the provided directions with one deviation: I use my waterproof mascara again after applying the Fiber Lash to keep it from flaking and/or running when I cry from laughter. I will definitely get this again.</li>
            <li> I used to spend so much money having eyelash extensions applied, just to have them grow out and look funny for a few days before they could be removed and reapplied. This mascara really does give the effect of extensions without the pain, cost, and inconvenience of going to a salon.</li>
            <li> Definitely saw a huge difference and it does work but the fibers get inside your eye very easily and it takes longer to apply than a traditional mascara</li>
            <li> Best invention ever! No need to false lash anymore.</li>
            <li> The fibers was not what I expected. Need to be real careful or it will go in your eyes!!. I need to keep the practice!</li>
            <li> Love my longer looking lashes.... And they last all day without flaking!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It makes my eyelashes longer and fuller looking. I usually only wear it out when I&#x27;m spending a night downtown or something, and you should note not to get the fibers to close to the eyeball or base of eyelashes because it tends to irritate the eye. But, if you follow their instructions to apply it on the upper half of the eyelashes there is no problem! I highly recommend 3D Fiber Lash Mascara</li>
            <li> Love this &amp; (wait for it) IT WORKS!  Thanks lash factory.  Have had some eye issues &amp; it doesn&#x27;t irritate.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! Very happy!!</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve used. Best invention ever! Thank you, this 65 year old lady has eye lashes again!</li>
            <li> They make my eyelashes so long I love it</li>
            <li> Lashes appeared longer and more defined love this product was tempted to get false lashes now that is no longer a option thanks to this product</li>
            <li> Gives you the longer and thicker eyelashes noticeably. It takes a couple times to get used to the process and to keep lashes from clumping. I found that if I took more time to brush lashes carefully straight with each stroke it worked better than how we can sometimes rush applying our regular mascara.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff makes my lashes like (BAM)!!</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering the Younique fiber mascara system, so I&#x27;m not sure how I ended up with this one, but I&#x27;m definitely happy with it. My lashes look longer and fuller. I got lots of compliments on how nice I looked. The fibers did fall off the first time I tried it, but I read to apply gel after the fibers to lock them in place and it worked. I&#x27;ve done it both with and without my own mascara first and I think it works better if you don&#x27;t put your own mascara on first.</li>
            <li> Was a little disappointed because it clumped my eyelashes and made them look bulky instead of long.</li>
            <li> Awful stuff, doesn&#x27;t work as promised!</li>
            <li> Not as good as it was presented.  I think the Younique brand has it beat hands down. I thought i was ordering the Younique. And this popped up andi clicked oorder</li>
            <li> Try the REAL 3D Fiber Lashes+ Mascara! Not this knockoff! The real 3D Fiber Lashes+ Mascara is all natural, vegan, gluten free, &amp; made in the USA!</li>
            <li> Great product and works perfect!</li>
            <li> This product works great for the price. Wears like regular mascara removes easily. Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> There was no real difference in my normal mascara and the fiber mascara. Just looked clumpy with one coat.</li>
            <li> It was the first time using any product of this kind so I have no point of reference for comparison. It does appear to flake off a bit and is a tad messy, but then that could be user error. Overall good product and does make your lashes look big and fluffy!</li>
            <li> This product really does make your eye lashes appear longer, only complaint is that it flakes immediately after use, i find myself trying to dig the fibers out of my eye all day.  Doesn&#x27;t clump unless the brush dries out than it&#x27;s harder to apply.  overall it worked nice, just don&#x27;t like the way it irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li> So easy to use! I put my regular mascara on first, let it dry, then use the fiber lash. They look so full and thick when I&#x27;m done! I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I feel like the fibers always run out pretty quickly. this is the second brand of fiber lash i&#x27;ve tried and i&#x27;ve had the same problems with both. I have lots of gel, but the fibers are basically gone after a week&#x27;s use :(</li>
            <li> Wow! This stuff works!!. I have never had the patience for glue and false eyelashes. This stuff is so much better.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting half the effect, great!</li>
            <li> Love the mascara!!!so many people commenting on how long my lashes look. Amazing product!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, almost immediately after she put it on it started bothering her eyes as if the mascara was getting in her eyes</li>
            <li> As soon as I run out of this mascara I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! I get the effect i have been searching for, highly recommend</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. Would order again.</li>
            <li> I love the product, it takes a bit of finesse (recommend having a lash brush on hand for a final step) but nothing like my struggles with falseys and I achieve a similar effect. Read the directions they send!</li>
            <li> It was ok, it lasted for like 2 weeks and that was it I feel like I should&#x27;ve gotten more for my money</li>
            <li> My niece was selling the other brand of 3D fiber lashes last year when I tried it &amp; loved it. When it started to dry up this year, I looked on Amazon for something comparable but a little cheaper. I got exactly what I wanted -- Lash Factory is the same thing but about $15 less. Very happy. I&#x27;ll buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> Wish it was waterproof though - - -</li>
            <li> BEST MASCARA EVER!&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT AND PLAN ON USING IT FOREVER! BONNIE STRANGE</li>
            <li> I liked this!  It definitely works, but it is best to follow the instructions (I didn&#x27;t the first time LOL). To make this work for me and the look I wanted, I applied 2 coats and my lashes were thicker and looked more dramatic.  I don&#x27;t like the lump look, so I used a lash brush to make the result look more natural. Very nice!</li>
            <li> This product was disappointing!!! It did not give me the results I was expecting. Also while applying the dry fibers, they fall on your foundation. Just seemed a little messy and then kept reapplying only to never see that much of a difference from my favorite Lorel Telescopic Mascara. Not worth the price!</li>
            <li> I am extremely dissatisfied with the product as I expected it to be comparable to another lash product I had used previously.  It is clumpy, flaky and hard to apply neatly.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I will but it again.</li>
            <li> Love this product use it daily!!!  Would recommend this product to anyone especially if you have short lashes</li>
            <li> Recently I ordered the 3D mascara from lash factory. When I received it, it was at first trial and error. Applying it of course is simple and comes with specific directions,  although I found that I needed to apply it for about a week to get it right. I like the concept and most of the results I get. My couple of complaints would be these: 1. The fibers even after applying the gel to lock them in, continue to fall onto your face and eyelids throughout the day. It seems like you have to reapply the product and or your personal mascara often. (If you love eyelashes as much as I do) 2. Also I&#x27;ve noticed the application can chunk up,  unlike falsies that stay in place and separated. I would love to give this product 5 stars cause I love the length I achieve,  but the few things listed can get frustrating.  Here is a pic to give you an idea of the clumping,  but also the length.</li>
            <li> I have used friend&#x27;s more expensive version of the 3-d mascara. Side by side, this works just as well. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Stuff is awesome! Literally looks like you&#x27;re wearing fake eyelashes, minus all the fumbling with them! So easy and fast for fabulous lashes!</li>
            <li> Bouught this for my girlfriend she says she likes it but at the same time it is very clumpy and a recent update is that she has stopped wearing it and ordered a new kind</li>
            <li> works great and the price is right compared to others that are so expensive!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! You can redo the lashes as many times as you want to add to the length or do just once to have a fuller lash. I like to go big! I like to build on the fibers by going through the process several times for each eye to have extra long lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will love them!</li>
            <li> really like the fiber lashes , but sometimes the fibers get in my eyes and its a uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> This product is good and I really like the traveling case. However, I only use it when I&#x27;m going out because it&#x27;s not very practical for everyday. I really don&#x27;t have that much time in the mornings and I wish this was a one step process.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE!!! I am so surprised on how they advertise it works so well. Buyer Beware! Save your money! I tried several attempts to use it and each one failed the fibers fall into your eyes causing tearing and burning threw out the day.</li>
            <li> A dusting of the fiber lashes tend to fall on cheeks after applied.  Okay product.  Would not purchase again though.</li>
            <li> I have great eye lashes with this pproduct. It is great. Thank you</li>
            <li> does not make lashes as long as other brands</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li> My lashes were longer and fuller thanks to the fiber lash mascara. I recommend this mascara to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Really thickens and lengthens!</li>
            <li> The product is awesome and works all day. The pic is after a whole day of running errands, still looks great. There is some irritation when you take it off with makeup remover later but nothing terrible. the look is amazing!!!! i dont know what i did without it before.</li>
            <li> I do like this product a lot, the only problem is that if you don&#x27;t put it on perfectly then the fibers will sometimes get in to your eyes and it is irritating to get out. The pros definitely outweigh the cons though. Great product!</li>
            <li> I loved it! It does increase the length and you can make them as thick as you want. ‚ù§Ô∏è</li>
            <li> Product makes eyelashes look great.  Really easy to apply.  However application and occasionally throughout the day,  the fibers flake off leaving black underneath eyes.  It wipes off fairly easily but can ruin face/under-eye makeup.</li>
            <li> Love love how this product makes my lashes look fuller and extra long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying it is not good, but I really did not like it. Too complicated and I also have sensitive eyes. Sorry, I prefer regular mascara</li>
            <li> I have tried other Fiber Lash Mascara, all more expensive than this brand. After trying 300X Fiber Lashes, I will not go back to the more expensive product, that is no better than 300X.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It makes my eyes pop!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a present for my niece, she loves it.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT MADE MY LASHES LOOK CLUMPY. FIBERS DID NOT GO ON EASILY. DID NOT SEE INCREASED LENGTH.</li>
            <li> put the wet gel on and then the powder, then gel again, so it doesn&#x27;t flake. i don&#x27;t need regular mascara and if you re-apply with several coats you can make eyelashes look rediculously long. someone asked if i had fake lashes on. awesome product</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really impressed by this considering I had to put mascara on first and my mascara is Mac Haute and Naughty which by itself is freakiin awesome!!! But I fig with the 3D lash it would have an even more dramatic look....it didn&#x27;t really give me the look I was hoping for, it&#x27;s ok in my opinion but what really annoyed me was the entire time I wore it I wanted to wash my face because it irritated my eyes and I kept wanting to rub my eyes which was a no no unless I wanted fibers in my eyes so this product did work out to well for me.</li>
            <li> This product is a rip-off of the original Younique 3D Fiber Lashes. If you are interested in a mascara like this, please seek out a Younique representative or visit the Younique website. I have seen photos of people getting horrible eye irritation from these fake products. Its not worth saving a few dollars. Get the real thing.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Makes a huge difference and washes off easily! Love it and have already recommended to friends! Did mascara only on one eye, added the 3x on the other in my picture! Big difference!</li>
            <li> Love it. Easy to apply (apply gel, then fibres, then more gel to seal them in and stop them falling out). I use on top and bottom lashes and it really gives a great and dramatic look. Easy enough to avoid clumps. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the fibres falling out, or getting into eyes and irritating them. I was thinking about getting eyelash extensions but now I am going to use this instead. I will join the majority of reviewers here in saying that I highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li> Awful .. gave me watery and red eyes!</li>
            <li> so far so good. I only wear this product for 3-4 hours top but very easy to apply, not mess at all. Definitely makes my lashes longer... Love it so far.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed. I don&#x27;t like clumpy mascara.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Definitely will be buying again</li>
            <li> fibers fall in your eye.  Constantly feeling as if something is IN your eye</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Take your time applying one eye at a time and you will have beautiful results</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be discouraged by the two step process. Once you use it a few times, it is actually very easy to apply. The only down side (minimal) is that it smudges a little under my eyes during the day. Otherwise, I really love it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever write review, but this product is amazing. Easy to use and my lashes look amazing too!</li>
            <li> I really liked the mascara but I have contacts and very sensitive eyes. It was very irritating. Wanted to like it but had to send it back.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I always wanted to get the longer thicker eyelashes look. But it is hard to apply, since the gel tends to dry up pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I save mine for special occasions and LOVE it. Apply your own mascara, then gel (which looks like mascara), fiber, then gel again. It might sound like a long procedure but it only takes a minute. The fiber is made from green tea leaves, I believe. SO COOL.</li>
            <li> Not any better than regular mascara, and way more time consuming.</li>
            <li> I do love it! I need more volume in my lashes, so I did try it a couple of ways. First, I tried it with the gel that comes with it &amp; then the fibers and more coats of the gel. Length was great ..but looked sparse and &amp;#34;spider legish&amp;#34; :) So, I then tried what another reviewer said and start the first coat with your regular mascara, fibers and then the gel provided. Worked perfectly! So glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li> I hate it. It looks clumpy and little particles fall in my eye throughout the day as well as under my eyes creating a messy look. It&#x27;s just a mess and I regret spending money on it.</li>
            <li> I love the 3D fiber lash mascara!!!!</li>
            <li> Followed the directions they sent me and the fibers still come off on my eyelid.  Even with just one swipe of the fiber.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. This is my 2nd purchase. Follow the directions that come with it. Fast delivery, sealed very nicely.</li>
            <li> Love this product. As my lashes are thinning this product helps gives them substance. Love how easy it is to use. I would recommend that you use a coat of your own mascara after applying this product to seal the deal.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! It really does work vs all the other mascara i have tried out there. Try it for yourself!</li>
            <li> The picture in the blue is me without the 3d fiber lash mascara and the one up close is when I used the fiber lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3d fiber lash mascara is better than getting fake eye lashes at the store,or paying anyone to install them individually. I recommend buying the 3d fiber lash mascara. Its so easy to put on, easy as one two three.It can fit in your purse and you will be able to remove them easily. You can make your eyelash as long as you want with the fibers. (Love it)&lt;br /&gt;I Will be starting My very own YouTube channel soon and will be doing a tutorial on the 3d Fiber lashes. Follow me on Instagram xxtrathickztheraphyisgood4u</li>
            <li> I have received them and they are awesome! I have been using them more than I even anticipated since they are so easy to use and make such a difference in my thin eyelashes! I will most likely order another pair soon!</li>
            <li> I love this product but if you do happen to accidentally get some in your eye... it hurts!!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t that crazy about it and would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really like this Lash Factory 3D Fiber Lash Mascara.  I have used other more pricey brands, (Younique and Benefit), and I felt this product was superior to the others.  I have a couple of suggestions to get the most out of this mascara.  First of all, curl your lashes.  This will go along way with making your lashes look more dramatic.  Secondly, put one base coat of your regular mascara on first.  After you have done those two steps you are ready to begin application.  IT IS SUPER EASY!  Just apply a coat of the gel to the top half of your lashes (I tend to focus mainly on the tips) then apply the fibers and then apply gel again.  You can do this several times to achieve the length you want.  Be sure to do one eye at a time so the gel doesn‚Äôt dry prior to applying the fibers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I would say is that they do flake just a bit‚Ä¶but this happens with ALL these type of lashes and I found this product to flake less than the other brands. I&#x27;ve included a photo of before applying the 3D Fiber Lash Mascara and after application so you can see the difference. A+ and 5 well earned stars!  ~Sample provided for evaluation and testing~</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are on the shorter side and this is the first mascara that has made them really stand out!! I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple weeks but so far I love it! Definitely a great choice if you want a stand out eye look</li>
            <li> What a knock off. It had ZERO fiber on the brush. Thought this was Younique. So bummed.</li>
            <li> The fact that this product indeed delivers exactly as it says it will, should always lend itself to a 5 star rating in my book.  That said, there are some  challenges; while reasonable, they do exist. 1. It costs a bit more than traditional mascara and you have to commit more time and care with application. (Again, this is a superior product so it is to be expected ) 2. The fibers will get into your eyes and they will transfer to the lid and below the eye during application. Experience and patience will minimize this but not eliminate it from ever occurring. 3. I don&#x27;t wear contacts, but I could see how the fibers (similar to filament dryer lint) could be a problem for people who do. 4. Lifestyle. As I first mentioned, application is a process and this takes time. I&#x27;m not going to be able to do this using the passengers side vanity mirror for a quick &amp;#34;on-the-way-there&amp;#34; makeup job. So for me, I will still need to have traditional mascara on hand for quick applications.  Conclusion: The pictures speak for themselves.  It works. You will love it. It comes off easily when removing the rest of your makeup WITHOUT pulling out your natural eyelashes! And that last bit is very important, because I don&#x27;t want to do anything to temporarily beautify my lashes that ultimately deteriorates the volume I already have.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve posted....I did not care for this product and gave it to someone else to try. The fibers were all over my face and I had to constantly check in a mirror to remove them. Terrible product!!!</li>
            <li> it works amazingly and its works a lot better than other mascara products. The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like about it is that the fibers would fall of but other than that it works great.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use daily but extra oomph for special occasion</li>
            <li> I love them! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not used to spending much time with make-up, but using this two-piece mascara did increase the length of my eyelashes as well as thickness - noticeably.  I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I was so... Excited when I got it on that I tried it immediately. Just one coat and look how long they look! I used a eyebrow comb to help separate the lashes while they were still wet and it works amazingly.</li>
            <li> I have fairly short lashes and have tried many products to get the length and volume I want and THIS WORKS GREAT!!! This does not make them look fake or over exaggerated! In the fraction of the time it would take you to attempt to put false lashes on u can have a great look! I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I have the worlds shortest lashes ever!!! I love strips but who has the time... These 3-D lashes are AMAZING! My new fave makeup staple!!! The picture shows from no lashes to my 2nd application... AWESOME!!!</li>
            <li> . Very satisfied, seems like the more expensive brand.  I really like the whole fiber systems, I do not think it is too hard to apply but it is not easy, just takes time with this type of product but definitely gives much more lashes.</li>
            <li> Nice product. It does was it says. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Tried it multiple ways still clumpy. This product does add volume but I did not see an increase in length. And the fibers start to flake by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Absolutely  love it!.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Protip: You have to read the directions; in fact, read them a couple of times. The only time I&#x27;ve had irritation was on a super humid day where I walked and biked a ton. It was unexpected, and I wouldn&#x27;t have worn this product had I known I&#x27;d be getting all sweaty. Other than that, for day-to-day and for evenings outs, this product is amazing. I do one round of application for work and two for evenings out.</li>
            <li> These are great for the cost.  Love them!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me I&#x27;m the bristles fell off the brush exposing the metal tips</li>
            <li> Good idea...but no. It&#x27;s always clumpy. I for one do not appreciate &amp;#34;spidey lashes&amp;#34; but I mean...if that&#x27;s your thing then sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it ALWAYS flakes off. I wind up with it all over my face and IN my eyes. Burns and hurts like mad, especially with contacts. No thanks. I was excited for it but I&#x27;ll warn everyone against it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. . I had huge beautiful lashes! Works like it says</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, the only thing I could wish for would maybe be an eyelash seperater to be included inside. The product is awesome though, and very much what I expected.</li>
            <li> This is my second order and it is the best.  My eyelashes are so long and fuller when I use the 3D Fiber Lash Mascara.  This is now my go to mascara I will never go back to the old traditional mascara. Thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li> Ever since missing a fiber lash party thrown by a friend of a friend, I&#x27;ve been curious about products like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I know why 3D lashes are gaining popularity!  If you like the look of false lashes this mascara is for you.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t toss your regular mascara, you apply one coat of it as the first step in using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When finished, you get a glamorous flutter. It all comes in a chic case, similar to an eyeglass case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product received to test with the option to review.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara! I am very picky about my eyelash products and this is by far the best. It&#x27;s not hard on your lashes and makes them look so thick!</li>
            <li> Definitely better results than regular mascaras, and does not flake. I wish it would make my lashes look a little thicker in addition to looking longer. It makes them look a little feathery, which might be what you are looking for. Since you have to use regular mascara first before applying, I might have to find one that thickens when I use this (maybe that was my problem?).</li>
            <li> I love this product. My actual lashes are just a little longer than 1/8 inch. This product is amazing! I actually have long, beautiful lashes now. It took a few days to get the technique for me figured out. I do not recommend using mascara first; it causes a great deal of clumping. I use 2-3 very thin layers and my lashes actually touch my eyeglasses. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it! Got here sooner than expected and I tried it as soon as it got here, I already know I will never use anything else! This is the best mascara ever!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!! Everyone asks if my eyelashes are fake!! This IS by FAR the best mascara ever!! I am a customer for life!</li>
            <li> I have to say I am not pleased with this product. I use a lot of mascara and I thought this product would make things easier. I&#x27;ve tried using less of my regular mascara, or more, every time my lashes look clumpy thick and overall bad. I&#x27;ve also found that even when not getting close to the base of my lashes my eyes become extremely irritated and I end up having to take off the mascara completely, after picking out 400 fibers from my eyeballs. I was very excited to try this product but I find that I am overall displeased. I followed all of your tips and directions to a T to try to make this work, but it&#x27;s just not as advertised. I have gone back to using my regular mascara and feel I have wasted my money on this product.</li>
            <li> Great product! Thank you</li>
            <li> I love it thank you so much! I will definitely be buying again soon</li>
            <li> I LOVE the lashes.  Better than extensions</li>
            <li> Love this mascara! Stays on all day!</li>
            <li> Was very skeptical trying these new form of mascaras, but happy I did!! This works great!! :) just make sure to use a lot of the adhesive gel before the fiber lashes go on, or you&#x27;ll get lots of loose fibers in your eyes.  Happy with this product and will re purchase.</li>
            <li> Im so in love with the 3D Fiber lash Mascara. I can&#x27;t  wear fake lashes. So this product os great for me I love it. And will recommend  to everyone</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older I have found my lashes have been thinning. I can&#x27;t use fake lashes due to the glue and shaky hands so I figured I would give 3D lash a try. Wow I love it. It is a four step process that takes all of maybe a min to complete if that. I will let the picture talk for them selves but I did not have any flaking or smudging through out the whole day and I was even able to just touch them up the next day and look great all over again. I am so happy that I was able to purchase this as part of a promotion. No more thin lashes.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have had several eye surgeries and have to be careful what I use.  My lashes are not like they used to be.  I hesitated to buy this for fear it might irritate, as I have purchased several different mascaras, but they irritate and  do not increase your lashes.  This is an excellent product and the company does excellent follow up emails.  I would recommend this to everyone.  I am very happy with this and my lashes look a lot fuller, like they used to be.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.</li>
            <li> They go on thick and actually look good, HOWEVER, if you are in the heat or warmer weather (at an event) and begin to perspire a bit.....lets just say you don&#x27;t need to remove this from your eyes at night. I began to perspire a bit and this ran off my eyelashes so fast,,,,leaving black specks all over my face and burning my eyes. Awful!  If it wasn&#x27;t too late I would return for a full refund.  Might be fine in cold weather....who knows.</li>
            <li> Love the 3D lash mascara. Easy to useüòÄ</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice and the mascara doesn&#x27;t stick like others it kind of just glides on. When ever I used open the oven I could really feel my old mascara like crunch up and stick but whenever I wear the 3D fiber it is not affected at all. it&#x27;s wonderful! I only want to wear it for special occasions they really increase length thickness and they look amazing!</li>
            <li> Came packaged well and timely. Never had tried to do something with my lashes like this product before but after the initial try it was easy and simple. Much easier for me than gluing them on which I can never do properly. Love using a light eye shadow to show how much fuller my eyes look. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Had to return. One tube was dried up:(</li>
            <li> One of the tubes came in completely dried up.</li>
            <li> This is not genuine Younique product.  Younique prohibits sales online.  Careful.  It is an imitation.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes never looked so good!  I love this mascara.  None other compares and I have tried most all of them!  This is now my everyday go to mascara.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Younique a similar product.  I was disappointed in the application.  Too clumpy.</li>
            <li> HOLY MOLY!! This really works! I was born with long thick lashes but as I aged they got shorter. I was going to get extensions but was dragging my feet because of the cost. Well I saw these on FB and thought I would give them a try. I will be reordering them, I love them. Very easy to apply. LOVE LOVE LOVE them. I would recommend them to anybody.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!! My lashes look like I use Latisse.  Really long and lush. I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on looking for the perfect Mascara and this one is it.  I also think the price is very reasonable for the fantastic results.  Latisse is at least a monthly commitment of $100.00 and has substantial side effects. I&#x27;ve ordered a second one to have on hand in my car :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way- this is my first review ever on a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow the directions and take your time.  It&#x27;s important to especially slow down when working with the fibers, because they can get loose and into your eye. But even if they do it&#x27;s no biggie to get them out and only a minor irritation.</li>
            <li> I have short lashes, this product made them thick and long looking. I would recommend and purchase again.</li>
            <li> I got several compliments on when I used this. It was very pretty and made my lashes look soooo full but there was tons of fall out and raccoon eyes. It didn&#x27;t last my work day even with my water proof mascara I use everyday. I really wanted this to work. Maybe it&#x27;s ok for special occasions?</li>
            <li> I love this mascara !!! Here is a picture of my eyes, on the right side I have no mascara at all, on the left side I&#x27;m wearing the 3D Fiber Lash Mascara, and I took a picture of just one eye done so you guys cans see the difference. I&#x27;m so positive, you will fall in love with it !!!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. My only reason for the 4 star rating is that is tends to fall off under the eyes during the day. So you need to keep checking the mirror frequently. Other than that it does exactly what it says it will do. Happy shopping!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I didn&#x27;t find it flakey, nor did it make my eyes water! It&#x27;s so easy to put on also, and looks great! But you do have to follow the instructions!</li>
            <li> Definitely makes my eyelashes look fuller.</li>
            <li> I like a different brand more but thought I would try this.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife and she is loving every minute of her having it on!!!</li>
            <li> I ended up being mildly allergic to this mascara, (my eyes would consistently water &amp; my throat would mildly swell) however I did wear it a few times honestly I bought 3D mascara for a fraction of the price of Lash Factory that worked better. (Not worth the hype). The Mascara clumps easily &amp; you get a lot of fall out product (creates a raccoon looking effect underneath the eye)  will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great product for lengthening lashes.  My daughter and I are addicted.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Started using it after my extensions fell off. Lashes were very short but this mascara did the trick!!!</li>
            <li> I love it. This really works.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product.I was truly impressed with the length and thickness.  that was added. I appreciate the opportunity to try this product and will purchase again. I was not paid to review this product or for my opinion at all by anyone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m putting it on right. Every time I put it on the fiber flackes off into my eyes and bothers me.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this mascara!  I have used name brand mascaras and they leak on my eyelids, clump together and are a pain to take off!  I will never use another mascara again!  I love this mascara it is a life saver to me!</li>
            <li> Best product EVER!!!!!  Will never buy a different mascara again!!!!  As you can see, one eye is done with the Fibers and one is not....such a difference!</li>
            <li> I bought it on a recommendation.  It is ok.  But not what I expected and a bit clumpy.</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying this mascara and I loveee it! Really works with extending your eyelashes, making them look beautiful. I always get asked &amp;#34;are they your real eyelashes&amp;#34; lol.</li>
            <li> Horrible product! It looks so bad and clumpy.  And no, i didnt apply them wrong, all of the sales people that post pictures of their lashes on facebook look the same way. Looks gross like spider legs. Not to mention 2 weeks after i took it off, that crap is STILL stuck to my lashes and ruined my real lashes. Dont waste your money</li>
            <li> The gel mascara is completely  dried out - I would not recommend this product, it did nothing for me since it was defective. Looks as if I&#x27;m not the only one this has happened to as well.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I like it. It&#x27;s not for me. Maybe some others will like it</li>
            <li> I just got this today and omg I am in love I will be buying more I actually look like I have beautiful long thick  eyelashes!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased. I would like a lighter shade . I usually wear black brown. It&#x27;s pretty black. My hair color is blonde. I will defiantly reorder.</li>
            <li> My wife loved these lashes and mascara. Added body to her lashes and she bought them here for&lt;br /&gt;$7.00 less than company website. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Majorly disappointing!!!</li>
            <li> It does increase the fullness in your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Falsies fall off on your face and into your eyes. They do make your eyes bigger but not significantly</li>
            <li> Love love love this product!!  My eyes are too sensitive for lash extensions with glue so I was spending so much on falsies and they are difficult to put on even though I&#x27;ve been doing it for years. This product is super easy and very noticeable. Im in love!!!</li>
            <li> I simply love this product and will purchase more!!</li>
            <li> its alright, just pretty much like any other mascara.</li>
            <li> This mascara is extremely hard to apply without getting clumpy lashes. I even used my dry wand to remove clumps and my eye lashes were still left stuck together. Also this mascara doesn&#x27;t really add as much length as it says it does. After using it I realized that applying two coats of my regular mascara left me with longer length than this product.</li>
            <li> I enjoy having longer lashes. My sister told me about this product.</li>
            <li> WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW LONG IT WILL LAST.WHEN WILL I NEED TO PURCHASE ANOTHER.NO WAY OF SEEING WHEN PRODUCT IS GETTING LOW.</li>
            <li> It works great! Received it today and I love it, makes my eyelashes 10x longer!!</li>
            <li> The mascara does not do the promissed job. Cover girl is acctually better!!</li>
            <li> Love it, love it. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Best thing since sliced bread...fabulous, and it really works,  longest my eyelashes have been in years,  BRAVO, BRAVO</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply with instant results.</li>
            <li> Cheap knock off, not Younique!</li>
            <li> Sorry this was a disappointment. The fibers all fell off my lashes and ended on my face. I followed instructions and still a waste. Looked like I shaved and forgot to wash face. The wand barely scraped fibers off prior to coming out tube so too&lt;br /&gt;Many fibers would end up on wand. I only was nice gave it 1 star because it did make some difference but nothing I was significant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this once since buying 3 months ago and will probably never use it again. It looked okay... not a huge difference from my usual mascara. What I absolutely  hated is the fibers got in my eyes and I spent days trying to get them all out. Complete waste of my money. Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been told by so many people that I need to try 3D fiber mascara. My friends are always looking to find a local sales person to buy it from and act like they just can&#x27;t live without it. So I decided to give it a go. I was a bit surprised to find out that you use it along with regular mascara. The product is easy enough to apply. You put on regular mascara, then a coat of the gel (black like mascara) then a coating of the fibers. The fibers look like tiny chopped off pieces of lint (but not in a ball) Then another coat of the gel. It says apply as many coats as needed. I gave it a shot and I think it did well for some extra volume, but I don&#x27;t see a huge difference. I put regular mascara on one eye and used the 3D on the other. I guess if you have thin eye lashes it will help out a lot, but I didn&#x27;t see a huge length difference. The little pieces fell off a couple times before I got the gel on and fell in my eye, which didn&#x27;t hurt too bad, so try and move quickly and not blink. I see why my friends like it as a few of them have very sparse lashes, so it helps them, but I don&#x27;t see a huge difference for myself. My husband couldn&#x27;t guess which eye had my regular cover girl and which eye had the 3D.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: My sister in law loves it. She says she can see a big difference in her eyelashes. She has light colored lashes and says this helps her out. The product works well for her, so I am updating this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE TO TRY OUT IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW. EVERYTHING IN THIS REVIEW IS MY OWN AND IN NO WAY INFLUENCED.</li>
            <li> Love my 3D fiber lashes!!!! Look how long and full my lashes r!!!! Love them!!!!</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions and it works amazingly! I will always keep some on hand now!</li>
            <li> The tops were off of this product and it was dried out.</li>
            <li> Look natural, almost if I didn&#x27;t wear make up, only thing is you need patience.</li>
            <li> It was for my wife she loves it.</li>
            <li> Does not work as well as I thought it would.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;(</li>
            <li> Truly enhances lashes... love it!!!!  Some of fibers fall after applying and gives you a racoon look. They can be quickly brushed off your face.  Just keep checking a mirror.</li>
            <li> This is a knock off product of the REAL 3D Fiber Lash Mascara form Younique.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by knock off&#x27;s.  get the real thing!!  Just like knock off purses, perfume etc.  You get what you pay for!!</li>
            <li> Why did you copy EVERYTHING from Younique?? Plus, there is nylon is in your product!</li>
            <li> This is truly one of a kind mascara!! Looks just like false lashes, without the hassle of applying falsies!! Absolutely love this product and will continue to use as my only mascara in the future! Extremely pleased!!!</li>
            <li> It works beautifully like anything takes practice but definately changed the look of my lashes I attached a photo with no make up on my eyes and a comparison between mascara alone and mascara with this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The left side has regular mascara and the right has 3d lashes (not that that needed explaining haha)</li>
            <li> fibers get in my eyes</li>
            <li> Absolutely love my 3d lashes, my lashes have never looked so good. Would recommend this product every time to everyone!</li>
            <li> Love this best mascara ever</li>
            <li> I love this!! It is a great alternative to false lashes!!</li>
            <li> It really works, although it seemed to make my lashes thicker more than longer. But they did make my lashes look full and long, as good as if I was wearing false lashes. I made one mistake where I didnt finish by applying my own mascara after I was done and as a result I had fiber flakes all over my face. I didn&#x27;t give it a five star because I wanted longer lashes not such thick ones and because of the flakes of fiber.... I got one in my eye didn&#x27;t cause any harm, but was irritating.</li>
            <li> Love this.  It&#x27;s just as good as Younique, but much cheaper!</li>
            <li> Not happy at all total scam</li>
            <li> So great!  Remember to follow EVERY step to ensure the mascara stays on and doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
            <li> Love it! Wish u had bought it long ago. I definetly see a difference!</li>
            <li> Bought some for my 18 yr old dtr for Christmas...she looked so amazing that I got some for my 21 yr old dtr and myself!! Long beautiful lashes on all of us!</li>
            <li> One of the tubes was completely dried out.</li>
            <li> This is the worst mascara I have ever used!! Save your money and look for something else!</li>
            <li> Item works excellently.</li>
            <li> Horrible, at first I thought I wasn&#x27;t applying it correctly but I followed the instructions to a T. The product is extremely flakey and within an hour it&#x27;s all over ur eyelids and on ur cheeks.  I will not he using this at all. I feel like i wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for a girlfriend and myself who had read the reviews and give it a shot! Although, in theory, it does what is promised, we both found that the fibers were &amp;#34;falling&amp;#34; into our eyes causing us pain, tears and a red eyeball. Both of us returned after trying it for over a week and would highly NOT recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Love my 3D Fiber Lash Mascara. Does exactly what it promises, follow the instructions and you get gorgeous longer lashes. I used a lash brush to ensure they didn&#x27;t clump and kept them separated for a more &#x27;natural&#x27; look. I have long lashes anyway but this made them longer and fuller looking. Love it, and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE them!!</li>
            <li> really like this product but it takes a lot of time and effort to get looking nice. you cannot just apply it quickly like most regular mascaras. It requires your original mascara as a type of base coat, then several additional coats and clumps VERY easily no matter how carefully you are during application. Additional tools are requited to get it looking nice like you see in ads but it really does make lashes look longer and thicker. Definitely delivers results. Very easy to remove and so far, I have not experienced smudging or flaking from this brand.</li>
            <li> This is easy to do and the best thing I&#x27;ve ever done.  I finally feel like I have my eye lashes back and they are beautiful and long again.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had pretty eyelashes but as I grew older, they were not as long as they were when I was in my twentiesand unfortunately age makes them not so pretty and much more space.  I feel so much better now.  Love this product and I have even recommended it to my mom.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different mascara and none of them give the results this product does!!!  Thanks you 3D people!!!  üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç</li>
            <li> What a great difference. .love it</li>
            <li> I think this 3D Mascara is so much fun! I had been wanting to try 3D Fiber Lash Mascara for a while now.  I like how easy it is to tell the difference between each Lash applicator. One looks like regular Mascara, and I just applied that normally, and then I used the Fiber Brush (It looks like a soft Felt) What helped me even out my fibers was putting another coat of the first liquid mascara on, and then I used an eyebrown/eye lash brush to make my lashes really pop more.  I think it&#x27;s a lot of fun, and my eye lashes were long.  I received product at discount for my opinion.</li>
            <li> It certainly does make a difference if you do not have naturally long lashes.  It thickens and lengthens...it works.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are very thin, this product makes it look like I have eyelashes, not hard to use, just remember to clean off every night or the fibers start to clump and fall, this is to be expected if not removed regularly</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!! Easy to use.  Gives you the look of falses without the hassle.  Priced well</li>
            <li> Was not a bit impressed smearing was a big issue stopped using after a week...who wants raccoon eyes??</li>
            <li> Amazing, amazing, amazing! I love this stuff, who doesn&#x27;t?! Makes me look like cat woman lol.</li>
            <li> This product exceeded my expectations!  It is very easy to apply and actually makes my lashes longer.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> The fibers fall into your eyes and face</li>
            <li> 3d mascara was always something I wanted to try. I am super glad I did! It has taken some getting used to but now that I have the hang of how to use it it is now my favorite thing to use!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE it!!!!  My lashes look awesome!!!!</li>
            <li> Fantastic if you&#x27;re patient and follow the instructions properly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, sometimes the fibers do fall on your undereye or above the lid. so be cautious of that</li>
            <li> A friend introduced me to this and I love it!  My lashes double in thickness and length.  I have light blonde lashes and can&#x27;t go without mascara but this gives me lashes I&#x27;ve always dreamed of!  I gave it four stars because if you don&#x27;t have a good lash comb to separate and define your lashes, it can be a little clumpy.  Wish practice I probably won&#x27;t need the comb.</li>
            <li> I like this but it flakes in my eyes.. Someone told me to close my eye when applying and that does help some!</li>
            <li> First day using it, followed the instructions exactly and my eyelashes aren&#x27;t any longer or thicker than they get with the Loreal Paris Double Extend Tube Mascara ($10). The Loreal product sometimes requires a minor touchup to the tips as the goop that extends them is white and once in awhile it wears off the tips. I am going to experiment this weekend with both brands to see if I can make the 2 together give better results. OH and the 300x flakes off into your eyes.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product! My lashes look like longer and fuller. Easy to apply and take off.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely horrible and is not worth your time, money and effort. I received the product and what do I get? The wrong brand with the transplanting gel missing. I never want to buy from this brand again and I recommend that you don&#x27;t either. This is going straight back to the factory it came from and I&#x27;m getting my money back.  I can&#x27;t believe they were foolish enough to send me a product that isn&#x27;t even completely whole. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY!!!!</li>
            <li> While the product worked well, after a few hours my eyes became extremely red and irritated.</li>
            <li> Love this!  My lashes just about doubled in size just with one coat.  It&#x27;s really easy to use, lasts all day, and easy to remove at the end of the day.  And so much faster than putting on multiple coats of mascara.  I just use one coat of mascara, a coat of the get, a coat of fibers, and a last coat of gel, no more time consuming than putting on multiple coats of just mascara and the end result is so much better and fuller.</li>
            <li> It really works was nervous because of the mixed reviews but over all very happy made my lash ridiculous long.</li>
            <li> Did a pretty good job. It did make my lashes look longer, but was a little messy.</li>
            <li> This is a mess, the fibers are gonna make me go blind, I don&#x27;t wear this</li>
            <li> Definitely a very nice product and make a huge difference in lashes.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. So easy to use. I just received my second lash factory. Mascara is the only makeup that I wear and this stuff makes my eyelashes look amazing.</li>
            <li> Never thought my scanty lashes can be made to look naturally fuller! Simply love it. Very easy to use and stays fresh for good 8 hours. Have not tried to wear it longer than that.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have purchased several times and it never disappoints.  Best alternative to false eyelashes</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t impressed, I thought, ew, this stuff is all over my face.  Then I started to learn to use it, and damn, my lashes are fierce!  It&#x27;s a process but it&#x27;s worth it.  I can&#x27;t afford to get lash extensions so this stuff is the next best thing!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Just trying to keep up with the youngsters! Fiber lash mascara is an easy way to give more volume to my sparce lashes. Gotta keep up with my daughter and friends!</li>
            <li> Great, tried others not happy with them, lash factory is the best I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to apply, huge lashes :)</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of this product. The fibers would fall into my eyes, which would sting a lot, or above my cheeks, which would look unclean.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t clump &amp; truly makes the lashes longer! Every time I wear this I get compliments on my lashes.</li>
            <li> this item is misleading.. it is NOT like Younique&#x27;s fiber mascara</li>
            <li> Great does a great job looks like you have false eyelashes on</li>
            <li> I love, love this product!! It is very simple to use &amp; left my lashes looking longer and much fuller, but not fake!</li>
            <li> I only used it twice so far and it goes on very well.  My eyelashes are very light and thin so it makes them look vibrant and I get so many compliments on my eyes.  I recommend this product...</li>
            <li> The instructions were easy and the results are wonderful. Only downside the gel dried very quickly and it took multiple applications to get the desire look. I will repurchase...</li>
            <li> Not happy with this purchase. Gel was very runny and did not work properly, the fibers would not attach to the gel so more of them ended up on my eyeball, which is very uncomfortable. Overall bad experience with this product and would not reccomend. I should have paid the extra $7 and went with the younique 3D Fiber lashes, they work great and make your eyes pop.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product. It went above and beyond my expectations. My lashes look so great some think I have on false lashes. They are 500% fuller and longer. I would recommend this product for every lady!!</li>
            <li> does it come in dark brown or brown/black ?? other than the color I love it because it is very EASY to remove.</li>
            <li> causes eye irritation only if you get it in your eye.  Wears well</li>
            <li> Really makes ur eyelashes huge. I will buy again !!</li>
            <li> This mascara is beautiful. It is very light and does not clump or feel heavy on your eyes. It is very easy to use and it stays on well.</li>
            <li> I like it! You can make it as bold as you want by layering it. I use my own mascara instead of the gel. I would suggest you use mascara that has a brush that will help separate your lashes. Once you add the fibers it can get a little crumpy but overall I like it and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Kind of sucks! I mean i like it but i dont, the fibers dont really stick -_-</li>
            <li> I have pretty sparse eyelashes, but with this they look fabulous! Sometimes I get some fibers in my eyes but that usually when I over do it. It lasts pretty long and looks great.</li>
            <li> Fun to put on. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the longest and the fullest my eyelashes have ever looked. I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I liked the product but it wasn&#x27;t as good as Younique one. I have tired both and I would say that the Younique one is more noticeable. I was really hoping this product would be better, because of the price but it is not. You can tell on your eyelashes that you apply the fiber but I feel that the eyelashes get tangle a lot more than with the Younique one. I will probably not buy from again but  I&#x27;m happy that I was able to try this one to see the difference.</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered this product it was great, ordered again. This time it seems not as good, the gel is much dryer and the fiber wand isn&#x27;t as full. I am disappointed. Prior I used another brand. Looks like I will be changing back to the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; brand.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this was nothing like the other product that I purchased. I barely saw a difference for when I apply two kinds of mascara. Background is I bought it&#x27;s competing product in April come mid June I realized I needed to re-up on some more but I didn&#x27;t  like the price ($30). I found lash factory and read the reviews and decided to give it a try. Mistake, once opened it looked like my previous product after 2 1/2 months of use. There were barely any fibers on it and the ones that were was very clumped. Also, the gel, although goopy (lack of better term) just didn&#x27;t seen to make the lashed stick or come on easily on my real lases. Like I said before, I tried their leading competitors product and it was by far money well worth it. Just a note to self, you get what you pay for. I should have spent the extra $8 and stuck with it&#x27;s competitor&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> Amazing it does what it says!!</li>
            <li> There are a lot of fiber lash mascaras out there and I thought I was ordering something else but I love this product.  I&#x27;m 51 and have straight eyelashes.  I have to curl them everyday.  My lashes have started to thin and this product is amazing at making my lashes fuller and longer.  It takes a bit of practice though.  I curl and apply my regular mascara.  Then work quickly and apply the gel about 21 strokes then lightly apply the fibers from mid lash to the ends.  It will look clumpy but don&#x27;t worry.  Quickly apply the gel mascara again (it thins out the fibers) and invest in an eyelash comb.  Most of the time I don&#x27;t need the comb.  Some days I only use the gel over my regular mascara.  If you have fibers under your eyes or on your cheeks, you are using too much.  A little of the fibers goes a long way and it stays put all day.</li>
            <li> Great product.  My eyelashes are very thin and even thick mascara was not helping.  These appear as if I have had implants.  It is also very easy to remove.  The company sends tips on how to use the product when you order, which has been very beneficial as well.  There were flakes getting into my eyes and they sent information to avoid this.  Great product, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I expected it to make my lashes longer... &amp; the fibers get into your eyes a lot its basically the same as any of them just with the irritating fibers</li>
            <li> Not worth it at all. My Cover Girl mascara works 10 times better.</li>
            <li> You can get the same look with a lot of  mascara, but it&#x27;s cool to have!</li>
            <li> My eye lashes are already long, just not thick enough.  Tried 2 coats but didn&#x27;t lengthen much more then regular mascara but I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s because my lashes are already long.  Thickened nicely.</li>
            <li> I have gotten the lashes and absolutely love them. They have been so much easier than using fake eyelashes. They give me the look that I was wanting without all of the extra work involved. With them being so easy to apply, they save me time in the mornings when applying my makeup and I get so many compliments when I use them. Thank you for the product and I plan on using them for a long time.</li>
            <li> I like it about as much as I live the Loreal product with the white mascara on one end to extend and the black to cover... In fact, Loreal MAY be better!  Will update  after my next use.</li>
            <li> Worst product ever!!! &amp;#34;Fibers&amp;#34; kept falling during the day!!</li>
            <li> Does what it says but drawback is it starts to fall off throughout the day!</li>
            <li> Crazy fast shipping, very helpful instructions. I thought it was easy to use and the results are amazing. My eye lashes are naturally pretty long and thick, so I will probably only use this for special occasions bc they are insanely long when I use this!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright, don&#x27;t get near moisture!</li>
            <li> I have blonde, very sparce lashes, wow I had visible lashes! AND easy to remove.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an experiment.  It works as advertised if you follow their tips - only apply one eye at a time, re-apply gel liberally after applying fibers (that prevents flaking), use an eyelash comb to separate lashes.  One tip I would add is apply gel and then fibers to top AND bottom of top lashes, you get a more drastic look with less applications.  I gave it 4 stars because the process is a bit tedious and takes longer than I&#x27;m used to, but the results are pretty amazing and when I wear it my whole family has commented on how pretty my eyes look.  I don&#x27;t use the product everyday but when I do I love it.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I have naturally long eyelashes. So, when I bought this product I expected what all the other reviews claimed:  my actual lashes to look so long that others would expect them to be fake. For me, this product was comparable to a good mascara with added steps. It works well...but it doesn&#x27;t work wonders!  Perhaps I have too high expectations but the day I hear someone comment on how abnormally long my lashes look is when I&#x27;d change my 3 star rating into 5 stars. I have had it for a month and have had no such encounter.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.I recommend them. Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> So I have been following the hype on Facebook and I ordered this through Amazon because there was Prime free shipping and a lower price than buying directly from YouNique.  I have used this product as instructed and my results haven&#x27;t been the same as some people have had on the internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the case the two product tubes come in. It&#x27;s a very nice, sturdy carrying case and I appreciated this extra bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final, completed look on the eyes is surprisingly very nice and somewhat professional looking. I was expecting tarantula eyes, and I didn&#x27;t experience that at all. It does extend eye lash appearance and the black mascara enhances the depth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately what I don&#x27;t love is the all day irritation of the tiny fibers that are not sticking to the lash. I followed all of the instructions to the letter and still getting small flaking of the fibers falling off, and into my eye causing redness and irritation.</li>
            <li> Wow! I have naturally long lashes but this made them wow and thick. Probably won&#x27;t use every day but I love it.</li>
            <li> so I followed the directions and the fibers still fell off...to the point people kept wiping my face of the &#x27;fibers&#x27;. did it work? Yes I guess but not great and not for an extended period of time. NOTE: I gave it 3 stars because honestly my eyelashes stuggle to keep mascara of anykind...soooo cant fault the product fully!</li>
            <li> Clumpy and lumpy.  Does not go on well at all.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery..  Excellent products..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I really feel about this. The pro&#x27;s are, love the case, its awesome!  It is easy to apply if you pay attention to the instructions.  It did make my lashes look a little more full, but they didn&#x27;t look any longer, in fact, what I dislike about this item is that I feel like the mascara, the gel, and the fibers weigh down my lashes, especially if you try to do another coat of the 3D, if you do they go completely straight.  I was honestly a bit sad because everything else was cool but the end result pretty much fell apart after 10 minutes and your lashes will be straight.  I would prefer my regular mascara over the 3D mascara simply because my mascara holds my curl and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I used it for the first time yesterday and was in 110 degree heat for over 5 hours sweating and there was no issues. They look and feel amazing. Recommened highly to my coworkers</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I was a skeptic at first especially since it was on amazon but this has exceeded my expectations. I have it for a while now and its perfect for everyday wear or just for special occasions. My photo is with only one coat on. You can tell the differences in my eyelashes with and without it. I have sensitive eyes and does not irritate my eyes at all. Just use eye makeup remover to get it all off at the end of the night. I love this product and can&#x27;t imagine using anything else now!!</li>
            <li> I just love it. Your lashes not only look long but thicker.&lt;br /&gt;Buy this product!!</li>
            <li> Maybe I can&#x27;t get the hang of them</li>
            <li> Thick,long lashes. Love the way my lashes look. Easy to apply and remove.</li>
            <li> Best mascara ive ever used. It does take some practice to get a technique going but if long lashes is something that you struggle with like myself you won&#x27;t regret trying this stuff. Also, removal is so much easier than other mascaras. You can literally use just water and it will come right off. Ive tried all kinds of brands and very expensive mascaras but have seen the most results from this brand.</li>
            <li> Dont get the dry fibers in your your eyes or your eyes will turn red. After a few hours it starts to flake off as well</li>
            <li> I am very very happy with the purchase of the 3D Fiber Lash Mascara.  Use it every day, no more wrestling with false eyelashes (are they straight, even etc . . ) and mascaras that really don&#x27;t thicken or lengthen.  I will purchase again . . . .  FOREVER!!!.</li>
            <li> This works great.  As you get older your lashes thin out.  It took me about 4 times of putting this on the get the hang of it, but I will never use regular mascara again.  You can keep adding  to make them loner.  I do a length I like doing 3 coats.  Definitely do one eye at a time.  Seems to help if the liquid tube is warmed up a little.  Put in your pocket or a cup of warm water.  This works!!!</li>
            <li> Once I applied the Gel and Fibers and Gel again, it looked like I had lash extensions on!! I love. I will never go back to regular mascara again!!</li>
            <li> I freakin love this mascara !!</li>
            <li> This product works great!! I have very short lashes and this product gives them amazing length and volume. It is worth the price!</li>
            <li> Been using this for almost a year now and I will never go back. So obsessed.</li>
            <li> This product was not bad but it also did not work as much as I was hoping. For longer lashes it works okay, but it doesn&#x27;t create much volume and it flakes off easily.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. The cheaper one&#x27;s work better than this brand. Sticky and terrible to apply before a week was up.</li>
            <li> It does make a significant difference in the length and thickness of my lashes. I did see small flakes on my eyelids and cheeks, but i&#x27;m sure those are there because I didn&#x27;t apply enough gel to seal the lash.  Removal is a breeze.  I gave it 4 stars because the gel is very thick and can cause clumping.  However, I&#x27;ve found that sticking the tube in a cup of hot water for about a min warms it up enough to thin it out and make it easier to apply.  This is a very cool product and a much better and cheaper alternative to false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I don&#x27;t think I would ever use another mascara again. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is, the fiber gets into my eyes and it feels like sand in my eyes. I tried not looking up when I&#x27;m applying it but still goes to my eyes. I tried working one eye at a time but the fiber still falls in my eyes. If you have a better way to apply it, let me know. Overall, happy to find a mascara that makes my eyelashes longer and thicker naturally.</li>
            <li> I love it! It the best</li>
            <li> I have fairly long lashes, but like them full (not spidery) and lush, I am also always running late. Lol so I thought one coat and done ? I will try it. Result? Love it! Works perfectly! No more multiple applications of the regular stuff, long, beautiful, thick eye popping lashes in one and done!</li>
            <li> Works great! Really made my eyelashes look great. Customer service is excellent ! I received two follow up emails from lash factory with tips on how to apply.</li>
            <li> Nice. The mascara was as I had expected it. Very nice product. Last all day!! I would purchase this product again and would recommend as well.</li>
            <li> Really, nothing more to say about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Christine Maldonado</li>
            <li> Great product! I apply it in the morning and never have to reapply. I typically only do one coat of this, any more and it looks too heavy and your lashes clump together terribly. I start off by applying a little bit of my normal mascara, just for color. I then apply the gel, then the fibers, then the gel again to seal it. The fibers are soft, but if you do not apply enough gel they will fall on your cheek or in your eye. They do not hurt when they get in your eye but they make your eyes water. I am definitely going to be continuing to use this product in the future.</li>
            <li> a little clumpy and almost gone after 3-4 uses</li>
            <li> dont waste your money on these. It takes longer to apply this more than puting fake lashes on. When applying the fiber mascara, it sprinkles around your cheeks and face. it looks like you just stepped out of a salon from getting your bangs trimmed and they didnt clean the hair around your face.</li>
            <li> Gave as gift and she loves it</li>
            <li> This really does work!  I was on the fence with this because of all the mixed reviews but this gave me lush, dark, thick, long lashes.  I have no problem with irritation - I follow the directions and don&#x27;t get close to my roots but concentrate on the tips.  I don&#x27;t even need to use mascara with this -- i just use the 2 steps.  One day I&#x27;m going to have to try all 3 steps and see how really lush my lashes get!</li>
            <li> I have fallen in love with this mascara definitely worth the money. Didnt know if I should get the younique so I went for lash factory and I love it. I still plan on getting the younique to see the difference between the two but this is a great buy.</li>
            <li> If you use this product correctly your lashes are amazing!! Love it!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do as described and it burned my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have eyelashes again!  It has been over 20 years since I have used mascara and I don&#x27;t like the hassle of fake eyelashes.  I also don&#x27;t like the \\&quot;overdone\\&quot; look that fake eyelashes can give.  I have very thin and short eyelashes plus oily skin.  Mascara tends to become raccoon eyes very quickly on my face.  This product has solved all of these problems.  And I am particularly happy that these are \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ingredients.  Just yesterday I wore the product for 8 hours, dancing (which means sweat) and the product held up -- no flaking, no running, no raccoon eyes.  Very very happy with this purchase.  I also hear that Younique Mood Fiberlashes has had similar success and will probably try that as well (when this purchase runs out).</li>
            <li> The first shipment did not reach me. I had to repurchase the item, but Amazon did upgrade to overnight shipping for free. Always great customer service at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the product itself is just mediocre.  I have to use 4 coats minimum of the gel and the fibers for them to actually show.  The fibers do not blend in well, and look clumpy even after being combed through.  I have found that if I use a coat of regular mascara as the final coat, the fibers hide better.  The application process takes a while ladies, so don&#x27;t rush yourself for the first few applications, or you will end up looking clumped.&lt;br /&gt;I wish the fiber brush had a better filter, and thicker comb because I feel that the application would adhere better, waste less fibers, and be less clumpy</li>
            <li> This is not as great as the Cherry Bloom will go back to the Cherry Bloom.</li>
            <li> Honestly, not that impressed. Doesn&#x27;t look any bigger/longer than any regular mascara.</li>
            <li> 3D Fiber Mascara was great..It made my lashes longer and fuller.  I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work was really dry and the fibers got in my eyes.  I threw away.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing... To see with my own eyes how my little tiny eyelashes became long and beautiful was amazing... Love the fact that this product gives me longer lashes without the maintaince of fake lashes.... Absolutely love this product!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I cannot believe how real my lashes look! Yes I have lashes now!! It&#x27;s a little messy putting it on but it does work and no more fake lashes!!</li>
            <li> The fiber dropped in my eyes make my eyes red. I don&#x27;t like it n don&#x27;t use any more</li>
            <li> Lash Factory uses the same case, and the same tubes, and even the same titles as Younique, leading people to believe they are buying the Younique 3D Lashes but they are NOT YOUNIQUE. Then, they &amp;#34;discount&amp;#34; the $29 price, but charge shipping of $6, which is the same exact price Younique sells for.  Younique also offers FREE SHIPPING for all orders of $100+, and you can earn Hostess Freebies, and support your friends so why would people buy this imposter brand? Because Lash Factory fools them into believing it is the official 3D Lashes. BUYER BEWARE.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes looked great and it is easy to use BUT when I applied the mascara over the gel, the mascara brush left little fibers (that look like little eyelashes) that fell/shed down my face upon applying and throughout the day.  The fiber debris comes off easy but every time I looked in the mirror, I saw the fallen debris on my face.  I&#x27;m returning this product.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve had this for a few days now, and overall I&#x27;m not impressed. It doesn&#x27;t really lengthen my lashes and the fibers tend to be 1. Clumpy and 2. Really loose. By loose I mean as many that get on my lashes fall on my face.</li>
            <li> I was impressed that this actually works. I noticed the negative reviews complained about one tube being dried out. That&#x27;s the way it is supposed to be. Apply the wet coat, then the dry fiber coat, then the wet coat to seal again. I like to look natural so I just do one application and it adds a bit of length that actually does last all day and I find with it I don&#x27;t need eyeliner which I love. And it comes off easily with soap and water which is a must for my makeup. I would definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Tends to flake after a few hours</li>
            <li> Do not hesitate, this stuff is amazing. I was trying to simplify my make-up routine and had been experimenting with just false eyelashes and some attention to my brows in order to streamline the time and effort. False eyelashes did not save me any time but I really, really liked the look. This gives the exact same effect without any hassles. Goes on easily, stays on and comes off at the end of the day without any special treatment.</li>
            <li> I received this as a Christmas gift and had no idea what to expect, but I love it!!! I watched a few YouTube videos to see how other people liked it, and the best way to apply it and I&#x27;m hooked! My lashes are so long and thick, they look fake! I was worried about getting loose fibers in my eyes or all over my face but the primer gel really keeps them in place! And it really doesn&#x27;t take much longer to apply then putting on a few extra coats of mascara. Love it!</li>
            <li> Gives my sparse eyelashes a whole new look.</li>
            <li> My wife used this and said while it works as well as the original Younique brand, it doesn&#x27;t last anywhere near as long and therefore she&#x27;s going back to the original.</li>
            <li> I dont see what the hype is but it does what it says so...</li>
            <li> I was so excited for this mascara. I was constantly checking my mail hoping it would come in! Well it did and of course I opened the package and started going through and examining everything. When I opened the tube with the fibers the wand broke and left the spoolie inside the tube. I&#x27;m very disappointed that I didn&#x27;t even get to try it once. Total waste of my money :(</li>
            <li> ends up looking quite clumpy, I&#x27;m going to keep working on technique when applying it.  Not overly thrilled with it considering the price.  Having an eyelash brush/comb is definitely required/helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: A couple weeks later I ended up getting the semi-permanent eyelash extensions and they look AMAZING.  I think this is the route I&#x27;ll go considering I just don&#x27;t always have the patience or time to properly apply this mascara (aka so as not to end up with spider leg looking lashes).</li>
            <li> Love how this makes my lashes look. Use a clean lash wand to comb thru any clumps but this works great!</li>
            <li> I HAVE NEVER WRITTEN A REVIEW ON ANY ITEM BEFORE....BUT I HAD TO ON THIS PRODUCT.  IT ABSOLUTELY WORKS WONDERFULLY!!!!!  I WAS SKEPTICAL, BUT AFTER RECEIVING MY PRODUCT AND TRYING IT THE FIRST TIME....IT MADE A BELIEVER OUT OF ME.  I WILL DEF BE ORDERING THIS PRODUCT AGAIN.  FROM NOW ON, 300X FIBER LASHES BY LASH FACTORY WILL BE A &amp;#34;MUST HAVE&amp;#34; IN MY MORNING ROUTINE &#x3D;)  LOVE IT &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> It makes my eyelasges look bigger</li>
            <li> Was skeptical about this product but I really love it makes your lashes look so much fuller.</li>
            <li> First time buying fiber lashes and was not too impressed. Looks good at first but the fibers keep falling off throughout the day and seemed to irritate my eyes. I don&#x27;t know if that is normal with fiber lash but not planning on using anymore.</li>
            <li> Love this!! Best mascara i have ever used! I have naturally straight but long eyelashes which can be such a pain tocurl and get to stay but this mascara doesnt weigh them down!:)</li>
            <li> This product did make your lashes seem a little longer but not much, the more i tried to make them longer the more they clumped up. Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product! I was ordering from Younique but this works just as well, if not better. I DEFINITELY will order again and recommend this to my friends...</li>
            <li> They are great! My eyelashes are so think and long it&#x27;s amazing! Also the customer service is great, they emailed me to make sure I got them and also provided additional tips for the product. Love this!!</li>
            <li> It works good, but getting an eye infection when using this product is not fun at all...very unsatisfied</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work like I thought it would</li>
            <li> Yes, this product gives me longer looking lashes. Works just fine with 1-2 coats.</li>
            <li> Does not work as well as Younique.  Fibers fall everywhere during application.</li>
            <li> leaves a lot of little black flakes on your face. Doesnt make my lashes longer, maybe a little thicker</li>
            <li> Works great.  Less expensive than some I have seen.</li>
            <li> I have never had much luck with mascara, but this was a dream!  Definitely improvement in lashes - more than any other product I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried them all!  Hooked on this one for life!</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this product as I have been wearing lash extensions for a while and want to opt for something i could do at home.  Let me say this, the service was AMAZING!!!  I got my product earlier than expected and received a few follow up emails about how best you use the product, how to apply and other tips.    I am used to wearing individual lashes (I&#x27;m a little addicted to them).  But, I took the lashes off of one eye and tried this product and it is actually pretty good.  I definitely get length.  I don&#x27;t get the same fullness I see when I wear individuals but that&#x27;s like comparing apples and oranges.    I am happy with the product and once i get the hang of it, may try to wean myself off of the individuals which have left my lashes very sparse!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the best at doing makeup but this stuff really works! It&#x27;s pretty easy to use, it gets a little clumpy for me but i think that relates more to my skill level then the actual product. It comes with instructions on how to use it, works better then i thought it would. Whenever i wear it i always get compliments and sometimes people even ask if I&#x27;m wearing false lashes i can get them so long!</li>
            <li> Easy to use &amp; great results!</li>
            <li> My Lady loves this product.</li>
            <li> not the best brand and dryer and seemed like less product inside then yopuniques</li>
            <li> No comparison to the brand I thought I was ordering, which is Younique.  I do not recommend Lash Factory brand.  I sent it back.</li>
            <li> Excellent mascara.  It looks like I have lash extensions on when I wear it. You must follow the directions though.</li>
            <li> The product I received was dried out and did not work.  I didn&#x27;t have the return information to return the product. I requested it in an email, but it wasn&#x27;t answered.  Not a good experience</li>
            <li> Looks similar to name brand, although I can&#x27;t get as long of lashes as pictures show.  Defiantly thicker though.</li>
            <li> I love them! Exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t blown away by this product. Also, the little fibers without fail always get in my eye. I have tried &amp;#34;setting&amp;#34; it with the gel, but it didn&#x27;t help. I was really hoping that it would be a good replacement for my false lashes -- not so much.</li>
            <li> They work AWESOME!!!!!  And quality just like the expensive ones!</li>
            <li> Love these 3D lashes. It really makes my lashes look very very long.  Amazing.</li>
            <li> This is an exceptional product.  I have very thin and short lashes.  My daughter introduced me to this product as she is a cosmetic artist by trade.  I was amazed the very first time I saw the product.  I have lashes now.  I can even choose to have &amp;#34;Bambi&amp;#34; lashes if I am so bold to do so.  The product does not flake off.  It adheres to the lashes until I take my makeup off at night.  I have tried another brand but am sold on this one.  After trying the cheaper version, I am convinced this is the product for me.  I do not have trouble with the fibers flaking or getting into my eyes.  The ease of it going on and not even flaking while putting it on, is a huge selling point for me.  I can not stand something in my eye, and other the other product I tried had tiny fibers that would end up in my eyes just trying to put it on.  I am a very satisfied customer.&lt;br /&gt;I am also very convinced because of the weight of the product.  It adheres, makes long great looking lashes, does not have the tendency to clump, but if you get too much with out letting it dry, it can clump.  It does not weigh my eye lids down with the product and I have put a lot on a couple of times now.  It is terrific.</li>
            <li> the fibers are bigger than the 3d younique brand. not a horrible product but i prefer the small thinner fibbers to avoid it looking so chuinky</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this it is not made with natural green tea fibers and go to Younique and buy 3D fiber mascara it&#x27;s all natural green tea fibers and healthier for long lasting eye lashes.</li>
            <li> Wow! This was my first time purchasing this product and it truly lengthens my lashes. Will buy again</li>
            <li> Great over your mascara lashes makes them long as false eyelashes</li>
            <li> lasts all day long and is easy to apply.  cannot believe how full and long it makes my naturally thin and blond lashes!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughter and daughter in law. They love it</li>
            <li> Love this mascara! It really gives you the fake lash look and makes your eyes pop! I only gave it 4 stars because the fiber tends to always end up underneath my eyes, but I&#x27;m not too worried about it! Other than that I&#x27;m completely obsessed with this product and will never go back to another mascara!</li>
            <li> Love the way that this makes my eyes look.  I just wish it was a little cheaper so that I could use it every day for fabulous lashes.</li>
            <li> This product is a quick fix if you&#x27;re looking for longer, fuller lashes temporarily.  I love the length and fullness it provides my thinning lashes. I have used Latisse in the past to increase lash growth , but this is an expensive prescription that only irritated my eyes. The only downfall of this product is that it takes much longer to apply than regular mascara and once on it looks really heavy - so if you&#x27;re going for an all natural look,  this product may not be for you.  If you&#x27;re going out for a night on the town,  this product will definitely enhance your eyes and lashes.  In order for the product to work successfully you have to follow the instructions to the tee : 1. Apply regular masacara and let dry fully,  2. Apply wet application to lashes, which is similar to applying regular mascara, 3. Apply dry synthetic lashes with dry flat brush - this can be rather difficult at first and lashes may look lumpy, but I have found practice makes perfect. Overall,  this product works well.  Cons are it is way too time consuming and lashes can appear lumpy if you apply too much of the synthetic lash application.</li>
            <li> This mascara is so perfect i love it.... i have never seen my eye lashes so long and full it&#x27;s so amazing and it last all day. I will be purchasing this item again once it runs out</li>
            <li> It might of been good but the Brush broke off n the container so I could not use it</li>
            <li> I love the case and the product what I did not care for too much and it takes getting used to is sometimes the fibers will get into your eyes so let it try between coats will help but you can also use with your own mascara as well</li>
            <li> This mascara was a huge disappointment. I LOVE the  Younique Moodstruck 3D Fiber Lash mascara, but this generic off-brand is nothing like the awesome original products! From now on I&#x27;ll buy the real thing at [...]</li>
            <li> Will use no other product but this! I have short eyelashes, and I have yet to find a mascara that makes my lashes stay and appear large and thick. THIS though... is AMAZING! My sister introduced this to me, and let me say - you need to put this on over your mascara, but once you do, your eyelashes will look like they are fake! (in a good way) I had girls asking me at work how my eyelashes looked so long and it stayed that way all day. You put the transfer gel on, then the fibers. Warning: it does shed at first, so you will need to wipe your finger under your eye to catch stray fibers. After that, works like a charm and comes off easily when you take a shower. LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> Makes them fuller not longer. Feel like I&#x27;ve wasted money. Mia Adora is much better with less effort.</li>
            <li> What a great product!  My eyelashes look twice as thick; I highly&lt;br /&gt;recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I hate it. It&#x27;s clumpy and little fibers get all over the place. Use it FIRST or you will wreck your make-up. One review says to use it properly, the gel tube should be put in hot water. Who has time for that. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I have used to date! Does exactly what it says it will!</li>
            <li> Watch YouTube videos first! It&#x27;s a little tricky, but it&#x27;s worth it once you&#x27;ve got it down. Don&#x27;t sleep with the mascara on, you&#x27;ll wake up with irritated eyes.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed how much fuller it makes my lashes! Happy with the product!</li>
            <li> So glad I purchased two of these!  May be back for more!</li>
            <li> People need to read the instructions. I see a lot of reviews saying &amp;#34;one came and it was dried out&amp;#34; even in the picture it says one is wet and the other is DRY s</li>
            <li> Really enjoying this!!!</li>
            <li> STRIKING RESULT FOR A WONDERFUL MASCARA. PROMISE KEPT AND I SEE MY LASHES FOR THE FIRST TIME.</li>
            <li> wonderful product for those of us not endowed with long thick curly eyelashes</li>
            <li> They REALLY are just beautiful!</li>
            <li> I saw these eyelashes in Baltimore for Sweet Adelines International competition. They are as advertised! Lashes thicker, longer.</li>
            <li> The fiber doesnt stick to the mascara like the younique brand does. Id rather pay a few bucks more for a better product.</li>
            <li> My regular mascara works better than this junk and it smells awful. I&#x27;ve used it one time and don&#x27;t plan to use it again.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to buy a mascara that was so pricey. Believe me it is well worth the money. Makes a huge difference in my lashes! Not too heavy and stays on all day!!</li>
            <li> It works make your lashes look longer</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all! The fibers get all over your cheeks and so hard to get off! I followed instructions perfectly and have been in the make-up and skincare field for over 10 years! Will not buy again!</li>
            <li> Mascara flakes not a daily wear</li>
            <li> The look does not match the advertisement it looks ok but not as dramatic as I expected</li>
            <li> My daughter bought it for me for Mother&#x27;s day. She said she bought it for me because she knows how unhappy I am with my short thin eyelashes. She told me to practice using it before I went to a wedding I&#x27;m going to on Friday. So this morning I gave it a try. Not only was it very easy to put on but with only one coat my eyelashes looked amazing!  I love this stuff! Can&#x27;t wait till Friday,  my eyes are going to look great with eye liner and shadow and my beautiful lashes! I&#x27;m going to do 3 coats! Love it!</li>
            <li> Great product, I am very happy going to give this to all my girlfriends on the Holiday üòäüòäüòäüòä</li>
            <li> although it is easy to apply after 30minutes of wear I checked my face out in the mirror and the fibers were all under and in my eyes... I felt like i had an eyelash in my eye all day.... It looks great when you first apply it but the fibers don&#x27;t stick to the gell like they are supposed to. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> This stuff is bad it gets in your eyes and is almost impossible to get out</li>
            <li> absolutely love itttt. &#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to like this mascara it&#x27;s just that sometimes it&#x27;s gets a little messy. Thank you</li>
            <li> I purchased this mascara on a whim and I was pleasantly surprised by the results (initially). It gave my lashes a fuller look; as if I were wearing fake ones. The only disappointment that I have is regarding the mascara itself. It seemed like after about three weeks of use, it became super clumpy and not able to disburse enough product for the lash fibers to adhere to. I&#x27;m hoping that this is just a one-time occurrence because I really like it. üòü</li>
            <li> Love, love love! I feel like I look tired when I don&#x27;t have my 3d fiber lash on!</li>
            <li> This mascara makes me look I have lots of long lashes and is easy to use. Just read the directions first!</li>
            <li> I think this is a great concept. However, with my tiny lashes, this was a pain. Then, it flaked all day long. Shame too, I&#x27;d love to have eye lashes like everyone else :(</li>
            <li> will buy over and over. Lashes look great!!!!</li>
            <li> This clumped up and flaked</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was more than a little excited to try this fiber last mascara, this was provided to me as a sample for review. It has taken over the beauty world and given an entire new twist to mascara and fake lashes (Which I am never able to apply appropriately so I do not wear them). My lashes are already a decent length but I definitely could use thickness, which I was hoping to achieve with the fiber lash mascara. What an amazing difference it made! But, it is a good learning process like a winged liner, so here is my learning curve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit tricky at first &amp; I got frustrated to figure out how to get beautiful lashes and no flakiness. So I followed the directions to the letter and then I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips for a fail proof method:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Do one eye at a time. This is essential because you apply the gel then quickly apply the fibers while the gel is still wet, wait about 20 seconds for the fibers to set then apply the gel again to seal in the fibers. The sequence is gel-fibers-gel.&lt;br /&gt;2) You can repeat these steps as often as you wish to get the desired effect. I find 2 total coats of the system gives me the look I want.&lt;br /&gt;3) One hint from my own experience - I find it helps to apply one coat of your regular mascara first before you begin the gel/fiber application then seal everything with a final coat of regular mascara. It helps keep the fibers locked in. My routine is regular mascara - gel - fibers - gel - fibers - gel - regular mascara.&lt;br /&gt;4) This removes easily with soapy facial cleanser and water provided you&#x27;re not using a waterproof mascara to seal the whole deal down. If using a waterproof mascara then use some coconut oil or cleanser that melts the waterproof mascara and wash off everything.</li>
            <li> It flakes off quiet often. So it smears under your eyes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it. All it left was extra fiber hairs on my face.</li>
            <li> Maybe it worked for the people on YouTube , but even after carefully following directions and applying several coats it looked no more extreme than if I added a few coats of my regular mascara. Besides how it looks, it takes a considerable amount of time to apply and worst of all it made my eyes burn and itch all night at work. I posted two photos, the first darker one is the product and the other is one coat of my regular mascara. I would say the product fails at lengthening.</li>
            <li> Love this product. No need to use your mascara before applying 3D Fiber Lash unless you are going for super thick or long lashes.</li>
            <li> So, I bought these for my sister so I&#x27;m just the messenger:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Loved them, would definitely buy again&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;-My sister.</li>
            <li> I was searching for an alternative to the Younique 3D Fiber Lashes because of their price and these are the perfect replacement! Not only are they pretty much 99% the same, when compared side by side you can&#x27;t tell the difference in packaging, design and the product. Works exactly the same and bonus points that it&#x27;s 15 dollars cheaper and has 2-day shipping!</li>
            <li> Would not purchase again</li>
            <li> The product is awesome it really does work love it</li>
            <li> I received my order sooner than the the date originally,  so that was great. This product is amazing, no more hastle of applying and wearing false lashes for this girl anymore,  I will be using 3D mascara always. Thank you for the prompt service.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  Everyone always asks me how I get my lashes so long and I don&#x27;t want to tell them my secret!  ;) particles fall under your eye sometimes but that&#x27;s the only con I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> GREAT GREAT PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;I WAS NOT BLESSED WITH GREAT LASHES TO BEGIN WITH&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT&lt;br /&gt;MAKES IT LOOK LIKE I HAVE LASHES</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this purchase.  The fibers really do fill in the lashes.  I love the product!</li>
            <li> They are working nicely for me.  I am curious to see how long these tubes last with daily application?  Good product and even though I have sensitive eyes, these do not bother me at all.</li>
            <li> Just as great as the other brands people sell! The price of this stuff bothered me because I&#x27;m cheap, but it&#x27;s worth every penny.  No joke! I will now not use any other mascara.  When I try to wear something else I notice the huge difference and now can&#x27;t go back.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  Very easy to apply, and stays on all day.  Only drawback is that some of the fibers ended up flaking off under my eyes for the first few times--nothing horribly noticable--but I solved it by applying extra gel after I applied the fibers.  (It was in the manual, I just didn&#x27;t pay attention the first time).</li>
            <li> I tried to buy this 3D fiber mascara instead of the other more popular brand and it was a mistake. This mascara does work to extend your lashes, but not as well and it irritated my eyelids.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara and I can see a difference.  I am still mastering this product.  It is much easier to apply than I thought.</li>
            <li> Didnt like the fibers. They flake off.</li>
            <li> Amazing!! Absolutely amazing product! I have really short lashes and with 3 coats my lashes are long! The fibers did not fall on my face, but I did get. Couple of fibers in my eye. But after awhile it was fine</li>
            <li> Same as Younique but MUCH more affordable! Won&#x27;t be buying Younique again.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Was a bit skeptical at first when I ordered, but now that I&#x27;ve been using it religiously I&#x27;m hooked.  Noticeable difference on my lashes makes my makeup look more dramatic.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product but purchased it anyway. Short lashes have always been a struggle for me. Seriously, though. This mascara is absolute magic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took two minutes to read the instructions and execute the application and when I looked in the mirror I was shocked my the length and fullness of my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is sturdy and attractive and adds to the luxe feel of the product. I love this and can&#x27;t wait to show off my eyes!</li>
            <li> I was hoping to find something to replace my mascara but you need mascara on top of using this product. I have pretty long eyelashes so I was hoping this would make them pop since my lashes are blonde. This made my eyelashes look shorter. I have applied this a few times hoping they would get better if I applied it differently but that wasn&#x27;t it. This stuff flakes too. Big fat thumbs down. Returning!</li>
            <li> Noticed how great my friend&#x27;s eyes looked she told me about this product. Bought it and love it! My daughter tried and loved it.</li>
            <li> This mascara is fabulous , really does what it says, love it.. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product is truly &amp;#34;the bomb&amp;#34;! I love it. I have been using it for two weeks no and am hooked. It is easy to use and the results are amazing. Before, I would put multiple coats of mascara on my eyelashes and not get the same effect as LashFactory. Plus there is no flaking and the look lasts all day. I think it is a fairly natural look also, at least more natural than extensions, because no one has really commented on my really long lashes. It does not bother my eyes and is easy to remove at night. I will definitely buy this product again when this supply runs out.</li>
            <li> LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! That only begins to describe it!!!  I don&#x27;t even have to wear the rest of my eye makeup since using this!!!! Super easy to use and lasts as long as you need them too &amp; comes off easily with soap and water!!!&#x27;</li>
            <li> I love this product. Its perfect. It provides a full set of lashes. The only compliant is that by the end of the day the fibers sometimes scatter under my eyes. I don&#x27;t know if its me doing something wrong or if it just dust off through the day. Otherwise, I love it.</li>
            <li> I replaced mascara for 3DFLM every day.&lt;br /&gt;One I would like to have included in the kit one lash brush to seperate lashes after gel application</li>
            <li> fibers sometimes get in my eyes</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, My eyelashes are blonde so without mascara, they look non-existent. After reading the reviews for lash factory, I decided to give it a shot. I will never ever wear normal mascara again. I get asked at least 3x per week if I have fake eyelashes and I can answer &amp;#34;no&amp;#34; truthfully! I&#x27;ll never give my secret away to those who know me;)</li>
            <li> I feel like this is all hype. Building up different  mascaras with extra layers gave me similar if not the same results. It&#x27;s a decent product, but don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I received this 3D Fiber Lash mascara today in the mail, and I am in LOVE! It comes in a super cute little hard case, which is nice because I tend to have things &amp;#34;hide&amp;#34; from me in my makeup drawer.  I use another brand almost daily, and now will be switching! This was so perfect. I attached 3 photos to show, one with nothing, one with my regular lash extension mascara, and the other with this applied for the very first time. I have no other makeup on in the photos.  I have very blonde eyelashes, and it is hard to even tell that they are there. I don&#x27;t wear a ton of makeup, but when I do, I always wear something for eyelashes.  Many of the fiber lash mascaras seem to shed and hit my eyes, irritating them and making them red. These do not seem to do this. This #D Fiber Lash seems to lay properly and not shed at all.  I did not notice and shedding on my cheek bones either.  I see a huge difference in the before and after of my eyelashes.  I did receive a discount on the 3D Fiber Lash Mascara, but I would buy it at the regular price as well. It works wonderfully! Next time I am going out in the evening, I am going to try for an even more dramatic look!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but when i tried it on my lashes it really  extends my lashes I use it daily&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Never using regular Mascara again! I&#x27;m 100% on board with the 3D Fiber Lash Trend!!! Love love love</li>
            <li> I ordered this product twice... the first came and was unusable as one of the items had completely dried out.  I reordered thinking I just got a bad one, and on receiving the second order, had the exact same experience.</li>
            <li> The bottle that didn&#x27;t have mascara in it was empty and I&#x27;m really irritated with how clumpy the mascara makes my lashes. This the most expensive/worst mascara I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> Not at good as the Veronique that I thought I was ordering.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Still flakes some and gets on my eyeshadow but omg it looks great and makes my eye pop!!! Thanks so much</li>
            <li> Made my eye lashes look amazing! I find it feels like it gets in my eyes, but I&#x27;m new to the product and I&#x27;m getting used to it. I will absolutely continue to use it!</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do extend lashes long but these stink and they clump a lot unless you get the application just right.  I wouldn&#x27;t invest in them.</li>
            <li> I received my order extremely fast.  Actually before I even thought I would receive it.  It makes my lashes a lot fuller the only issue I had was the fibers falling but after understanding the product a little more I no longer have that problem.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this at all. It flaked off into my eyes and on my face. It also didnt give the fullness or length it said it would.  Definitely not worth the price. My regular mascara worka just the same and doesnt get all over for under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Just what I was expecting.  Have used a more expensive brand in the past and these are just as great!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I really do not have much lashes and this adds volume, length and glamour to my eyes which I am not use to. I am glad I purchased this product</li>
            <li> My wife says makes her almost nonexistant eyelashes look lush!!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this and priced right!</li>
            <li> The mascara was awesome! I got so much compliments and also recommended to many others re this product! Very pleased.</li>
            <li> The fibers end up all over your face, some get in your eyes. It is super irritating. Id rather wear false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Omg his is sooooo amazing , I orderd it on Monday and got it Wednesday so that was pretty exciting&lt;br /&gt;it pretty easy to use but it can also make your eyelashes very clumpy if u use to much but over all its amazing</li>
            <li> Great look lt really look like falsiesüòä</li>
            <li> It doesnt even work . Doesnt show any difference , NOT satisfied !!</li>
            <li> I have never once tried using false eye lashes before, but have always thought they looked so pretty when I&#x27;ve seen people wear them. The 3D Fiber Lash Mascara is the best cosmetic purchase I have ever made, and I feel like my eyelashes look too good to be true! The black fibers really thicken the width of the lashes and the wet gel really lengthens them. A perfect combination and well worth the price!</li>
            <li> strange product, not easy to apply, used it once and wasn&#x27;t impressed, I will probably use it again but first impressions weren&#x27;t favorable</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t informed I had to wet the brush for the mascara to work. I got so many fibers in my eyes that I threw it out. I totally wasted my money on your product. I am very disappointed and out several dollars  Chris Wilhelm</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  in love. I did like my natural lashes before his but now I love my lashes. excellent investment.</li>
            <li> I really love the way this 3d fiber lash mascara makes my eye lashes way longer then they are! Makes it look great and I love looking forward to putting it on every day and see how long and beautiful I can get them! Thank U!</li>
            <li> Seems clumpy and fibers flake off as day goes by. Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> What a difference! I really like the 3D Mascara. My lashes look thicker and longer. Handling the fibers and not getting them in my eye took some practice but I got it and it looks great.</li>
            <li> Makes my unnoticeable lashes very noticiable.  Worth every penny!  I posted a picture with 3d lashes on right eye so you can see the difference!  That&#x27;s one coat only!</li>
            <li> LOVE  this product. I feel so confident wearing my OWN lashes now. FINALLY  found something that makes me appear to have fuller lashes and wear less eye liner.</li>
            <li> Love!!!!! Will order from your company again! I have received sooo many compliments on how pretty my eyes are.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the tips. I&#x27;m getting better at applying it. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> It flakes off and gets in your eyes...don&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Makes my lashes look so much bigger.</li>
            <li> Hated it and returned it. Didn&#x27;t even last 2 hrs and flaked on to my face</li>
            <li> I had extensions for over two years and I decided to give my bank account a break so I purchased this product. I&#x27;m not in love with it, but I like it. I&#x27;m only giving it four stars because it did not meet my expectations. I was hoping to get better results for the price.</li>
            <li> Three reasons I don&#x27;t like the product.  Too many steps: 1. apply regular mascara 2. apply gel 3. apply black flaky stuff that falls off all day.  I will never use it again.  I should have listened to those who told me it was awful.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> Love how big it makes my lashes look!</li>
            <li> This product is awful. Smears rubs off on your face. I would like to return. How do I complete a return?</li>
            <li> LOVE this!!! I&#x27;ve been recommending it to all of my friends, it is definitely worth the price.  This is the only mascara that i will wear from now on.</li>
            <li> FINALLY! This is the perfect mascara duo.  It does what it promises. Noticeable difference in my lashes in volume, thickness and length.</li>
            <li> Love the lashes ! I always wear falsies since my eyelashes are so short but now I actually look like I have longer eyelashes with just of mascara on. It&#x27;s so pretty it does take a little practice to get the technique down but when she do totally worth it.</li>
            <li> gives full thick lashes,, love it!</li>
            <li> It worked the same as my regular mascara. Followed the instructions to the tee. Not worth the money</li>
            <li> This is addictive! It makes your natural lashes thick and beautiful..worth every cent.</li>
            <li> It really works and does not appear fake.</li>
            <li> Longer thicker lashes. Takes a little more time to do eye make.</li>
            <li> To accurately use these &amp;#34;fiber&amp;#34; mascaras you do the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) take a small cup and put very hot water in it. Place the transplanting gel tube into cup&lt;br /&gt;2) apply your normal mascara. This serves as a base coat and works wonders&lt;br /&gt;3) open the fibers tube and then grab the transplanting gel from hot water&lt;br /&gt;4) apply transplanting gel to lashes. Be sure to coat good.&lt;br /&gt;5) apply fibers.&lt;br /&gt;6) wait about 45 seconds for fibers to gel not lashes&lt;br /&gt;7) apply one more coat of transplanting gel to set the fibers (this will prevent fall out)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will then put the lid back on gel and place back into hot water, let my lashes set approx. 90 seconds and then repeat steps 3-7 again. This helps intensfy the look.</li>
            <li> I love the 3 D fiber lash. I&#x27;ve use Younique and I can&#x27;t tell the difference. Except the 3 D is less costly.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Great product,  I highly recommend everyone try this.</li>
            <li> Love how my eyelashes look.  The product is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Sheds more than Younique does...</li>
            <li> Fibers get in eyes and end up all over face. My lashes end up shorter and clumpier than before I applied the product. I applied the way instructed. Any suggestions?</li>
            <li> I have only used this product a few times, but I like it a lot! One note of caution is to use it as lightly as possible to avoid clumping. If you do that, you&#x27;ll have your desired effect!</li>
            <li> Amazing my lashes look great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really short lashes this does a great job and gives my eyelashes great lengthüòä.  I would recommend this to all of my friends!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth purchasing can&#x27;t go wrong!! Best mascara ever!</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this a four is because of the smell..product is easy to use, and stayed on all day.</li>
            <li> Love this product, use it daily.  Make sure you follow the directions for best results.  It&#x27;s as good as the so called name brand.</li>
            <li> I do like that the product does in deed, improve both the length and volume of my lashes.  However, I have found that you need to be sure that you place a lot of the second coat of gel after applying the fibers or the fibers will fall off and irritate you eye.  Also go very slowly when applying the fiber coat, if you go too quickly they will fall into your eye and all over your lower lashes.  Overall, I am very pleased with the product, it does what is says it will and their customer service is exceptional.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I love it even more than the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; brand. It lasts longer and isn&#x27;t clumpy. The one tip I would give is just be sure to take your time, and don&#x27;t try to glob it on. Small, thin layers is what you need. Repeat as many times as you want to thicken it up! Thanks much lash factory!</li>
            <li> Love this mascara!!!! Its totally worth every penny..</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it. It irritated my eyes and it flaked all.day.long. Ultimately, it didn&#x27;t even look that great when initially applied. I was really disappointed in the poor quality of this product.</li>
            <li> Good good product. It&#x27;s all I use now</li>
            <li> I am still getting used to the idea of them. I am astonished at the length of them, I wear falsies daily and have come to love them, so as I give the Fiber lashes a chance I am really liking them...</li>
            <li> Now that I have mastered how to apply the lashes I love this product. It makes my lashes look fuller and longer than they actually are. Great product and I will continue to buy them.</li>
            <li> Great product doesn&#x27;t flake gives lashes a natural look.</li>
            <li> Sent to me for review this product is very similar to mascara in that it aims to improve the appearance of your eyelashes by making them fuller, thicker and longer. This is meant to have the overall effect of making you look younger and sexier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whilst applying standard mascara is generally a 1 step process involving just adding liquid to your eyelashes via a brush this product is totally different as it involves a 4 step process which actually involves using your own mascara as the 1st step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To summarise the steps you firstly add your own mascara and leave it to dry, you then add the transplanting gel to your lashes and then apply the natural fibres to your eyelashes whilst the gel is wet. You then reapply the transplanting gel onto the eyelashes to secure it all together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes impressively presented in a smart retro case (similar size to prescription spectacles case) and has inside it the gel and fibres in a pen sized tube which are in fact a similar size to mascara. They come with full instructions which are quite easy to follow but I personally found all the information on the product page, instructions and the additional instructions I received via E-Mail to overcomplicate the whole process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results were good after the 1st application and were a lot better after the second application. It&#x27;s also water proof and overall it worked well although I didn&#x27;t expect customers to need to use their own mascara and for it to be a 4 step process. Certainly worth trying given that you have the free 30 day guarantee to fall back on.</li>
            <li> As long as you apply these correctly and remember to use a generous amount of gel after you put the fibers on these are awesome.</li>
            <li> Really like the 3D Fiber lash Mascara, I don&#x27;t have long lashes and this really make my eyes look bigger, just love it</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic ! I&#x27;ll be purchasing it again for sure.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with not only the speed of delivery, but the product itself.  It is no harder to apply than any other type of mascara and I will absolutely recommend it to all my &amp;#34;lashless&amp;#34; friends, and will order again.</li>
            <li> Product works as advertised, but I found that the Younique product works a little better.  I have very short, very straight Asian eyelashes and this type of product does make my eyelashes look much longer.  They don&#x27;t look as long as the advertisement, but my eyelashes are way shorter than average.  It is definitely worth the month if you want your eyelashes to look longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it came in brown.  Also, I have had to use a regular lash brush as the brushes get way to goopy and clumpy and thick.  It took me awhile to figure it out, but with practice the look has gotten better.  Does not stay on all day though.  Whatever you are using to &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; it could be more like regular mascara, which I put over the top of it after the sealer coat and that seems to make it last longer without having to reapply later in the day.</li>
            <li> One very long term customer here...very pleased!</li>
            <li> Love love 3d fiber lash mascara 300x, I will never go back to fake lashes again! My only complaint is it come out a little clumpy I gues it just takes practice. . But really awesome!!</li>
            <li> I love these lashes! After getting lash extensions my real lashes were a mess. This mascara is amazing. I use it every day and will NEVER use a regular mascara again.</li>
            <li> I totally love this mascara!  I always wondered how celebrities (Kim Kardashian, etc.) had such long eyelashes. I couldn&#x27;t see any signs of false eyelashes. My guess is that they are also using fiber mascara - because I got the same result after applying it!&lt;br /&gt;My eyelashes are normally &#x27;dinky&#x27; but with this mascara they look so full and natural and beautiful. I truly feel more attractive when I wear it!</li>
            <li> THIS IS A SCAM! I RECEIVE THIS PRODUCT AND IT WAS ALREADY DRY! SO IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK! IT&#x27;S HORRIBLE!! THE DRY MASCARA(short one) IS HORRIBLE! IT LEAVES A LOT OF BRISTLES AND IT GET&#x27;S IN THE EYE!!! IF YOU WEAR CONTACT LENSES IT IS NOT GOOD!!! YOU CAN GET AN IRRITATION! THE SMELL OF THE MASCARA IS ALSO NOT GOOD! IT SMELLS LIKE A CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE. :( SO SAD ABOUT THIS!</li>
            <li> Best mascara EVER. Won&#x27;t be without it now that I&#x27;ve found it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff .. I personally think it&#x27;s better than the unique 3d fiber .. I will most definitely buy again when I run out! &amp; fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first about this brand of fiber lashes, but after using it only once I loved it. My lashes were thicker and longer! I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> You HAVE to have a clean and dry mascara brush to eliminate the &#x27;clumping&#x27; effect. Instructions included say to use your regular mascara, let that dry, then apply the Mascara and quickly apply the fibers, then apply the Mascara again, this is where your clean dry mascara wand comes in, I usually blow upwards as I am un-clumping and keeping the weight of all the product from pulling my eyelashes down. It does NOT flake off, it actually lasts 12 hours or longer!! You cannot use a curling tool after the Mascara and fibres go on, it will leave a deep mark and you will have to start all over :(&lt;br /&gt;I slept with this 3D Fiver Lash on one night and to my utter surprise, it still hadn&#x27;t flaked off or rubbed into my face...I actually went a whole second afternoon with the 3D Fiber Lash applied more than 24 hours earlier!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s absolutely worth it!!!!</li>
            <li> The lashes are amazing. I wear glasses so false lashes just aren&#x27;t my thing. If you follow the directions they are just as full and beautiful as they advertise.  One thing I would suggest is to make the dry wand a different color. When you has your glasses off it&#x27;s hard to tell which wand is which.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about this product. Clumps excessively so that even trying to use the comb does not do a great job of de-clumping.</li>
            <li> Amazing.  No need for me to spend money on any other kind of mascara. I&#x27;m in love, and my eyelashes look amazing.</li>
            <li> I have short thin lashes. This product works. It is easy to apply and stays on. It gives my lashes length and volume.  I will continue to use and purchase this product.  I no longer think about applying false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> So happy with the results</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd time I have ordered this product.  I really like the way they make my lashes look so long and thick, and have never found a product that worked so well. However! I feel that this gel tube does not have as much gel as usual, and I have been using my own mascara 1st.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love love this mascara!! do a lot with dog and dog grooming so do not have time to re apply and with this, no need and there was NO flakes on my face at all...Just apply correctly and it will make your lashes longer and beautiful!!!!</li>
            <li> I feel my eyelash long.It is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;This mascara must be purshase for you.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping Quality merchandise.</li>
            <li> It really makes a noticable difference as compared to regular mascara. You are easily able to control the density of your lashes just based upon the number of times you apply it.  I&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
            <li> Love it! My lashes look amazing!!</li>
            <li> Came quickly! It makes my small eyelashes big which I like! I will keep buying this from now on!!</li>
            <li> Sorry, but not for me.&lt;br /&gt;Constantly flaking into eyes causing irritation!!</li>
            <li> I did not like this product  - messy, clumpy. The mascara I use for $6. Works even better. Sorry I do not recommend. Very pricey would have liked to return it.</li>
            <li> Horrible. My cheap mascara is better.</li>
            <li> 3D Fiber Lash adds length and thickness to lashes. The first time I used it I didn&#x27;t follow the gel-fiber-gel directions on each eye. I forgot the 2nd gel and my eyes were flaked, and a mess. I was ready to send it back. I decided to try it again and follow the directions completely and only one eye at a time. It works. I need a lash comb, but haven&#x27;t purchased one yet.  At shower time that night I was curious if it came off easily and it does. I used a circular motion (gently) around my lashes with facial wash soap, a scrubby, and the fiber-gel-mascara washes off easily and completely. I am now a fan.</li>
            <li> They really look good and natural</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time today and let me tell you, combining this with the Fuchsia deluxe eyelash curler AND grandelash MD eyelash enhancer has just made me think about tossing my falsies...which is HUGE because I&#x27;m OBSESSED with falsies and used them everyday! (not the desired length...YET I&#x27;m confident I will get there soon) my lashes looked so long after using this product. I also freaked out a little when I took a shower and began cleaning my eyelashes because it looked like long eyelashes were falling out! Have no fear! It is the natural fibers! Lol. So obsessed!!!!! Never using normal mascara again!</li>
            <li> My lashes are very short and fine. No mascara can help me....until I tried this. The proof is in the picture.  A customer for life!</li>
            <li> I personally didn&#x27;t like this mascara. My drugstore mascaras did better.. Won&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li> This is a fun product to try out that will give you longer lashes for the day. It comes with two tubes - the gel and the fibers. First, you apply some mascara, then gel, then fibers...to add length and volume, continue to add coats of gel alternating with fiber. I find that with any makeup, it&#x27;s easy to overdo it. I like it to look natural and just apply 1-2 coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could change the design on the tube a bit - notice how it says &amp;#34;300x&amp;#34; in big writing on each tube. Instead, I&#x27;d rather it say &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;fiber&amp;#34; in big writing. As it is, I can barely make out the writing below the &amp;#34;300x.&amp;#34;  Since you&#x27;re going back and forth between tubes, it would be easier if it&#x27;s clearly labeled. I just try to remember the fibers are in the shorter tube. Once you use this for a while though, everything starts getting mixed. The fibers end up in the gel and the gel in the fibers. That&#x27;s just inevitable when you&#x27;re alternating like that. With sensitivity, I haven&#x27;t personally had a problem but I know some that have. It may be because I only apply 1 or 2 coats. Also, I would make sure not to sleep with it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this product. Although, my expectations weren&#x27;t that high. I just thought it&#x27;d be nice to have longer lashes than I had without it, and the 300x does help to make them noticeably longer in minutes. Product provided at a promotional price for testing and review purposes, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> Not the results promised and the fiber smaller tube is messy leaving my lashes looking clumpy and not looking good.  I would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I like it. Some of the lashes have fallen out but that&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t put enough of the wet stuff on first. Other than that, I&#x27;m really happy with the product. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love it! I&#x27;m a klutz with all eye makeup and usually get EVERYTHING in my eye and this is even easy for me. I was really hesitant and waited until I had a lot of time to try it and now, it&#x27;s part of my daily routine. Easy to apply just like mascara with one more step. Just like lashes you pay to get applied but if one lash falls off, you have all you need in your purse. I only apply once in the morning and they last through my evening face wash, but not past the morning shower. Looks amazing and natural; more natural without any mascara. Will be a repeat customer for sure!</li>
            <li> I have previously used Younique and this product is every bit as good, and not nearly as expensive!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product yet, however the smell was so offensive when I opened the box I put the product in the garage to air out.  Has to throw the case away, awful chemical smell.  Even if I like the product I think the stench would deter me from reordering.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see the difference from using 3D fiber kash mascara then from my regular mascara. I feel like it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> You have to do it a certain way or it won&#x27;t come out how you want it to. But so far I like it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely luv this product! I&#x27;ve recommend to all my girlfriends. It gives you full long lashes without ask the trouble of false lashes and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. My lashes are not very dark and this give my lashes a full and dark look.  I apply it once a day and it lasts all day.  I have worked out with it on and it stays looking just as good after as it did before.</li>
            <li> I love the fiber lashes!  The whole process is very simple and only takes a couple of minutes. As with almost everything, you must follow the directions.  It is a great product, and since it does not irritate my eyes,  I plan to continue using it.  I have dry eye disease and must use prescription medication daily.  Unlike another fiber lash I tried, because it dropped flakes in my eyes and on my face  Yours is a keeper!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE my 3D lashes!!!! I had used another brand of fiber lashes before and really liked them and their look....but when it came time to re-order I found you on Amazon, ordered your 3D fiber lash and I can&#x27;t believe how I love your product!!!!!!!  I will definately be ordering from you in the future!!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference--my lashes are so short--and when I saw the pics I thought they must be putting it on over fales lashes.  Then my sister tried the Younique brand and I saw first hand that it really does work.  I&#x27;ve been using the Younique brand and love it but was looking for a less expensive alternative.  I saw this brand and decided to give it a try.  I find no difference between the two. The transplanting gel with both brands is very thick.  I personally don&#x27;t like it that thick so I add a few drops of saline solution (for contacts) and find it works much better.  The real key to not having the fibers fall onto your face (or anywhere else) is to not let the transplanting gel dry.  I put my base mascara on both eyes-top and bottom, then I put the gel on the top lashes of 1 eye and immediatly put on the fibers, then I do the bottom lashes of that eye.  While those dry I do the other eye.  If I want a longer look I repeat the process, if not then I just go over all of them with the gel again--make sure not to forget this step or you will have fibers falling off all day.  If you do it right they will stay on all day.  The only problem -and it is very minor-is that you really have to take it off every day.  Once after I started using the fiber lashes, I got home late and did not take it off before I went to bed.  I was short on time in the morning and tried to just put it on over what was there but it did not look good at all.  It is not a problem with this brand it is the same with the other one--you just can&#x27;t do &amp;#34;second day&amp;#34; with them--my lashes looked thick and goopy so I just make sure to take it off every night.  I will never go back to regular mascara and will definitely buy this brand again!</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look much thicker - would like them to look longer.  Still learning to use it, though.</li>
            <li> love this product, my lashes look good every day and it is as easy as putting on mascara.  instant long lashes.  Fast shipping and received much sooner than expected.  Would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> This really does improve the thickness of your lashes, I have very thin lashes and they look full.  The only downfall I had was I used it on the bottom lashes and it seemed to irritate my eyes.  The next use I only used it on the top lashes and that felt much better. Also I suggest going one eye at a time so that the gloss does not dry up before you put the fibers on.</li>
            <li> It seems to work quite well although I had to purchase from my niece, through a friend of hers,  for $37.50. I had no idea that I could purchase this item for much less money. Next time I will check out Amazon before purchasing else where.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pearl</li>
            <li> It takes more time to build the lash than just putting it on. Work. But does what it says.</li>
            <li> Must awesome mascara I have ever used! I&#x27;m not a youngster, so I have tried every mascara. I tried wearing false eyelashes, but never had luck putting them on. My lashes are micro short, and this mascara triples my lash length! Easy to use, and not time consuming at all! This is a must try!</li>
            <li> I wanted this to be comparable to Younique but it doesn&#x27;t even come close. I guess you get what you pay for but I&#x27;m disappointed. my fault for trying to save a few dollars.</li>
            <li> It worked, but I didn&#x27;t care for it as much as another brand I normally use. This one did not stay on as well and the fibers were very thick.</li>
            <li> Works awesome!! It came very quickly on the mail. Definitely should buy here again.</li>
            <li> The mascara works great.  It&#x27;s amazing how it improved my natural lashes.    You definitely need to work one eye at a time.  As suggested by other users, apply 1 coat of your mascara  I curled my lashes, applied my regular mascara and let it dry. Curled them a 2nd time and working one eye at a time added the gel then the fibers. Did the 2nd eye. Curled them a 3rd time and added the gel and fibers.  And Wow! I was so impressed with the final look. Definitely purchasing this again.  I love that it looks natural and lasted until i washed my face.</li>
            <li> My lashes look so good! It&#x27;s a lot fuller and longer</li>
            <li> WOW! I just got the package here in the office and tried it! I didn&#x27;t even do all the stuff I was supposed to like put mascara on first and curl my lashes. It looks incredible! I have virutally no eyelashes. I&#x27;m so excited!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas.  She loves the way it give her lashes some extra length because she hates fake lashes.  She will buy again.</li>
            <li> Everything is good! I love the product. Works just how I imagined it working. Keep up the good work! (:</li>
            <li> Flakes all over your face!!!</li>
            <li> Love it and so easy to use!!!!</li>
            <li> It WORKS!!! You have to use a lash comb or else it&#x27;ll clump up in the process. I love the results and you will too :)</li>
            <li> Works great for me - I don&#x27;t use the small tube - just the big one, and love it all by itself!</li>
            <li> This mascara did not live up to the hype. My Lanc√¥me mascara has better effect.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the prompt service and the tips the company sent with the product. I am very impressed with the 3D mascara. It really works and I&#x27;d recommend the product to anyone interested in buying it.</li>
            <li> Love the 3-D fiber mascara</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my lashes as long and full as i wanted and the fibers get in my eyes throughout the day</li>
            <li> I have very short, very straight eyelashes. This mascara at least triples the length and makes them appear thicker, but they do extend my makeup regimen by about 10 minutes to get them to the length I want. It takes some practice to figure out how to apply the transplanting gel as to not make your eyelashes clump together, but they look awesome once you master it. The transplanting gel dries out fairly quick when you use it frequently, but I have resolved this by placing 1-2 drops of eye lubricant into the container once it starts to dry up. Also, the fibers will gradually fall off throughout the day. Call me crazy but I use hair spray and they stay all day without any issues. I&#x27;m too cheap to spend $100/month on eyelash extensions, and although doing my mascara can sometimes become time consuming, I&#x27;m happy to spend the time if it&#x27;s saving me almost $100/month. Pictures attached show my eyes with regular mascara vs the Fiber Lash Mascara</li>
            <li> It was good but not as good as the Younique brand</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as described. It arrived early. I am very pleased with the product. It does increase the length of my lash and is so easy to use. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get it to work right..Sent it back.</li>
            <li> I love it!! it can get kinda messy though</li>
            <li> I love my new 3d mascara! My eyelashes are already somewhat long &amp; with this they look great &amp; very long!!! I was asked If I had on false eyelashes! Very very pleased!</li>
            <li> I like the mascara but the second time I used it the rubber came out and the brush didn&#x27;t get cleaned off . I got it back into the tube but was real messy and lost a liot of the first coat tube.</li>
            <li> Great product,  my daughter is very pleased...</li>
