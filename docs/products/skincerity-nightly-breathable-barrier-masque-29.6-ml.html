            <li>To be honest</li>
            <li>Their advice was to work it out with the employee who should reimburse me out of her own pocket</li>
            <li>I have to say the fumes from this product are very strong.  </li>

            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok the smell is overbearing .  </li>
            <li>the face does look better..</li>
            <li>have done lots of web searches because I wanted more info.</li>
            <li>What worries me is that most of the info I can find is either posted by Nucerity, or by someone who is selling the product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously lots of people love this product and I have read many glowing reviews about it.  </li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I am sure it is not the best thing to breathe while sleeping, but when u feel desperate to be beautiful</li>
            <li>Other than that it is awesome.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply; easy to remove.  </li>
            <li>It claims it peels off easily</li>
            <li>It is also easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>And it is easy storage.</li>
            <li>It comes off easy in the shower with a washcloth or face wash</li>
            <li>It smells so strong like a nail salon (all that acetone), and burns my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I strongly suggest you wear sunblock throughout the day to protect your face.</li>
            <li>The smell is as strong as putting your nose in a bottle of nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>I just can not stand the strong smell</li>
            <li>I did not like this product because of the strong acetone smell.</li>
            <li>I have used it for about a month now and have noticed a HUGE difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I roll it on after I place both my night serum and light moisturizer on.  </li>
            <li>The smell is strong but goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it leaves my skin soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>The concept of having your face creams held in and not rubbed off on the pillow is kinda cool but that acetone needs to go before I would look at it again.</li>
            <li>tell you are true.  </li>
            <li>I have used this myself and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>The one I bought on here was old or something; can&#x27;t really tell what it was except it seemed more watery and flaked off more than the one from distributor.</li>
            <li>I was aware of the product on my face and it kept me from sleeping comfortably at night.  </li>
            <li>My pores WERE smaller, my skin was smoother and I love it!</li>
            <li>I felt like I had to rub really hard to get it off, and that I was doing more damage to my skin than whatever good the product might do.</li>
            <li>sometimes it is worth the risk.</li>
            <li>I also developed a itchy rash many days after using it.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely worth trying.  </li>
            <li>Have purchased thru original company and worked very well.</li>
            <li>So far, it is easy to use, although it takes a bit of scrubbing to get the mask off in the morning. .</li>
            <li>;-) Overall I&#x27;m a fairly healthy person</li>
            <li>Love the way my skin feels the next morning after using this product.  </li>
            <li>It is just minor things to get used to like tightening of skin and acetone smell but to get the results I&#x27;ve received its more then worth it..</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know if the face looks better because I stay in bed an extra 10 minutes rubbing on my skin  to get the stuff off</li>
            <li>/&gt;-what exactly are the ingredients?  </li>
            <li>If you have a scar or skin issue in a specific area, it may be worthwhile used in a small area, but it does not feel good all over the face.  </li>
            <li>The acetone which is a large portion of the ingredient list will get into your system thru your skin.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin with large pores and breakouts.  </li>
            <li>Although the price is high, I am willing to pay for results.</li>
            <li>So much that I don&#x27;t even care if it may have worked if I kept it up longer.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t understand how this product is even legal.</li>
            <li>product really helped me out.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I even get complimented by my mom (who does nothing but remind me of how much acne I have throughout all these years)</li>
            <li>I have really noticed a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>thanks..</li>
            <li>and I think works very well for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have really damaged skin with age spots</li>
            <li>I had a friend that had some scars and it really helped and my husband (85) had a lot of blackheads on his face.  </li>
            <li>After spending $85 on the product, I really dislike it.  </li>
            <li>Dries very fast, clear</li>
            <li>I threw it out based on the likely absorption thru the skin of such a large amount of acetone, which would be as healthy as rubbing nail polish remover all over your face and neck every night.</li>
            <li>On top of all of this I also had to try to keep from googling the ingredients constantly because of the constant anxiety I had over what all the acetone and some sort of Teflon polymer was doing to my body.  </li>
            <li>Sure enough, the swelling returned after the second attempt to use this product.  </li>
            <li>I was glad I didn&#x27;t pay that much but wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted the $60 on Amazon either.</li>
            <li>I bought it for 80 dollars with high hopes.  </li>
            <li>highly reccomend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The price is high</li>
            <li>I feel like my results have been better than the chemical peels without treating my skin harshly.  </li>
            <li>She said, just do your normal nightly routine - steaming washcloth and Libriderm for me- and roll it on over.\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that it takes a bit of scrubbing to remove the product, but it&#x27;s well worth the</li>
            <li>, i use my normal night cream under it too buying it from [...]</li>
            <li>I would put it on while holding my breath and have to walk quickly around the house to walk into fresh air until it dried.</li>
            <li>There are many otc and prescription creams you can use for this, but it&#x27;s expensive, and invasive, and filled with all kinds of sterioids and chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>My skin looks so clear!  </li>
            <li>I love the youthful glow I have and age spots/acne scars/and small wrinkles that it has removed..</li>
            <li>the morning and use a little Vit A-E oil which removes the mask easily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;AND, be sure to purchase Skincerity through Amazon -- it&#x27;s half the retail price!!</li>
            <li>It rolls on easily and neatly and the acetone smell/sting does go away after a few seconds.  </li>
            <li>The darker brown tint that was on my skin has completely receded.  </li>
            <li>Surprised this passed any laws.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 57 years old and my hands looked like I was in my 40&#x27;s again.  </li>
            <li>, i had scars on my chin from acne as a teen and its working very well</li>
            <li>so far I haven&#x27;t obtain the results I hoped for.</li>
            <li>(I am not overly sensitive to smells)  </li>
            <li>The soft face cloth that was included is non abrasive to remove the product in the morning.</li>
            <li>I have severe acne scarring and since using this product I have seen major improvement!!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not sure that it is safe to be breathing these fumes for the sake of physical beauty, maybe for chemotherapy.</li>
            <li>There is no other product that works this well for my sons acne!  </li>
            <li>(And yes I put on a thick moisturizer before I applied the roll-on, like they suggest you do for easy</li>
            <li>If you roll it on all over your face when it dries it makes you face feel tight (like it&#x27;s going to crack if you smile).  </li>
            <li>Small wrinkles are gone and smooth hydrated younger looking skin is in its place.</li>
            <li>The product disappeared much faster than I had expected.</li>
            <li>Apparently, they don&#x27;t take responsibility for their employees and claim the mistake is not their fault.  </li>
            <li>My skin always feels so soft and refreshed after using this nightly mask; I would definitely recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t feel tight if you put moisturizer on first.  </li>
            <li>I would have to pick and pick tiny pieces off plus use water and cleanser and scrub my face so hard that I would be bright red and raw after.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly but leaves skin feeling uncomfortably tight, dry, and itchy.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> so far I haven&#x27;t obtain the results I hoped for.</li>
            <li> (I am not overly sensitive to smells)  </li>
            <li> The soft face cloth that was included is non abrasive to remove the product in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have severe acne scarring and since using this product I have seen major improvement!!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure that it is safe to be breathing these fumes for the sake of physical beauty, maybe for chemotherapy.</li>
            <li> There is no other product that works this well for my sons acne!  </li>
            <li> (And yes I put on a thick moisturizer before I applied the roll-on, like they suggest you do for easy</li>
            <li> If you roll it on all over your face when it dries it makes you face feel tight (like it&#x27;s going to crack if you smile).  </li>
            <li> Small wrinkles are gone and smooth hydrated younger looking skin is in its place.</li>
            <li> The product disappeared much faster than I had expected.</li>
            <li> Apparently, they don&#x27;t take responsibility for their employees and claim the mistake is not their fault.  </li>
            <li> My skin always feels so soft and refreshed after using this nightly mask; I would definitely recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t feel tight if you put moisturizer on first.  </li>
            <li> I would have to pick and pick tiny pieces off plus use water and cleanser and scrub my face so hard that I would be bright red and raw after.  </li>
            <li> It dries quickly but leaves skin feeling uncomfortably tight, dry, and itchy.  </li>
            <li> The only reason it does contain acetone is so that it can dry almost instantly as its applied.  </li>
            <li> I admit I haven&#x27;t given it long enough to see if it works for all the claims it makes.  </li>
            <li> no major change...</li>
            <li> There arre too many fakes online with dangerous chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> my pores have all but disappeared and my breakouts are few and far between.  </li>
            <li> feels a bit strange when you put it on</li>
            <li> He couldn&#x27;t get them off until he used Skincerity to get old dead skin off.</li>
            <li> A friend introduced this to me when I complained of dye skin from where I live (Nome, AK).</li>
            <li> What you get are chunks of a white filmy skin, and its really gross and messy!  </li>
            <li> All the points made about a tingly feeling when you put the mask on, a tight feeling, mild smell, difficult to remove are so minor</li>
            <li> then hours later after meetings find a few flakes on my cheek or neck.</li>
            <li> Wet wash cloth works.  </li>
            <li> I believe it has a minimal amount of acetone in it</li>
            <li> but I have been using this product for almost a year and my pores have closed</li>
            <li> I wet my face with water</li>
            <li> I used to have trouble skin and alot of blemish/pigmentation from old acne and some small bumps as well.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe these are the major points of complaint.  </li>
            <li> Minimizes small lines appearing around my upper lip line.  </li>
            <li> But that is a small price to pay for younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was from the acetone or some other ingredient.  </li>
            <li> I will not purchase this product due to it does not work.</li>
            <li> This locks in all of the benefits of the other products.  </li>
            <li> They accidentally sent me a duplicate shipment due to a mistake made by their sales rep</li>
            <li> The only complain is, it is hard to remove in the morning</li>
            <li> have been using this for 5 days, on my feet or hard skin, and my face and a ezcema on my shin, its cleared everything up nearly instantly</li>
            <li> The only negative aspect is that it smells like acetone.  </li>
            <li> I truly feel my skin has less wrinkles</li>
            <li> And my pores are way less noticeable</li>
            <li> So I waited a few day for the swelling to go down.  </li>
            <li> it holds tightly to your skin</li>
            <li> What they don&#x27;t tell you is that it leaves a shiny, tight feeling, smelly film on your skin</li>
            <li> Used it for a few months didn&#x27;t even see a slight change to my skin.</li>
            <li> OMG what a HUGE annoying pain in the butt trying to remove it.  </li>
            <li> Also the heavy price tag - and doctor&#x27;s fees you pay along with that.  </li>
            <li> I can say I&#x27;ve never ever hated a product more than this.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a few Skincerity bottles for my mom.</li>
            <li> Pealing it off in the morning can be messy.</li>
            <li> So what this stuff may be, or how old it is, is questionable.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just been using this product for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> A few of the things that the website, ads, etc.</li>
            <li> The bottle lasted less than a month!</li>
            <li> My black heads around my nose are gone also!</li>
            <li> A few minutes of scrubbing in the morning is a small price to pay for results like this.  </li>
            <li> I just wish it was a little cheaper!</li>
            <li> Now instead of tedious face routines all I have to do is wash, roll, sleep, wake up, wash and repeat the following night.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t actually difficult to remove the film the next day as some have stated.  </li>
            <li> But for me, the smell, the annoying clean-up,the price, and the lack of information are a huge negative!</li>
            <li> This was a major disappointment.</li>
            <li> Also hard to get it out of your hair so try not to get too close to the hairline.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to comment on the effectiveness of this product because I also changed skin care products.  </li>
            <li> this stuff is so hard to get off the skin in the morning...</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is the roller applicator.</li>
            <li> Commonly referred to as &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; by dermatologists.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for at least a month</li>
            <li> worse thing ever invented, dont waste your time or money</li>
            <li> Used this on some serious burn scars and they&#x27;re almost invisible now.</li>
            <li> I feel it is not wise to inhale that every time you use the product.</li>
            <li> the acetone smell goes away, but the perfumey smell that lingers is not pleasant.  </li>
            <li> All of these special products are expensive, but women seem to float from product to product and expect miracles when they treat their bodies terribly.  </li>
            <li> I started using the mask on a recommendation from a friend (whose skin had improved dramatically so I asked her secret).  </li>
            <li> Annoying to remove in the morning with alsolutely no change or improvement in skin other than the pinkish tone after rubbing to romove it from the face.</li>
            <li> It is sometimes difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> I could never sleep well on the nights I did it because it was so uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s expensive but it works well.</li>
            <li> Unhappy with quality, thin and watery.</li>
            <li> Yes, it did make my skin softer but it feels uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked to read all the negative reviews!  </li>
            <li> Three years, and 100lbs after having my child, I was sick of seeing them.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate it.  </li>
            <li> , that is really annoying to get off in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Oh and of course the nasty &amp;#34;nail polish&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrific</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Used this on some serious burn scars and they&#x27;re almost invisible now.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about buying, not only because of the price, but every review done seemed to be by an &amp;#34;authorized dealer.&amp;#34; I did not feel very confident when I purchased. However - I was happily mistaken! This has given me some of the best results I have ever had! I have severe acne scarring and since using this product I have seen major improvement!! It seems equivalent to what you might expect from a Lazer treatment I would guess...without pain! Also the heavy price tag - and doctor&#x27;s fees you pay along with that.  Small wrinkles are gone and smooth hydrated younger looking skin is in its place. I use it before bed with rosehip oil applied underneath. My biggest complaint is the roller applicator. It is sometimes difficult to apply. Oh and of course the nasty &amp;#34;nail polish&amp;#34; smell. Lol! I am sure it is not the best thing to breathe while sleeping, but when u feel desperate to be beautiful sometimes it is worth the risk. ;-) Overall I&#x27;m a fairly healthy person so I don&#x27;t feel like one product will do me in.  The product disappeared much faster than I had expected. The bottle lasted less than a month! Although the price is high, I am willing to pay for results. I will be purchasing another bottle.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply; easy to remove.  Great night time barrier to aid in skin repair.  Minimizes small lines appearing around my upper lip line.  Aiding in the repair of a 2 inch scar on my daughter&#x27;s cheek.</li>
            <li> To be honest I admit I haven&#x27;t given it long enough to see if it works for all the claims it makes.  I bought it for 80 dollars with high hopes.  I absolutely hate it.  It smells so strong like a nail salon (all that acetone), and burns my eyes.  It dries quickly but leaves skin feeling uncomfortably tight, dry, and itchy.  I could never sleep well on the nights I did it because it was so uncomfortable.  It claims it peels off easily but OMG what a HUGE annoying pain in the butt trying to remove it.  I would have to pick and pick tiny pieces off plus use water and cleanser and scrub my face so hard that I would be bright red and raw after.  I also developed a itchy rash many days after using it.  On top of all of this I also had to try to keep from googling the ingredients constantly because of the constant anxiety I had over what all the acetone and some sort of Teflon polymer was doing to my body.  All in all I can say I&#x27;ve never ever hated a product more than this.  So much that I don&#x27;t even care if it may have worked if I kept it up longer.  Absolutely horrific and I don&#x27;t understand how this product is even legal.</li>
            <li> I ordered a few Skincerity bottles for my mom. After a few weeks, she told me it really works. I think it&#x27;s expensive but it works well. I should try it next time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this skin mask for about 9 months now.  I was shocked to read all the negative reviews!  All the points made about a tingly feeling when you put the mask on, a tight feeling, mild smell, difficult to remove are so minor I can&#x27;t believe these are the major points of complaint.  This mask works wonders!  I wish I could post a before and after picture of my face so you could see the incredible difference.  The darker brown tint that was on my skin has completely receded.  My skin looks so clear!  I feel like it has taken seven or eight years off of my face and that&#x27;s in only 9 months of use.  A few minutes of scrubbing in the morning is a small price to pay for results like this.  I started using the mask on a recommendation from a friend (whose skin had improved dramatically so I asked her secret).  It took about two weeks for me to start seeing a difference but every day I use it I can see areas that are lighter and lines that disappear.  I have people all the time asking what I use for my skin.  Yeah, it&#x27;s that good.  I have a friend that has been getting chemical peels for a more youthful appearance.  I feel like my results have been better than the chemical peels without treating my skin harshly.  This is definitely worth trying.  Once you see how well it works, you will be converted!</li>
            <li> A friend introduced this to me when I complained of dye skin from where I live (Nome, AK). She said, just do your normal nightly routine - steaming washcloth and Libriderm for me- and roll it on over.\\&quot;. It IS that simple!  Dries very fast, clear so my husband doesn&#x27;t even know I have it on.     Pealing it off in the morning can be messy. Water or even lotion takes it off, but there&#x27;s been several times I&#x27;ve showered, moisturized, pit my makeup on and all....then hours later after meetings find a few flakes on my cheek or neck.</li>
            <li> I suffer from severe keratosis pilaris on my arms. Commonly referred to as &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; by dermatologists. There are many otc and prescription creams you can use for this, but it&#x27;s expensive, and invasive, and filled with all kinds of sterioids and chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;My friend recently gave me this to help me fade my stretch marks. Mamas, you know what I&#x27;m talking about. You want them gone. Three years, and 100lbs after having my child, I was sick of seeing them.&lt;br /&gt;This product really helped me out. My stretch marks are almost unnoticeable, and my KP is almost non existent.&lt;br /&gt;I highly reccomend this product. I went from using it nightly to once a week and it seems to keep doing its job.&lt;br /&gt;I love love love it. And I tell all my friends to buy it. Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Item as described. Works like a charm. I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle now. Skin is definitely improving. I used to have trouble skin and alot of blemish/pigmentation from old acne and some small bumps as well.  Now I feel like it&#x27;s gradually going away. I even get complimented by my mom (who does nothing but remind me of how much acne I have throughout all these years)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product BUT I would never ever, ever think of buying it on amazon. There arre too many fakes online with dangerous chemicals in it. and you&#x27;re only supposed to get it frrom a registered distrributor, per company agreement. So what this stuff may be, or how old it is, is questionable. Would you buy your newborrn&#x27;s life saving medicine frrorm amazon?</li>
            <li> I have really noticed a difference in my skin.  I truly feel my skin has less wrinkles and I look younger.  The only complain is, it is hard to remove in the morning and I am often picking it out of my hair thought out the day.  But that is a small price to pay for younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> Love the way my skin feels the next morning after using this product.  Skin looks refreshed and younger.  Definitely a product I don&#x27;t want to run out of - ever.</li>
            <li> I feel to change my skin. It is also easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to take anywhere. And it is easy storage.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it works wonders for my face. Now instead of tedious face routines all I have to do is wash, roll, sleep, wake up, wash and repeat the following night. I strongly suggest you wear sunblock throughout the day to protect your face.</li>
            <li> Unhappy with quality, thin and watery. Have purchased thru original company and worked very well. This was a major disappointment. I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Used it for a few months didn&#x27;t even see a slight change to my skin.</li>
            <li> worse thing ever invented, dont waste your time or money this is bogus and you NEVER put acetone on your face, its made to take off nail polish! geez</li>
            <li> I could see results within 2weeks. It stopped my breakouts and evened skin tone. Great product. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like this product at all!  Didn&#x27;t see any difference in my skin.  It isn&#x27;t actually difficult to remove the film the next day as some have stated.  Wet wash cloth works.  Didn&#x27;t feel tight if you put moisturizer on first.  While applying it, my throat and nose burned and sore throat and headache followed.  After 2 nights of use, both of my eyes were swollen shut in the morning.  I thought the swelling was unrelated.  So I waited a few day for the swelling to go down.  Sure enough, the swelling returned after the second attempt to use this product.  I don&#x27;t know if it was from the acetone or some other ingredient.  I can&#x27;t recommend anyone use it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year now. It truly makes a difference in my skin. I&#x27;m 59 and won&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> I love it,,,My observation is that it&#x27;s perfectly works.  thanks..</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great products and best seller. Excellent. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The acetone which is a large portion of the ingredient list will get into your system thru your skin. This is nail polish remover! The smell is as strong as putting your nose in a bottle of nail polish remover. I would put it on while holding my breath and have to walk quickly around the house to walk into fresh air until it dried. it holds tightly to your skin and I found it noticeable during the night. I threw it out based on the likely absorption thru the skin of such a large amount of acetone, which would be as healthy as rubbing nail polish remover all over your face and neck every night. it was tightening my skin but how - by PICKLING it??  Surprised this passed any laws. The concept of having your face creams held in and not rubbed off on the pillow is kinda cool but that acetone needs to go before I would look at it again.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  My skin looks younger and healthier. And my pores are way less noticeable</li>
            <li> I will not purchase this product due to it does not work.</li>
            <li> I just can not stand the strong smell</li>
            <li> I won Skincerity on a KIXI prize giveaway recently.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to test it out.  All I can say is, \\&quot;Wow!\\&quot;  I began using the product on my hands and within a week, I saw amazing results.  I&#x27;m 57 years old and my hands looked like I was in my 40&#x27;s again.  My face and neck area have improved as well.  The only drawback is that it takes a bit of scrubbing to remove the product, but it&#x27;s well worth the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND, be sure to purchase Skincerity through Amazon -- it&#x27;s half the retail price!!</li>
            <li> Annoying to remove in the morning with alsolutely no change or improvement in skin other than the pinkish tone after rubbing to romove it from the face.</li>
            <li> I have been using skincerity for over a year.  I have oily skin with large pores and breakouts.  Once I started using Skincerity my pores have all but disappeared and my breakouts are few and far between.  I roll it on after I place both my night serum and light moisturizer on.  This locks in all of the benefits of the other products.  The smell is strong but goes away quickly.  Also hard to get it out of your hair so try not to get too close to the hairline.  Other than that it is awesome.</li>
            <li> It is hard to comment on the effectiveness of this product because I also changed skin care products.  I have to say the fumes from this product are very strong.  The FDA may have approved it for medicinal purposes but I&#x27;m not sure that it is safe to be breathing these fumes for the sake of physical beauty, maybe for chemotherapy.</li>
            <li> I saw this product for sale at my local salon for $100. I was glad I didn&#x27;t pay that much but wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted the $60 on Amazon either. It comes off easy in the shower with a washcloth or face wash but after using it for several several weeks, I haven&#x27;t seen the point of it. It hasn&#x27;t changed my skin at all.</li>
            <li> Nothing different!! no major change...</li>
            <li> I would defintely recommend this product. I have used it for about a month now and have noticed a HUGE difference in my skin. I will continue to reorder this product over and over again!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just been using this product for a few weeks.  So far, it is easy to use, although it takes a bit of scrubbing to get the mask off in the morning. . .but then, it is a MASK and that&#x27;s par for the course.  My friend who has been using this product for a longer period of time says she is VERY happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle from here and also from a distributor. They were different. The one I bought on here was old or something; can&#x27;t really tell what it was except it seemed more watery and flaked off more than the one from distributor. I am now signed up for the auto ship and get it for $60 a bottle.</li>
            <li> My review of the product:  I tried this product on my face as well as on a scar.  Yes, it did make my skin softer but it feels uncomfortable.  If you roll it on all over your face when it dries it makes you face feel tight (like it&#x27;s going to crack if you smile).  I was aware of the product on my face and it kept me from sleeping comfortably at night.  After two weeks, I still could not get used to it.  If you have a scar or skin issue in a specific area, it may be worthwhile used in a small area, but it does not feel good all over the face.  My review of the company:  They seem like a start up and are disorganized.  They accidentally sent me a duplicate shipment due to a mistake made by their sales rep that I spoke to on the phone and now they will not refund shipping fees and in addition charged a penalty for restocking that I was not told about in advance.  Apparently, they don&#x27;t take responsibility for their employees and claim the mistake is not their fault.  Their advice was to work it out with the employee who should reimburse me out of her own pocket (like I&#x27;m ever going to hear from her again!). Beware should any errors be made with your order!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it leaves my skin soft and smooth! I love the hydration it gave my skin, I no longer feel like I need to moisturize as soon as I get out of the shower. I don&#x27;t understand why people have an issue with taking it off. It is just like washing your face! I just wish it was a little cheaper!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for at least a month and I can see a difference in my skin.  My pores are smaller and my skin is a lot smoother.  The only negative aspect is that it smells like acetone.  I believe it has a minimal amount of acetone in it but it will not harm the skin.  The only reason it does contain acetone is so that it can dry almost instantly as its applied.  I am definitely purchasing this product again once I am finished with it.</li>
            <li> This product was a great price and I think works very well for my skin.  I will purchase again when I run out this order.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product because of the strong acetone smell. I feel it is not wise to inhale that every time you use the product.</li>
            <li> have been using this for 5 days, on my feet or hard skin, and my face and a ezcema on my shin, its cleared everything up nearly instantly, i had scars on my chin from acne as a teen and its working very well feels a bit strange when you put it on, i use my normal night cream under it too buying it from [...] as not in the uk yet, amamzing product would def recommend</li>
            <li> I love it and will use it forever! It is just minor things to get used to like tightening of skin and acetone smell but to get the results I&#x27;ve received its more then worth it..I love the youthful glow I have and age spots/acne scars/and small wrinkles that it has removed..simply amazing.love it</li>
            <li> The price is high but I have been using this product for almost a year and my pores have closed and I never have any acne break outs.  My black heads around my nose are gone also!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok the smell is overbearing .  I have really damaged skin with age spots&lt;br /&gt;and so far I haven&#x27;t obtain the results I hoped for. I wet my face with water&lt;br /&gt;in the morning and use a little Vit A-E oil which removes the mask easily.  I&lt;br /&gt;will continue to use the product.</li>
            <li> My skin always feels so soft and refreshed after using this nightly mask; I would definitely recommend this product to anyone! This is my second purchase and I believe I will always keep this product rotated among my cosmetics.</li>
            <li> this stuff is so hard to get off the skin in the morning... the face does look better.. the theory makes sense also.. but I don&#x27;t know if the face looks better because I stay in bed an extra 10 minutes rubbing on my skin  to get the stuff off</li>
            <li> I have used this products before and it did a good job of tightening my skin.  All of these special products are expensive, but women seem to float from product to product and expect miracles when they treat their bodies terribly.  I had a friend that had some scars and it really helped and my husband (85) had a lot of blackheads on his face.  He couldn&#x27;t get them off until he used Skincerity to get old dead skin off.</li>
            <li> After spending $85 on the product, I really dislike it.  A few of the things that the website, ads, etc. tell you are true.  It rolls on easily and neatly and the acetone smell/sting does go away after a few seconds.  What they don&#x27;t tell you is that it leaves a shiny, tight feeling, smelly film on your skin, that is really annoying to get off in the morning.  I put it on my neck, back of my hands, and decolletage, and tried it two nights in a row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes the acetone smell goes away, but the perfumey smell that lingers is not pleasant.  (I am not overly sensitive to smells)  To get it off you can either peel it (like sunburned skin) or rub cleanser or lotion on it.  What you get are chunks of a white filmy skin, and its really gross and messy!  I felt like I had to rub really hard to get it off, and that I was doing more damage to my skin than whatever good the product might do. (And yes I put on a thick moisturizer before I applied the roll-on, like they suggest you do for easy removal.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have done lots of web searches because I wanted more info. before applying this stuff to my face.  What worries me is that most of the info I can find is either posted by Nucerity, or by someone who is selling the product.  I&#x27;d like to read some information given by someone that isn&#x27;t being paid by the company!  Some of the things I was trying to find out were:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-does the company test on animals?  I can not find a definite answer, and this is a big deal to me.  I assume that means they do test on animals.&lt;br /&gt;-what exactly are the ingredients?  My friend told me the product was \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; but my searches on the individual ingredients came up with basically plastic and teflon, along with vitamin e, grapeseed oil, and acetone.  One website even said that they do not include all ingredients on the label!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously lots of people love this product and I have read many glowing reviews about it.  But for me, the smell, the annoying clean-up,the price, and the lack of information are a huge negative!</li>
            <li> I have used this myself and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. After using it, I noticed almost immediate results. My pores WERE smaller, my skin was smoother and I love it! It is something that you have to keep up with, if you stop using it the effects diminish, but I guess that&#x27;s just the aging process too.</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel good and it worked okay. The soft face cloth that was included is non abrasive to remove the product in the morning.</li>
            <li> There is no other product that works this well for my sons acne!  I absolutely love this product, thank you!</li>
