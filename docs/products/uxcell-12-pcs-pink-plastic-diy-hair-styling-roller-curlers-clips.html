            <li> Purchased for my daughter to practice on doing different styles involving curlers. Came as described, quick shipping, and all 12 pieces were included. Great training supply.</li>
            <li> They are very flimsy.</li>
            <li> These were the curlers I had been looking for and they are a good size.  Its great to know I can get them over the internet.  They were not in any of the stores around here.</li>
            <li> Took awhile to arrive, but these are so hard to find, so that was ok! My elderly mom still uses these and I was thrilled to find them. I also ordered the next size up...!</li>
            <li> Not worth getting and not from this store</li>
            <li> My mother loved them.  She is 95 years old and this is exactly what she has been looking for.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> After my Mom (who is 91) survived a fire in her home she lost her pink curlers and was very upset. When I found these on Amazon I purchased them immediately. Although they are not the same size as the ones that she previously had she is SO glad to have her pink curlers back.</li>

            <li> Received as shown. The kind my mother loves to use.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my Mom.  She was running low on these so I bought a few packs for her.  She&#x27;s been using them for years and years.  Refuses to use anything else.</li>
            <li> I was expecting they me be a little big but they were perfect.  Thanks</li>
            <li> These were way too small  to use on the average person. Outside of someone using these on EXTREMELY SHORT HAIR, do not buy these.</li>
