            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I love this and the salon where I bought it stopped selling it.</li>
            <li>For some reason many stores have stopped carrying it</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work any better than drugstore products.  </li>
            <li>This BB shampoo doesn&#x27;t work any better or perform miracles.  </li>
            <li>I actually love BB&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I love it and continue to buy it. : )</li>
            <li>and i love the smell of her hair</li>
            <li>The first time i used it a cashier at a store told me how good my hair looked.</li>
            <li>So this is a highly recommended product its amazing!</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a beautiful result, and I receive many compliments on my shoulder-length bob.</li>
            <li>The shampoo smells great and it is not harsh on your hair.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has a really pleasant smell, and I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li>(My hair looks so pretty! :-)</li>
            <li>After towel-drying, I give the bleached sections a light application of Kerastase Thermal Protector.  </li>
            <li>i love it this shampoo crema de coco if your hair is dry is good</li>
            <li>The shampoo ruined my hair… it wasn&#x27;t even close to the original product.</li>
            <li>Creme de Coco is a rich, pleasantly smelling shampoo that makes my blonde, fine-but-thick hair shiny and \\&quot;swingable.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>Smells amazing and makes your hair so soft and shiney!</li>
            <li>They were nothing special.  </li>
            <li>Just an overall good product.</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy this shampoo as it is mild for color-treated hair also.</li>
            <li>In fact, I find that most high end shampoos and conditioners are outperformed by their drugstore counterparts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve discovered that high end shampoos and conditioners rarely perform better than their drugstore counterparts.  </li>
            <li>Third, the lather wasn&#x27;t as fragrant or rich and I had to use a fifty cent amount of this kind as opposed to a dime amount of the real stuff to wash my fine textured hair.  </li>
            <li>Makes ur hair so soft light weight and easy to brush hait after u shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no longer dry feeling and blow dries nicely.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t spend very much money on my hair.</li>
            <li>This is a nice gentle &amp; rich shampoo I use for island vacation -- gentle after a day&#x27;s diving &amp; swimming but gets the salt &amp; other bits out.</li>
            <li>So funny</li>
            <li>I would love to return for refund since I only used twice and will not use again.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re thinking of purchasing this BB shampoo and conditioner, give SM a try first.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re thinking of purchasing this BB shampoo and conditioner, give SM a try first.  </li>
            <li>And the fragrance is definitely one of the better coconut aromas on the market today.</li>
            <li>I had some creme de coco left from a salon where I bought it, and was able to put the two side by side.</li>
            <li>My hair stays clean for days and soft</li>
            <li>All their shampoos are sulfate, silicone and cruelty free and they actually do what they promise.  </li>
            <li>Does It All spray, which really holds the waves in my hard-to-hold hair.</li>
            <li>It really does what it promises.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t like the fragrance much.  </li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t like the fragrance much.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much difference it makes using a quality shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so much healthier now.</li>
            <li>Buy moisture maniac if you really want to see result and its  aquarter of the price.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t bother with coloring, highlighting or any of that other stuff many people maintain, so</li>
            <li>I hope like so many other thing I like that</li>
            <li>A small amount goes a long way, does the job very nicely.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the extra money to buy quality.</li>
            <li>Very soft.</li>
            <li>I love all B&amp;B products and this shampoo keeps my hair healthy and prevents my extremely long and thick wavy hair from getting too dry.</li>
            <li>There are better products for less money, like Kanechom deep conditioner from South America and a YouTube sensation.</li>
            <li>I use the Raw Shea Butter shampoo, conditioner and mask and my hair is shiny, strong and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it makes my hair soft</li>
            <li>These BB products also made my hair color fade considerably.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer the Shea Moisture products and the Kanechom deep conditioner.  </li>
            <li>They far surpass this BB formula.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>My hair is bleached platinum and the creme de coco line keeps it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Second, the consistency was much thinner, it ran easily back and forth when I tipped the bottle, unlike the real Bumble &amp; Bumble that barely moves.</li>
            <li>We love all the BB products; this shampoo is soooo creamy...and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure this product was fake</li>
            <li>For example,  Schwartzkopf&#x27;s Got2be line, which is inexpensive and does the same thing as Schwartzkopf&#x27;s high end line (they don&#x27;t produce two totally different formulas, they just repackage the cheaper line) which is four times the drugstore price.  </li>
            <li>this shampoo makes my hair so soft  takes like a quarter size to shampoo my long hair  </li>
            <li>First, the color was pale yellow,</li>
            <li>We have hard water at home and it really makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>

            <li> Creme de Coco is a rich, pleasantly smelling shampoo that makes my blonde, fine-but-thick hair shiny and \\&quot;swingable.\\&quot;  It brings out the color variation and highlights beautifully.  However, it does weigh it down.  To counter that, I use it only on the mid-lengths and ends, with a lighter-weight conditioner, and I alternate it with a lighter shampoo.  Because I have bleached highlights, I also use the Quenching Conditioner (not carried by Amazon) on the ends.  On the crown, I use a lighter-weight shampoo and conditioner.  After towel-drying, I give the bleached sections a light application of Kerastase Thermal Protector.  This is a complicated regime, but the bleached highlights require special care.  Overall, it&#x27;s a beautiful result, and I receive many compliments on my shoulder-length bob.</li>
            <li> I love this product. The shampoo smells great and it is not harsh on your hair. Perfect dor every day use.</li>
            <li> They are always out of this at the local store. Not a shock. It is wonderful and addictive. Glad I could find it online,</li>
            <li> Pretty sure this product was fake</li>
            <li> The shampoo seems watered down from the one I bought at a studio. I won&#x27;t buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Great smell, great shampoo.  Love the way it leaves my hair</li>
            <li> My hair stays clean for days and soft</li>
            <li> A solid shampoo choice. Just an overall good product. I implement at least twice a week.</li>
            <li> This is a nice gentle &amp; rich shampoo I use for island vacation -- gentle after a day&#x27;s diving &amp; swimming but gets the salt &amp; other bits out. Leaves hair soft/smooth when used with the conditioner also</li>
            <li> The shampoo doesn&#x27;t make hair so soft as to be limp. That works for me on my short hair. The first time i used it a cashier at a store told me how good my hair looked. And he was a teenager! So funny</li>
            <li> We love all the BB products; this shampoo is soooo creamy...and a little goes a long way. Beautful fragrance. (My hair looks so pretty! :-)</li>
            <li> This shampoo. Seller did great and product is wonderful. It makes hair shiny, bouncy &amp; no unwanted chemicals. Not tested on animals</li>
            <li> I did not like this product. It left my hair feeling dry and lacking in shine or luster .&lt;br /&gt;I would not purchase again and will not continue to use.  I would love to return for refund since I only used twice and will not use again.</li>
            <li> this shampoo makes my hair so soft  takes like a quarter size to shampoo my long hair  I don&#x27;t even use conditioner when I shampoo with this product love it</li>
            <li> i love it this shampoo crema de coco if your hair is dry is good&lt;br /&gt;it makes my hair soft</li>
            <li> Smells great. Washes my hair great. I like to rotate my shampoo, and this one is definitely in the rotation. Suds up a lot!</li>
            <li> I love this and the salon where I bought it stopped selling it. We have hard water at home and it really makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Everyone always raves about Bumble and Bumble, but all of their shampoo has performed less well than your garden-variety Herbal Essences. It dried my ends, frizzed the body of my hair, and left my roots greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have type 2B hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t spend very much money on my hair. I only get haircuts twice a year and I don&#x27;t bother with coloring, highlighting or any of that other stuff many people maintain, so I can justify spending a little more on a luxury shampoo and that it what this feels like, luxury, from the scent to the softness it leaves behind. For some reason many stores have stopped carrying it and I am forced to get it online. I hope like so many other thing I like that it does not cease to exist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using B&amp;B for a long time, usually bought at my salon. What I received from this vendor is not the same and was terrible (left my hair looking like a hornet&#x27;s nest). Further evidence is that the bottle arrived without the sealing cover. In fact, some of the product had leaked out of the bottle and into the wrapping. Definitely a fake product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what all the fuss is about this shampoo (and the conditioner).  It doesn&#x27;t work any better than drugstore products.  In fact, I find that most high end shampoos and conditioners are outperformed by their drugstore counterparts. For example,  Schwartzkopf&#x27;s Got2be line, which is inexpensive and does the same thing as Schwartzkopf&#x27;s high end line (they don&#x27;t produce two totally different formulas, they just repackage the cheaper line) which is four times the drugstore price.  This BB shampoo doesn&#x27;t work any better or perform miracles.  Let&#x27;s face it, women will buy anything that promises good hair.  Pass on this shampoo (and the conditioner as well).  There are better products for less money, like Kanechom deep conditioner from South America and a YouTube sensation. Also excellent is the Shea Moisture line.  All their shampoos are sulfate, silicone and cruelty free and they actually do what they promise.  I use the Raw Shea Butter shampoo, conditioner and mask and my hair is shiny, strong and moisturized.  I had hoped for those kinds of results from this Bumble and Bumble Creme de Cocoa shampoo and conditioner and I completely wasted my money.  These BB products also made my hair color fade considerably.  I read online that this was a good s&amp;c but I think the folks from BB were writing the reviews.  They were nothing special.  I much prefer the Shea Moisture products and the Kanechom deep conditioner.  They far surpass this BB formula.  I&#x27;ve discovered that high end shampoos and conditioners rarely perform better than their drugstore counterparts.  The only exception is styling products.  I actually love BB&#x27;s Does It All spray, which really holds the waves in my hard-to-hold hair. It really does what it promises. I use the DIA spray and then spray Nexxus Comb Thru hairspray all over and my style lasts into the next day.  The Nexxus hairspray is another product that delivers on its promise of touchable, invisible hold. Shea Moisture products are about $11 at Walgreens, CVS, Ulta and Target.  If you&#x27;re thinking of purchasing this BB shampoo and conditioner, give SM a try first.  You won&#x27;t be sorry, especially if your hair is color treated.  This BB shampoo contains sulfates which will literally wash your color down the drain.  I also don&#x27;t like the fragrance much.  Like I&#x27;ve said, there are better, less expensive options out there.  I have half a bottle of Creme de Cocoa conditioner sitting in my shower.  I should throw it out but it was expensive and I don&#x27;t have the heart.  I will get my husband to use it up. What a waste of $$.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product at all.at Walgreens, CVS, Ulta and Target.  If you&#x27;re thinking of purchasing this BB shampoo and conditioner, give SM a try first.

            <li> I have thick, curly hair and this works very well.  It smells great also.  I love it and continue to buy it. : )</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much difference it makes using a quality shampoo. My hair feels so much healthier now. It&#x27;s worth the extra money to buy quality.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and this shampoo works great!  It keeps my hair soft and manageable. It&#x27;s no longer dry feeling and blow dries nicely.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t blow my mind.  Buy moisture maniac if you really want to see result and its  aquarter of the price.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a really pleasant smell, and I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells. I usually buy fragrance-free. This smell doesn&#x27;t bother me. The shampoo itself seems to do a good job, not too drying.</li>
            <li> This was a misfit product. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS SELLER. EVER. The shampoo ruined my hair… it wasn&#x27;t even close to the original product.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product on numerous locations from other retailers.  The product I received from Atlas Pros Choice was not a genuine Bumble and bumble product. I immediately noticed the difference in consistency.  It appeared &amp;#34;watered down.&amp;#34; I will continue to purchases this product, but never again from this company.</li>
            <li> Have used Bumble and Bumble Crème De Coco for about 3 yrs - Excellent</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and makes your hair so soft and shiney!</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way, does the job very nicely.  And the fragrance is definitely one of the better coconut aromas on the market today.</li>
            <li> Been using this soap for awhile.  It lasts and does a good job on my hair without gumming it up.  Rinses well and great price.</li>
            <li> My hair is bleached platinum and the creme de coco line keeps it soft and shiny. This smells great, too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found my hair that become richer in feeling. Smells great! I have found my hair to become less tangled. Very soft. You should have this product!</li>
            <li> We always buy Bumble&amp;Bumble haircare products in our home.  This has a particularly pleasant, yet mild, fragrance with good cleaning properties.  I will continue to buy this shampoo as it is mild for color-treated hair also.</li>
            <li> I love all B&amp;B products and this shampoo keeps my hair healthy and prevents my extremely long and thick wavy hair from getting too dry.</li>
            <li> Love the way this product makes my hair feel and smell!</li>
            <li> Smells so good. my wife uses it and i love the smell of her hair</li>
            <li> I watch a reality show on tv &amp; one of the people on there mention Bumble &amp; Bumble Shampoo &amp; that was amazing Shampoo. I told my husband i was going to order some &amp; i did best investment ever!! Makes ur hair so soft light weight and easy to brush hait after u shower. The sent isn&#x27;t over powering but has that wonderful sent of coconut makes u feel like your on the beach. So this is a highly recommended product its amazing! This is my 2nd bottle i have ordered! Only need dime size or so cos makes great lather and leaves ur hair silky soft even good for frizzy and out of control hair like mine.</li>
            <li> Beware, this is not a Bumble &amp; Bumble product!! It is FAKE. I had some creme de coco left from a salon where I bought it, and was able to put the two side by side. First, the color was pale yellow, not pure white like the salon had. Second, the consistency was much thinner, it ran easily back and forth when I tipped the bottle, unlike the real Bumble &amp; Bumble that barely moves. Third, the lather wasn&#x27;t as fragrant or rich and I had to use a fifty cent amount of this kind as opposed to a dime amount of the real stuff to wash my fine textured hair.  Fourth, I saw recent reviews warning me before I bought this and chose to ignore them, wish I had paid attention!</li>
            <li> This made my hair feel like straw.  Did not like at all.  Should have listened to the other comments.  Sorry</li>
