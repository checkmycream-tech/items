            <li>At this point, I was already happy with the product because I felt I could cover the redness with makeup</li>

            <li>I am soooo happy with this purchase that I am going to buy the 32oz.pump b/c using it twice a day all over the body uses a lot of cream.</li>
            <li>Great lotion.</li>

            <li>Great product.</li>

            <li>So, MetaDem works great for us</li>
            <li>I do a lot of mission work and have taken this product into Sierra Leone Africa with great results.  </li>
            <li>great lotion</li>
            <li>Love this product!!</li>

            <li>It is very nice</li>
            <li>These people truly care about your skin and have amazing customer service!</li>
            <li>Metaderm is an amazing product!</li>
            <li>My wife bought this product bec of the good reviews and was hopeful for this product</li>
            <li>But, in all, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>And California Baby was also good, but I prefer a foam dispenser.  </li>
            <li>I think it is going to become my go-to product for any kind of skin irritation and could even make a great &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; face cream.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>and I have loved having this moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li>It took itching away for a good 8-10 hours from the start.</li>
            <li>In addition I did some research and castor oil is good for lighting scars on the skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x60;t know why this company think that the plants in this cream are good for the skin, my face looked like the time i touched poison ivy.</li>
            <li>This product is really good</li>
            <li>Good luck to all that suffer from eczema</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>but it is surprising how well an organic product like this works.</li>
            <li>Very good texture, and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so very glad that I did.</li>
            <li>I am sure it just depends on the person, but for me, it worked great.</li>
            <li>A huge difference from 2 or 3 times a week!!  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>will be ordering more!</li>
            <li>You will be so glad you did!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>A return customer for sure!</li>
            <li>I love the products!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!  </li>
            <li>I love MetaDerm!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>while I can&#x27;t say for certain it works for Eczema, I can tell you it&#x27;s a great, great moisturizer on</li>
            <li>Amazing.......</li>
            <li>the stuff in here is amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s used to be amazing</li>
            <li>I want to say &amp;#34;this product is amazing</li>
            <li>It has been amazing for the dryness of my Eczema.</li>
            <li>As soon as I applied this to my skin it was just amazing.  </li>
            <li>It is an amazing feeling to have my life</li>
            <li>This stuff is beyond amazing.</li>
            <li>and honestly it worked...</li>
            <li>and i tried this cream on my own hands</li>
            <li>nice packaging</li>
            <li>Good thing is my neck is better after being treated by the doctor.</li>
            <li>which is why I always make sure to have a good stockpile of this stuff..</li>
            <li>but I wish they had some kind of an eczema soap wash to tie with the MetaDerm Cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much thicker than a lotion which is great!</li>
            <li>I can honestly say I believe this is working for my husband.</li>
            <li>So far so good.. very impressed..</li>
            <li>i would walk by the pharmacy an the pharmacist know me by name, and nothing worked,doctors said stop eating this ,stop eating that, stop wearing perfume,lotion,and all kind of stuff.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>Really nice ingredient blend.</li>
            <li>and I liked the reviews and the fact of it being all herbal mix</li>
            <li>A nice company to shop with they care about their customers and how well their products work.</li>
            <li>this was kind of greasy to the touch.</li>
            <li>good effect, reduce itch, my baby love it</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great product!!</li>
            <li>and I really do hope people find what works best for them.</li>
            <li>I honestly thought it would never be that way again.</li>
            <li>Who would think an organic cream that costs about 1/5 of any steroid cream would have this kind of results.  </li>
            <li>i really liked this product seems it works well</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t nearly as effective at killing my eczema as coconut oil based lotion or magnesium lotion, but was still a creamy lotion.</li>
            <li>Very nice, smooth cream.</li>
            <li>On another great note, I started using the cream as a facial moisturizer at night and in the morning, and it&#x27;s perfect under makeup - very light and not at all greasy.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a high quality perfect moisturizer, this is what I will be recommending to everyone I know with eczema like myself.</li>
            <li>The Honest Company soap and lotion were good, but I prefer how Metaderm&#x27;s products are fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>Skin probably varies quite a bit as far as sensitivity and what will work best for it.</li>
            <li>Having said this, this is a nice cream that will help most people I would imagine.</li>
            <li>This one seems more effective.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this Cream and am so happy I tried this...her legs are totally clear from the eczema!!!</li>
            <li>love love love it!</li>
            <li>So excited about finding a product made in my state that I can use that is good for eczema.</li>
            <li>For someone without a skin condition simply looking for a nice moisture cream, this would be wonderful.</li>
            <li>I want the quick fix!!</li>
            <li>I want the quick fix!!</li>
            <li>Aveeno does a better job than this one.</li>
            <li>Maybe you would have better luck.</li>
            <li>I love when a product does what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the bumps or redness, from scratching any more.  </li>
            <li>The more I cleansed it and the more products I tried the&lt;br /&gt;more</li>
            <li>more.  </li>
            <li>some of which have side effects more concerning than the skin problem one is trying to cure.</li>
            <li>and my son skin just keeps getting better.</li>
            <li>Air Force, here I come. :)</li>
            <li>It really works and smells and feels great</li>
            <li>Its organic and even better thing is that its clearing my skin up</li>
            <li>Thank You Metaderm :))&lt;</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this lotion one more time to help if the redness would go away faster.</li>
            <li>I looked up the ingredients in [...] (which you should always do to be safe), and there are a couple at the top of the ingredient list that have warnings of toxicity.</li>
            <li>and I love that it is organic</li>
            <li>I have a Hydrocortisone allergy and can not use most over the counter treatments on my eczema because of that</li>
            <li>I also love this because it dose not have all the chemicals in it that most creams do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m incredibly picky and sensitive with the products I use, and Metaderm eczema lotion and soap are outstanding.  </li>
            <li>I also used Aveeno ezcema cream, but I like this better because it doesn&#x27;t have alcohol in the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>causing more itching and burning and peeling of skin., but no change to rash</li>
            <li>and immediately I feel better.  </li>
            <li>This product helps seal it better</li>
            <li>I will for sure reorder this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such an excellent product, now everyone in the family uses it!</li>
            <li>and hopefully it works better for you than it did with my son.  </li>
            <li>I Love all Metaderm  </li>
            <li>sure you use twice a day.</li>
            <li>and it has surely helped her too.</li>
            <li>and I noticed his skin seemed more supple and healthier-looking.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed and pleased with the results, for sure, and we&#x27;re only 4 or 5 weeks into the process!</li>
            <li>it does not burn when I apply it to my sore eyes and most products</li>
            <li>it has a nice light</li>
            <li>/&gt;We were recently in Mexico and Metaderm worked wonderfully on sunburnt skin!  </li>
            <li>I found another product which works better for my problem.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Most stop working after a while.</li>
            <li>This product has given better relief for eczema and itching on my hands than anything else I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I did not use it for 90 days as directed, more like 30-60 days at a time and that worked for me.  </li>
            <li>The store bought lotions would burn and break her out more</li>
            <li>At most it took some itching away for an hour or two.</li>
            <li>I researched the ingredients and most of the ingredients are organic and are proven to promote healthy skin.</li>
            <li>I have deeplyembedded rashes that I have not been able to do anything about.</li>
            <li>My legs look and feel about 75 - 80 % better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s now in amazon.</li>
            <li>My skin has been better since using this cream.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 2 weeks and my skin looks much better.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin will look like in 10 more weeks.</li>
            <li>Everyone in our family is amazed at how much better her skin looks.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s healthy olive coloring.</li>
            <li>This lotion tempers both of those issues without being greasy or creating more breakouts.  </li>
            <li>Love the MetaDerm.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>This will not be one of the many products I use then discard because it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Eczema stopped me from attending many events as well as a trip to Disneyworld with my grandchildren</li>
            <li>would&#x27;nt be able to walk</li>
            <li>Organic coconut oil seems to do a better job for me.</li>
            <li>I hope that more people who suffer from this condition find their way here and read the reviews.  </li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>This stuff works better than steroids people.</li>
            <li>This stuff works better than steroids people.</li>
            <li>I never felt so confident in my life.</li>
            <li>but I should&#x27;ve known better.</li>
            <li>You better think twice before purchasing no brand cream.</li>
            <li>I have eczema flares mostly on my hands, elbows and feet.</li>
            <li>I just wish they could add more quantity</li>
            <li>It calms eczema and makes skin look and feel healthy</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m talking about potent steroids, a weaker Desonide didn&#x27;t even work for me.  </li>
            <li>My hands will start to get more itchy.  </li>
            <li>I also use the hyper-moisturizing cream from MetaDerm and it is more moisturizing</li>
            <li>I figure I must be allergic to one or more of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using MetaDerm for more than a year now.</li>
            <li>My eczema is now so much better, but will need a bit more time to &amp;#34;heal&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I am in love with the consistency of this lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did, because it seems to be helping with both the redness and flakiness which have improved noticeably in one week.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to put on makeup over any moisturizer as my skin will flake off, but with this product I can.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ve started alternating between the cream and the spray- seems to work:)  </li>
            <li>UPDATE: Still love this cream.</li>
            <li>I have also been using tallow/olive oil cream for a couple years, and I put Metaderm over the top at night to seal in the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love the cream, soothing and organic.  </li>
            <li>didnt work, made my ecza itch more.</li>
            <li>and I have been more than pleased with this products results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad i bought this</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what I should have done in the first place, is just went to the doctors!!!</li>
            <li>First off, I was very impressed by the large samples I received.</li>
            <li>A perfect product for dry skin which most of us are prone.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best product I have ever tried and have had the most success with.</li>
            <li>The Aveeno face one was pretty good but didnt soak in.</li>
            <li>Okay, so the cream did not work for me, but you need to try the spray as it is wonderful and really works very well.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty good.</li>
            <li>my lower legs are starting to clear up very nicely and should be cleared up in another week or 2, just using it once a day after taking a shower, SERIOUSLY HAPPY AND CHEAPER THAN THE DOCTORS CREAMS!!!!</li>
            <li>Already I can see my eczema clearing up and rarely feeling itchy!!</li>
            <li>He was thrilled that it worked so well, so quickly.</li>
            <li>She is a happy young lady!  </li>
            <li>This is the absolute best lotion that I have ever used for the highly problematic issues of skin infected with eczema.</li>
            <li>Great for my Eczema, non greasy, leaves hands feeling wonderfully soft.</li>
            <li>All in all great, natural product.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s cheap compared to most high-end skin creams.  </li>
            <li>this morning I woke up itch free (which sometimes keeps me up at night) and better</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredible to hear parents express their gratitude and relief at finally finding \\&quot;something that works.\\&quot;  Thank you!!!</li>
            <li>I loved Metaderm&#x27;s soap so much that I purchased this refill</li>
            <li>To be fair, this has been a very stressful holiday season for me and stress</li>
            <li>The best Ointment -  fixed dry hands which many good Dermatologist couldn&#x27;t not fix!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended product</li>
            <li>I was right!!</li>
            <li>This great gift more than replaced my failing effort of unscrewing the cap, which eventually pliers did (and now I understand why, because they don&#x27;t want it to leak upon shipment, and are actually talking about this with the product people to correct).  </li>
            <li>Like most really good products that are wholly or partly natural, you have to give Metaderm some time to work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so so happy that this seems to be working already because all I want is to be able to not have to worry about skin issues, especially in front of guys.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that she has finally made the connection between applying something to her skin and feeling and looking better.  </li>
            <li>This cream is the best and it works very well and does not dried out your skin at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cooling , refreshing and clean feeling.</li>
            <li>strongly recommend this product, and if you&#x27;re a skeptic, just try it out anyway.</li>
            <li>I will give it the full 3 months and if it is still doing OK, order again.</li>
            <li>I suffer from some mild excema and this works wonders for me!</li>
            <li>I work 1600 feet underground in an environment that really dry&#x27;s out your skin, this stuff is amazing and feels so good.</li>
            <li>They say twelve weeks, but I saw HUGE improvements after about 1 week.</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT REALL DOES WORK, INTO FORTH WEE AND HUGE IMPROVEMENT</li>
            <li>If the clinical trials are accurate I have an 85% chance of my skin improving.</li>
            <li>We tried the MetaDerm products (wash, spray &amp; lotion), she has been rash free for over a year now.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable with it.</li>
            <li>want to run the risk of not having this fabulous cream for Eczema</li>
            <li>, it is gentle and effective.  </li>
            <li>So in the end, I can&#x27;t say enough great things about Metaderm lotion and soap.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as emollient as others I&#x27;ve tried - on the flipside, it was absorbing and doing something effective.</li>
            <li>He even did the light therapy, 3 times a week @</li>
            <li>And because it is so light</li>
            <li>children using MetaDerm are doing great -- teachers and parents are constantly commenting about the improvement that they&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li>I got it with free shipping for $44.88 God bless</li>
            <li>my skin is so soft and bright.</li>
            <li>What a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>To calm her latest outbreak, she tried a bleach bath.  </li>
            <li>(Sounds bizarre, but I read it about it on the Mayo Clinic site.)  </li>
            <li>The same day she started using Metaderm lotion, and she has seen great improvement.  </li>
            <li>This was organic and they sent me a free sample.  </li>
            <li>I just ordered three more tubes and hope for the continued success.  </li>
            <li>the Dermatologist gives me this great list of things I have to change about my life such as:&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo: Johnson&#x27;s baby shampoo&lt;br /&gt;Soap</li>
            <li>I have tried many products over the years without much success in solving my winter eczema (on my eyelids around my nose, etc.)</li>
            <li>I apply it in the morning and before bed, I don&#x27;t even have to use cover up anymore just a light mineral foundation</li>
            <li>but so far so good</li>
            <li>It is as important for our treatment to be effective as is it to be gentle, this encompasses both.</li>
            <li>Finally I have found this cream thanks to all the wonderful reviews and have tried it.</li>
            <li>and I used it very lightly the first time.</li>
            <li>But at this price point for Metaderm, it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li>I think if I continue to use it consistently it will continue to get better.</li>
            <li>The inflammation of my eczema has been significantly reduced.</li>
            <li>Let me first say we have used many things for my daughters eczema.</li>
            <li>Great for minor irritations/rashes.</li>
            <li>This cream delivers exactly what it said it would :)  </li>
            <li>If we have had this much success in 8 days I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does as the weeks go on!</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s so excited that she can now wear sleeveless tops and skirts.  </li>
            <li>I really liked this very emollient lotion, though not greasy, absorbed quickly on my hands...</li>
            <li>I put it on and had to take it right off, set my skin on fire!</li>
            <li>Very nice healing cream for dry eczema prone skin.  </li>
            <li>We use Vanicream, which works wonderfully, but doesn&#x27;t have the most wholesome products (includes BHA, not ideal).  </li>
            <li>initially I thought that was good but within a week</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better rely on something promising than to continue using petroleum-based lotions.</li>
            <li>That being said I have used 1.5 full bottle of MetaDerm and when used 2x a day I notice a difference.</li>
            <li>The lotion is light weight and easily absorbed, without a noticeable odor/fragrance.</li>
            <li>This happens most winters, but this time it was really yucko.  </li>
            <li>Recommended by my sister who has low eczema.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived in good time.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>It also works well as a lotion, absorbing into the skin instead of sitting on top and rubbing off on everything I touch like others.  </li>
            <li>In the spirit of full disclosure, it is not Eczema that I have, but I know the specifics of the condition, and thought that this just could</li>
            <li>I really would love to hug you</li>
            <li>Even a cool shower would leave her so inflamed and itchy, she was in misery.  </li>
            <li>I thought that was cool.</li>
            <li>I bought the full line of MetaDerm products including the foaming cleanser, cream and spray.</li>
            <li>* When I initially ordered, I almost didn&#x27;t because the reviews seemed too good to be true.</li>
            <li>I am lucky that I haven&#x27;t punctured my ear drums with everything I tried.</li>
            <li>Like many people I&#x27;ve tried many different products to heal my skin.</li>
            <li>I can say that I had some success with this product on some of my smaller problem areas, so that is good news</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>No more bumps and her skin is so smooth and beautiful again.</li>
            <li>It reduces or eliminates the itchiness and burning feel rather quickly.</li>
            <li>Super and A+ for customer service.</li>
            <li>My skin has become so much more healthy after only a couple weeks of use.</li>
            <li>Go to the quick clinic</li>
            <li>HELLLOOOO Quick Clinic.</li>
            <li>I cannot tell you how lucky I am to have found this.</li>
            <li>I cannot tell you how lucky I am to have found this.</li>
            <li>I ordered one for me two months ago, had satisfying results, so I ordered one more for one of my relative.</li>
            <li>Stops itching and the need to scratch quickly.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely continue to use this!!</li>
            <li>We went on a weekend trip and she was REALLY suffering!!  </li>
            <li>First it cooled the inflammation and stopped the itching, then I started noticing it was shrinking!</li>
            <li>My skin has stop itching completely and is very smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for less than a week and my skin is already looking and more importantly feeling SO much better.</li>
            <li>I am so blessed to have found such an amazing product that has gave me results within a week.</li>
            <li>Great improvement in a few days.  </li>
            <li>I have only been using this August 22 and it is now September 8, and this product has made my skin look and feel amazing.</li>
            <li>I understand that having Eczema is a fickle skin issue with episodic flareups and periods of calm, well behaved intact skin..  </li>
            <li>I recently came across this Metaderm lotion for Eczema and was able to recieve a free sample to try it out.</li>
            <li>so you do need to stick with it to see results, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think it was worth  </li>
            <li>For the price it is worth it as well.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a shot if you&#x27;re struggling.</li>
            <li>and I hope this cream helps you like it has my 4 yr old :)</li>
            <li>They was kind enough to refund for the lotion that I could not use.</li>
            <li>This cream is light and creamy makes skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Yes, I did read the headline for this product (85% success for product),</li>
            <li>Like I said, I may be a part of that 15% that has zero success with the product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth massaging it in well to avoid a sort of slimy look, if your skin tends to do that like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I try to use natural skincare products, and this has some really lovely ingredients, This isn&#x27;t overly greasy, it absorbs well and allows my skin to heal.  </li>
            <li>For a couple of years We been looking for the right cream that would help my kids skin problem.</li>
            <li>Metaderm is the one product that began to help right away.</li>
            <li>Not only did the company replace it with minimal communication and hassle, but they sent me a large box of sample products, which was a wonderful treat.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easy and fast absorbing.  </li>
            <li>From the neck down we were good, but her face...</li>
            <li>, it was best decision ever it actually worked been using for a little while now</li>
            <li>I have an stubborn patch of eczema on my hand that won&#x27;t go away that even my strong hydrocortisone cream could clear up.</li>
            <li>The initial feel of the product is pleasant, and quickly makes any present itch disappear.</li>
            <li>I saw all of the positive reviews and thought that this would be worth trying.</li>
            <li>You will not be disappointed and the best part is that it is organic and natural so you can feel good about putting it on your skin.</li>
            <li>I was very, very relieved from my first application.  </li>
            <li>After the first month I thought it was getting a bit better; fewer itchy days, so I held out hope, but over the past week there has been significant improvement, the skin in my ear canal feels smooth, doesn&#x27;t itch, and I realized today that I wasn&#x27;t thinking about it.</li>
            <li>It has been about a month so far and the MetaDerm has been a huge hit.  </li>
            <li>I think this is the first lotion I have ever seen sorbitol in.  </li>
            <li>unlike most reviews here, only aggravated my sons eczema.</li>
            <li>i have finally found something that works after so many prescriptions and trying every lotion on the market.</li>
            <li>i am a 32 YO male with healthy skin on my hands</li>
            <li>Now with about 2/3ds of the first tube</li>
            <li>I cannot think of one downside to this product, except why wasn&#x27;t it created earlier? :)</li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was truly my first test of patience.</li>
            <li>Mostly my neck was red all the time and it always itched.</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish is that this product moisturized better - I still need to use Aquaphor to prevent dryness of the rashes (which become scaly and flaky).</li>
            <li>they reformulate and remove those ingredients (and the untrue \\&quot;100% Organic\\&quot; claim), then I&#x27;ll rate it higher.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about it is it does not have a smell.</li>
            <li>If i washed my face they would immediately swell and get even more red and inflamed.</li>
            <li>First the inflammation disappeared.</li>
            <li>I make sure to use this and spread the word as much as possible because I want others to know there is HOPE.</li>
            <li>It is pretty concentrated in this area</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products from the store and prescribed topical creams from the dermatologist and they never worked....</li>
            <li>I. I use it in conjunction with metaderm baby spray, my daughters eczema has improved almost 100% with the exception of flare ups in the creases of her elbows and knees during hot summer days.</li>
            <li>x 2.5&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>She actually asks to apply it all the time and literally begs for more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different lotions for my itchy skin.</li>
            <li>For anyone interested in saving some $ on the 32oz pump go to metaderms website</li>
            <li>It is also very affordable, which is rare for eczema creams.  </li>
            <li>That is exactly what this lotion does \\&quot;HEAL\\&quot; your skin.</li>
            <li>Metaderm did exactly was it was advertised to do.</li>
            <li>THANKS!</li>
            <li>Now she only uses the cream once or twice a week before bed as a maintenance procedure :)  </li>
            <li>This is the first product that has helped her.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>So far this cream is FANTASTIC STUFF, being diabetic</li>
            <li>My sister recommended Hydrocortisone 10 Eczema and it worked pretty well from me.</li>
            <li>I read various reviews on this site that generally gave MetaDerm a good review.</li>
            <li>I itch more and the patches seem to have grown larger on my elbows.</li>
            <li>would like to give Hydro-moisturizing a try, but I can&#x27;t afford to spend more money on another product of the same brand.</li>
            <li>i absolutly recommend this after so many years suffering wit eczema trying anything possible noting worked.</li>
            <li>this is the only thing that has worked my eczema has got so much better</li>
            <li>We highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>will most likely post an update after 10 weeks.</li>
            <li>I love this product because you get instant results regarding itchy skin.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this my husband thought it was glue.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize it at first</li>
            <li>All Free and Clear</li>
            <li>Elodil or whatever it is for the first time in a year.</li>
            <li>Elodil or whatever it is for the first time in a year.</li>
            <li>Looking at the glowing 5 star reviews, most of them have been reviewed by people and this is the only product reviewed.</li>
            <li>so it did not last more than an hour on my skin</li>
            <li>I actually find it super light warery and drying and it actually made me itch more.</li>
            <li>I am especially grateful for that now that I am pregnant and don&#x27;t want to put anything on my skin that I wouldn&#x27;t be comfortable putting on my baby after it is born.</li>
            <li>this has cleared the adult acne i have had all of my life!!~!!  </li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I was excited to try it on my 5 year old who has eczema.</li>
            <li>I have inflamed eczema due to some kind if allergen.</li>
            <li>This product is luxurious and really makes your skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and have tried many, MANY different creams, and this one beats them all.</li>
            <li>This is working VERY well for my daughter&#x27;s eczema - smoothing out the rough spots and blending nicely.  </li>
            <li>Now iv tried so many products and its weird whenever I find a good one.</li>
            <li>So far this had worked far better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This cream has worked very well and is very gentle.  </li>
            <li>all the good reviews here on amazon and the YOU TUBE video of the woman with the little girl is starting to sound like a scam to me.</li>
            <li>I started to use it and noticed a positive difference.</li>
            <li>I have no clue how or why, and I don&#x27;t really care, but this stuff really really works!</li>
            <li>My eczema really flared up when I had my first child 4 years ago.  </li>
            <li>After using it on my left leg for four days, It really made the eczema effected spot much better, Thanks</li>
            <li>Having eczema for most of my life I have spent so much money and tried so many different things to help.</li>
            <li>Most creams eventually dry sky out over time, leaving my hands &amp; arms all scaly.  </li>
            <li>It did get rid of the dry spots for the most part.</li>
            <li>like many i&#x27;ve tried basically everything in Walgreens for dry skin/eczema.</li>
            <li>She has gone to several Doctors, who had prescribed some strong steroids.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients are absolutely pure and it does not have any ghastly scent.</li>
            <li>Personally, 12 weeks is not long to wait for something that really is effective and does not thin my skin.  </li>
            <li>welcome to the world of middle-age female hormones--which means that I use a lot of chemicals, sometimes harsh, to keep it in check.  </li>
            <li>All of these products are very soothing</li>
            <li>I love that this cream works and has organic ingredients with minimal chemicals.</li>
            <li>product works for me, is cheaper than Rx creams, has no scent, and is incredibly reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>My blood glucose levels are much improved.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very thankful and grateful for the improvement in my excema symptoms that this product has provided for me.  </li>
            <li>I threw away the whole thing and will never use it again.</li>
            <li>I have severe sun damage to my chest area and neck resulting in too much sun in my 20&#x27;s and 30&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve suffered with eczema my whole life.</li>
            <li>Thanks MetaDerm.</li>
            <li>It really flares up when I&#x27;m stressed.  </li>
            <li>and my rash was very itchy.  </li>
            <li>I am going through this bottle much faster than I do Aveeno, and I don&#x27;t feel that my skin is improving.</li>
            <li>It really has worked so well for myself and&lt;br /&gt;little girl.</li>
            <li>This cream really really really works, have been suffering with hand eczema (on my fingers) for almost two years now, seen my doctor , allergy specialist, nutritionist, skin tests</li>
            <li>at night really calms it.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs really well, too and seems to be scent-free.</li>
            <li>but I wanted people to know that this cream really helped me.</li>
            <li>but it has helped alot and has really helped his itching as well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a cure for me but very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream for anyone suffering from excema!</li>
            <li>I was really in to coconut oil and the lauric acid in</li>
            <li>it caused the fungus to exit my body through my skin as I did not gradually increase my intake of the coconut oil I use too much too fast.</li>
            <li>So Thak U sooo much to the person who came up with this.</li>
            <li>Very thankful.</li>
            <li>Applying the steroids and covering it with band&#x60;aids, which didn&#x27;t really help much.  </li>
            <li>I tried all kinds of creams and ointments, and nothing really worked that well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>the company and Liz was really helpful.</li>
            <li>I did buy the \\&quot;Fast absorbing\\&quot; and not the \\&quot;Hyper-Moisturizing.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The flareups are clearing, and her skin feels much softer than before.  </li>
            <li>THANKS Metaderm.</li>
            <li>My child has been having atopic eczema for 8 years now (primary areas are elbows, back of knees,  hands, wrists and feet).</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t really work as what the product says its suppose to do.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really help my eczema...</li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t see much improvement.</li>
            <li>I was ready to go to another dermatologist and try another steroid, since the eczema was migrating from my legs and arms to my hands and chest.  </li>
            <li>But the rest of my body and my hands are so much</li>
            <li>It really changed my life.</li>
            <li>It really changed my life.</li>
            <li>But I really like it and have noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping to find something non-steroidal that would work for me.</li>
            <li>You guys really have something here</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>really helped the eczema close to eye area .</li>
            <li>This lotion really has helped with my eczema.  </li>
            <li>I bought this 3 months ago and it hasn&#x27;t really helped me</li>
            <li>okay only 4 days to 12 weeks clear</li>
            <li>my 11 years old daughter was recovering of a severe eczema rash on her hands, we tought that this cream would help her to recover faster based on the good reviews this cream has here on amazon, we tried it at night before bed time next mornig she woke up with her hands red and with lots of waterballs all over her hands.</li>
            <li>After a few days of not using any kind of product the redness started to recede.</li>
            <li>so I bought this $14 lotion thinking that it wouldn&#x27;t do much but at least it was organic and probably good for moisturizing.</li>
            <li>when you put on this cream, it feels nice for a few seconds.  </li>
            <li>I had really high hopes after reading all the positive reviews, but it turned out to be just another cream to add to the list of products that claimed to be miracle workers and do not do anything.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m supposed to have soft hands, right?).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see the future results this product gives me!</li>
            <li>I am satisfied and will try other products as well.</li>
            <li>My eczema gets really dry and itchy and I need a strong moisturizer that will keep me from scratching.</li>
            <li>I will continue with the cream, the tube is large enough to last me many years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Metaderm cream for less than a week and honestly can&#x27;t believe that my eczema is almost completely cleared up.</li>
            <li>I had severe eczema as a baby and mild eczema as a young child; I am now 63, and hadn&#x27;t had eczema in my adult</li>
            <li>My son has used this for a few weeks in along with the amazing dead sea salt spreadable and his eczema is much much better.</li>
            <li>It did clear some of my eczema after the first application.</li>
            <li>Your skin feels smooth all day long.</li>
            <li>So far overall I&#x27;m thrilled my eczema is starting to go away!</li>
            <li>Lauri white to understand the true depths of our trials.</li>
            <li>I am not yet completely healed, but after just 8 short days, I have every belief that they will completely clear in a couple more weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait for that new bottle!  </li>
            <li>This lotion has did an unbelievable job on my skin and is nothing short of amazing!</li>
            <li>Now she complains much less of itchiness and her mom says she is sleeping better at night.  </li>
            <li>i am a loyal customer, just ordered my second tube!!!!</li>
            <li>Things would be ok for awhile and then boom, itchy red rash back and reeking havoc.</li>
            <li>I am glad to say that 3 weeks to the day he started using it, he came home from work and showed me that he actually has hair growing on the back of his hands.</li>
            <li>not only with the results but how quickly the product worked.  </li>
            <li>I am only giving it two stars because of quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I bought this after just checking out the decent review on here</li>
            <li>Also, only a small amount of this product is required and it is a large indeed, making this an exceedingly good value.</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with my results and can&#x27;t wait to see what the next few weeks bring!!</li>
            <li>using but really liking results so far!</li>
            <li>Jury&#x27;s still out, but the first round are going strong.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li>Eventually it moved from my forearms to my hands in high school, moving into the severe category.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this cream for my 16 yr old niece who had suffered from eczema on her hands for YEARS, and was VERY self conscience about it.  </li>
            <li>This really helped clear my skin.</li>
            <li>Obviously, I think it&#x27;s worth it, because I&#x27;m going to continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>Immediately the itching stopped and my skin&#x27;s temperature returned to normal.  </li>
            <li>I can see normal skin colour again.</li>
            <li>My wife can breathe, my daughter can have a normal life and</li>
            <li>In a few more months I bet it will be gone.</li>
            <li>The only I can say is, it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li>Results seem effective but slow at times...</li>
            <li>There is no topical treatment that can make her skin clear up 100%, but this is the first lotion (that&#x27;s not a topical steroid) that has made a significant difference.  </li>
            <li>It took several weeks to fully clear, but I could tell that it was working rather quickly.</li>
            <li>Even though I don&#x27;t have eczema, I&#x27;ve had facial redness for years and have been looking for something mild for my sensitive skin to help.</li>
            <li>It might be the right combination, FINALLY!</li>
            <li>I bought the large bottle of hyper-moisturizing but will buy this regular one again when I go through the large bottle.</li>
            <li>I can use this lotion for just a few days and most itchy spots clear up!</li>
            <li>This is a very slight sting to the skin when applying this product however the skin already looks and feel better.</li>
            <li>In a few more days the redness was completely gone and the cracked areas of her hands were healing up!  </li>
            <li>I have tried many many things to get rid of my eczema or at least control it with no avail.. lotions, creams, natural home remedies, and have spent hundreds of dollars to see doctors and specialists.</li>
            <li>and we had run the gammit for trying new products when I came across MetaDerm Organic cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Aveeno Eczema Therapy for quite awhile but thought I&#x27;d try something new as I felt</li>
            <li>All this suffering and this cream has given me a new lease on life.  </li>
            <li>It has not helped with the itching, I have pretty extreme eczema,  very large irritated patches so that could have something to do with it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After using this only one time, we noticed a huge difference the next</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to smells that linger all day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this MetaDerm stuff twice a day (after my morning shower, and right before bed), and it has a clear, obvious effect</li>
            <li>I find that very little works better than a lot.</li>
            <li>I was on my way to scratching my skin completely off!  </li>
            <li>the first week the itching was totally gone and the rash was fading more&lt;</li>
            <li>my son has who&#x27;s 11 has been suffering with eczema since he was 3 yrs old!</li>
            <li>I put it on first thing in the morning and don&#x27;t feel the need to keep putting hand cream on the rest of the day as I did with regular hand creams.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time my daughters eczema has totally went away</li>
            <li>The 3rd ingredient is emulsifying wax which caused me to pause when I first read it.</li>
            <li>Wow did it help!</li>
            <li>I shop on Amazon all the time and usually never leave a review</li>
            <li>Recently she even commented on how pretty her feet look.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It has completely cleared up!</li>
            <li>My husband has a heat rash on his back year round, this eczema cream really seemed to make it better.</li>
            <li>This is the first product that actually absorbs into my skin!</li>
            <li>I did notice that if I use to much (as I was very excited about it), my skin will get a little red.</li>
            <li>This stuff calmed it down overnight, the redness was gone in 72 hours and after a week her skin is smooth and soft without an itchy patch in sight!</li>
            <li>I typically read reviews of anything I order on Amazon, but I was given Metaderm as a free sample at a mom&#x27;s event and had never researched it before trying.  </li>
            <li>At this rate my skin should be back to normal within a week after scratching so much I had sores.  </li>
            <li>Sadly, this product is not for me, but the company will give you a full refund if you aren&#x27;t satisfied.    </li>
            <li>worth every single penny</li>
            <li>I am forever grateful to Metaderm for freeing me from the endless cycle of prescription eczema creams that are full of things that probably shouldn&#x27;t be put on my body any ways.</li>
            <li>and the swelling has gone down significantly.</li>
            <li>Coming back a couple hours later to reapply it is better if you feel dry.  </li>
            <li>Wow, after trying to treat my 6 year old daughters eczema her whole life with little success</li>
            <li>Best part about it is, unlike the topical steroids we get both from her doctor and OTC, I can put it on her every day without fear of the bad side effects that come from the steroidal creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried anything &amp; everything to help clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>I would say their skin is now 90% clear.</li>
            <li>We have been using the product for 8 days and the rough, raised patches are smooth and her skin is almost back to</li>
            <li>attribute my clear zkin to Metaderm.</li>
            <li>If by christmas I&#x27;m still clear I will write another review.  </li>
            <li>This is a relief for a 7yr old who was bothered by the break</li>
            <li>My son has had eczema since he was two months old.  </li>
            <li>Been using on my 2 1/2 year old since he was about 1 1/2.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin moisturized and soft.  </li>
            <li>So, after vaseline and lotion wasn&#x27;t quite doing much, the prescribed ointment was getting low</li>
            <li>Thanks to Meta Derm lotion, which I have to use daily,</li>
            <li>I am in healthcare and started to use only organic types of hand soaps about 2 years ago (to avoid chemicals and toxins) and noticed that many of them severely dried my hands, exacerbated by frequent handwashing and glove changing throughout the day.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t work out for our 8 months old.</li>
            <li>I saw metaderm on Amazon as I am a frequent shopper on here.</li>
            <li>It took about a month for the redness to completely disappear, and from then on, it has completely stayed away and I can even go out WITHOUT makeup on!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I needed a product that could reduce my eczema to the point of either completely restored skin or where it seems that I don&#x27;t even have eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had nearly immediate relief during the two weeks off the steroids.  </li>
            <li>I am 22 and have had Eczema since I was 2 years old.</li>
            <li>and it leaves my skin soft, moisturized, and not an itch...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for adult now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only one that really worked to soothe.</li>
            <li>Its affordable, natural and no side effects.</li>
            <li>it leaves the skin so soft .</li>
            <li>I purchased this cream for my 10 week old baby, who had developed eczema on his face.</li>
            <li>I test everything on myself before passing it along to my son&#x27;s sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Even the lotion that&#x27;s supposed to be for sensitive skin makes her cry out in pain when I apply.  </li>
            <li>THREE days was all it took using this lotion for my eczema to be completely cleared.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been struggling with eczema on my face(forehead,under eyes,&amp; near chin) for months now-as soon as I thought it was clearing up</li>
            <li>The cream leaves your skin feeling soft and doesn&#x27;t sting or irritate when you put it on.</li>
            <li>the all natural stuff would be so greasy that it would stain her clothes and get in her hair.</li>
            <li>and it keeps my skin soft all day.  </li>
            <li>Well, that was as far as that went.</li>
            <li>Seems to be doing it;s job so far.</li>
            <li>I used this stuff and after 2-3 months the Eczema on my face was faded and nearly gone.  </li>
            <li>I get these sore&#x27;s on my lower legs, all the creams the doctors give me have done nother to heal the sore&#x27;s, so far after day 3 of using this stuff</li>
            <li>I have adult acne--</li>
            <li>My daughter suffered from this disorder since she was 6 months old.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 20 year old daughter who has suffered from eczema since she was a toddler.  </li>
            <li>I am now 29yrs old and have suffered from it forever.</li>
            <li>So far using it about a week.  </li>
            <li>Two years ago, I developed eczema after a hiking trip in the desert.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s a surgeon and has to wash his hands frequently, so I&#x27;m hoping that this helps him, too.</li>
            <li>My eczema is completely gone from my arms, face, and stomach.</li>
            <li>My eczema is completely gone from my arms, face, and stomach.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any difference for about 20 days but after that I was surprised to see my skin start to clear up</li>
            <li>the layer of crust that covered my entire back has chaffed away, and new smooth skin has emerged with only left over fading spots.</li>
            <li>elbows are clear, hands are clear, back of my legs are clear, my butt is clear, wrists are all clear of itchy scaly flakes!  </li>
            <li>I met an older woman a while back</li>
            <li>I go back to the quick clinic tell them I have been on steroids more or less for the past 2 months.</li>
            <li>My skin was paper thin from the steroids and cut very easily.  </li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m in shock because the eczema havent returned, my hands are unbelievable back to normal smooth and soft again, BUT ITS A 12 WEEK FORMULA SO DONT USE FOR 1 WEEK  OR 2 AND EXPECT TO SEE RESULTS.</li>
            <li>My skin is back to normal.  </li>
            <li>In just 2 days the rash is smaller and the skin is returning to normal.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;m back to my normal self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and then it became completely normal in only the area that I was putting the cream.</li>
            <li>Normally my skin gets very red and irritated with any moisturizer, and it doesn&#x27;t with this.</li>
            <li>Seems to calm my Eczema down and heal it &amp;#</li>
            <li>We have one child who has particularly severe eczema (she&#x27;s been hospitalized before) and generally hates having anything applied topically -- it seems like everything ends up triggering itching and burning.  </li>
            <li>We went over his diet and routine and the Metaderm was the only new addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am definitely one who is more sensitive to trying new products but never experienced any breakouts that occurred in the lower rated reviews.</li>
            <li>Within 3 days I noticed it starting to clear and within 6 days it was completely gone.</li>
            <li>I very occasionally use steroid cream to bring my skin back when the eczema starts to get really itchy</li>
            <li>there has been a major noticeable difference and</li>
            <li>My skin on my hands is still not perfect but it is better than it&#x27;s been in years!  </li>
            <li>It took her red, raw, raised patches of eczema and soothed and healed them so quickly!</li>
            <li>Slight smell, not bad, but definitely has a scent to it</li>
            <li>It is a very thick cream, almost too thick, so it is not as easy to spread, and you end up using more product than you need.</li>
            <li>I have tried various other prescription creams but without much success.</li>
            <li>The only thing that has ever worked for me is a strong dose of hydrocortisone cream and it still only lasts a few days.</li>
            <li>I read a lot of the reviews and they are overwhelmingly positive, this is one of the very few products for eczema that have clinical trial research to back it up and in addition a large percentage of the ingredients are organic and proven to aid in the healing of skin issues/conditions naturally.</li>
            <li>The lotion itself is very thick, more like a salve.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a large tube and will last a long time, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again...</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I was sorry to say that I found that it didn&#x27;t work for that purpose, I did find an AMAZING moisturizing cream in this MetaDerm Eczema cream.</li>
            <li>Instead the cream has a pleasantly smooth and delicate feel to it, and the eczema may just be subsiding...</li>
            <li>This is my second week and my face is 90% clear.</li>
            <li>Not only does it clear up my eczema</li>
            <li>My knuckles developed outbreaks of an itchy rash that would resolve only temporarily with over-the-counter hydrocortisone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen improvement in only 2 weeks of use, and I hope to see my eczema completely vanish by the end of 12 weeks.</li>
            <li>My 7 year old daughter&#x27;s eczema is severe enough that at any given time, she has cracked, bleeding skin.  </li>
            <li>I found my old tube of this product that I bought last year and decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li>MetaDerm is far purer, but not as moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t create the same barrier on his skin, but it&#x27;s a trade-off.  </li>
            <li>I can only use baby eczema creams because adult creams burn and irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Now that I am 25 years old, I just recently started to notice patches on my neck and elbows.</li>
            <li>We only used it once, but my 5 year old burst out in tears because it was burning her legs.</li>
            <li>, I think many people get confused by that.  </li>
            <li>Finally a product that actually is helping my 10 month old&#x27;s eczema!  </li>
            <li>I am not going to jump to conclusions yet because like other products we have used they work well at first but over time the eczema comes back.</li>
            <li>So far I like the product, however, I have not used it long enough as yet, to give a clear review on the jproduct.</li>
            <li>about 6 weeks ago I developed red, dry patches of skin between my eye brows and on the sensitive skin area under my eyes to the bridge of my nose.</li>
            <li>After about a month, I couldn&#x27;t stand the products anymore and went back to my old moisturizer and non-soap cleanser which returned my skin back to square one.</li>
            <li>Lately the rash started to spread to new areas of her body, including her face, for the first time.</li>
            <li>I like the long term effects &amp; the fact that it&#x27;s so natural.  </li>
            <li>I have found that when I&#x27;m cleaning or washing dishes, I have to wear latex gloves, because all detergents, even those without harsh chemical, and the hot water aggravate the eczema on my hands.  </li>
            <li>you have eczema, this product is WELL worth the small price.  </li>
            <li>Earlier this year some of her classmates teased her and said that her hands looked dirty; she had become very self-conscious and quiet but her skin looks so much better now and her confidence has soared.  </li>
            <li>After using it a month I have noticed my skin is MUCH softer and has a less damaged appearance.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I both suffer from dry, sensitive, eczema ridden skin.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone with dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This product is a must have for dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It can sting sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I would still definitely recommend anyone with dry skin, sensitive skin, or eczema</li>
            <li>but it sometimes flakes a little on my skin if I rub it in too much.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for extreme dry skin.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> At this point, I was already happy with the product because I felt I could cover the redness with makeup</li>

            <li> i dont think it works so great.</li>
            <li> After 1 month he feels great and has not had the &amp;#34;itchies&amp;#34; at all.</li>
            <li> great product thank you Metaderm.</li>
            <li> I am soooo happy with this purchase that I am going to buy the 32oz.pump b/c using it twice a day all over the body uses a lot of cream.</li>
            <li> Great lotion.</li>
            <li> This product worked great for me.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Great find.</li>
            <li> just so you know how great this product is.</li>
            <li> So, MetaDem works great for us</li>
            <li> I do a lot of mission work and have taken this product into Sierra Leone Africa with great results.  </li>
            <li> great lotion</li>
            <li> Love this product!!</li>
            <li> I love this product!!</li>
            <li> It is very nice</li>
            <li> These people truly care about your skin and have amazing customer service!</li>
            <li> Metaderm is an amazing product!</li>
            <li> My wife bought this product bec of the good reviews and was hopeful for this product</li>
            <li> But, in all, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> And California Baby was also good, but I prefer a foam dispenser.  </li>
            <li> I think it is going to become my go-to product for any kind of skin irritation and could even make a great &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; face cream.  </li>
            <li> This is a good product.</li>
            <li> and I have loved having this moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> It took itching away for a good 8-10 hours from the start.</li>
            <li> In addition I did some research and castor oil is good for lighting scars on the skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x60;t know why this company think that the plants in this cream are good for the skin, my face looked like the time i touched poison ivy.</li>
            <li> This product is really good</li>
            <li> Good luck to all that suffer from eczema</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> but it is surprising how well an organic product like this works.</li>
            <li> Very good texture, and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so very glad that I did.</li>
            <li> I am sure it just depends on the person, but for me, it worked great.</li>
            <li> A huge difference from 2 or 3 times a week!!  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> You will be so glad you did!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> A return customer for sure!</li>
            <li> I love the products!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  </li>
            <li> I love MetaDerm!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> while I can&#x27;t say for certain it works for Eczema, I can tell you it&#x27;s a great, great moisturizer on</li>
            <li> Amazing.......</li>
            <li> the stuff in here is amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s used to be amazing</li>
            <li> I want to say &amp;#34;this product is amazing</li>
            <li> It has been amazing for the dryness of my Eczema.</li>
            <li> As soon as I applied this to my skin it was just amazing.  </li>
            <li> It is an amazing feeling to have my life</li>
            <li> This stuff is beyond amazing.</li>
            <li> and honestly it worked...</li>
            <li> and i tried this cream on my own hands</li>
            <li> nice packaging</li>
            <li> Good thing is my neck is better after being treated by the doctor.</li>
            <li> which is why I always make sure to have a good stockpile of this stuff..</li>
            <li> but I wish they had some kind of an eczema soap wash to tie with the MetaDerm Cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much thicker than a lotion which is great!</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I believe this is working for my husband.</li>
            <li> So far so good.. very impressed..</li>
            <li> i would walk by the pharmacy an the pharmacist know me by name, and nothing worked,doctors said stop eating this ,stop eating that, stop wearing perfume,lotion,and all kind of stuff.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> Really nice ingredient blend.</li>
            <li> and I liked the reviews and the fact of it being all herbal mix</li>
            <li> A nice company to shop with they care about their customers and how well their products work.</li>
            <li> this was kind of greasy to the touch.</li>
            <li> good effect, reduce itch, my baby love it</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great product!!</li>
            <li> and I really do hope people find what works best for them.</li>
            <li> I honestly thought it would never be that way again.</li>
            <li> Who would think an organic cream that costs about 1/5 of any steroid cream would have this kind of results.  </li>
            <li> i really liked this product seems it works well</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t nearly as effective at killing my eczema as coconut oil based lotion or magnesium lotion, but was still a creamy lotion.</li>
            <li> Very nice, smooth cream.</li>
            <li> On another great note, I started using the cream as a facial moisturizer at night and in the morning, and it&#x27;s perfect under makeup - very light and not at all greasy.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a high quality perfect moisturizer, this is what I will be recommending to everyone I know with eczema like myself.</li>
            <li> The Honest Company soap and lotion were good, but I prefer how Metaderm&#x27;s products are fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> Skin probably varies quite a bit as far as sensitivity and what will work best for it.</li>
            <li> Having said this, this is a nice cream that will help most people I would imagine.</li>
            <li> This one seems more effective.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this Cream and am so happy I tried this...her legs are totally clear from the eczema!!!</li>
            <li> love love love it!</li>
            <li> So excited about finding a product made in my state that I can use that is good for eczema.</li>
            <li> For someone without a skin condition simply looking for a nice moisture cream, this would be wonderful.</li>
            <li> I want the quick fix!!</li>
            <li> I want the quick fix!!</li>
            <li> Aveeno does a better job than this one.</li>
            <li> Maybe you would have better luck.</li>
            <li> I love when a product does what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the bumps or redness, from scratching any more.  </li>
            <li> The more I cleansed it and the more products I tried the&lt;br /&gt;more</li>
            <li> more.  </li>
            <li> some of which have side effects more concerning than the skin problem one is trying to cure.</li>
            <li> and my son skin just keeps getting better.</li>
            <li> Air Force, here I come. :)</li>
            <li> It really works and smells and feels great</li>
            <li> Its organic and even better thing is that its clearing my skin up</li>
            <li> Thank You Metaderm :))&lt;</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this lotion one more time to help if the redness would go away faster.</li>
            <li> I looked up the ingredients in [...] (which you should always do to be safe), and there are a couple at the top of the ingredient list that have warnings of toxicity.</li>
            <li> and I love that it is organic</li>
            <li> I have a Hydrocortisone allergy and can not use most over the counter treatments on my eczema because of that</li>
            <li> I also love this because it dose not have all the chemicals in it that most creams do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m incredibly picky and sensitive with the products I use, and Metaderm eczema lotion and soap are outstanding.  </li>
            <li> I also used Aveeno ezcema cream, but I like this better because it doesn&#x27;t have alcohol in the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> causing more itching and burning and peeling of skin., but no change to rash</li>
            <li> and immediately I feel better.  </li>
            <li> This product helps seal it better</li>
            <li> I will for sure reorder this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such an excellent product, now everyone in the family uses it!</li>
            <li> and hopefully it works better for you than it did with my son.  </li>
            <li> I Love all Metaderm  </li>
            <li> sure you use twice a day.</li>
            <li> and it has surely helped her too.</li>
            <li> and I noticed his skin seemed more supple and healthier-looking.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed and pleased with the results, for sure, and we&#x27;re only 4 or 5 weeks into the process!</li>
            <li> it does not burn when I apply it to my sore eyes and most products</li>
            <li> it has a nice light</li>
            <li> /&gt;We were recently in Mexico and Metaderm worked wonderfully on sunburnt skin!  </li>
            <li> I found another product which works better for my problem.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Most stop working after a while.</li>
            <li> This product has given better relief for eczema and itching on my hands than anything else I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I did not use it for 90 days as directed, more like 30-60 days at a time and that worked for me.  </li>
            <li> The store bought lotions would burn and break her out more</li>
            <li> At most it took some itching away for an hour or two.</li>
            <li> I researched the ingredients and most of the ingredients are organic and are proven to promote healthy skin.</li>
            <li> I have deeplyembedded rashes that I have not been able to do anything about.</li>
            <li> My legs look and feel about 75 - 80 % better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s now in amazon.</li>
            <li> My skin has been better since using this cream.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 2 weeks and my skin looks much better.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin will look like in 10 more weeks.</li>
            <li> Everyone in our family is amazed at how much better her skin looks.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s healthy olive coloring.</li>
            <li> This lotion tempers both of those issues without being greasy or creating more breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Love the MetaDerm.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff</li>
            <li> This will not be one of the many products I use then discard because it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Eczema stopped me from attending many events as well as a trip to Disneyworld with my grandchildren</li>
            <li> would&#x27;nt be able to walk</li>
            <li> Organic coconut oil seems to do a better job for me.</li>
            <li> I hope that more people who suffer from this condition find their way here and read the reviews.  </li>
            <li> Okay.</li>
            <li> This stuff works better than steroids people.</li>
            <li> This stuff works better than steroids people.</li>
            <li> I never felt so confident in my life.</li>
            <li> but I should&#x27;ve known better.</li>
            <li> You better think twice before purchasing no brand cream.</li>
            <li> I have eczema flares mostly on my hands, elbows and feet.</li>
            <li> I just wish they could add more quantity</li>
            <li> It calms eczema and makes skin look and feel healthy</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m talking about potent steroids, a weaker Desonide didn&#x27;t even work for me.  </li>
            <li> My hands will start to get more itchy.  </li>
            <li> I also use the hyper-moisturizing cream from MetaDerm and it is more moisturizing</li>
            <li> I figure I must be allergic to one or more of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using MetaDerm for more than a year now.</li>
            <li> My eczema is now so much better, but will need a bit more time to &amp;#34;heal&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I am in love with the consistency of this lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did, because it seems to be helping with both the redness and flakiness which have improved noticeably in one week.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to put on makeup over any moisturizer as my skin will flake off, but with this product I can.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve started alternating between the cream and the spray- seems to work:)  </li>
            <li> UPDATE: Still love this cream.</li>
            <li> I have also been using tallow/olive oil cream for a couple years, and I put Metaderm over the top at night to seal in the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love the cream, soothing and organic.  </li>
            <li> didnt work, made my ecza itch more.</li>
            <li> and I have been more than pleased with this products results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad i bought this</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what I should have done in the first place, is just went to the doctors!!!</li>
            <li> First off, I was very impressed by the large samples I received.</li>
            <li> A perfect product for dry skin which most of us are prone.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product I have ever tried and have had the most success with.</li>
            <li> The Aveeno face one was pretty good but didnt soak in.</li>
            <li> Okay, so the cream did not work for me, but you need to try the spray as it is wonderful and really works very well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty good.</li>
            <li> my lower legs are starting to clear up very nicely and should be cleared up in another week or 2, just using it once a day after taking a shower, SERIOUSLY HAPPY AND CHEAPER THAN THE DOCTORS CREAMS!!!!</li>
            <li> Already I can see my eczema clearing up and rarely feeling itchy!!</li>
            <li> He was thrilled that it worked so well, so quickly.</li>
            <li> She is a happy young lady!  </li>
            <li> This is the absolute best lotion that I have ever used for the highly problematic issues of skin infected with eczema.</li>
            <li> Great for my Eczema, non greasy, leaves hands feeling wonderfully soft.</li>
            <li> All in all great, natural product.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s cheap compared to most high-end skin creams.  </li>
            <li> this morning I woke up itch free (which sometimes keeps me up at night) and better</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredible to hear parents express their gratitude and relief at finally finding \\&quot;something that works.\\&quot;  Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I loved Metaderm&#x27;s soap so much that I purchased this refill</li>
            <li> To be fair, this has been a very stressful holiday season for me and stress</li>
            <li> The best Ointment -  fixed dry hands which many good Dermatologist couldn&#x27;t not fix!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended product</li>
            <li> I was right!!</li>
            <li> This great gift more than replaced my failing effort of unscrewing the cap, which eventually pliers did (and now I understand why, because they don&#x27;t want it to leak upon shipment, and are actually talking about this with the product people to correct).  </li>
            <li> Like most really good products that are wholly or partly natural, you have to give Metaderm some time to work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so so happy that this seems to be working already because all I want is to be able to not have to worry about skin issues, especially in front of guys.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great that she has finally made the connection between applying something to her skin and feeling and looking better.  </li>
            <li> This cream is the best and it works very well and does not dried out your skin at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cooling , refreshing and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> strongly recommend this product, and if you&#x27;re a skeptic, just try it out anyway.</li>
            <li> I will give it the full 3 months and if it is still doing OK, order again.</li>
            <li> I suffer from some mild excema and this works wonders for me!</li>
            <li> I work 1600 feet underground in an environment that really dry&#x27;s out your skin, this stuff is amazing and feels so good.</li>
            <li> They say twelve weeks, but I saw HUGE improvements after about 1 week.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT REALL DOES WORK, INTO FORTH WEE AND HUGE IMPROVEMENT</li>
            <li> If the clinical trials are accurate I have an 85% chance of my skin improving.</li>
            <li> We tried the MetaDerm products (wash, spray &amp; lotion), she has been rash free for over a year now.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable with it.</li>
            <li> want to run the risk of not having this fabulous cream for Eczema</li>
            <li> , it is gentle and effective.  </li>
            <li> So in the end, I can&#x27;t say enough great things about Metaderm lotion and soap.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as emollient as others I&#x27;ve tried - on the flipside, it was absorbing and doing something effective.</li>
            <li> He even did the light therapy, 3 times a week @</li>
            <li> And because it is so light</li>
            <li> children using MetaDerm are doing great -- teachers and parents are constantly commenting about the improvement that they&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li> I got it with free shipping for $44.88 God bless</li>
            <li> my skin is so soft and bright.</li>
            <li> What a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> To calm her latest outbreak, she tried a bleach bath.  </li>
            <li> (Sounds bizarre, but I read it about it on the Mayo Clinic site.)  </li>
            <li> The same day she started using Metaderm lotion, and she has seen great improvement.  </li>
            <li> This was organic and they sent me a free sample.  </li>
            <li> I just ordered three more tubes and hope for the continued success.  </li>
            <li> the Dermatologist gives me this great list of things I have to change about my life such as:&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo: Johnson&#x27;s baby shampoo&lt;br /&gt;Soap</li>
            <li> I have tried many products over the years without much success in solving my winter eczema (on my eyelids around my nose, etc.)</li>
            <li> I apply it in the morning and before bed, I don&#x27;t even have to use cover up anymore just a light mineral foundation</li>
            <li> but so far so good</li>
            <li> It is as important for our treatment to be effective as is it to be gentle, this encompasses both.</li>
            <li> Finally I have found this cream thanks to all the wonderful reviews and have tried it.</li>
            <li> and I used it very lightly the first time.</li>
            <li> But at this price point for Metaderm, it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li> I think if I continue to use it consistently it will continue to get better.</li>
            <li> The inflammation of my eczema has been significantly reduced.</li>
            <li> Let me first say we have used many things for my daughters eczema.</li>
            <li> Great for minor irritations/rashes.</li>
            <li> This cream delivers exactly what it said it would :)  </li>
            <li> If we have had this much success in 8 days I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does as the weeks go on!</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s so excited that she can now wear sleeveless tops and skirts.  </li>
            <li> I really liked this very emollient lotion, though not greasy, absorbed quickly on my hands...</li>
            <li> I put it on and had to take it right off, set my skin on fire!</li>
            <li> Very nice healing cream for dry eczema prone skin.  </li>
            <li> We use Vanicream, which works wonderfully, but doesn&#x27;t have the most wholesome products (includes BHA, not ideal).  </li>
            <li> initially I thought that was good but within a week</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better rely on something promising than to continue using petroleum-based lotions.</li>
            <li> That being said I have used 1.5 full bottle of MetaDerm and when used 2x a day I notice a difference.</li>
            <li> The lotion is light weight and easily absorbed, without a noticeable odor/fragrance.</li>
            <li> This happens most winters, but this time it was really yucko.  </li>
            <li> Recommended by my sister who has low eczema.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived in good time.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> It also works well as a lotion, absorbing into the skin instead of sitting on top and rubbing off on everything I touch like others.  </li>
            <li> In the spirit of full disclosure, it is not Eczema that I have, but I know the specifics of the condition, and thought that this just could</li>
            <li> I really would love to hug you</li>
            <li> Even a cool shower would leave her so inflamed and itchy, she was in misery.  </li>
            <li> I thought that was cool.</li>
            <li> I bought the full line of MetaDerm products including the foaming cleanser, cream and spray.</li>
            <li> * When I initially ordered, I almost didn&#x27;t because the reviews seemed too good to be true.</li>
            <li> I am lucky that I haven&#x27;t punctured my ear drums with everything I tried.</li>
            <li> Like many people I&#x27;ve tried many different products to heal my skin.</li>
            <li> I can say that I had some success with this product on some of my smaller problem areas, so that is good news</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> No more bumps and her skin is so smooth and beautiful again.</li>
            <li> It reduces or eliminates the itchiness and burning feel rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Super and A+ for customer service.</li>
            <li> My skin has become so much more healthy after only a couple weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Go to the quick clinic</li>
            <li> HELLLOOOO Quick Clinic.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how lucky I am to have found this.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how lucky I am to have found this.</li>
            <li> I ordered one for me two months ago, had satisfying results, so I ordered one more for one of my relative.</li>
            <li> Stops itching and the need to scratch quickly.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I will absolutely continue to use this!!</li>
            <li> We went on a weekend trip and she was REALLY suffering!!  </li>
            <li> First it cooled the inflammation and stopped the itching, then I started noticing it was shrinking!</li>
            <li> My skin has stop itching completely and is very smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for less than a week and my skin is already looking and more importantly feeling SO much better.</li>
            <li> I am so blessed to have found such an amazing product that has gave me results within a week.</li>
            <li> Great improvement in a few days.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using this August 22 and it is now September 8, and this product has made my skin look and feel amazing.</li>
            <li> I understand that having Eczema is a fickle skin issue with episodic flareups and periods of calm, well behaved intact skin..  </li>
            <li> I recently came across this Metaderm lotion for Eczema and was able to recieve a free sample to try it out.</li>
            <li> so you do need to stick with it to see results, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think it was worth  </li>
            <li> For the price it is worth it as well.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a shot if you&#x27;re struggling.</li>
            <li> and I hope this cream helps you like it has my 4 yr old :)</li>
            <li> They was kind enough to refund for the lotion that I could not use.</li>
            <li> This cream is light and creamy makes skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Yes, I did read the headline for this product (85% success for product),</li>
            <li> Like I said, I may be a part of that 15% that has zero success with the product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worth massaging it in well to avoid a sort of slimy look, if your skin tends to do that like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I try to use natural skincare products, and this has some really lovely ingredients, This isn&#x27;t overly greasy, it absorbs well and allows my skin to heal.  </li>
            <li> For a couple of years We been looking for the right cream that would help my kids skin problem.</li>
            <li> Metaderm is the one product that began to help right away.</li>
            <li> Not only did the company replace it with minimal communication and hassle, but they sent me a large box of sample products, which was a wonderful treat.  </li>
            <li> Goes on easy and fast absorbing.  </li>
            <li> From the neck down we were good, but her face...</li>
            <li> , it was best decision ever it actually worked been using for a little while now</li>
            <li> I have an stubborn patch of eczema on my hand that won&#x27;t go away that even my strong hydrocortisone cream could clear up.</li>
            <li> The initial feel of the product is pleasant, and quickly makes any present itch disappear.</li>
            <li> I saw all of the positive reviews and thought that this would be worth trying.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed and the best part is that it is organic and natural so you can feel good about putting it on your skin.</li>
            <li> I was very, very relieved from my first application.  </li>
            <li> After the first month I thought it was getting a bit better; fewer itchy days, so I held out hope, but over the past week there has been significant improvement, the skin in my ear canal feels smooth, doesn&#x27;t itch, and I realized today that I wasn&#x27;t thinking about it.</li>
            <li> It has been about a month so far and the MetaDerm has been a huge hit.  </li>
            <li> I think this is the first lotion I have ever seen sorbitol in.  </li>
            <li> unlike most reviews here, only aggravated my sons eczema.</li>
            <li> i have finally found something that works after so many prescriptions and trying every lotion on the market.</li>
            <li> i am a 32 YO male with healthy skin on my hands</li>
            <li> Now with about 2/3ds of the first tube</li>
            <li> I cannot think of one downside to this product, except why wasn&#x27;t it created earlier? :)</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was truly my first test of patience.</li>
            <li> Mostly my neck was red all the time and it always itched.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish is that this product moisturized better - I still need to use Aquaphor to prevent dryness of the rashes (which become scaly and flaky).</li>
            <li> they reformulate and remove those ingredients (and the untrue \\&quot;100% Organic\\&quot; claim), then I&#x27;ll rate it higher.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about it is it does not have a smell.</li>
            <li> If i washed my face they would immediately swell and get even more red and inflamed.</li>
            <li> First the inflammation disappeared.</li>
            <li> I make sure to use this and spread the word as much as possible because I want others to know there is HOPE.</li>
            <li> It is pretty concentrated in this area</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products from the store and prescribed topical creams from the dermatologist and they never worked....</li>
            <li> I. I use it in conjunction with metaderm baby spray, my daughters eczema has improved almost 100% with the exception of flare ups in the creases of her elbows and knees during hot summer days.</li>
            <li> x 2.5&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li> She actually asks to apply it all the time and literally begs for more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different lotions for my itchy skin.</li>
            <li> For anyone interested in saving some $ on the 32oz pump go to metaderms website</li>
            <li> It is also very affordable, which is rare for eczema creams.  </li>
            <li> That is exactly what this lotion does \\&quot;HEAL\\&quot; your skin.</li>
            <li> Metaderm did exactly was it was advertised to do.</li>
            <li> THANKS!</li>
            <li> Now she only uses the cream once or twice a week before bed as a maintenance procedure :)  </li>
            <li> This is the first product that has helped her.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> So far this cream is FANTASTIC STUFF, being diabetic</li>
            <li> My sister recommended Hydrocortisone 10 Eczema and it worked pretty well from me.</li>
            <li> I read various reviews on this site that generally gave MetaDerm a good review.</li>
            <li> I itch more and the patches seem to have grown larger on my elbows.</li>
            <li> would like to give Hydro-moisturizing a try, but I can&#x27;t afford to spend more money on another product of the same brand.</li>
            <li> i absolutly recommend this after so many years suffering wit eczema trying anything possible noting worked.</li>
            <li> this is the only thing that has worked my eczema has got so much better</li>
            <li> We highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> will most likely post an update after 10 weeks.</li>
            <li> I love this product because you get instant results regarding itchy skin.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this my husband thought it was glue.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it at first</li>
            <li> All Free and Clear</li>
            <li> Elodil or whatever it is for the first time in a year.</li>
            <li> Elodil or whatever it is for the first time in a year.</li>
            <li> Looking at the glowing 5 star reviews, most of them have been reviewed by people and this is the only product reviewed.</li>
            <li> so it did not last more than an hour on my skin</li>
            <li> I actually find it super light warery and drying and it actually made me itch more.</li>
            <li> I am especially grateful for that now that I am pregnant and don&#x27;t want to put anything on my skin that I wouldn&#x27;t be comfortable putting on my baby after it is born.</li>
            <li> this has cleared the adult acne i have had all of my life!!~!!  </li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I was excited to try it on my 5 year old who has eczema.</li>
            <li> I have inflamed eczema due to some kind if allergen.</li>
            <li> This product is luxurious and really makes your skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and have tried many, MANY different creams, and this one beats them all.</li>
            <li> This is working VERY well for my daughter&#x27;s eczema - smoothing out the rough spots and blending nicely.  </li>
            <li> Now iv tried so many products and its weird whenever I find a good one.</li>
            <li> So far this had worked far better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This cream has worked very well and is very gentle.  </li>
            <li> all the good reviews here on amazon and the YOU TUBE video of the woman with the little girl is starting to sound like a scam to me.</li>
            <li> I started to use it and noticed a positive difference.</li>
            <li> I have no clue how or why, and I don&#x27;t really care, but this stuff really really works!</li>
            <li> My eczema really flared up when I had my first child 4 years ago.  </li>
            <li> After using it on my left leg for four days, It really made the eczema effected spot much better, Thanks</li>
            <li> Having eczema for most of my life I have spent so much money and tried so many different things to help.</li>
            <li> Most creams eventually dry sky out over time, leaving my hands &amp; arms all scaly.  </li>
            <li> It did get rid of the dry spots for the most part.</li>
            <li> like many i&#x27;ve tried basically everything in Walgreens for dry skin/eczema.</li>
            <li> She has gone to several Doctors, who had prescribed some strong steroids.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients are absolutely pure and it does not have any ghastly scent.</li>
            <li> Personally, 12 weeks is not long to wait for something that really is effective and does not thin my skin.  </li>
            <li> welcome to the world of middle-age female hormones--which means that I use a lot of chemicals, sometimes harsh, to keep it in check.  </li>
            <li> All of these products are very soothing</li>
            <li> I love that this cream works and has organic ingredients with minimal chemicals.</li>
            <li> product works for me, is cheaper than Rx creams, has no scent, and is incredibly reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> My blood glucose levels are much improved.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very thankful and grateful for the improvement in my excema symptoms that this product has provided for me.  </li>
            <li> I threw away the whole thing and will never use it again.</li>
            <li> I have severe sun damage to my chest area and neck resulting in too much sun in my 20&#x27;s and 30&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with eczema my whole life.</li>
            <li> Thanks MetaDerm.</li>
            <li> It really flares up when I&#x27;m stressed.  </li>
            <li> and my rash was very itchy.  </li>
            <li> I am going through this bottle much faster than I do Aveeno, and I don&#x27;t feel that my skin is improving.</li>
            <li> It really has worked so well for myself and&lt;br /&gt;little girl.</li>
            <li> This cream really really really works, have been suffering with hand eczema (on my fingers) for almost two years now, seen my doctor , allergy specialist, nutritionist, skin tests</li>
            <li> at night really calms it.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs really well, too and seems to be scent-free.</li>
            <li> but I wanted people to know that this cream really helped me.</li>
            <li> but it has helped alot and has really helped his itching as well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a cure for me but very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream for anyone suffering from excema!</li>
            <li> I was really in to coconut oil and the lauric acid in</li>
            <li> it caused the fungus to exit my body through my skin as I did not gradually increase my intake of the coconut oil I use too much too fast.</li>
            <li> So Thak U sooo much to the person who came up with this.</li>
            <li> Very thankful.</li>
            <li> Applying the steroids and covering it with band&#x60;aids, which didn&#x27;t really help much.  </li>
            <li> I tried all kinds of creams and ointments, and nothing really worked that well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> the company and Liz was really helpful.</li>
            <li> I did buy the \\&quot;Fast absorbing\\&quot; and not the \\&quot;Hyper-Moisturizing.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The flareups are clearing, and her skin feels much softer than before.  </li>
            <li> THANKS Metaderm.</li>
            <li> My child has been having atopic eczema for 8 years now (primary areas are elbows, back of knees,  hands, wrists and feet).</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t really work as what the product says its suppose to do.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really help my eczema...</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t see much improvement.</li>
            <li> I was ready to go to another dermatologist and try another steroid, since the eczema was migrating from my legs and arms to my hands and chest.  </li>
            <li> But the rest of my body and my hands are so much</li>
            <li> It really changed my life.</li>
            <li> It really changed my life.</li>
            <li> But I really like it and have noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to find something non-steroidal that would work for me.</li>
            <li> You guys really have something here</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> really helped the eczema close to eye area .</li>
            <li> This lotion really has helped with my eczema.  </li>
            <li> I bought this 3 months ago and it hasn&#x27;t really helped me</li>
            <li> okay only 4 days to 12 weeks clear</li>
            <li> my 11 years old daughter was recovering of a severe eczema rash on her hands, we tought that this cream would help her to recover faster based on the good reviews this cream has here on amazon, we tried it at night before bed time next mornig she woke up with her hands red and with lots of waterballs all over her hands.</li>
            <li> After a few days of not using any kind of product the redness started to recede.</li>
            <li> so I bought this $14 lotion thinking that it wouldn&#x27;t do much but at least it was organic and probably good for moisturizing.</li>
            <li> when you put on this cream, it feels nice for a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> I had really high hopes after reading all the positive reviews, but it turned out to be just another cream to add to the list of products that claimed to be miracle workers and do not do anything.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m supposed to have soft hands, right?).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see the future results this product gives me!</li>
            <li> I am satisfied and will try other products as well.</li>
            <li> My eczema gets really dry and itchy and I need a strong moisturizer that will keep me from scratching.</li>
            <li> I will continue with the cream, the tube is large enough to last me many years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Metaderm cream for less than a week and honestly can&#x27;t believe that my eczema is almost completely cleared up.</li>
            <li> I had severe eczema as a baby and mild eczema as a young child; I am now 63, and hadn&#x27;t had eczema in my adult</li>
            <li> My son has used this for a few weeks in along with the amazing dead sea salt spreadable and his eczema is much much better.</li>
            <li> It did clear some of my eczema after the first application.</li>
            <li> Your skin feels smooth all day long.</li>
            <li> So far overall I&#x27;m thrilled my eczema is starting to go away!</li>
            <li> Lauri white to understand the true depths of our trials.</li>
            <li> I am not yet completely healed, but after just 8 short days, I have every belief that they will completely clear in a couple more weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait for that new bottle!  </li>
            <li> This lotion has did an unbelievable job on my skin and is nothing short of amazing!</li>
            <li> Now she complains much less of itchiness and her mom says she is sleeping better at night.  </li>
            <li> i am a loyal customer, just ordered my second tube!!!!</li>
            <li> Things would be ok for awhile and then boom, itchy red rash back and reeking havoc.</li>
            <li> I am glad to say that 3 weeks to the day he started using it, he came home from work and showed me that he actually has hair growing on the back of his hands.</li>
            <li> not only with the results but how quickly the product worked.  </li>
            <li> I am only giving it two stars because of quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought this after just checking out the decent review on here</li>
            <li> Also, only a small amount of this product is required and it is a large indeed, making this an exceedingly good value.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with my results and can&#x27;t wait to see what the next few weeks bring!!</li>
            <li> using but really liking results so far!</li>
            <li> Jury&#x27;s still out, but the first round are going strong.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li> Eventually it moved from my forearms to my hands in high school, moving into the severe category.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this cream for my 16 yr old niece who had suffered from eczema on her hands for YEARS, and was VERY self conscience about it.  </li>
            <li> This really helped clear my skin.</li>
            <li> Obviously, I think it&#x27;s worth it, because I&#x27;m going to continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> Immediately the itching stopped and my skin&#x27;s temperature returned to normal.  </li>
            <li> I can see normal skin colour again.</li>
            <li> My wife can breathe, my daughter can have a normal life and</li>
            <li> In a few more months I bet it will be gone.</li>
            <li> The only I can say is, it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li> Results seem effective but slow at times...</li>
            <li> There is no topical treatment that can make her skin clear up 100%, but this is the first lotion (that&#x27;s not a topical steroid) that has made a significant difference.  </li>
            <li> It took several weeks to fully clear, but I could tell that it was working rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Even though I don&#x27;t have eczema, I&#x27;ve had facial redness for years and have been looking for something mild for my sensitive skin to help.</li>
            <li> It might be the right combination, FINALLY!</li>
            <li> I bought the large bottle of hyper-moisturizing but will buy this regular one again when I go through the large bottle.</li>
            <li> I can use this lotion for just a few days and most itchy spots clear up!</li>
            <li> This is a very slight sting to the skin when applying this product however the skin already looks and feel better.</li>
            <li> In a few more days the redness was completely gone and the cracked areas of her hands were healing up!  </li>
            <li> I have tried many many things to get rid of my eczema or at least control it with no avail.. lotions, creams, natural home remedies, and have spent hundreds of dollars to see doctors and specialists.</li>
            <li> and we had run the gammit for trying new products when I came across MetaDerm Organic cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Aveeno Eczema Therapy for quite awhile but thought I&#x27;d try something new as I felt</li>
            <li> All this suffering and this cream has given me a new lease on life.  </li>
            <li> It has not helped with the itching, I have pretty extreme eczema,  very large irritated patches so that could have something to do with it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this only one time, we noticed a huge difference the next</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to smells that linger all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this MetaDerm stuff twice a day (after my morning shower, and right before bed), and it has a clear, obvious effect</li>
            <li> I find that very little works better than a lot.</li>
            <li> I was on my way to scratching my skin completely off!  </li>
            <li> the first week the itching was totally gone and the rash was fading more&lt;</li>
            <li> my son has who&#x27;s 11 has been suffering with eczema since he was 3 yrs old!</li>
            <li> I put it on first thing in the morning and don&#x27;t feel the need to keep putting hand cream on the rest of the day as I did with regular hand creams.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time my daughters eczema has totally went away</li>
            <li> The 3rd ingredient is emulsifying wax which caused me to pause when I first read it.</li>
            <li> Wow did it help!</li>
            <li> I shop on Amazon all the time and usually never leave a review</li>
            <li> Recently she even commented on how pretty her feet look.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> It has completely cleared up!</li>
            <li> My husband has a heat rash on his back year round, this eczema cream really seemed to make it better.</li>
            <li> This is the first product that actually absorbs into my skin!</li>
            <li> I did notice that if I use to much (as I was very excited about it), my skin will get a little red.</li>
            <li> This stuff calmed it down overnight, the redness was gone in 72 hours and after a week her skin is smooth and soft without an itchy patch in sight!</li>
            <li> I typically read reviews of anything I order on Amazon, but I was given Metaderm as a free sample at a mom&#x27;s event and had never researched it before trying.  </li>
            <li> At this rate my skin should be back to normal within a week after scratching so much I had sores.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, this product is not for me, but the company will give you a full refund if you aren&#x27;t satisfied.    </li>
            <li> worth every single penny</li>
            <li> I am forever grateful to Metaderm for freeing me from the endless cycle of prescription eczema creams that are full of things that probably shouldn&#x27;t be put on my body any ways.</li>
            <li> and the swelling has gone down significantly.</li>
            <li> Coming back a couple hours later to reapply it is better if you feel dry.  </li>
            <li> Wow, after trying to treat my 6 year old daughters eczema her whole life with little success</li>
            <li> Best part about it is, unlike the topical steroids we get both from her doctor and OTC, I can put it on her every day without fear of the bad side effects that come from the steroidal creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried anything &amp; everything to help clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> I would say their skin is now 90% clear.</li>
            <li> We have been using the product for 8 days and the rough, raised patches are smooth and her skin is almost back to</li>
            <li> attribute my clear zkin to Metaderm.</li>
            <li> If by christmas I&#x27;m still clear I will write another review.  </li>
            <li> This is a relief for a 7yr old who was bothered by the break</li>
            <li> My son has had eczema since he was two months old.  </li>
            <li> Been using on my 2 1/2 year old since he was about 1 1/2.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin moisturized and soft.  </li>
            <li> So, after vaseline and lotion wasn&#x27;t quite doing much, the prescribed ointment was getting low</li>
            <li> Thanks to Meta Derm lotion, which I have to use daily,</li>
            <li> I am in healthcare and started to use only organic types of hand soaps about 2 years ago (to avoid chemicals and toxins) and noticed that many of them severely dried my hands, exacerbated by frequent handwashing and glove changing throughout the day.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t work out for our 8 months old.</li>
            <li> I saw metaderm on Amazon as I am a frequent shopper on here.</li>
            <li> It took about a month for the redness to completely disappear, and from then on, it has completely stayed away and I can even go out WITHOUT makeup on!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I needed a product that could reduce my eczema to the point of either completely restored skin or where it seems that I don&#x27;t even have eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had nearly immediate relief during the two weeks off the steroids.  </li>
            <li> I am 22 and have had Eczema since I was 2 years old.</li>
            <li> and it leaves my skin soft, moisturized, and not an itch...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for adult now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only one that really worked to soothe.</li>
            <li> Its affordable, natural and no side effects.</li>
            <li> it leaves the skin so soft .</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream for my 10 week old baby, who had developed eczema on his face.</li>
            <li> I test everything on myself before passing it along to my son&#x27;s sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Even the lotion that&#x27;s supposed to be for sensitive skin makes her cry out in pain when I apply.  </li>
            <li> THREE days was all it took using this lotion for my eczema to be completely cleared.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with eczema on my face(forehead,under eyes,&amp; near chin) for months now-as soon as I thought it was clearing up</li>
            <li> The cream leaves your skin feeling soft and doesn&#x27;t sting or irritate when you put it on.</li>
            <li> the all natural stuff would be so greasy that it would stain her clothes and get in her hair.</li>
            <li> and it keeps my skin soft all day.  </li>
            <li> Well, that was as far as that went.</li>
            <li> Seems to be doing it;s job so far.</li>
            <li> I used this stuff and after 2-3 months the Eczema on my face was faded and nearly gone.  </li>
            <li> I get these sore&#x27;s on my lower legs, all the creams the doctors give me have done nother to heal the sore&#x27;s, so far after day 3 of using this stuff</li>
            <li> I have adult acne--</li>
            <li> My daughter suffered from this disorder since she was 6 months old.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 20 year old daughter who has suffered from eczema since she was a toddler.  </li>
            <li> I am now 29yrs old and have suffered from it forever.</li>
            <li> So far using it about a week.  </li>
            <li> Two years ago, I developed eczema after a hiking trip in the desert.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s a surgeon and has to wash his hands frequently, so I&#x27;m hoping that this helps him, too.</li>
            <li> My eczema is completely gone from my arms, face, and stomach.</li>
            <li> My eczema is completely gone from my arms, face, and stomach.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference for about 20 days but after that I was surprised to see my skin start to clear up</li>
            <li> the layer of crust that covered my entire back has chaffed away, and new smooth skin has emerged with only left over fading spots.</li>
            <li> elbows are clear, hands are clear, back of my legs are clear, my butt is clear, wrists are all clear of itchy scaly flakes!  </li>
            <li> I met an older woman a while back</li>
            <li> I go back to the quick clinic tell them I have been on steroids more or less for the past 2 months.</li>
            <li> My skin was paper thin from the steroids and cut very easily.  </li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m in shock because the eczema havent returned, my hands are unbelievable back to normal smooth and soft again, BUT ITS A 12 WEEK FORMULA SO DONT USE FOR 1 WEEK  OR 2 AND EXPECT TO SEE RESULTS.</li>
            <li> My skin is back to normal.  </li>
            <li> In just 2 days the rash is smaller and the skin is returning to normal.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m back to my normal self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and then it became completely normal in only the area that I was putting the cream.</li>
            <li> Normally my skin gets very red and irritated with any moisturizer, and it doesn&#x27;t with this.</li>
            <li> Seems to calm my Eczema down and heal it &amp;#</li>
            <li> We have one child who has particularly severe eczema (she&#x27;s been hospitalized before) and generally hates having anything applied topically -- it seems like everything ends up triggering itching and burning.  </li>
            <li> We went over his diet and routine and the Metaderm was the only new addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am definitely one who is more sensitive to trying new products but never experienced any breakouts that occurred in the lower rated reviews.</li>
            <li> Within 3 days I noticed it starting to clear and within 6 days it was completely gone.</li>
            <li> I very occasionally use steroid cream to bring my skin back when the eczema starts to get really itchy</li>
            <li> there has been a major noticeable difference and</li>
            <li> My skin on my hands is still not perfect but it is better than it&#x27;s been in years!  </li>
            <li> It took her red, raw, raised patches of eczema and soothed and healed them so quickly!</li>
            <li> Slight smell, not bad, but definitely has a scent to it</li>
            <li> It is a very thick cream, almost too thick, so it is not as easy to spread, and you end up using more product than you need.</li>
            <li> I have tried various other prescription creams but without much success.</li>
            <li> The only thing that has ever worked for me is a strong dose of hydrocortisone cream and it still only lasts a few days.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of the reviews and they are overwhelmingly positive, this is one of the very few products for eczema that have clinical trial research to back it up and in addition a large percentage of the ingredients are organic and proven to aid in the healing of skin issues/conditions naturally.</li>
            <li> The lotion itself is very thick, more like a salve.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a large tube and will last a long time, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again...</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I was sorry to say that I found that it didn&#x27;t work for that purpose, I did find an AMAZING moisturizing cream in this MetaDerm Eczema cream.</li>
            <li> Instead the cream has a pleasantly smooth and delicate feel to it, and the eczema may just be subsiding...</li>
            <li> This is my second week and my face is 90% clear.</li>
            <li> Not only does it clear up my eczema</li>
            <li> My knuckles developed outbreaks of an itchy rash that would resolve only temporarily with over-the-counter hydrocortisone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen improvement in only 2 weeks of use, and I hope to see my eczema completely vanish by the end of 12 weeks.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old daughter&#x27;s eczema is severe enough that at any given time, she has cracked, bleeding skin.  </li>
            <li> I found my old tube of this product that I bought last year and decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> MetaDerm is far purer, but not as moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t create the same barrier on his skin, but it&#x27;s a trade-off.  </li>
            <li> I can only use baby eczema creams because adult creams burn and irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Now that I am 25 years old, I just recently started to notice patches on my neck and elbows.</li>
            <li> We only used it once, but my 5 year old burst out in tears because it was burning her legs.</li>
            <li> , I think many people get confused by that.  </li>
            <li> Finally a product that actually is helping my 10 month old&#x27;s eczema!  </li>
            <li> I am not going to jump to conclusions yet because like other products we have used they work well at first but over time the eczema comes back.</li>
            <li> So far I like the product, however, I have not used it long enough as yet, to give a clear review on the jproduct.</li>
            <li> about 6 weeks ago I developed red, dry patches of skin between my eye brows and on the sensitive skin area under my eyes to the bridge of my nose.</li>
            <li> After about a month, I couldn&#x27;t stand the products anymore and went back to my old moisturizer and non-soap cleanser which returned my skin back to square one.</li>
            <li> Lately the rash started to spread to new areas of her body, including her face, for the first time.</li>
            <li> I like the long term effects &amp; the fact that it&#x27;s so natural.  </li>
            <li> I have found that when I&#x27;m cleaning or washing dishes, I have to wear latex gloves, because all detergents, even those without harsh chemical, and the hot water aggravate the eczema on my hands.  </li>
            <li> you have eczema, this product is WELL worth the small price.  </li>
            <li> Earlier this year some of her classmates teased her and said that her hands looked dirty; she had become very self-conscious and quiet but her skin looks so much better now and her confidence has soared.  </li>
            <li> After using it a month I have noticed my skin is MUCH softer and has a less damaged appearance.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both suffer from dry, sensitive, eczema ridden skin.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone with dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This product is a must have for dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can sting sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I would still definitely recommend anyone with dry skin, sensitive skin, or eczema</li>
            <li> but it sometimes flakes a little on my skin if I rub it in too much.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for extreme dry skin.</li>
            <li> If you have a VERY stubborn case, this product is likely not strong enough to work for you.</li>
            <li> His face is still slightly red and dry, but the weeping has completely disappeared and it looks far less irritated.</li>
            <li> at first he told me that they were still dry, stiff and sore and he thought he was breaking back out</li>
            <li> It is very hydrating and long lasting for both my little one and</li>
            <li> In one case a young girl who had been scheduled for skin grafts was taken off that list due to her favorable response to treatment.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other natural eczema creams and though they have worked on my kids, they never did a thing for me.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several products for eczema but this is the only one that gives me long lasting relief.  </li>
            <li> I also use this on my kids for any random rash that I see and it clears pretty much everything up in a day or two for them.  </li>
            <li> Like many of you, I was pretty doubtful that something like this would work, but it did wonders for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gone the full 12 weeks yet, but so far I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> Tt&#x27;s still red and dry, so this cream definitely keeps it moisturized .</li>
            <li> , i noticed a difference the next day my face wasn&#x27;t so red, and the dry skin was healing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After going to three different dermatologists, and trying several steroid creams, my eczema was getting worse, especially on my hands, which are exposed to detergents and hot water.  </li>
            <li> I even ordered some for myself for my face during the winter when it gets dry and flaky from being outside!</li>
            <li> When I purchased the cream I had dry red patches of skin and discoloration on my cheeks and around my mouth.</li>
            <li> It is truly a cream and not greasy, a pleasure to use not only for those with eczema  but with rough and red skin as well.</li>
            <li> (I have very sensitive skin) and it will ease any itchiness or discomfort in just a few days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and my skin has gone down to just barely pinkish red skin.</li>
            <li> a side note, there is no strong smells, dangerous chemicals or greasy feel which we have experienced with other treatments).</li>
            <li> My family and I love this especially in the cold dry winter weather.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed (especially in this last week) that the scar is MUCH less red and noticeable.</li>
            <li> but since i needed it for my entire body it didn&#x27;t even last a week also my eczema is extremely severe</li>
            <li> my skin is so much hidrated less inflamated and less itch</li>
            <li> Bought this for a young kid with classic patches of eczema behind the elbows and knees.</li>
            <li> He started to feel insecure as he was developing scars and huge eczema patches on his arms</li>
            <li> I tried EVERYTHING, a list too long to mention</li>
            <li> I have been a long time eczema sufferer.</li>
            <li> so he wore long sleeves even in the summertime.</li>
            <li> And then I started not needing the steroids as often or as long.  </li>
            <li> Wow, What a waste.</li>
            <li> it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long, but all my eczema rashes are already healing.</li>
            <li> but I have lots of natural oils (almond, vitamin E, sesame seed, olive oil to name a few) that I can use for that.</li>
            <li> Nothing has worked long term for me like this product.</li>
            <li> and she doesn&#x27;t have to worry about the long term effects of steroid creams.  </li>
            <li> It takes a long time to work.</li>
            <li> I will be a life long customer.  </li>
            <li> I like the consistancy, not a greasy or thick cream, and unlike all the others IT WORKS fast</li>
            <li> sigh I came back to the reviews looking below 3 stars and sure enough a parent wrote a review that it burned their child&#x27;s legs... :-(</li>
            <li> Last November, I had a skin cancer removed from my chest area and it left a small red scar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of products from other brands such as Aveeno, Cetaphil, Goldbond, Vaseline, etc.</li>
            <li> , doctors prescribed all kind of medications for me ,but the eczema would go away for a few days and come right back even worst.</li>
            <li> This fixed my eyelids along with every other trace of eczema I have on my body in less than 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> I can say that after twelve weeks of use, several of my worst spots have truly disappeared and all in all I am experiencing great relief on my hands.  </li>
            <li> It just seems to &amp;#34;go away&amp;#34; and my hands begin to dry then</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a week and the itchy, flaking dry skin is almost gone.</li>
            <li> but it made my skin terribly dry.</li>
            <li> I would def recommend this to anyone struggling with eczema or even just dry skin.</li>
            <li> Did not help it but was soothing on the dry skin when it is healing.</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY dry skin.</li>
            <li> To get around this, apply immediately after a bath, and never on dry skin.</li>
            <li> Now I only use the steroid cream when I have a flare up, and then only for a few days.  </li>
            <li> I contacted their company to inquire about the proper use (yes, you can use it several times a day and on the weeping areas), and they returned my email within a few hours and event sent me sample spray and baby wash/shampoo.</li>
            <li> Over a few months period, doctors tried combinations of medications including antibiotics and steroids, several different kinds of antibiotics.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve only had to use steroids a few time since starting this cream.  </li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend them for dermatitis secondary to dryness.</li>
            <li> It worked beautifully to clear up her dry patches, and there was none of the stinging that usually comes with treatment.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from a variety of odd small rashes or hot spots, probably due to stress...</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: This product was not able t completely clear up my eczema.</li>
            <li> So far none of the usual complaints about stinging or stickiness.</li>
            <li> This seems sketchy to me and I checked several other products that I was looking into and most people who tend to review items have several others that they also reviewed. :(</li>
            <li> I have eczema on the lower part on both of me legs (from the knee down) and on my left arm.</li>
            <li> I am one of the very few that contract eczema as an adult.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to wear open shirts and sleeveless shirts and was never able to because my skin was red, irritated, and inflamed.</li>
            <li> and I applied this after my shower daily and in less then a week it was gone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have eczema, but I do get very dry skin</li>
            <li> I found this cream and decided to try it, in a few days it was controlling the itch and also softening my extra dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have had moderate eczema since I was a little girl.  </li>
            <li> That often leads to dry, flakey skin and redness due to irritation.  </li>
            <li> I have now ordered my second batch, it is a little expensive, but I feel it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> After reading through a few items on the internet, I thought it may be due to dry skin and after further reading reviews of the product decided to order it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not 100% clear but at least 60% clearer.</li>
            <li> and i wasn&#x27;t sure how it could heal since it&#x27;s cracked, blistery and painful.</li>
            <li> I was shocked when I saw  the difference side by side and decided to get more of this cream for my hands and feet.</li>
            <li> I developed hand and foot eczema 3 years ago in my late 50&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t make my Ezcema worse, but it doesn&#x27;t really do anything either except leave a filmy feel to my hands.</li>
            <li> I saw vast improvement with eczema within a few days of usage.</li>
            <li> Within a few days after initial usage, the itchiness was gone and the raised patches of skin and flakiness subsided.</li>
            <li> So, I spent the money, and gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> MetaDerm has just about cured the wet eczema on my hands.</li>
            <li> the money I spent on all three of them,</li>
            <li> the Earth Mamma Angel Baby castile soap was too drying for us, especially in this harsh winter.  </li>
            <li> With this lotion, the sting is minimal, if at all.  </li>
            <li> This stuff worked wonders this winter when he was having an extremely rough time with his chapped and cracked skin.  </li>
            <li> and I have spent hundreds of dollars in dermatology visits and have tried at least 5 different prescription strength topical steroids.</li>
            <li> This product has almost cleared my skin in only a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Did not really see any results.</li>
            <li> I never really knew what caused the rash but always figured it was some sort of dermatitis or eczema.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe Im giving up on the product 5 days after use, but its really made my skin worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried wet wraps, bleach baths, vinegar soaks and just about every steroid cream they make.  </li>
            <li> The wet wraps allowed me to walk in the morning but by the time I got home from work</li>
            <li> Basically I spent like 150 bucks on</li>
            <li> , I really do not care.</li>
            <li> , I really do not care.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Longer story less long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Longer story less long.</li>
            <li> but  as you rub it in to your skin, it all peels off, making a big mess!</li>
            <li> Raw red bumps around my nose mouth and chin and eyes.</li>
            <li> The only problem I run into is that I am a CNA and constantly wash my hands throughout work and my eczema always seems to get worse when they dry.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is nothing I have ever felt its almost tacky like and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> So, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would find anything that was not full of chemicals to combat my dry, pealing, irritated skin</li>
            <li> I admit, you have to try to apply it consistently at least twice a day to see a quick and noticeable change which I am not great at.</li>
            <li> After 3 years and two allergist s we found out he has a corn allergy amount other food and environmental allergies.  </li>
            <li> first time she put her hands over her mouth and sad &amp;#34;Burn&amp;#34; and walked away from me.</li>
            <li> This lotion worked a little for my eczema...takes too long though!</li>
            <li> but now I only get small flare ups every so often</li>
            <li> it causes cancer and has other harmful side effects.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s eczema has been pretty difficult to treat.</li>
            <li> My husband has been dealing with eczema on his hands for almost 4 years due to an allergy to some cleaners that he used at work.</li>
            <li> I tried lots of other products but they did not work.</li>
            <li> This product has been helping/working whereas my child has been allergic to other products.</li>
            <li> I am not entirely convinced about the &amp;#34;12 week&amp;#34; improvement promise, since my flare-ups usually improve anyways over that time period, but I will say I like this product for these reasons:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I went thru one tube and ordered another before the other one was gone.</li>
            <li> Small bumps on my upper arms disappeared within days of using this.  </li>
            <li> Anyone suffering from eczema or some other skin condition should give this product a try.</li>
            <li> I tried other over the counter remedies.</li>
            <li> It has no smell and doesn&#x27;t burn like other products out there.</li>
            <li> its is nothing other than a miracle.</li>
            <li> all other kinds of stuff.</li>
            <li> No more steroids finally.  </li>
            <li> I hope that eczema sufferers will give MetaDerm a chance, it is time and money well spent!</li>
            <li> Prescription creams from the dermatologist stung, usually contained steroids, and only worked temporarily, only to have my eczema come back, sometimes worse than before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will not go back to any of those pricy crap that&#x27;s loaded with chemicals that does absolutely nothing good :(  </li>
            <li> However, as the day goes on, even after reapplying the product, my skin would feel very dry, tight and irritated.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t want to do steroids but was almost desperate enough to cave and get some.</li>
            <li> first application (horribly) burned my face, and the second application didn&#x27;t burn as much.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend anyone who suffers from skin problems and doesn&#x27;t want to seek medical treatment to try it.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that it&#x27;s too pricey.</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend people at least give this a try.</li>
            <li> While I love the lotion itself, it has not helped to relieve itching and rash associated with this annoying skin condition.</li>
            <li> So this cream has helped bring down the inflammation without having to go and get steroids.</li>
            <li> I broke down and went to the doctor and got a prescription.</li>
            <li> Now I just use it for preventative maintenance about every other day!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thin and goes on very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some rough patches on my forehead (redness, a little scaling, and a lot of dry skin around the eyebrows) for the past few months.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because the seasons are changing and my 5 year old little girl eczema gets worse during this time.</li>
            <li> I have tried other creams over the counter and the cream my doctor prescribed, dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> I am always skeptical when I try something new, but you get so desperate that you&#x27;re willing to try anything for relief!  </li>
            <li> a couple days I noticed the itching and redness was less and by the end</li>
            <li> My one tip: use less than you think you need.</li>
            <li> But this lotion made it go away in less than two weeks.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s typically all I needed.  </li>
            <li> Less than $20</li>
            <li> It is not a steroid, so it is not quick</li>
            <li> No more raised red skin, no more cracking or oozing.</li>
            <li> Within days it really helps to control my flare ups and makes me feel less insecure because of how raw my skin would look.</li>
            <li> At first, I was a skeptic, but I was also desperate.</li>
            <li> So, I will use it for at least that long.  </li>
            <li> Next thing I knew my eczema had grown worse and spread to my face and other parts of my body.</li>
            <li> Same your money at the Dr. if you have hard to treat Eczema and go with this!</li>
            <li> my ears are a little itchy but no scabs or spots.  </li>
            <li> So when anything works even a little</li>
            <li> I noticed it stung a little</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t help my little boy who has severe ezcema.</li>
            <li> He tried every product out there with little or no relief.</li>
            <li> I did get a few little spots on my lefthand but it is about 1/100thof</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I get very dry skin on my legs and hands in the bitter cold and regular body lotion wasn&#x27;t doing the trick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We started using this after a round of prednisone that had cleared up his skin.  </li>
            <li> ; I assumed it was because a few years ago I had a patch on my chin and the Dermatologist told me it was eczema.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday for eczema</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks, I started seeing results.</li>
            <li> It took a few months</li>
            <li> This product is waste of money.</li>
            <li> Please do not your waste on this item like I did.</li>
            <li> I have had eczema for numerous years and ever since I had my son four years ago it has been increasingly worse.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money for us.</li>
            <li> Aveeno just kept my skin constant, it never improved, but never got worse.</li>
            <li> As I said, it does work, but it somewhat dried his skin.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried it, wasted hundreds of dollars and nothing came close to working even 2%.</li>
            <li> but it only got worse.</li>
            <li> It took about a month, but started to help within a few days.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s not as harsh, I believe.)</li>
            <li> Everyday I get up and check my hands and feet by</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that didn&#x27;t have a bunch of harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have used steroid creams for a number of years but with those I kept getting my eczema back during treatment and my skin got thin and damaged.</li>
            <li> Started out well,  but by the second week I broke out in a worse rash.</li>
            <li> Feels thick but not greasy or oily and quickly sinks into skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> It seems redundant and prob company workers</li>
            <li> I found that it actually made her eczema worse, so I discontinued use after a few days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a bit thick and sticky, but it actually hasn&#x27;t clogged my pores and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with breakouts (yet, at least).</li>
            <li> I found that this was a long used product in some countries but its recipe was kept as a hidden secret until now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little small for the price.</li>
            <li> My daughter was born with eczema and we have spent soooo much money we have tried organic cold pressed shea butter, organic cold pressed avocado oil, organic CP cupusu, red raspberry seed oil, gold bond lotion</li>
            <li> Obviously you can&#x27;t use topical steroids indefinitely as they are harsh and thin the skin out and can actually cause horrible sores (google it, gross!).</li>
            <li> I was scratching an area of skin on my leg raw.  </li>
            <li> My finger tips were raw, laden with dysphrotic eczema and peeI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This started to heal my hands in a few weeks of using it at least a few times a day.  </li>
            <li> This cream did not help my little girl&#x27;s eczema patches at all!</li>
            <li> He loves the texture of the lotion as it isnt as thick as some other creams which usually contain petroleum!</li>
            <li> I would take her shirts off and there would be small spots of blood.</li>
            <li> No better product out there for this affordable price and ease of availability.</li>
            <li> I had a small spot pop up on my arm</li>
            <li> I am not sure</li>
            <li> and unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t open my foaming soap container to fill it.  </li>
            <li> Even with the price break on the larger 32 oz size, it&#x27;s still ridiculously expensive.  </li>
            <li> My 5 year old suffers from sever eczema</li>
            <li> Even shaving which usually exacerbates my rash has not caused any problems.</li>
            <li> Our 2 year old started getting these crazy bumps on her arm</li>
            <li> I was so devastated because she was never able to fix the issue.</li>
            <li> Have been using it but not sure of results yet.</li>
            <li> I was also told I was part of a small percentage that this happened too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t touch anything without white cotton gloves and holding a steering wheel was difficult.  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t review products, but in this case, I felt the need to share my experience for the benefit of others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , You must have been lazy and didn&#x27;t wash your jeans or something&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but this product deserves one.</li>
            <li> :/ if i put it on when my eczema is flared up, i get a burning sensation and have to wash my hands off.</li>
            <li> I have had a horrible rash/eczema on my lower legs for almost 3 years now (developed as an adult, mystery as to why)</li>
            <li> But as far as getting Calmoseptine off your skin and clothes its impossible.</li>
            <li> Before i bought this i had dry patches on my cheek and chin, and putting cover up over it just looked even worse!</li>
            <li> So far so my son has extremely bad excema during the winter it gets so bad his sholders and back if his knees and other area will start cracking the hell scratch at them and they will bleed.</li>
            <li> This along with soaking my hands in raw apple cider vinegar allowed my symptoms to go away without ever having to take antibiotics or steroids!</li>
            <li> , eczema is so hard to treat and deal with</li>
            <li> why but it is really hard to deal with.</li>
            <li> like Die Hard, it came back....with a Vengeance.</li>
            <li> The swelling and redness is gone from the backs of my hands, and has reduced to hardly anything on my finger tips.  </li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve tried coconut oil for my discoid eczema.</li>
            <li> I did have to apply it at least 6-8 times a day in the beginning</li>
            <li> Try it, be patient, you should give it at least a 2 month trial.</li>
            <li> Just last year I developed horrible case of eczema on my hands.</li>
            <li> reading some of the negative reviews, I think those people must have an allergy to one of the ingredients because this stuff does not sting at all when I put it on.</li>
            <li> and I thought it was the same type of condition my sister has where her skin feels like chicken skin.</li>
            <li> I would at least try this</li>
            <li> I was looking for a hydrating moisturizing cream (vs lotion, which is not as intensive) for my todder, who suffers from moderate eczema.  </li>
            <li> I am late with my update.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Eczema sucks</li>
            <li> I use this quite often throughout the day, probably at least 5 times a day.  </li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve also had issues with flaky skin, so I thought I might as well try this.</li>
            <li> Others like Aveeno for eczema were way too thick and filmy for me on the body.</li>
            <li> My kids has a very bad skin problem prior to buy this Eczema Moisturizing cream, but now it has 5%-10% left of their Eczema.</li>
            <li> and he had no more pain and within a couple days there was no trace of any irritation at all!</li>
            <li> Everyone I know who uses this for rashes and eczema sees dramatic differences in a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Apparently this is bad.</li>
            <li> Seriously for the price just give it a try.</li>
            <li> It usually gets worst after the initial allergy attack, until I end up having to get steroids to get healed, but these cause other issues with the immune system.  </li>
            <li> It softened areas that had become thick and tough.</li>
            <li> This product is not good strictly for eczema.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been three years of trying to soothe her poor delicate skin.</li>

            <li> I have seborrheic dermatitis on my face and dry skin, the flaking is impossible to control.  </li>
            <li> The only hand lotion I can use without itching due to my horrible eczema!</li>
            <li> ; But it may just do well with my skin, I don&#x27;t want anyone to be disappointed if they don&#x27;t see the same results</li>
            <li> Thick and not greasy!</li>
            <li> The dermatologist said that continued use of the hydrocortisone would thin and age my skin.</li>
            <li> It made it worse.</li>
            <li> my redness got worse.</li>
            <li> and the redness got worse.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t really help my terrible eczema</li>
            <li> Irritated my eczema worse</li>
            <li> , the skin was so thin on his hands at one point that you could count the veins.</li>
            <li> My skin went crazy and I paid a heavy price for trying this product.</li>
            <li> always seems to make my hands worse.</li>
            <li> Did not clear my rash up at all if anything made it worse !!!</li>
            <li> Now after using this product, it doesn&#x27;t burn or it doesn&#x27;t smell bad like other lotions I have tried!</li>
            <li> It used to itch very badly, and now I barely notice it.</li>
            <li> I have very bad dermatitis ( on the back of my neck, under my armpits, behind my ears and under my breast)</li>

            <li> I have been battling unrelenting&lt;br /&gt;Eczema on the back of both my legs for almost a year...a terrible itchy,&lt;br /&gt;watery</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s frustrating and depressing to deal with it, but this may be the answer to clearing up your skin, it worked for me</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I haven&#x27;t used it since.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Meta Derm will be going in our drawer of lotions that don&#x27;t work on her.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this gave my 13yo son a rash.</li>
            <li> Have had the problem since I was ten, off and on, and it was horrible when I started using the MetaDerm.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately I&#x27;m part of the 15%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only product I have found that works for the terrible eczema I have on my face.</li>
            <li> But this is a relatively expensive cream.</li>
            <li> I have found the cause of my eczema is a food intolerance, but relieving the terrible itch and pain in the healing process was critical and this cream was helpful.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has suffered from winter dry skin horribly for years, often scratching his sides and legs until his skin bled.</li>
            <li> It was bad and the inflammation was getting worse every day.</li>
            <li> My hands were horrible and it was an embarrassment to have to shake someone&#x27;s hand, knowing how rough and scaly my hands were (I&#x27;m a woman</li>
            <li> My neck itched like crazy when I put this stuff on.</li>
            <li> I was desperate to try anything</li>

            <li> Our son suffers from eczema and we have tried plenty of products.</li>
            <li> (Crazy Expensive)&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> It could be dangerous.</li>
            <li> I have eczema on my hands and before using this cream I had to use steroid creams a few times a week to control the crazy itchiness and the terrible rashes on my hands.  </li>
            <li> anybody who has this knows how annoying and frustrating it is.</li>
            <li> For those of you who don&#x27;t know about eczema, it can drive you mad with itching, weeping, crusting, healing, then another cycle begins.</li>
            <li> The worst part (and scary with winter coming) is just how much worse it gets in the cold weather</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from terrible eczema for the past four years and prescription medications help control it, but not well.  </li>
            <li> He randomly breaks out in hives and within minutes of using Metaderm he has relief from the itchiness and within minutes of that again there is no trace of any irritation at all!</li>
            <li> I was completely skeptical about the product......but have now seen it work wonders!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gluten-free &amp; dairy-free so I was shocked and appalled when my eczema flared up worse than it&#x27;s ever been.</li>

            <li> Her itching was bad, and her scratching would cause scabs.</li>

            <li> are really bad.</li>
            <li> frustrated</li>
            <li> Ulgy, itchy, painful blotches.</li>
            <li> That relieved the painful burning itch quite a bit.  </li>

            <li> I purchased this for my husband. He is trying it out now and I hope that it will help his eczema. Very good price.</li>
            <li> Works great on my granddaughters eczema.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do the job</li>
            <li> okay only 4 days to 12 weeks clear and... i have 2 stubborn spots on my scalp that still itch, but no longer flake.  my ears are a little itchy but no scabs or spots.  elbows are clear, hands are clear, back of my legs are clear, my butt is clear, wrists are all clear of itchy scaly flakes!  but the best is yet to come... this has cleared the adult acne i have had all of my life!!~!!  thank you thank you!  i am a loyal customer, just ordered my second tube!!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter has had really bad break outs to the point they bleed. We tried the MetaDerm products (wash, spray &amp; lotion), she has been rash free for over a year now. As soon as we notice a break out she uses the lotion immediatly, she uses the wash daily. The MetaDerm products are cheaper then the store bought products as well. This is a relief for a 7yr old who was bothered by the break outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS METADERM!</li>
            <li> Amazing.......&lt;br /&gt;My Eczema is gone in one week.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon also MetaDerm Organic.</li>
            <li> My son has had eczema since he was two months old.  After 3 years and two allergist s we found out he has a corn allergy amount other food and environmental allergies.  We are always looking for something non prescription to help. After seeing all the wonderful reviews we ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We started using this after a round of prednisone that had cleared up his skin.  After a week if using this my son broke out in a rash over 75% of his body.  We went over his diet and routine and the Metaderm was the only new addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon reading the ingredients I noticed that sorbitol is the 5th ingredient with it made from corn syrup.  I think this is the first lotion I have ever seen sorbitol in.  Anyway, shame on me for not reading the ingredients but I have used a lot of lotions on him and this is the only one he has reacted to.</li>
            <li> unlike most reviews here, only aggravated my sons eczema. would not recommend after using for two weeks.would not recommend at all.</li>
            <li> the stuff in here is amazing. i have finally found something that works after so many prescriptions and trying every lotion on the market. so thankful i came across this and i will continue to buy it. worth every single penny</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Been using on my 2 1/2 year old since he was about 1 1/2. We tried everything including prescription ointments, his eczema was so bad he was raw from head to toe. Gave this a shot and noticed immediate results and have been using ever since and it has continued to work best.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t make my Ezcema worse, but it doesn&#x27;t really do anything either except leave a filmy feel to my hands. I compared this with Aveeno and the Aveeno absorbs, this seems to just stay on the surface of my skin.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for extreme dry skin. Aveeno does a better job than this one.</li>
            <li> Skin probably varies quite a bit as far as sensitivity and what will work best for it. As soon as I applied this to my arms I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable with it. It burned enough to where I decided that was the last time I would try it. Maybe you would have better luck. Lately I&#x27;ve tried coconut oil for my discoid eczema. initially I thought that was good but within a week or so I&#x27;m back to square one. I think diet might play a big role in skin condition. If that doesn&#x27;t work it&#x27;s probably back to the dermatologist.. Any suggestions?</li>
            <li> I love when a product does what it says it will do.  I was scratching an area of skin on my leg raw.  I don&#x27;t know if it was eczema or not; I assumed it was because a few years ago I had a patch on my chin and the Dermatologist told me it was eczema.  She prescribed a steroid cream and told me to use Cerave products.  That took care of that patch.  The area on my leg was something different though.  I tried EVERYTHING, a list too long to mention and nothing worked.  I was on my way to scratching my skin completely off!  It was horrible.  I googled Eczema and there was a link for Metaderm.  I ordered it immediately from Amazon.  I was very, very relieved from my first application.  I did have to apply it at least 6-8 times a day in the beginning, now I only apply it between 1-3 times; morning, afternoon, evening.  It works for me.  My skin is back to normal.  I no longer have that itch that can&#x27;t be relieved.  It keeps my skin moisturized and soft.  I don&#x27;t have the bumps or redness, from scratching any more.  I will continue to buy this product.  Also I have been using the Metaderm Foaming Wash for eczema, and that product is also great!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because the seasons are changing and my 5 year old little girl eczema gets worse during this time. So, after vaseline and lotion wasn&#x27;t quite doing much, the prescribed ointment was getting low, I thought lets try something different. I got her Shea Moisture for Eczema and honestly it worked...BUT, it didn&#x27;t stop the itching, it just helped with the moisture. Her itching was bad, and her scratching would cause scabs. I would take her shirts off and there would be small spots of blood. I bought this and I applied this on her. From the neck down we were good, but her face...first time she put her hands over her mouth and sad &amp;#34;Burn&amp;#34; and walked away from me. I hadn&#x27;t applied it on her face for about a week, and tried it again tonight and she walked away from me with her hands on her face and sad &amp;#34;burn mommy&amp;#34;...sigh I came back to the reviews looking below 3 stars and sure enough a parent wrote a review that it burned their child&#x27;s legs... :-( Back to the drawing board...I couldn&#x27;t give it one star because I don&#x27;t hate, I just don&#x27;t like it, but yes it deserves one star</li>
            <li> my 11 years old daughter was recovering of a severe eczema rash on her hands, we tought that this cream would help her to recover faster based on the good reviews this cream has here on amazon, we tried it at night before bed time next mornig she woke up with her hands red and with lots of waterballs all over her hands. i am a 32 YO male with healthy skin on my hands and i tried this cream on my own hands and they start to itchy after 10 minutes of using it. I DO NOT RECOMEND THIS CREAM all the good reviews here on amazon and the YOU TUBE video of the woman with the little girl is starting to sound like a scam to me.</li>
            <li> I have been battling unrelenting&lt;br /&gt;Eczema on the back of both my legs for almost a year...a terrible itchy,&lt;br /&gt;watery bumps rash.  The more I cleansed it and the more products I tried the&lt;br /&gt;more frustrated I became.  Cortisone products seemed to help it for&lt;br /&gt;a day or so then, boom, here it came roaring back.  I read about MetaDerm&lt;br /&gt;online and decided to give it a try.  I&#x27;m so very glad that I did. Within&lt;br /&gt;just a couple days I noticed the itching and redness was less and by the end&lt;br /&gt;of the first week the itching was totally gone and the rash was fading more&lt;br /&gt;and more.  Now with about 2/3ds of the first tube used I can tell you that&lt;br /&gt;the rash is virtually gone.  I can still feel just a tiny bit of it but it&lt;br /&gt;is not noticeable to the eye.  I re-ordered 2 tubes this time as I simply do&lt;br /&gt;not want to run the risk of not having this fabulous cream for Eczema if&lt;br /&gt;and/or when I get another outbreak.</li>
            <li> My son has used this for a few weeks in along with the amazing dead sea salt spreadable and his eczema is much much better.</li>
            <li> works wonders on my hands</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for my finger tips eczema.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really great. I saw vast improvement with eczema within a few days of usage. It is truly a cream and not greasy, a pleasure to use not only for those with eczema  but with rough and red skin as well. Also, it&#x27;s a great alternative to steroid cream some of which have side effects more concerning than the skin problem one is trying to cure. Also, only a small amount of this product is required and it is a large indeed, making this an exceedingly good value.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I use it everyday for eczema and I am a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> No better product out there for this affordable price and ease of availability. I have been a long time eczema sufferer. I believed there was no cure that could help me. Next thing I knew my eczema had grown worse and spread to my face and other parts of my body. It is an enduring sufferation. Thanks to Meta Derm lotion, which I have to use daily, the layer of crust that covered my entire back has chaffed away, and new smooth skin has emerged with only left over fading spots. Thank God.</li>
            <li> This lotion worked a little for my eczema...takes too long though! I found a miracle cream on Amazon. Cleared my eczema in 3-4 weeks!</li>
            <li> I use it for three weeks. It didn&#x27;t work at all. Even relieve it.</li>
            <li> I am in healthcare and started to use only organic types of hand soaps about 2 years ago (to avoid chemicals and toxins) and noticed that many of them severely dried my hands, exacerbated by frequent handwashing and glove changing throughout the day. My knuckles developed outbreaks of an itchy rash that would resolve only temporarily with over-the-counter hydrocortisone. The dermatologist said that continued use of the hydrocortisone would thin and age my skin. So, I recently started washing my hands only with Sappo Hill oatmeal and glycerin soap followed by the Metaderm cream. I also have been applying the cream and wearing Ecoland organic cotton gloves to sleep. It&#x27;s been about 2 weeks and my hands are finally healing! All of these products are very soothing and I would highly recommend them for dermatitis secondary to dryness. I love that this cream works and has organic ingredients with minimal chemicals.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this product bec of the good reviews and was hopeful for this product but it didn&#x27;t work out for our 8 months old. It made it worse. It all depends on the body.</li>
            <li> The only reason i gave this product 2 stars is my daughter is allergic to it.</li>
            <li> my son has who&#x27;s 11 has been suffering with eczema since he was 3 yrs old! we have tried every cream, lotion, prescribed steroids and nothing seem to work! He started to feel insecure as he was developing scars and huge eczema patches on his arms so he wore long sleeves even in the summertime. I saw metaderm on Amazon as I am a frequent shopper on here. Its been about 4 weeks and my son skin just keeps getting better. He loves the texture of the lotion as it isnt as thick as some other creams which usually contain petroleum! He&#x27;s happy and I&#x27;m happy and we cant wait to see what week 12 will look like! if you have eczema you need this cream! It works</li>
            <li> This was the only thing that worked on my eczema! This along with soaking my hands in raw apple cider vinegar allowed my symptoms to go away without ever having to take antibiotics or steroids! Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have had eczema for over 13 years and nothing had ever worked for me. Prescription creams from the dermatologist stung, usually contained steroids, and only worked temporarily, only to have my eczema come back, sometimes worse than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At home remedies smelled bad and didn&#x27;t work for me (apple cider vinegar, exfoliations, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is now mid-July and I have been using Metaderm since the end of March. Within a few days after initial usage, the itchiness was gone and the raised patches of skin and flakiness subsided. At this point, I was already happy with the product because I felt I could cover the redness with makeup (my eczema is on my face). It took about a month for the redness to completely disappear, and from then on, it has completely stayed away and I can even go out WITHOUT makeup on!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works for me, is cheaper than Rx creams, has no scent, and is incredibly reasonably priced. I cannot think of one downside to this product, except why wasn&#x27;t it created earlier? :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to add that we should all know not everything works for everyone (otherwise we would have one medicine for each ailment, one type of cosmetic, etc). But at this price point for Metaderm, it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given it five stars because it proved my expectations to be incorrect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product on Aug 14, 2013. I&#x27;m still in the middle of my 12 week usage period. At first, I was a skeptic, but I was also desperate. I needed a product that could reduce my eczema to the point of either completely restored skin or where it seems that I don&#x27;t even have eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having eczema is a disqualification that is (or was) preventing me from joining the U.S. Air Force. My friend recommended this product to me from Amazon (yay, amazon). I saw all of the positive reviews and thought that this would be worth trying. Additionally, there was the possibility of part of the 15% of people who didn&#x27;t benefit from the cream. So, I spent the money, and gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was truly my first test of patience. Within a few weeks, I started seeing results. It was still itching here and there, but with continued use came the exponential relief. Within the second month, it&#x27;s as if I don&#x27;t even have excema. Air Force, here I come. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this product, and if you&#x27;re a skeptic, just try it out anyway. It&#x27;s better rely on something promising than to continue using petroleum-based lotions.</li>
            <li> I have had ear canal eczema for thirty years. I have tried everything. I often resorted to prescription cortisone cream to control the insane itching but over time cortisone thins your skin. I am lucky that I haven&#x27;t punctured my ear drums with everything I tried. For those of you who don&#x27;t know about eczema, it can drive you mad with itching, weeping, crusting, healing, then another cycle begins. So when anything works even a little I&#x27;m happy. So now 7 weeks later I can say I am in remission. After the first month I thought it was getting a bit better; fewer itchy days, so I held out hope, but over the past week there has been significant improvement, the skin in my ear canal feels smooth, doesn&#x27;t itch, and I realized today that I wasn&#x27;t thinking about it. I will continue with the cream, the tube is large enough to last me many years. Try it, be patient, you should give it at least a 2 month trial.</li>
            <li> After using it on my left leg for four days, It really made the eczema effected spot much better, Thanks</li>
            <li> Great product. This works!</li>
            <li> I really liked this very emollient lotion, though not greasy, absorbed quickly on my hands...I don&#x27;t have eczema, but I do get very dry skin and once daily in the evening before I go to sleep was the correct time of day for my hands and I saw a vast improvement.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> It really works and smells and feels great</li>
            <li> This cream is keeping me from winter misery! Most creams eventually dry sky out over time, leaving my hands &amp; arms all scaly.  I like the long term effects &amp; the fact that it&#x27;s so natural.  Love this product!!</li>
            <li> It has helped me with allergic reaction inflammation around my eyes, caused by allergy to dust mites.  It usually gets worst after the initial allergy attack, until I end up having to get steroids to get healed, but these cause other issues with the immune system.  So this cream has helped bring down the inflammation without having to go and get steroids.</li>
            <li> My son has eczema and MetaDerm has the best products for his condition.  This cream works so well, it is gentle and effective.  I wouldn&#x27;t think of using anything else on him.</li>
            <li> Great for my Eczema, non greasy, leaves hands feeling wonderfully soft.</li>
            <li> still in use don&#x27;t know yet how it&#x27;s working for the person I bought it for, when he let me know I will comment.</li>
            <li> MetaDerm has just about cured the wet eczema on my hands. It took a few months but now I only get small flare ups every so often</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I can say that after twelve weeks of use, several of my worst spots have truly disappeared and all in all I am experiencing great relief on my hands.  I must say I also like it just as a hand cream.  I put it on first thing in the morning and don&#x27;t feel the need to keep putting hand cream on the rest of the day as I did with regular hand creams.  I am buying a second tube to keep in the kitchen closer at hand.</li>
            <li> I have been using MetaDerm for almost a year now.  Prior to using it, I was applying the steroid creams twice daily for 2 weeks and then going off of them for two weeks.  During the two weeks on the cream, my excema was tolerable.  Almost immediately after ceasing use of the steroid, the excema symptoms would again flare up.  Also, I am diabetic and the steroid creams caused my blood glucose to spike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then my wife found MetaDerm.  I had nearly immediate relief during the two weeks off the steroids.  And then I started not needing the steroids as often or as long.  Now I only use the steroid cream when I have a flare up, and then only for a few days.  I am using a tiny fraction of the amount of steroids that I used a year ago.  In their place I use MetaDerm twice a day.  My blood glucose levels are much improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very thankful and grateful for the improvement in my excema symptoms that this product has provided for me.  I would wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I have severe atopic dermatitis eczema. I have tried everything!!!! This is the only thing that has worked! These people truly care about your skin and have amazing customer service!</li>
            <li> I have tried anything &amp; everything to help clear up my skin. I am 22 and have had Eczema since I was 2 years old. I recently came across this Metaderm lotion for Eczema and was able to recieve a free sample to try it out. I am so blessed to have found such an amazing product that has gave me results within a week. I have always wanted to wear open shirts and sleeveless shirts and was never able to because my skin was red, irritated, and inflamed. Mostly my neck was red all the time and it always itched. Now after using this product, it doesn&#x27;t burn or it doesn&#x27;t smell bad like other lotions I have tried! Its organic and even better thing is that its clearing my skin up and it leaves my skin soft, moisturized, and not an itch...It&#x27;s amazing!!! I recommend this product to anyone who suffers from Eczema! It&#x27;s frustrating and depressing to deal with it, but this may be the answer to clearing up your skin, it worked for me so it never hurts to try it out! Thank You Metaderm :))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Yesenia R.</li>
            <li> Like many people I&#x27;ve tried many different products to heal my skin. It&#x27;s used to be amazing where I would get compliments, then it became what my dermatologists said were allergies, acne and eczema all rolled into one. They don&#x27;t know if environmental exposure or who knows what is causing it. That being said I have used 1.5 full bottle of MetaDerm and when used 2x a day I notice a difference. It&#x27;s not 100% clear but at least 60% clearer. I think if I continue to use it consistently it will continue to get better. Others like Aveeno for eczema were way too thick and filmy for me on the body. The Aveeno face one was pretty good but didnt soak in. Metaderm soaks in unless you over apply it. Coming back a couple hours later to reapply it is better if you feel dry.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My children were born with moderate to severe excema. They have been on one steroid cream or another almost since birth. We started using Metaderm excema lotion 4 months ago and I have not used any steroid creams or ointments on them in over a month. It does take some time to work so you do need to stick with it to see results, but it is worth it. I would say their skin is now 90% clear. This is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with dermatitis for years and this stuff seems to be doing well. I have tried probably a hundred different things over the year with no luck and so I stumbled on this.  The jury is still out but so far so good and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li> Like many of you, I was pretty doubtful that something like this would work, but it did wonders for my skin.  When I started to develop eczema on my arms I went to several dermatologists and was prescribed some form of topical steroids each time.  The steroids worked for a time, but after my treatment was finished the eczema always came back with a vengeance.  I went through this process several times until I decided to give up on steroid based solutions altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After finding this product online I decided to give it a shot, thinking what&#x27;s the worst that could happen I already have terrible eczema.  After two weeks of applying this cream I immediately started to see results as the itching and bumps were subsiding rapidly.  After three weeks, my eczema was virtually gone and all that&#x27;s left are the scars of when I scratched.</li>
            <li> This product is not good strictly for eczema. I used it on a rash from allergic reaction to a cosmetic product.  It is quite soothing and the rash cleared up almost immediately.  The ingredients are absolutely pure and it does not have any ghastly scent.</li>
            <li> The only hand lotion I can use without itching due to my horrible eczema!</li>
            <li> This has made my patches above and under my eyes vanish! They say twelve weeks, but I saw HUGE improvements after about 1 week.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I am still using it.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described.</li>
            <li> It did not help my eczema.  It is a very thick cream, almost too thick, so it is not as easy to spread, and you end up using more product than you need.</li>
            <li> This product is waste of money. Please do not your waste on this item like I did. I purchased two products from Metaderm and it feels likes they are out to get your money. I feel ripped of and do not have the time to return these products</li>
            <li> Not what it is cracked up to be !!!  Did not clear my rash up at all if anything made it worse !!!</li>
            <li> For a couple of years We been looking for the right cream that would help my kids skin problem. My kids has a very bad skin problem prior to buy this Eczema Moisturizing cream, but now it has 5%-10% left of their Eczema.</li>
            <li> I wish this product had worked for me, I bought the two pack for $30, Wow, What a waste. I work in Afghanistan, and even though I&#x27;ve been here over a year, with no symptoms of any illnesses or skin conditions about 6 weeks ago I developed red, dry patches of skin between my eye brows and on the sensitive skin area under my eyes to the bridge of my nose. I ordered this and I used it very lightly the first time. I noticed it stung a little but I went with it and my redness got worse. After a few days of not using any kind of product the redness started to recede. I wanted to try this lotion one more time to help if the redness would go away faster. So I used this lotion again and just like before it stung a bit when I applied it and the redness got worse. I threw away the whole thing and will never use it again.</li>
            <li> The inflammation of my eczema has been significantly reduced. It used to itch very badly, and now I barely notice it. The only thing I wish is that this product moisturized better - I still need to use Aquaphor to prevent dryness of the rashes (which become scaly and flaky). But, in all, it&#x27;s a good product. I&#x27;ve seen improvement in only 2 weeks of use, and I hope to see my eczema completely vanish by the end of 12 weeks. I will update around the beginning of January (when the 12 weeks is up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: This product was not able t completely clear up my eczema. I broke down and went to the doctor and got a prescription. If you have a VERY stubborn case, this product is likely not strong enough to work for you. I try to avoid pharmaceuticals when possible, and it was truly my last resort. I can say that I had some success with this product on some of my smaller problem areas, so that is good news</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for adult now. It&#x27;s the only one that really worked to soothe. I find that very little works better than a lot.</li>
            <li> I looked up the ingredients in [...] (which you should always do to be safe), and there are a couple at the top of the ingredient list that have warnings of toxicity. See: [...]  and  [...]&lt;br /&gt;If they reformulate and remove those ingredients (and the untrue \\&quot;100% Organic\\&quot; claim), then I&#x27;ll rate it higher. Check out: [...]</li>
            <li> I began using this about a month ago. I have severe sun damage to my chest area and neck resulting in too much sun in my 20&#x27;s and 30&#x27;s.  The first thing I noticed about it is it does not have a smell. When I use lotions and creams on my face or neck area I am very sensitive to smells that linger all day. After using it a month I have noticed my skin is MUCH softer and has a less damaged appearance. Some of my sun spots have actually began to fade. Last November, I had a skin cancer removed from my chest area and it left a small red scar. I have also noticed (especially in this last week) that the scar is MUCH less red and noticeable. I will absolutely continue to use this!! I am extremely happy with my results and can&#x27;t wait to see what the next few weeks bring!!</li>
            <li> This has helped my Daughters psoriasis on here hands! We will be purchasing this product again! I would recommend this product to family and friends!</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT REALL DOES WORK, INTO FORTH WEE AND HUGE IMPROVEMENT, I HAVE HAD ECZEMA FOR YEARS AND I KNOW WHAT I&#x27;M TALKING ABOUT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with eczema my whole life. I like to avoid steroids when possible so when I got a flair up on my face I tried this cream. As soon as I applied it my skin started stinging and burning and I had to wash it off immediately. Needless to say, I haven&#x27;t used it since.</li>
            <li> nice packaging and I love that it is organic but it doesn&#x27;t really help my terrible eczema but nothing ever helps it and I will continue the search which I feel will never end, eczema is so hard to treat and deal with</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me. I used it prior to going to the dermatologist. I was diagnosed with contact dermatitis which is basically the same thing as eczema with a flare from something my skin is irritated by. Anyway, it was like rubbing sugar water on my neck and then expecting mosquitoes to not bite me!!! My neck itched like crazy when I put this stuff on. Instead of sending it back, I ended up throwing it in the trash. Good thing is my neck is better after being treated by the doctor. That&#x27;s what I should have done in the first place, is just went to the doctors!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice, smooth cream. Seems to help the bumps and rashes my kids get. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have perioral dermatitis. My face looked awful. Raw red bumps around my nose mouth and chin and eyes. If i washed my face they would immediately swell and get even more red and inflamed. My dermatologist did nothing to help me. She prescribed Elidel..... it causes cancer and has other harmful side effects. I came to Amazon.com and typed in perioral dermatitis and MetaDerm popped up. I bought it. It said to use it for 12 weeks. It started working in one week. First the inflammation disappeared. I could wash my face without looking like a tomatoe. Then the swelling stopped. By the end if the week bumps started disappearing. I can&#x27;t believe this worked. I will never be without it. This is my second week and my face is 90% clear. Its affordable, natural and no side effects. I&#x27;m so happy. Thanks MetaDerm.</li>
            <li> its a great moisturizing! it leaves the skin so soft .</li>
            <li> So far I like the product, however, I have not used it long enough as yet, to give a clear review on the jproduct.</li>
            <li> This is working!!!  Finally a product that actually is helping my 10 month old&#x27;s eczema!  So happy!</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream for my 10 week old baby, who had developed eczema on his face. We have been using it now for almost 3 weeks and have seen drastic improvements. His face is still slightly red and dry, but the weeping has completely disappeared and it looks far less irritated. The lotion is light weight and easily absorbed, without a noticeable odor/fragrance. I contacted their company to inquire about the proper use (yes, you can use it several times a day and on the weeping areas), and they returned my email within a few hours and event sent me sample spray and baby wash/shampoo. I am highly impressed with the product and their customer service and would recommend everyone to give them a shot!</li>
            <li> I would wake up at night itching, I used cetaphil cream , and I wasn&#x27;t itching .  don&#x27;t think it was worth  the money I spent on all three of them,</li>
            <li> Let me first say we have used many things for my daughters eczema. Lotions the Dr. reccommended then lotions that the Dr. prescribed! This is the first time my daughters eczema has totally went away and i cant even tell that she had eczema! I am very pleased with this Cream and am so happy I tried this...her legs are totally clear from the eczema!!! this is one happy momma!!!</li>
            <li> I have a Hydrocortisone allergy and can not use most over the counter treatments on my eczema because of that and this has worked like a charm for me. I had a small spot pop up on my arm and I applied this after my shower daily and in less then a week it was gone. I also love this because it dose not have all the chemicals in it that most creams do. I am especially grateful for that now that I am pregnant and don&#x27;t want to put anything on my skin that I wouldn&#x27;t be comfortable putting on my baby after it is born. I am forever grateful to Metaderm for freeing me from the endless cycle of prescription eczema creams that are full of things that probably shouldn&#x27;t be put on my body any ways. They have gained a customer for life!</li>
            <li> I have had eczema for numerous years and ever since I had my son four years ago it has been increasingly worse. I am not sure why but it is really hard to deal with. It is the worst on my hands, fingers, and arms. The worst part (and scary with winter coming) is just how much worse it gets in the cold weather which is why I always make sure to have a good stockpile of this stuff.. in the house, in the car, and in my purse. I have tried many many things to get rid of my eczema or at least control it with no avail.. lotions, creams, natural home remedies, and have spent hundreds of dollars to see doctors and specialists. This is by far the best product I have ever tried and have had the most success with. I HIGHLY recommend it. You will not be disappointed and the best part is that it is organic and natural so you can feel good about putting it on your skin. Within days it really helps to control my flare ups and makes me feel less insecure because of how raw my skin would look. I make sure to use this and spread the word as much as possible because I want others to know there is HOPE. My husband has psoriasis and my sister has horrible eczema and they have both found relief with MetaDerm products. Do yourself a favor, and regain your life. You will be so glad you did!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my eczema :(  Just found out about Neem oil, that is the next thing I am going to try.</li>
            <li> I typically read reviews of anything I order on Amazon, but I was given Metaderm as a free sample at a mom&#x27;s event and had never researched it before trying.  I can&#x27;t express how well my experience has been, not only with their products, but also their customer service.  I&#x27;m incredibly picky and sensitive with the products I use, and Metaderm eczema lotion and soap are outstanding.  It rid me and my son of eczema (the lotion isn&#x27;t sticky, watery, or drying) and even their soaps are wonderful.  I test everything on myself before passing it along to my son&#x27;s sensitive skin.  Of the three products I tested, the Earth Mamma Angel Baby castile soap was too drying for us, especially in this harsh winter.  The Honest Company soap and lotion were good, but I prefer how Metaderm&#x27;s products are fragrance free.  And California Baby was also good, but I prefer a foam dispenser.  I loved Metaderm&#x27;s soap so much that I purchased this refill and unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t open my foaming soap container to fill it.  Not only did the company replace it with minimal communication and hassle, but they sent me a large box of sample products, which was a wonderful treat.  This great gift more than replaced my failing effort of unscrewing the cap, which eventually pliers did (and now I understand why, because they don&#x27;t want it to leak upon shipment, and are actually talking about this with the product people to correct).  So in the end, I can&#x27;t say enough great things about Metaderm lotion and soap.  Next on the list to review are the bug spray and hyper moisturizing cream.  What terrific products and company!!</li>
            <li> My 7 year old daughter&#x27;s eczema is severe enough that at any given time, she has cracked, bleeding skin.  Even the lotion that&#x27;s supposed to be for sensitive skin makes her cry out in pain when I apply.  With this lotion, the sting is minimal, if at all.  She started begging for this lotion because of it.  There is no topical treatment that can make her skin clear up 100%, but this is the first lotion (that&#x27;s not a topical steroid) that has made a significant difference.  Best part about it is, unlike the topical steroids we get both from her doctor and OTC, I can put it on her every day without fear of the bad side effects that come from the steroidal creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it&#x27;s too pricey. Even with the price break on the larger 32 oz size, it&#x27;s still ridiculously expensive.  Obviously, I think it&#x27;s worth it, because I&#x27;m going to continue to use it.  But I hope someday they&#x27;ll have a sale on it.  Fingers crossed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some rough patches on my forehead (redness, a little scaling, and a lot of dry skin around the eyebrows) for the past few months.  This happens most winters, but this time it was really yucko.  I tried using a few moisturizers around the house, but they didn&#x27;t seem to do a whole lot.  I&#x27;ve been using this MetaDerm stuff twice a day (after my morning shower, and right before bed), and it has a clear, obvious effect -- it clears up the dandruff-ish stuff in the eyebrows rapidly, and it soothes the forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I haven&#x27;t gotten through the recommended six-month (?) period of treatment, I&#x27;m happy already. My one tip: use less than you think you need. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Update: I just bought my second bottle. I have an stubborn patch of eczema on my hand that won&#x27;t go away that even my strong hydrocortisone cream could clear up. I found my old tube of this product that I bought last year and decided to give it a shot. Although there was about a tablespoon of cream left in it, when I rubbed it on my hands all day today and it has kept it well moisturized and the swelling has gone down significantly. Can&#x27;t wait for that new bottle!  I have a patch of eczema about the size of my palm on the back of my neck. It is pretty concentrated in this area and i wasn&#x27;t sure how it could heal since it&#x27;s cracked, blistery and painful. I applied this cream to the area about 3-4times a day, changed my diet omitting gluten, took some supplements (Prevaclear) and probiotics and now the eczema is no longer puffy and cracked. Tt&#x27;s still red and dry, so this cream definitely keeps it moisturized . I can&#x27;t say what actually worked, but I did notice a difference when I applied the cream into the area in the downward motion, not circular motion. I also used Aveeno ezcema cream, but I like this better because it doesn&#x27;t have alcohol in the ingredients.  My eczema gets really dry and itchy and I need a strong moisturizer that will keep me from scratching. This product soothes my skin while keeping it moist. It isn&#x27;t as emollient as others I&#x27;ve tried - on the flipside, it was absorbing and doing something effective. I&#x27;ve applied  it throughout the day and my skin is clearing up after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old suffers from sever eczema and we had run the gammit for trying new products when I came across MetaDerm Organic cream. This stuff worked wonders this winter when he was having an extremely rough time with his chapped and cracked skin.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> Very nice healing cream for dry eczema prone skin.  I use it on hands and arms and legs.  Very good texture, and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Irritated my eczema worse</li>
            <li> Recommended by my sister who has low eczema.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived in good time.&lt;br /&gt;Like that it&#x27;s organic.&lt;br /&gt;Nice creamy consistency; not watery.&lt;br /&gt;Good for all over or spot use.&lt;br /&gt;Bought it for about $14ish &amp; its around the amount/price of Aveeno/Eurcerin/Neosporin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gluten-free &amp; dairy-free so I was shocked and appalled when my eczema flared up worse than it&#x27;s ever been. I really didn&#x27;t want to do steroids but was almost desperate enough to cave and get some. I stumbled across Metaderm on Amazon and figured it would be my last ditched effort. I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for less than a week and my skin is already looking and more importantly feeling SO much better.</li>
            <li> This cream did not help my little girl&#x27;s eczema patches at all! I had really high hopes after reading all the positive reviews, but it turned out to be just another cream to add to the list of products that claimed to be miracle workers and do not do anything. It was a waste of money for us. I found that it actually made her eczema worse, so I discontinued use after a few days.</li>
            <li> Seems to calm my Eczema down and heal it &amp;#34;some what&amp;#34;...Deffinatley like it and will order it again. ..</li>
            <li> i dont think it works so great. causing more itching and burning and peeling of skin., but no change to rash</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t help my little boy who has severe ezcema. Maybe it works for some but didn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
            <li> Jury&#x27;s still out, but the first round are going strong. Bought this for a young kid with classic patches of eczema behind the elbows and knees. So far none of the usual complaints about stinging or stickiness. Instead the cream has a pleasantly smooth and delicate feel to it, and the eczema may just be subsiding...</li>
            <li> The best Ointment -  fixed dry hands which many good Dermatologist couldn&#x27;t not fix!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how, and frankly I just don&#x27;t care! It works! My daughter has suffered with itchy, scaly eczema since she was a baby. It&#x27;s been three years of trying to soothe her poor delicate skin. This stuff calmed it down overnight, the redness was gone in 72 hours and after a week her skin is smooth and soft without an itchy patch in sight! I will keep using this religiously for her! A return customer for sure! I even ordered some for myself for my face during the winter when it gets dry and flaky from being outside!</li>
            <li> I have struggled with eczema my entire life. It really flares up when I&#x27;m stressed.  It&#x27;s time for law school finals and my knee was enflamed and swollen and my rash was very itchy.  Immediately the itching stopped and my skin&#x27;s temperature returned to normal.  In just 2 days the rash is smaller and the skin is returning to normal.  I apply it whenever it starts to itch and immediately I feel better.  At this rate my skin should be back to normal within a week after scratching so much I had sores.  I wish I had known about this before!!!</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly. Bought for mom and while it doesn&#x27;t work as well as her prescription cream, it does help.</li>
            <li> Just last year I developed horrible case of eczema on my hands. My hands were always blistery and horribly itchy throughout the day. I received MetaDerm in the mail this Monday and started applying twice a day. Already I can see my eczema clearing up and rarely feeling itchy!! Soo happy!! I&#x27;ve tried many products from the store and prescribed topical creams from the dermatologist and they never worked....this product does! The only problem I run into is that I am a CNA and constantly wash my hands throughout work and my eczema always seems to get worse when they dry. This product helps seal it better but I wish they had some kind of an eczema soap wash to tie with the MetaDerm Cream. So far overall I&#x27;m thrilled my eczema is starting to go away!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both suffer from dry, sensitive, eczema ridden skin. It is as important for our treatment to be effective as is it to be gentle, this encompasses both. It&#x27;s much thicker than a lotion which is great! It is very hydrating and long lasting for both my little one and I. I use it in conjunction with metaderm baby spray, my daughters eczema has improved almost 100% with the exception of flare ups in the creases of her elbows and knees during hot summer days. All in all great, natural product.</li>
            <li> THREE days was all it took using this lotion for my eczema to be completely cleared. I&#x27;m speechless. I have had a horrible rash/eczema on my lower legs for almost 3 years now (developed as an adult, mystery as to why) and I have spent hundreds of dollars in dermatology visits and have tried at least 5 different prescription strength topical steroids. Things would be ok for awhile and then boom, itchy red rash back and reeking havoc. Obviously you can&#x27;t use topical steroids indefinitely as they are harsh and thin the skin out and can actually cause horrible sores (google it, gross!). I was desperate to try anything so I bought this $14 lotion thinking that it wouldn&#x27;t do much but at least it was organic and probably good for moisturizing. I can&#x27;t believe how well it works. It&#x27;s not greasy and has no smell (which I like). I highly recommend. Even shaving which usually exacerbates my rash has not caused any problems. I feel like I&#x27;m back to my normal self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In reading some of the negative reviews, I think those people must have an allergy to one of the ingredients because this stuff does not sting at all when I put it on. The 3rd ingredient is emulsifying wax which caused me to pause when I first read it. I have no clue how or why, and I don&#x27;t really care, but this stuff really really works!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 2 months. It yields same results as Oil of Olay Cream Oil. Keeps eczema moisturized, but it still flares up periodically regardless.</li>
            <li> when you put on this cream, it feels nice for a few seconds.  but  as you rub it in to your skin, it all peels off, making a big mess!</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s eczema has been pretty difficult to treat. But this lotion made it go away in less than two weeks. It works awesomely.</li>
            <li> I am amazed by this product. My husband has been dealing with eczema on his hands for almost 4 years due to an allergy to some cleaners that he used at work. He had allergy tests done and is allergic to preservatives that are in lotions, paints, soaps, acids, oils, etc.. His hands have consistently broken out at least once a month and he has been using the steroids and creams that were prescribed and recommended by the dermatologist, the skin was so thin on his hands at one point that you could count the veins. He even did the light therapy, 3 times a week @ $50 each for 3 months. He gave up because it was only helping temporarily and his hands were still breaking out. I received this lotion and the foaming soap on 6/28/15.. it took some talking but I finally talked him into using it. I ask him daily how his hands are doing.. at first he told me that they were still dry, stiff and sore and he thought he was breaking back out but no blisters appeared.. I am glad to say that 3 weeks to the day he started using it, he came home from work and showed me that he actually has hair growing on the back of his hands. He hasn&#x27;t had any hair grow on his hands in almost 4 years.. I can honestly say I believe this is working for my husband. I will wait another 3 weeks and update this post if I can and let you know where we are at.. So far so good.. very impressed..</li>
            <li> I will be reordering this product.  I have been suffering from terrible eczema for the past four years and prescription medications help control it, but not well.  This product has almost cleared my skin in only a few weeks.  It soothes the itching and I only have to use steroids occasionally now.  I would recommend it to anyone with dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Did not really see any results.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!!! It does what it says it will do. I will for sure reorder this product. This product is luxurious and really makes your skin soft and smooth. I love this product!!</li>
            <li> It stops the itching, it stops the drying out.  Goes on easy and fast absorbing.  Next time im going with the bigger size</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I get very dry skin on my legs and hands in the bitter cold and regular body lotion wasn&#x27;t doing the trick. I started to use it and noticed a positive difference. I admit, you have to try to apply it consistently at least twice a day to see a quick and noticeable change which I am not great at. It did get rid of the dry spots for the most part. I am definitely one who is more sensitive to trying new products but never experienced any breakouts that occurred in the lower rated reviews. I am sure it just depends on the person, but for me, it worked great. For the price it is worth it as well.</li>
            <li> Threw it away after using it for 3 days.  My skin went crazy and I paid a heavy price for trying this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy that I found this brand! Our 2 year old started getting these crazy bumps on her arm and I thought it was the same type of condition my sister has where her skin feels like chicken skin. I was so devastated because she was never able to fix the issue. After reading through a few items on the internet, I thought it may be due to dry skin and after further reading reviews of the product decided to order it. Wow did it help! No more bumps and her skin is so smooth and beautiful again. The lotion itself is very thick, more like a salve. It&#x27;s such an excellent product, now everyone in the family uses it!</li>
            <li> Works great!!!! The best thing i bought!!! I tried lots of other products but they did not work.</li>
            <li> A perfect product for dry skin which most of us are prone. Great for minor irritations/rashes. Will buy again when needed.</li>
            <li> This cream actually does provide relief and healing for my recurring eczema.  it is truly one of the best products I have tried for this issue.</li>
            <li> This product has been helping/working whereas my child has been allergic to other products. Finally found something!  Was recommended by my doc and another person.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Aveeno Eczema Therapy for quite awhile but thought I&#x27;d try something new as I felt Aveeno just kept my skin constant, it never improved, but never got worse. I&#x27;d put it on once in the morning and that&#x27;s typically all I needed.  This MetaDerm, I find myself needing it every couple of hours even without hand washing. It just seems to &amp;#34;go away&amp;#34; and my hands begin to dry then crack. I am going through this bottle much faster than I do Aveeno, and I don&#x27;t feel that my skin is improving. I haven&#x27;t gone the full 12 weeks yet, but so far I am not impressed. To be fair, this has been a very stressful holiday season for me and stress always seems to make my hands worse.</li>
            <li> This stops the ecezma but its doesn&#x27;t moistureize as well as it should. I will probably try another brand rather than become a repeat buyer because of this. Although it works, when I reach for it, my son comments for me to use something else.  I would at least try this and hopefully it works better for you than it did with my son.  As I said, it does work, but it somewhat dried his skin.  When we put it on in the morning, by mid day, I have to put a moisturizer on the affected area.</li>
            <li> I Love all Metaderm  products!!&lt;br /&gt;I wish I took before and after pictures of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Follow the directions and these products will work!&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you use twice a day.</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt; I love the products! It really has worked so well for myself and&lt;br /&gt;little girl. She had a break out on her legs and arms from eczema and after just&lt;br /&gt;two uses of the lotion, it was almost gone. I have even been using it&lt;br /&gt;on one of the kids I babysit. She has had bad diaper rash on her&lt;br /&gt;bottom and it has surely helped her too. I wish I had these products&lt;br /&gt;sooner!</li>
            <li> Like most really good products that are wholly or partly natural, you have to give Metaderm some time to work. It&#x27;s a cumulative effect that takes several weeks to have an effect. My boyfriend has suffered from winter dry skin horribly for years, often scratching his sides and legs until his skin bled. He tried every product out there with little or no relief. After I did some research, I happened upon Metaderm 12 and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. I warned him that he has to stick with it and not expect an overnight miracle. Within 2 weeks of twice daily application, he stopped scratching and I noticed his skin seemed more supple and healthier-looking. After 1 month he feels great and has not had the &amp;#34;itchies&amp;#34; at all. I am very impressed and pleased with the results, for sure, and we&#x27;re only 4 or 5 weeks into the process! 2 thumbs up!!!</li>
            <li> I suffer from the occasional flare-up of eczema on the eyelids.  I am not entirely convinced about the &amp;#34;12 week&amp;#34; improvement promise, since my flare-ups usually improve anyways over that time period, but I will say I like this product for these reasons:&lt;br /&gt;- it does not burn when I apply it to my sore eyes and most products do;&lt;br /&gt;- it seems to relieve the itching; and&lt;br /&gt;- it has a nice light consistency.&lt;br /&gt;We were recently in Mexico and Metaderm worked wonderfully on sunburnt skin!  I think it is going to become my go-to product for any kind of skin irritation and could even make a great &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; face cream.  BTW, I don&#x27;t think $14.50 is at all pricey for a 6 oz tube  (which measures 5&amp;#34; x 2.5&amp;#34;).  That&#x27;s cheap compared to most high-end skin creams.  And because it is so light it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. It helped but did not get rid of my hand problems with eczema. I found another product which works better for my problem. Having said this, this is a nice cream that will help most people I would imagine.</li>
            <li> This has been one of the coldest winters for a while and I have loved having this moisturizing cream. I went thru one tube and ordered another before the other one was gone. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This cream really really really works, have been suffering with hand eczema (on my fingers) for almost two years now, seen my doctor , allergy specialist, nutritionist, skin tests , you name it i did it, doctors prescribed all kind of medications for me ,but the eczema would go away for a few days and come right back even worst. i would walk by the pharmacy an the pharmacist know me by name, and nothing worked,doctors said stop eating this ,stop eating that, stop wearing perfume,lotion,and all kind of stuff.Tried alot of stuff from all over the internet, healthfood store , stuff from china, japan,england,brazil, you name it i&#x27;ve tried it, wasted hundreds of dollars and nothing came close to working even 2%. but thank god i decided to try Metaderm, it was best decision ever it actually worked been using for a little while now and i&#x27;m in shock because the eczema havent returned, my hands are unbelievable back to normal smooth and soft again, BUT ITS A 12 WEEK FORMULA SO DONT USE FOR 1 WEEK  OR 2 AND EXPECT TO SEE RESULTS. havent been to my doctor in months . great product thank you Metaderm.</li>
            <li> Probably the best product I&#x27;ve ever used on stubborn eczema.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for two days now for my facial eczema. It reduces or eliminates the itchiness and burning feel rather quickly. I hope it will remove the eczema entirely!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review before but this is so necessary. I have very bad dermatitis ( on the back of my neck, under my armpits, behind my ears and under my breast) anybody who has this knows how annoying and frustrating it is. The only thing that has ever worked for me is a strong dose of hydrocortisone cream and it still only lasts a few days. Anyway..... ! I received this item yesterday and used it before bed. It&#x27;s very thin and goes on very well. It immediately started burning my scalp/back of neck but I figured that meant it was working. I was right!! this morning I woke up itch free (which sometimes keeps me up at night) and better yet I had no stinging when I showered. Every time I shower shampoo effects my neck and burns like crazy. I felt nothing this morning! I&#x27;m so so happy that this seems to be working already because all I want is to be able to not have to worry about skin issues, especially in front of guys. I&#x27;m excited to see the future results this product gives me! I want to say &amp;#34;this product is amazing go try it!!&amp;#34; But it may just do well with my skin, I don&#x27;t want anyone to be disappointed if they don&#x27;t see the same results but I hope you guys do!!!!! Best, xoxo</li>
            <li> I wondered about this but ordered it anyway.  Less than $20 and I can risk that.  It works wonderfully.  I had outbreaks of eczema on my lower legs and this at night really calms it.  Great improvement in a few days.  It is still with me but the tube says 12 weeks!  So, I will use it for at least that long.  It absorbs really well, too and seems to be scent-free.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long, but all my eczema rashes are already healing. I can see normal skin colour again. I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with eczema on my face(forehead,under eyes,&amp; near chin) for months now-as soon as I thought it was clearing up I would wake up with big red splotches. Hydrocortisone creams weren&#x27;t doing anything for me and stung when I put them on. I&#x27;ve been using the Metaderm cream for less than a week and honestly can&#x27;t believe that my eczema is almost completely cleared up. The cream leaves your skin feeling soft and doesn&#x27;t sting or irritate when you put it on. I shop on Amazon all the time and usually never leave a review but I wanted people to know that this cream really helped me.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a hydrating moisturizing cream (vs lotion, which is not as intensive) for my todder, who suffers from moderate eczema.  We use Vanicream, which works wonderfully, but doesn&#x27;t have the most wholesome products (includes BHA, not ideal).  MetaDerm is far purer, but not as moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t create the same barrier on his skin, but it&#x27;s a trade-off.  I alternate and use the Vanicream when he&#x27;s in a flare up and once it&#x27;s under control use MedaDerm.  For someone without a skin condition simply looking for a nice moisture cream, this would be wonderful.</li>
            <li> So far so my son has extremely bad excema during the winter it gets so bad his sholders and back if his knees and other area will start cracking the hell scratch at them and they will bleed.I&#x27;ve been putting this stuff on him every day when he wakes up and after a bath before he goes to bed.. it&#x27;s definitely not something that&#x27;s going to make it go away in a day but it has helped alot and has really helped his itching as well</li>
            <li> After I read all the reviews, I was convinced this product would be the answer to our family&#x27;s eczema frustration. While I love the lotion itself, it has not helped to relieve itching and rash associated with this annoying skin condition.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nurse in a preschool and several of the children here have started using MetaDerm.  It has been about a month so far and the MetaDerm has been a huge hit.  We have one child who has particularly severe eczema (she&#x27;s been hospitalized before) and generally hates having anything applied topically -- it seems like everything ends up triggering itching and burning.  She loves the MetaDerm though!  She actually asks to apply it all the time and literally begs for more.  It&#x27;s great that she has finally made the connection between applying something to her skin and feeling and looking better.  Now she complains much less of itchiness and her mom says she is sleeping better at night.  Earlier this year some of her classmates teased her and said that her hands looked dirty; she had become very self-conscious and quiet but her skin looks so much better now and her confidence has soared.  Recently she even commented on how pretty her feet look.  I never thought that I&#x27;d hear that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 5/2/14&lt;br /&gt;The children using MetaDerm are doing great -- teachers and parents are constantly commenting about the improvement that they&#x27;ve seen.  It&#x27;s incredible to hear parents express their gratitude and relief at finally finding \\&quot;something that works.\\&quot;  Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different lotions for my itchy skin. Most stop working after a while. This one seems more effective. It softened areas that had become thick and tough. It&#x27;s not a cure for me but very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like Gold Bond Anti-itch [B002CVV1IA] and Cortisone 10 Intensive Healing [B00314GCJU].</li>
            <li> This product has given better relief for eczema and itching on my hands than anything else I have tried.  It also works well as a lotion, absorbing into the skin instead of sitting on top and rubbing off on everything I touch like others.  I did not use it for 90 days as directed, more like 30-60 days at a time and that worked for me.  I only need it in the winter.</li>
            <li> This is working VERY well for my daughter&#x27;s eczema - smoothing out the rough spots and blending nicely.  Definitely worth a shot if you&#x27;re struggling.</li>
            <li> Have been using it but not sure of results yet.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream to help with a skin issue I am having. In the spirit of full disclosure, it is not Eczema that I have, but I know the specifics of the condition, and thought that this just could work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I was sorry to say that I found that it didn&#x27;t work for that purpose, I did find an AMAZING moisturizing cream in this MetaDerm Eczema cream. I have dry skin and have tried many, MANY different creams, and this one beats them all. I can put it on in the morning after I shower, and when I shower the NEXT DAY, I tell it&#x27;s still working. Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while I can&#x27;t say for certain it works for Eczema, I can tell you it&#x27;s a great, great moisturizer on it&#x27;s own. I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> After 4 years of buying and trying literally everything I have found the BEST eczema cream ever. My daughter was born with eczema and we have spent soooo much money we have tried organic cold pressed shea butter, organic cold pressed avocado oil, organic CP cupusu, red raspberry seed oil, gold bond lotion, you name it and we&#x27;ve tried it with some problems. The store bought lotions would burn and break her out more the all natural stuff would be so greasy that it would stain her clothes and get in her hair. Finally I have found this cream thanks to all the wonderful reviews and have tried it. It is nothing I have ever felt its almost tacky like and a little goes a long way. It is not greasy but feels silky and thankfully it does not burn her skin and can be used on her face without burning. I am soooo happy with this purchase that I am going to buy the 32oz.pump b/c using it twice a day all over the body uses a lot of cream. For anyone interested in saving some $ on the 32oz pump go to metaderms website I got it with free shipping for $44.88 God bless and I hope this cream helps you like it has my 4 yr old :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  I suffer from some mild excema and this works wonders for me! I highly recommend this cream for anyone suffering from excema!</li>
            <li> Great lotion. Non-greasy! Really nice ingredient blend. Great product for the price! Try it! You won&#x27;t be dissatisfied! Go USA!</li>
            <li> I recently tried MetaDerm Eczema cream and I am hooked.  Not only does it clear up my eczema but it moisturizes my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.  It has no scent, so you can&#x27;t tell that you have any \\&quot;medicated lotion\\&quot; on, and I actually use it even AFTER my eczema is gone.  The moisturizing portion of this cream is so luxurious that I use it after showers and it keeps my skin soft all day.  I highly recommend this.  It is also very affordable, which is rare for eczema creams.  I love MetaDerm!</li>
            <li> This product worked great for me. I had an itchy red rash on my left inside elbow and going up my bicep. Tried vitamin E cream and vaseline intensive constantly for about 6 weeks and nothing. At most it took some itching away for an hour or two. Looked at various products on Amazon and I liked the reviews and the fact of it being all herbal mix so I tried Metaderm. It took itching away for a good 8-10 hours from the start. Within 3 days I noticed it starting to clear and within 6 days it was completely gone. Wow! Great product.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this August 22 and it is now September 8, and this product has made my skin look and feel amazing. I didn&#x27;t think I would find anything that was not full of chemicals to combat my dry, pealing, irritated skin but this has worked wonders. my skin is so soft and bright.</li>
            <li> Small bumps on my upper arms disappeared within days of using this.  Now I just use it for preventative maintenance about every other day!</li>
            <li> I have tried several products for eczema but this is the only one that gives me long lasting relief.  Others just soothe the symptoms.  This product soothes the symptoms temporarily, but over several weeks of use, I don&#x27;t even have symptoms anymore!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I was going to wait to do a review on this product. I started using this product on Friday, 12/6/13 and today is Tuesday 12/10/13 and I have been using it twice a day. This is a very slight sting to the skin when applying this product however the skin already looks and feel better. I plan on making a commitment to the 12 weeks twice a day. If the clinical trials are accurate I have an 85% chance of my skin improving. I researched the ingredients and most of the ingredients are organic and are proven to promote healthy skin. Anyone suffering from eczema or some other skin condition should give this product a try. I read a lot of the reviews and they are overwhelmingly positive, this is one of the very few products for eczema that have clinical trial research to back it up and in addition a large percentage of the ingredients are organic and proven to aid in the healing of skin issues/conditions naturally. I am impressed with all of this information alone. I will do an update one on January 6, 2014. UPDATE! I am late with my update. Today is Friday, January 24, 2014. I have been using this product twice a day for SEVEN weeks. I wish that I had taken \\&quot;before\\&quot; and \\&quot;after\\&quot; pictures of the bottom of both of my legs as those are the only areas that I have been applying the Metaderm lotion. Listen up everyone \\&quot;YOU\\&quot; have an 85 percent chance of this lotion healing your skin. Yes you heard me correct \\&quot;HEALING\\&quot; your skin. That is exactly what this lotion does \\&quot;HEAL\\&quot; your skin. This is the absolute best lotion that I have ever used for the highly problematic issues of skin infected with eczema. This lotion has did an unbelievable job on my skin and is nothing short of amazing! I encourage anyone to give this product a try. UPDATE! Today is Friday, February 28, 2014. The last day of my 12 week twice a day application of Metaderm. Overall I am very satisfied with the product. I have eczema on the lower part on both of me legs (from the knee down) and on my left arm. I have deeplyembedded rashes that I have not been able to do anything about. My skin has stop itching completely and is very smooth. No raised, bumpy or scaly skin. My legs look and feel about 75 - 80 % better. I will continue to use the rest of the Metaderm one application a day until the lotion is gone. And then I will return to using Eucerin. Metaderm does not provide enough moisture to the skin for me but I have lots of natural oils (almond, vitamin E, sesame seed, olive oil to name a few) that I can use for that. In addition I did some research and castor oil is good for lighting scars on the skin. Metaderm did exactly was it was advertised to do. I was really in to coconut oil and the lauric acid in it caused the fungus to exit my body through my skin as I did not gradually increase my intake of the coconut oil I use too much too fast. Anyway all products to do not work for everyone. Remember if you use Metaderm you have an 85% chance that it will help heal your skin.</li>
            <li> The worst product for your skin. it worsened my condition. I had red spots all over my face for a week. I don&#x60;t know why this company think that the plants in this cream are good for the skin, my face looked like the time i touched poison ivy.</li>
            <li> I am not one to write reviews, but I had to say something about how well this works for me.  It is not a steroid, so it is not quick, I think many people get confused by that.  Personally, 12 weeks is not long to wait for something that really is effective and does not thin my skin.  Great find.</li>
            <li> Everyone I know who uses this for rashes and eczema sees dramatic differences in a few weeks.  Truly remarkable!  I highly recommend anyone who suffers from skin problems and doesn&#x27;t want to seek medical treatment to try it.</li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of eczema products over the last 8 years from 5 different doctors. Nothing has worked long term for me like this product. I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s now in amazon. You can also find it in Walgreens.</li>
            <li> it helped for my in law&#x27;s foot problem</li>
            <li> Oh! So excited about finding a product made in my state that I can use that is good for eczema. Well, that was as far as that went. I put it on and had to take it right off, set my skin on fire! Wish I had my money, back. May work for some, just didn&#x27;t for me, was very disappointed. Okay, so the cream did not work for me, but you need to try the spray as it is wonderful and really works very well. The spray does not contain the same ingredients and does not burn when applied. A nice company to shop with they care about their customers and how well their products work. They was kind enough to refund for the lotion that I could not use. As for customer service there is not enough stars to rate this! Super and A+ for customer service.</li>
            <li> No problems, would buy again. THANKS!</li>
            <li> this was kind of greasy to the touch.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I was excited to try it on my 5 year old who has eczema. We don&#x27;t like to use steroids and her skin is a daily battle. She cried because it burns her skin. Unfortunately Meta Derm will be going in our drawer of lotions that don&#x27;t work on her.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help my son at all. Brought it for the reviews. Did nothing</li>
            <li> I like the consistancy, not a greasy or thick cream, and unlike all the others IT WORKS fast and...love the plastic tube. Jar sizes stay in the cabinet,  this fits in my purse and I will take it on my vacation to Europe!</li>
            <li> This cream delivers exactly what it said it would :)  I will not go back to any of those pricy crap that&#x27;s loaded with chemicals that does absolutely nothing good :(  So Thak U sooo much to the person who came up with this. I really would love to hug you just so you know how great this product is. I am believer in MetaDerm Organic!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I tried ointments and creams all that said to heal eczema but it only got worse. Metaderm is the one product that began to help right away. It&#x27;s been a week and the itchy, flaking dry skin is almost gone. I apply it several times a day. Very thankful.</li>
            <li> Seems to be doing it;s job so far. I will give it the full 3 months and if it is still doing OK, order again.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this gave my 13yo son a rash.</li>
            <li> good effect, reduce itch, my baby love it, I will tell people I know, I will recommend it to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from a variety of odd small rashes or hot spots, probably due to stress... I can use this lotion for just a few days and most itchy spots clear up! It is very nice and I can even use it on my face (I have very sensitive skin) and it will ease any itchiness or discomfort in just a few days.  Slight smell, not bad, but definitely has a scent to it - otherwise it would get 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream for my 16 yr old niece who had suffered from eczema on her hands for YEARS, and was VERY self conscience about it.  She has gone to several Doctors, who had prescribed some strong steroids.  We went on a weekend trip and she was REALLY suffering!!  Applying the steroids and covering it with band&#x60;aids, which didn&#x27;t really help much.  I found this cream and the spray and thought,,,  it cant hurt to try it..  Well I have to say I called her a week after giving it to her and she could NOT say ENOUGH about IT !!  She said her hands were no longer cracked and burning,,  they were actually healing !!  What a fantastic product.  Now she only uses the cream once or twice a week before bed as a maintenance procedure :)  THANK YOU</li>
            <li> I have been using this product twice a day for four months now and I have yet to see any results.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I tried this product! Every winter I used to break out with a red bumpy itchy rash on my hands and forearms. I never really knew what caused the rash but always figured it was some sort of dermatitis or eczema. I tried all kinds of creams and ointments, and nothing really worked that well. I then tried MetaDerm - I used it as directed for two weeks and haven&#x27;t had the rash since! It has completely cleared up! I am amazed! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Last year I had eczema on my leg. It was bad and the inflammation was getting worse every day. Ulgy, itchy, painful blotches. It hurt to put clothes on. Nothing prescribed by the doctors worked. I tried prescription steroids, topical and oral. Over a few months period, doctors tried combinations of medications including antibiotics and steroids, several different kinds of antibiotics. I tried other over the counter remedies. Still it kept spreading. Then I found Metaderm. I started using it twice a day. Within weeks I noticed a difference. First it cooled the inflammation and stopped the itching, then I started noticing it was shrinking! Now it is as if the eczema was never there! I never write reviews on products, but I decided this was something I wanted to share. It works!!!! I have since used it on my grandkids for a bee sting, and for hives, and again it relieved the problem.</li>
            <li> Went to 2 different Dermatologists.  They did nothing.  I used this stuff and after 2-3 months the Eczema on my face was faded and nearly gone.  Same your money at the Dr. if you have hard to treat Eczema and go with this!</li>
            <li> My skin has been better since using this cream. I have been using it for 2 weeks and my skin looks much better. I can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin will look like in 10 more weeks.</li>
            <li> This product is really good I like it</li>
            <li> Wow, after trying to treat my 6 year old daughters eczema her whole life with little success I had my doubts about Metaderm. I should not have doubted! Everyone in our family is amazed at how much better her skin looks. It took her red, raw, raised patches of eczema and soothed and healed them so quickly! We have been using the product for 8 days and the rough, raised patches are smooth and her skin is almost back to it&#x27;s healthy olive coloring. If we have had this much success in 8 days I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does as the weeks go on! It made a believer out of me!&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note, there is no strong smells, dangerous chemicals or greasy feel which we have experienced with other treatments).</li>
            <li> This cream is light and creamy makes skin feel soft and smooth. I recommend it only to my closest friends.</li>
            <li> I gave my daughter in law a tube of the Metaderm moisturizing cream.  She suffers from Eczema and psoriasis on her hands, arms and legs.  Her hands were red, cracked, peeling and bleeding.  She used the product and on the SECOND DAY OF USE the redness was leaving her hands and the peeling and bleeding had stopped.  In a few more days the redness was completely gone and the cracked areas of her hands were healing up!  She has gone to the doctor for YEARS with these problems, tried various prescription drugs and over the counter products and NEVER received any relief.  This is the first product that has helped her.  She was amazed! not only with the results but how quickly the product worked.  She is a happy young lady!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> So far this cream is FANTASTIC STUFF, being diabetic I get these sore&#x27;s on my lower legs, all the creams the doctors give me have done nother to heal the sore&#x27;s, so far after day 3 of using this stuff there has been a major noticeable difference and my lower legs are starting to clear up very nicely and should be cleared up in another week or 2, just using it once a day after taking a shower, SERIOUSLY HAPPY AND CHEAPER THAN THE DOCTORS CREAMS!!!!</li>
            <li> Metaderm is an amazing product! The results are immediate! I have used it on my son and almost instantly he had relief. My son suffered from horrible eczema when we made switch from diapers to underwear and after using Metaderm the redness was almost immediately gone and he had no more pain and within a couple days there was no trace of any irritation at all! He randomly breaks out in hives and within minutes of using Metaderm he has relief from the itchiness and within minutes of that again there is no trace of any irritation at all! It has no smell and doesn&#x27;t burn like other products out there. I use it for any skin irritation that my kids or I have. You will not regret buying Metaderm, the results are incredible!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have eczema, but that lotion is the best lotion I&#x27;ve used on my face--ever!  I have adult acne--welcome to the world of middle-age female hormones--which means that I use a lot of chemicals, sometimes harsh, to keep it in check.  That often leads to dry, flakey skin and redness due to irritation.  This lotion tempers both of those issues without being greasy or creating more breakouts.  It is awesome.  My skin has become so much more healthy after only a couple weeks of use.</li>
            <li> My daughter suffered from this disorder since she was 6 months old. God opened the doors to this miracle cream and our lives have never been the same. My wife can breathe, my daughter can have a normal life and its is nothing other than a miracle. The staff at HAUS are miraculous angels!! Look up my wife&#x27;s testimonial on you tube. Lauri white to understand the true depths of our trials. Thank you Metaderm for giving us life without eczema.</li>
            <li> Love the MetaDerm.  It has cleared up a continuing problem with my hands. It took about a month, but started to help within a few days. Use it every day to keep it under control.  Have had the problem since I was ten, off and on, and it was horrible when I started using the MetaDerm.  Cracked and bleeding fingers. Will always keep it on hand.  Thanks for the great product!!</li>
            <li> I can only use baby eczema creams because adult creams burn and irritate my skin. This is just my experience with it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first application (horribly) burned my face, and the second application didn&#x27;t burn as much. It did clear some of my eczema after the first application. I kept trying to use it but it made my skin terribly dry. I did e-mail the company and Liz was really helpful. I&#x27;m gonna be sent a sample of the spray (it&#x27;s not as harsh, I believe.) to see it it works out. I was also told I was part of a small percentage that this happened too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say give it a try.</li>
            <li> I am only giving it two stars because of quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had Eczema growing up as a kid. Now that I am 25 years old, I just recently started to notice patches on my neck and elbows. My sister recommended Hydrocortisone 10 Eczema and it worked pretty well from me. However, I felt that there might be something stronger out there. I read various reviews on this site that generally gave MetaDerm a good review. Yes, I did read the headline for this product (85% success for product), unfortunately I&#x27;m part of the 15%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe Im giving up on the product 5 days after use, but its really made my skin worse. I itch more and the patches seem to have grown larger on my elbows. Like I said, I may be a part of that 15% that has zero success with the product. I did buy the \\&quot;Fast absorbing\\&quot; and not the \\&quot;Hyper-Moisturizing.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to give Hydro-moisturizing a try, but I can&#x27;t afford to spend more money on another product of the same brand. For now, I&#x27;ll be going back to my Hydrocortisone 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eczema sucks and I really do hope people find what works best for them. Hope my review helped.</li>
            <li> I get occasional eczema on my lower legs. I was looking for an alternative to steroid creams. This really helped clear my skin. It took several weeks to fully clear, but I could tell that it was working rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I have tried other creams over the counter and the cream my doctor prescribed, dried out my skin. This cream is the best and it works very well and does not dried out your skin at all. I would recommend this to anyone who suffers from eczema.</li>
            <li> i absolutly recommend this after so many years suffering wit eczema trying anything possible noting worked. this is the only thing that has worked my eczema has got so much better I love this stuff my skin is so much hidrated less inflamated and less itch it gets better each time!!! i actually start to think that my eczema can get to a cure people try it out u dont lose nothing!!👌💕💕💕☝</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!! We highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I bought  this for a friend whose eczema did not respond at all to prescription creams.  He was thrilled that it worked so well, so quickly. Made me a hero!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 20 year old daughter who has suffered from eczema since she was a toddler.  Lately the rash started to spread to new areas of her body, including her face, for the first time. Her skin was cracked and bleeding.  Even a cool shower would leave her so inflamed and itchy, she was in misery.  We&#x27;ve tried dozens and dozens of products and homeopathic remedies over the years.  Some offered temporary improvement, but the flareups would return.  To calm her latest outbreak, she tried a bleach bath.  (Sounds bizarre, but I read it about it on the Mayo Clinic site.)  That relieved the painful burning itch quite a bit.  The same day she started using Metaderm lotion, and she has seen great improvement.  The flareups are clearing, and her skin feels much softer than before.  She&#x27;s so excited that she can now wear sleeveless tops and skirts.  And she likes that it is organic ingredients and she doesn&#x27;t have to worry about the long term effects of steroid creams.  We just ordered the big 32 oz bottle.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty good. It has been amazing for the dryness of my Eczema. Having eczema for most of my life I have spent so much money and tried so many different things to help. This stuff is the only thing that has made a visible difference immediately in my skin!! It has not helped with the itching, I have pretty extreme eczema,  very large irritated patches so that could have something to do with it.  But just the difference it has made in the softness and smoothness of my skin is pretty unbelievable. I honestly thought it would never be that way again. This has been a miracle worker. If only it helped with the itching as well. I would def recommend this to anyone struggling with eczema or even just dry skin. This will not be one of the many products I use then discard because it doesn&#x27;t work. I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> I developed hand and foot eczema 3 years ago in my late 50&#x27;s. It got so bad my hands looked like I was in a fire. I couldn&#x27;t touch anything without white cotton gloves and holding a steering wheel was difficult.  The soles of my feet were so cracked, there were times I couldn&#x27;t walk. I&#x27;ve tried wet wraps, bleach baths, vinegar soaks and just about every steroid cream they make.  The wet wraps allowed me to walk in the morning but by the time I got home from work I was in tears.&lt;br /&gt;l&lt;br /&gt;My only option was a steroid shot.  This helped for about 5 weeks but it would return.  Eczema stopped me from attending many events as well as a trip to Disneyworld with my grandchildren and I could only get 2 shots a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every night I would search the web until midnight looking for SOMETHING to help.  I read reviews about Metaderm and decided to try it.  My skin was paper thin from the steroids and cut very easily.  This was organic and they sent me a free sample.  I started in the middle of August. Unlike some reviews I did not have immediate relief but continued to use it. My husband and I were going on vacation Sept. 21st to the Dominican.  I knew I would&#x27;nt be able to walk so I decided to get another shot. Of course it went away but I continued to use Metaderm.  It is now November 13th and the eczema has not returned.  I can only attribute this to Metderm.  My feet and hands have not looked or felt like this in 3 years. I did get a few little spots on my lefthand but it is about 1/100thof what it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I attribute my clear zkin to Metaderm. Everyday I get up and check my hands and feet by they have been virtually spotless.  Who would think an organic cream that costs about 1/5 of any steroid cream would have this kind of results.  I just ordered three more tubes and hope for the continued success.  If by christmas I&#x27;m still clear I will write another review.  All this suffering and this cream has given me a new lease on life.  THANKS Metaderm.</li>
            <li> My child has been having atopic eczema for 8 years now (primary areas are elbows, back of knees,  hands, wrists and feet). I have been applying MetaDem this week one time per day and I can confirm this cream definitely improves skin health and helps to relieve itching and reduce skin inflammation. So, MetaDem works great for us and I hope that I found remedy that can control of my child’s eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will most likely post an update after 10 weeks.</li>
            <li> I love this product because you get instant results regarding itchy skin. This product is a must have for dry and sensitive skin. Your skin feels smooth all day long.</li>
            <li> love love love it! The only product I have found that works for the terrible eczema I have on my face. No more raised red skin, no more cracking or oozing. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and my skin has gone down to just barely pinkish red skin. In a few more months I bet it will be gone. Works wonders!!</li>
            <li> I was born with eczema. I am now 29yrs old and have suffered from it forever. Now iv tried so many products and its weird whenever I find a good one. So I gave this lotion a tried but didnt see no difference. I actually find it super light warery and drying and it actually made me itch more.Probably worked for some people but not for me :(</li>
            <li> I work 1600 feet underground in an environment that really dry&#x27;s out your skin, this stuff is amazing and feels so good.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this my husband thought it was glue. I didn&#x27;t realize it at first but it does smell and have the consistency of glue! It didn&#x27;t prevent us from using it. Our son suffers from eczema and we have tried plenty of products. I read the reviews and thought we would give this a shot. I was looking for a product that didn&#x27;t have a bunch of harsh chemicals. I met an older woman a while back and she suffered from severe eczema and she was raving about hemp oil/hemp products for her condition. This was another reason I went with Metaderm. Overall, we are waiting to see results. I will say that in the 2 weeks we have used it I have noticed it improving. I am not going to jump to conclusions yet because like other products we have used they work well at first but over time the eczema comes back. I am hopeful and will give this product 12 weeks. We have been combining his treatment with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Hemp and Lavender soap. It might be the right combination, FINALLY! Good luck to all that suffer from eczema I know it is a tough one!</li>
            <li> So far using it about a week.  Results seem effective but slow at times...</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t really work as what the product says its suppose to do. so i just use it as hand lotion</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really help my eczema...I used this stuff as instructed..But I didn&#x27;t see much improvement. I understand that having Eczema is a fickle skin issue with episodic flareups and periods of calm, well behaved intact skin..  But this is a relatively expensive cream. It&#x27;s a large tube and will last a long time, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again...still looking for a cream that will actually allow moisture to be maintained on my areas of eczema. Organic coconut oil seems to do a better job for me.</li>
            <li> Two years ago, I developed eczema after a hiking trip in the desert.  I had severe eczema as a baby and mild eczema as a young child; I am now 63, and hadn&#x27;t had eczema in my adult life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After going to three different dermatologists, and trying several steroid creams, my eczema was getting worse, especially on my hands, which are exposed to detergents and hot water.  I was ready to go to another dermatologist and try another steroid, since the eczema was migrating from my legs and arms to my hands and chest.  I was miserable!  Out of desperation, I did an internet search for a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; lotion or herbs for eczema.  I found Metaderm on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks, and I am amazed at the results!  My eczema is clearing up.  I have found that when I&#x27;m cleaning or washing dishes, I have to wear latex gloves, because all detergents, even those without harsh chemical, and the hot water aggravate the eczema on my hands.  But the rest of my body and my hands are so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thank the company that makes this wonderful product.  I hope that more people who suffer from this condition find their way here and read the reviews.  I usually don&#x27;t review products, but in this case, I felt the need to share my experience for the benefit of others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also shared this information with my brother who has eczema on his hands.  He&#x27;s a surgeon and has to wash his hands frequently, so I&#x27;m hoping that this helps him, too.</li>
            <li> Okay. I do not write reviews often. I think I have written 3 maybe 4. I am one of the very few that contract eczema as an adult. It started with a bunch of what I like to call &amp;#34;hand pimples&amp;#34; when I am living in a hotel room for months at a time. Immediately I say &amp;#34;must be poison Ivy/oak/sumac. Because I must have been stupid and got into some. Go to the quick clinic and they say &amp;#34;Oh, yep that must be it!!&amp;#34; Get some steroid shots, some pills and I am on my way!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But like Die Hard, it came back....with a Vengeance. So now instead of all over my hands, its on my neck, stomach, backs of knees, and elbows. I say &amp;#34;Well S***, You must have been lazy and didn&#x27;t wash your jeans or something&amp;#34;. HELLLOOOO Quick Clinic. &amp;#34;Yep, poison Ivy, give me steroids&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Healed...for now&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it happens again. I go back to the quick clinic tell them I have been on steroids more or less for the past 2 months. Apparently this is bad. They will not treat me, tell me to go to a Dermatologist. So I pay unreal amounts of money to go. She takes a chunk of my skin (still have a scar btw). They determine its Eczema. Freaking Super.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the Dermatologist gives me this great list of things I have to change about my life such as:&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo: Johnson&#x27;s baby shampoo&lt;br /&gt;Soap: Cetaphill&lt;br /&gt;Laundry Detergent: All Free and Clear (Crazy Expensive)&lt;br /&gt;And all other kinds of stuff. Like I can&#x27;t wear polyester etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do all of this. Yet it still comes back. Horribly. I go to Amazon (Cause I think I am going to outsmart the doctor psssshhh Stupid)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get this stuff called Calmoseptine, Metaderm, etc. Basically I spent like 150 bucks on Eczema Treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Calmoseptine did WONDERS for the itching, and it seemed like it slowed the spread of my eczema (which is now all over my body). But as far as getting Calmoseptine off your skin and clothes its impossible. Well I ran out of it when I went to Denver and Eastern Colorado aka the driest place in the USA. Only had this stuff called &amp;#34;Metaderm&amp;#34; Which says 12 weeks to cure Eczema (Which is why I never used it...I want the quick fix!! Screw this stuff!!) So I put it on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Longer story less long. This stuff somehow works. I do not know how. I do not know why, I really do not care. But holy S***. I am without topical steroids, Elodil or whatever it is for the first time in a year. This stuff works better than steroids people. I cannot tell you how lucky I am to have found this. I have ordered it recurring monthly. I will order it forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got back from CO 6 days ago. Eczema was all over my arms, face, stomach, legs, and feet. I have been using this after I shower and before bed. My eczema is completely gone from my arms, face, and stomach. Its still on my legs and feet, because it was on there for like 6 months prior and never fully healed but for once...its healing. Give this stuff a shot people. It really changed my life. I CAN USE HEAD AND SHOULDERS AGAIN!!!astern Colorado aka the driest place in the USA.

            <li> After researching the ingredients and deciding to give it a try, I regret spending $$ on this product. We only used it once, but my 5 year old burst out in tears because it was burning her legs. Disappointed and will not be using it again.&lt;br /&gt;**edited** When I initially ordered, I almost didn&#x27;t because the reviews seemed too good to be true. Looking at the glowing 5 star reviews, most of them have been reviewed by people and this is the only product reviewed. This seems sketchy to me and I checked several other products that I was looking into and most people who tend to review items have several others that they also reviewed. :(</li>
            <li> As soon as I applied this to my skin it was just amazing.  I never felt so confident in my life.</li>
            <li> I used it for three nights and on the third night during sleep, I felt my face itchy and scratched and ended up with rash on my face. I stopped using it immidiately and my itchness was gone. I bought this after just checking out the decent review on here but I should&#x27;ve known better. You better think twice before purchasing no brand cream. It could be dangerous.</li>
            <li> Good product. The product does what it says it will do. I ordered one for me two months ago, had satisfying results, so I ordered one more for one of my relative.</li>
            <li> Helped with eczema that I have around my eyes and back of hands. Would recommend this to anyone having eczema related issues!</li>
            <li> This is great product! I could definitely feel the heal!</li>
            <li> I have eczema flares mostly on my hands, elbows and feet. I have used steroid creams for a number of years but with those I kept getting my eczema back during treatment and my skin got thin and damaged. I have tried various other prescription creams but without much success. My doctor recommended this metaderm cream. I only put it on my elbows because I didn&#x27;t want to run out. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference for about 20 days but after that I was surprised to see my skin start to clear up and then it became completely normal in only the area that I was putting the cream. I was shocked when I saw  the difference side by side and decided to get more of this cream for my hands and feet. I just wish they could add more quantity but it is surprising how well an organic product like this works. I found that this was a long used product in some countries but its recipe was kept as a hidden secret until now. I thought that was cool. I will update my review if I notice anything different.</li>
            <li> I was completely skeptical about the product......but have now seen it work wonders!  I do a lot of mission work and have taken this product into Sierra Leone Africa with great results.  In one case a young girl who had been scheduled for skin grafts was taken off that list due to her favorable response to treatment.  This product works.</li>
            <li> i really liked this product seems it works well but since i needed it for my entire body it didn&#x27;t even last a week also my eczema is extremely severe so it did not last more than an hour on my skin</li>
            <li> It calms eczema and makes skin look and feel healthy</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.  Started out well,  but by the second week I broke out in a worse rash. Read the ingredients and it has wax.  That doesn&#x27;t allow the skin to breathe and thus traps all of the pores and glands... not a plus for eczema.</li>
            <li> This has been a miracle cream for me.  This is the ONLY non-steroid cream that has actually worked on my severe eczema!  I have eczema on my hands and before using this cream I had to use steroid creams a few times a week to control the crazy itchiness and the terrible rashes on my hands.  And I&#x27;m talking about potent steroids, a weaker Desonide didn&#x27;t even work for me.  My hands were horrible and it was an embarrassment to have to shake someone&#x27;s hand, knowing how rough and scaly my hands were (I&#x27;m a woman so I&#x27;m supposed to have soft hands, right?).  I have tried other natural eczema creams and though they have worked on my kids, they never did a thing for me.  Until I discovered MeraDerm!  I have been using this cream for about 7 months now and it keeps my eczema and the uncontrollable itch under control.  I very occasionally use steroid cream to bring my skin back when the eczema starts to get really itchy but I&#x27;ve only had to use steroids a few time since starting this cream.  So once every 2 or 3 months!  A huge difference from 2 or 3 times a week!!  I use this quite often throughout the day, probably at least 5 times a day.  I notice a difference when I don&#x27;t use this as often.  My hands will start to get more itchy.  My skin on my hands is still not perfect but it is better than it&#x27;s been in years!  My eczema really flared up when I had my first child 4 years ago.  This has been such a lifesaver.  Those with severe eczema know how terrible it can be, the uncontrollable itching, the unsightly rashes, the pain from cracked and bleeding skin.  I also use this on my kids for any random rash that I see and it clears pretty much everything up in a day or two for them.  This started to heal my hands in a few weeks of using it at least a few times a day.  I am hooked and I hope this cream will never stop being produced!!  I also use the hyper-moisturizing cream from MetaDerm and it is more moisturizing but it sometimes flakes a little on my skin if I rub it in too much.  I bought the large bottle of hyper-moisturizing but will buy this regular one again when I go through the large bottle.</li>
            <li> great lotion but I don&#x27;t know about helping my eczema.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little small for the price. But I really like it and have noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cooling , refreshing and clean feeling. Stops itching and the need to scratch quickly. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I suffer from eczema so badly that I almost cry with the itching, going on line I found this cream and decided to try it, in a few days it was controlling the itch and also softening my extra dry skin.  I have now ordered my second batch, it is a little expensive, but I feel it is worth every penny. I will definitely keep using it.</li>
            <li> I have inflamed eczema due to some kind if allergen. Did not help it but was soothing on the dry skin when it is healing.</li>
            <li> Did wonders for clearing up my pompholyx eczema on my hands.  No more steroids finally.  I would recommend using it all 12 weeks.  Seriously for the price just give it a try.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t nearly as effective at killing my eczema as coconut oil based lotion or magnesium lotion, but was still a creamy lotion. It stung though.</li>
            <li> I bought the full line of MetaDerm products including the foaming cleanser, cream and spray. I was really hoping to find something non-steroidal that would work for me. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of products from other brands such as Aveeno, Cetaphil, Goldbond, Vaseline, etc. Sadly, this product is not for me, but the company will give you a full refund if you aren&#x27;t satisfied.    The initial feel of the product is pleasant, and quickly makes any present itch disappear. However, as the day goes on, even after reapplying the product, my skin would feel very dry, tight and irritated. I would feel the urge to flush the skin with lots of water (and I could feel the product washing off) and then reapply a moisturizer. After about a month, I couldn&#x27;t stand the products anymore and went back to my old moisturizer and non-soap cleanser which returned my skin back to square one. I figure I must be allergic to one or more of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using MetaDerm for more than a year now. I have red scaly and flaky skin on my face. It has a soothing effect, it stops the itch and help with the redness.</li>
            <li> I have had moderate eczema since I was a little girl.  Eventually it moved from my forearms to my hands in high school, moving into the severe category.  I have been through every cream, lotion and potion (prescription and non) and while prescribed steroid creams work initially, they have horrible side effects and stop responding after about a month or two.  I am always skeptical when I try something new, but you get so desperate that you&#x27;re willing to try anything for relief!  The backs of my hands were flaming red, burned, itched and swollen.  My finger tips were raw, laden with dysphrotic eczema and peeI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began MetaDerm Eczema Moisturizing Cream, along with their foaming hand soap 8 short days ago.  My hands are already halfway cleared!  I am exclusively using the foaming soap and no others...carrying it around with me everywhere I go.  Two days ago, I added the MetaDerm baby shampoo/wash, using for both body and hair during showering.  My skin no longer itches when I exit the shower, and my scalp is finally itch-free as well!  The swelling and redness is gone from the backs of my hands, and has reduced to hardly anything on my finger tips.  I am not yet completely healed, but after just 8 short days, I have every belief that they will completely clear in a couple more weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MetaDerm...Thank you from the bottom of my heart for dedicating the time and energy it took to develop this product.  You guys really have something here and I will forever be a customer!  It is an amazing feeling to have my life back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have eczema, this product is WELL worth the small price.  Purchase the foaming hand wash with it as well if eczema is on your hands.  If it&#x27;s on your body or scalp, purchase the baby shampoo/wash.  I hope that eczema sufferers will give MetaDerm a chance, it is time and money well spent!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Works great! Thick and not greasy! My family and I love this especially in the cold dry winter weather.</li>
            <li> I got this for the eczema on my face because it was getting out of hand. When I purchased the cream I had dry red patches of skin and discoloration on my cheeks and around my mouth. Ive been using this cream for about a month, and I can already see an improvement on my discoloration. My eczema is now so much better, but will need a bit more time to &amp;#34;heal&amp;#34;. So far this had worked far better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but this product deserves one. I am in love with the consistency of this lotion. I have EXTREMELY dry skin. This last winter in Michigan has ruined my skin. For the last 2 months, I have been battling red/flaky eyelids. I had literally tried everything from Eucerin to Cerva Ve. Nothing worked well enough for me and didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling gross/oily. This is the best lotion I have ever used. Feels thick but not greasy or oily and quickly sinks into skin. This fixed my eyelids along with every other trace of eczema I have on my body in less than 4 weeks. I put this on in the morning before I apply my makeup and have never had problem with it making me look caked. If you are looking for a high quality perfect moisturizer, this is what I will be recommending to everyone I know with eczema like myself.</li>
            <li> My husband has a heat rash on his back year round, this eczema cream really seemed to make it better. Thanks</li>
            <li> Even though I don&#x27;t have eczema, I&#x27;ve had facial redness for years and have been looking for something mild for my sensitive skin to help. Lately I&#x27;ve also had issues with flaky skin, so I thought I might as well try this. I&#x27;m so glad I did, because it seems to be helping with both the redness and flakiness which have improved noticeably in one week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit thick and sticky, but it actually hasn&#x27;t clogged my pores and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with breakouts (yet, at least). I apply it at night and in the morning, and because of the consistency combined with my skin&#x27;s tendency to be oily (yet flaky in some spots... it&#x27;s annoying) means that I need to wear finishing powder with any foundation, even mattifying foundation. So, a little goes a long way and it&#x27;s worth massaging it in well to avoid a sort of slimy look, if your skin tends to do that like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I would still definitely recommend anyone with dry skin, sensitive skin, or eczema give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend people at least give this a try.</li>
            <li> Great product ! really helped the eczema close to eye area .</li>
            <li> Thank goodness&lt;br /&gt;No parabens !!!!&lt;br /&gt;Still using but really liking results so far!</li>
            <li> I got this cream for my daughter, who has had eczema since she was a baby. It worked beautifully to clear up her dry patches, and there was none of the stinging that usually comes with treatment. On another great note, I started using the cream as a facial moisturizer at night and in the morning, and it&#x27;s perfect under makeup - very light and not at all greasy. Love it!</li>
            <li> I find it works best with a cortisone cream. It takes a long time to work. My eczema break outs are really bad. This calmed the itch allowing my skin to heal. I am satisfied and will try other products as well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is beyond amazing. My son is three and has had severe eczema his entire life. Steroid ointments, lotions,essential oils, nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this only one time, we noticed a huge difference the next day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can sting sensitive and dry skin. To get around this, apply immediately after a bath, and never on dry skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion really has helped with my eczema.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and I can see an improvement.</li>
            <li> The only I can say is, it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li> First off, I was very impressed by the large samples I received. I&#x27;ve been using this cream and spray for almost 2 weeks- it&#x27;s awesome!  I have seborrheic dermatitis on my face and dry skin, the flaking is impossible to control.  This is the first product that actually absorbs into my skin! I&#x27;ve never been able to put on makeup over any moisturizer as my skin will flake off, but with this product I can. Normally my skin gets very red and irritated with any moisturizer, and it doesn&#x27;t with this. I did notice that if I use to much (as I was very excited about it), my skin will get a little red. So, I&#x27;ve started alternating between the cream and the spray- seems to work:)  I will be a life long customer.  UPDATE: Still love this cream. The only moisturizer I can use under makeup and on my neck.  I have also been using tallow/olive oil cream for a couple years, and I put Metaderm over the top at night to seal in the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love the cream, soothing and organic.  I have found the cause of my eczema is a food intolerance, but relieving the terrible itch and pain in the healing process was critical and this cream was helpful.</li>
            <li> didnt work, made my ecza itch more. I don&#x27;t trust all the non-amazon and some amazon verified reviews. It seems redundant and prob company workers</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous!!!! I give it a 10!</li>
            <li> This cream has worked very well and is very gentle.  I have tried many products over the years without much success in solving my winter eczema (on my eyelids around my nose, etc.) and I have been more than pleased with this products results.  I try to use natural skincare products, and this has some really lovely ingredients, This isn&#x27;t overly greasy, it absorbs well and allows my skin to heal.  Also, I am a vegetarian and this does not contain animal products (I wrote to them and they responded).</li>
            <li> I bought this 3 months ago and it hasn&#x27;t really helped me :/ if i put it on when my eczema is flared up, i get a burning sensation and have to wash my hands off.</li>
            <li> Before i bought this i had dry patches on my cheek and chin, and putting cover up over it just looked even worse! like many i&#x27;ve tried basically everything in Walgreens for dry skin/eczema. I&#x27;m so glad i bought this, i noticed a difference the next day my face wasn&#x27;t so red, and the dry skin was healing. I apply it in the morning and before bed, I don&#x27;t even have to use cover up anymore just a light mineral foundation and i&#x27;m good to go, this stuff is awesome sauce.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;m as itchy as ever. The lotions also clumps up all over your skin.</li>
