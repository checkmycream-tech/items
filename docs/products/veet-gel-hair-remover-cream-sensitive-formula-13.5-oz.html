            <li>The bottle I purchased said it was great for legs, body, bikini area, etc.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s great for when I don&#x27;t have time to wax or in between waxes.</li>
            <li>Product works great, but the plastic razor they give you is garbage.  </li>
            <li>I had great results.</li>
            <li>I used it on both the bikini area and legs, and had great results.</li>

            <li>I was eager to try this, because i&#x27;ve tried waxing and shaving and thought this would be good to try.</li>
            <li>Why would anyone shave when this wonderful product is available.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good produce.</li>
            <li>Good for men too.  </li>
            <li>Good product for hair removal, non-irritating.  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin and allergies-</li>
            <li>It does take a good 30 minutes if you do one leg at a time between application/waiting/rinsing.</li>
            <li>it makes me fell so good</li>
            <li>Good and satisfactory.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had good luck with hair removers.</li>
            <li>Also surprisingly the smell is not too nauseous</li>
            <li>Amazing, and will be ordering more!!</li>
            <li>Works great and it is very easy to use with the built in pump.</li>
            <li>It works and best thing is that is not bad on the SKin</li>

            <li>The first couple I LOVED it!!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this!</li>
            <li>Hair remover cream is so much better than shaving!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>this is perfect if you are a first time shaver or along time shaver.</li>
            <li>Love this cream!</li>
            <li>NAIR is better than this!</li>
            <li>Works like magic!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to have this on amazon and a subscribe and save!</li>
            <li>My skin feels so Smooth, and looks beautiful aswell.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have very good success with this product.</li>
            <li>This stuff works amazingly for me.</li>
            <li>works great legs and every thing i  use it on is smooth</li>
            <li>)I was looking for one of those 10-20 dollar razors,but the one I wanted based on amazing reviews was not in stock</li>
            <li>but this was absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>Works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing for me</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>the directions said and it worked amazingly.</li>
            <li>It’s amazing.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>I even would have considered grabbing one of my abundant icicles, snapping off the tip and placing it where it would do the most good.  </li>
            <li>and/or razor burn, no matter what kind of razor I use.  </li>
            <li>THEN I WASHED IT OFF IN THE TUB WITH WARM WATER AND LOOKED.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best hair remover.</li>
            <li>Does anyone click on &amp;#34;really liked it&amp;#34; for a product that is a corrosive chemical designed to burn hair from our bodies and smell like someone holding a lighter to a pile of hair?</li>
            <li>Try for your own results.</li>
            <li>There are so many good things about this product.  </li>
            <li>the shipping was fast and it was packaged ideally!</li>
            <li>And my legs feel sooo nice afterwards.</li>
            <li>so kind of defeated the purpose</li>
            <li>Would I purchase again honestly I wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I suggest you use some kind of petroleum based oil ... or just petroleum jelly around the hairline to protect your skin.</li>
            <li>Honestly, if it worked to remove hair I might have powered through the skin destruction.</li>
            <li>Using it on your legs uses up a lot each use, and it would be nice not having to reorder as often as I do now.</li>
            <li>Its good much better than a razor.</li>
            <li>The tool it came with is handy.</li>
            <li>Rinse with warm water in a bathtub - DO NOT USE SOAP.</li>
            <li>No amount of exfoliating stuff or lotion has made that skin look nice in years.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve kind of kept in my mind that maybe a hair removing lotion is what we&#x27;d be looking at someday.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel like if the razors lasted me longer if I&#x27;m honest.</li>
            <li>This product was nice while using.</li>
            <li>it four stars because the scraper you use to remove the hair is a nice idea,</li>
            <li>it is convenient to use and it is effective.</li>
            <li>It is a quick &amp; easy approach to removing body hair, but I find that I have to use Veet almost as often as I would with shaving...not impressed.</li>
            <li>Best way to use it is i strip naked before going in the shower, apply it to the designated area (use good amount).</li>
            <li>Does have a strong chemical smell though so you need to scrub good after use to get rid of the smell.</li>
            <li>RIGHT AFTER APPLYING VEET!!!</li>
            <li>I liked Veet better than Nair.  </li>
            <li>This would have provided wonderful, albeit temporary relief to my sensitive areas to the detriment of increasing the level of the water table in my neighborhood.  </li>
            <li>If you answered &#x27;yes&#x27; to these answers then this product might be suitable for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had better results using a warm, damp washcloth.</li>
            <li>With this, I was able to go 4 days without having to shave, so I was thrilled.</li>
            <li>This product is by far one of the best.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s more of my own fault and not the product.</li>
            <li>have extremely sensitive skin, but this product works great for me!</li>
            <li>The best product for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>like the large size, and good lord is the pump-style of the bottle convenient (about time, depilatory creams!).  </li>
            <li>and it worked great, came right off and no burning or itching.</li>
            <li>If you have very fine hair...</li>
            <li>Great volume for this price, it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I did my legs first and everything went great.</li>
            <li>First try it was great, all the hair was removed.</li>
            <li>Works great and fast!</li>
            <li>Very good, I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My legs were very smooth after using this product.</li>
            <li>On the upside, it worked very nicely on my legs, they are super smooth with no signs of irritation.</li>
            <li>just okay.</li>
            <li>Within a minute of application in my more nether regions, I abandoned hope of ever reproducing.  </li>
            <li>I buy this from Wal-Mart and I love it....</li>
            <li>But I really love the product....</li>
            <li>i RINSED IT IN THE SINK AND CONTINUED UNTIL MOST OF THE VEET WAS GONE.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use many nair/veet type products</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough about how wonderful this stuff works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure the results vary from person-to-person.</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY LOVE</li>
            <li>This veet cream works okay on your arms and legs.</li>
            <li>Make sure to test it everywhere</li>
            <li>and I was impressed to see how well the hair actually came off.</li>
            <li>There I was, in Walgreens hoping to find something magical.</li>
            <li>I really love this,I even threw away my razor.</li>
            <li>In shower hair removal is way better and alot faster.</li>
            <li>It works though that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>I also used gloves,so I would not have to worry about making sure the product was off my hands.</li>
            <li>works better than shaving</li>
            <li>Great product that works very well for my needs.</li>
            <li>Most of the time it does get quite a bit of the hair but it doesn&#x27;t get all of it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It is all that I use now and simply love it and the results.</li>
            <li>And it has managed to make the hair follicles on my legs more defined and noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i love most is the cost effectiveness of this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cannot comment on the effectiveness on more \\&quot;delicate\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I have the most obnoxious hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Finally, it works wonderfully!  </li>
            <li>This hair remover is ok.</li>
            <li>Shaving might just be a better option.</li>
            <li>It did work for me on the bikini area where a had more and longer hair</li>
            <li>but overall I wasn&#x27;t too impressed.</li>
            <li>I love veet</li>
            <li>Just do not leave it for more then 10 minutes</li>
            <li>Just make sure to moisturize after.</li>
            <li>For my legs, it feels 10x better than shaving.</li>
            <li>If you want a nice a smooth wherever you are using it, look somewhere else.</li>
            <li>A better scraper would have gotten this product 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I love love love this product.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be better then it is.</li>
            <li>It did an ok job on my hands.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s proving to be much more.</li>
            <li>Better than nair with argan oil</li>
            <li>Works very well, removed a great amount of hair.</li>
            <li>I also enjoyed using the waiting time to let the hair conditioner penetrate my hair.  </li>
            <li>Safe.</li>
            <li>Did it get rid of the hair, sure did----along with layers of skin.</li>
            <li>I have used this product and love it.</li>
            <li>Shave or wax, or better yet get</li>
            <li>Took most of the hair off, but not all...</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I like using the spatula to get most of the cream off</li>
            <li>I think it works better.</li>
            <li>so make sure time yourself while applying this...</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>Thanks and happy shopping.</li>
            <li>this stuff really works great.</li>
            <li>i will be ordering more of this &amp; this will be a socking stuffer at christmas.</li>
            <li>but it can remove most of it.</li>
            <li>It removed most of the hair from my legs, but not quite all of it.</li>
            <li>7 minutes removed most of my chin and neck hair.</li>
            <li>I save MORE</li>
            <li>I found this was much more convenient than shaving</li>
            <li>I actually bought mine from CVS for a bit more, but it&#x27;s amazing!!!</li>
            <li>I love Veet.</li>
            <li>(Because that&#x27;s so much better than the hair....?)</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>(maybe even 8) minutes instead of 5-6.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>But it worked perfectly on areas where the hair is finer - my belly, lower back, and arms.</li>
            <li>So I reapplied the cream the next day for best result..</li>
            <li>but I think that&#x27;s more user error than the cream itself.</li>
            <li>Sure.  </li>
            <li>I waited another hour just to make sure and then tested it on her.  </li>
            <li>I also love the plastic scraper.</li>
            <li>okay results, better than my lower legs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update my review if I get better results.</li>
            <li>It removed slightly more hair and again, I had no side effects.</li>
            <li>I tried it again yesterday with the max time and more hair was removed this time, but not all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is more time consuming than shaving, but it does leave my legs smoother, so I am satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Buy this you will love it.</li>
            <li>This is so much better than the Nair product that i tried.  </li>
            <li>But if you aren&#x27;t confident, do not try.</li>
            <li>If you have fair or sensitive skin, even if your body hair is fair &amp; fine... I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li>Its one of the best quality, like it a lot, lasts long time and it doesnt give me a rush</li>
            <li>Veet works beautifully and it does not irritate or cause issues with my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am so excited about this stuff!</li>
            <li>It does the job quickly and effectively.</li>
            <li>many time does not burn my skin like nair does, no hair bumps, and works well on strong hair,</li>
            <li>Goes on easy - smells OK.</li>
            <li>Quickly hop in the shower and use the spatula to remove it from your body and once you&#x27;ve use the spatula on the area just rinse with water, warm will do the trick.</li>
            <li>this is a safe and easy way to remove hair.</li>
            <li>No bad smell, easy to use, effective.</li>
            <li>worked wonders on my leg hair; the most fine of my body hair.</li>
            <li>I love this because I feel like it works the best out of any other cream removals.</li>
            <li>The sensitive skin formula is great</li>
            <li>There were patches of smooth skin, but many areas that still had hair.</li>
            <li>No cuts, roughness or anything, just smooth and sexy legs.</li>
            <li>My legs are more moisturized, smooth,</li>
            <li>Since it said sensitive I used it on my face, it didn&#x27;t burn it and worked great.  </li>
            <li>You also do not have to apply much of the cream for the optimum hair removal.</li>
            <li>and it works fast and is a good alternative to shaving.</li>
            <li>Good, does its job..wayy easier and sensitive on the skin than shaving, but make sure you follow directions and not leave it on for more than 10mins.</li>
            <li>Use it for the full 10 minutes and any undesirable hair will be gone!</li>
            <li>it works great on the arm pitts as well so smooth so soft no hair</li>
            <li>Makes hair removal easy.</li>
            <li>Its easy.</li>
            <li>so it comes off easily.</li>
            <li>I feel so clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>It does wonders and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Directions easy to follow</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, does not drip.</li>
            <li>I also think that having the hair follicles softened by steam probably helped the hair come off easily.  </li>
            <li>No pain and easy.</li>
            <li>its so easy to just jump in the shower when it&#x27;s time to wash this off.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really easy for me to get razor burn.</li>
            <li>and it was easy to remove.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong odor though but that can be overlooked if it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>People like to complain about the smell, but the smell is just like loation, not anything too strong or offensive.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong smell as you are using it</li>
            <li>It seems to me this isn&#x27;t as strong as the Neet</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt or burn at all, it just has this strong chemical smell, so I would recommend just showering afterward</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for an alternative to shaving because I strongly dislike shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Applied and whipped off with a hot warm rag.  </li>
            <li>I waited exactly 5 minutes and wiped it off with a warm washcloth and by God...</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just fine for</li>
            <li>Even for your legs and the rest of your body, it works great and pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I have to shave every two days, but I can use this once a week and be fine.</li>
            <li>This is easy to apply and relatively cheap.</li>
            <li>and what I have is fine.  </li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>and yes I&#x27;m gay</li>
            <li>So I just used a cloth and that seemed to do the job just fine.</li>
            <li>I do, however, have fine, blond hair and that may make it easier to remove.</li>
            <li>This, when uses appropriately and not too long on your skin, is great.</li>
            <li>stuff if easy and leaves my legs smooth for days!&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I first saw the commercial I ran to the store thinking, This is the greatest thing ever!</li>
            <li>Much more effort than a quick shave in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works quickly and no irritation!</li>
            <li>if it&#x27;s a huge hassle, and I have to shave anyway.</li>
            <li>So that is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m left smooth and happy.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>WASN&#x27;T ANY HAIR AND MY SKIN FELT SO SMOOTH AND SILKY.THIS IS MY ANSWER TO SMOOTH SILKY SKIN WITHOUT SHAVING.</li>
            <li>hairs were longer, some were shorter, in NO way did this product give me that smooth skin it promised.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Use a warm wash rag and six minutes is really all you need.</li>
            <li>I swim and having smooth legs</li>
            <li>I liked this so much</li>
            <li>I removed as much as I can, I rinsed the rest with warm water in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>was a simple, painless and great experience.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of trusting it to make my legs smooth and my legs still felt prickly after.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bikini was a total win.</li>
            <li>Removes every hair no rash or burn like a baby skin smooth</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe after another use or two, it will all be smooth.  </li>
            <li>I also enjoy the smooth of kg wife&#x27;s legs</li>
            <li>it leaves you silky smooth.</li>
            <li>This worked AMAZING on my legs, so much smoother than shaving and without all of the razor burn.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t leave me silky smooth, or anything.</li>
            <li>My skin was smooth and there was no irritation afterwards.</li>
            <li>A worry free weekend at the beach with smooth silky tan legs.</li>
            <li>shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy using this product it beats shaving any day.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t feel a burn during or after use and the results are ridiculously smooth and works well no matter</li>
            <li>, the formula is smooth, it hydrates my skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate it either.</li>
            <li>Some places on my legs were smooth and others looked like they hadn&#x27;t been touched.</li>
            <li>I find that Veet is both gentle and effective for all of my hair removal needs.</li>
            <li>Although I prefer to use an exfoliating mitt than the bladeless razor, this product leaves me baby smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anywho, if you don&#x27;t like pain, not a fan of body hair, and like cheap pricing, this is the way to go</li>
            <li>The last bottle I got worked great.</li>
            <li>I get smooth legs and</li>
            <li>But what it did remove seems smooth</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin really, really smooth afterwards as well.</li>
            <li>Keeps me smooth for about 3 days longer compared to shaving.</li>
            <li>Smooth skin and no irritation...</li>
            <li>Hair&lt;br /&gt;regrowth is slower and makes your skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li>It is obviously a fantastic exfoliator.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom for 48 hours.</li>
            <li>It was available for about $6 at Target, and I had a $2 coupon as well as a Target Cartwheel for 20% off, so why not?  </li>
            <li>Fortunately after about 10 minutes, it cleared/went away.</li>
            <li>Where it did work it came out really smooth, but</li>
            <li>I tried Veet a couple of weeks before my appointment and my arms stayed smooth and hair free for a week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that my legs stay hairless for the same amount of time a good shape would, maybe one day more.</li>
            <li>: Works great on longer hair, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin (even on the bikini line), and washes off pretty easily.</li>
            <li>I was able to was my skin with soap right after applying and no irritation.</li>
            <li>Cheap, easy on our skin and quick.  </li>
            <li>This was easy to use and quick.  </li>
            <li>Quick, easy, clean, and cheap.</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned with naturally dark hair</li>
            <li>It has a strong flowery chemical smell, but it&#x27;s not terrible (much improved from 10 years ago).</li>
            <li>After the first use, it felt better.</li>
            <li>I noticed that birds no longer sang in any of the trees around my castle, and the once familiar bees were swarming as one into the flames of our industrial boiler.  </li>
            <li>First time using it today, applied while wearing a latex glove to avoid touching it with my hands (contact lens wearer</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>but it was worth it!</li>
            <li>(not over the top, more like I got sunburn) , but to top it all off there was a lot of hair left.</li>
            <li>Fast, easy, and no irritation!</li>
            <li>I must say that the product is quite effective, as the hair was rather thoroughly removed, along with several layers of skin and most of my dignity.  </li>
            <li>You are betteroff using Nair if you want super smooth legs.</li>
            <li>I put it on for the max time  (10 mins) and there was no pain and the result was super baby butt smooth.  </li>
            <li>my sister said this product is the best remover cream, especially when you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s safe enough that you can rinse yourself in the shower or bath with warm water.  </li>
            <li>This Veet is so much better then the &amp;#34;Veet in shower cr&amp;egrave;me sensitive formula&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;Nair hair removal lotion&amp;#34; on so many levels.</li>
            <li>When you follow the directions as instructed its easy and even a bit fun to use.</li>
            <li>For underarms I had to leave the product on for 9 minutes to get good removal action; when I tried just 5 minutes it wasn&#x27;t so useful.  </li>
            <li>The spatula that comes with it is a great tool for getting rid of every single hair.</li>
            <li>Veet is the best, least likely to burn you, hair cream on the market, and this is the best Veet option if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Worked okay on certain spots, still had to shave after</li>
            <li>After I apply it, and wait forever, when i take it off (WITH the special remover thing) not all the hair is gone, and it ALL leaves stubble</li>
            <li>so I can wash it right away and the smell goes away!</li>
            <li>AND IT WAS FULL OF HAIR.</li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She tried it last weekend and loved it.  </li>
            <li>It works just as good as the regular formula.  </li>
            <li>I have to leave it on for the full 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>so I thought I&#x27;d try this while it was on sale because my legs are usually full of razor bumps and cuts since I shave so often.</li>
            <li>I tested on my legs and lady bits without any irritation, so I decided to go fo full on hair removal.</li>
            <li>So far, the soothing Neosporin with pain reliever in it is helping nicely.</li>
            <li>I leave it on for the full time</li>
            <li>Washed with soap and water then used finishing cream to cool skin.  </li>
            <li>This time when I scraped it off it actually seemed like it worked fairly well.</li>
            <li>It is literally a dream come true.</li>
            <li>I have given this product multiple chances and still have not seen good results.</li>
            <li>The smell for Veet is not bad at all.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take very much meticulousness, so if you want easy...</li>
            <li>but it reminds me of the smell of Nair just not so strong, and even after a shower it kind of left that chemical stench on my leg.&lt;br /&gt;Now for what its \\&quot;supposed\\&quot; to do...</li>
            <li>It takes care of any hairs that don&#x27;t come off easily the first time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this product would&#x27;ve worked just fine if it wasn&#x27;t 3 years old.</li>
            <li>I am extremely impressed with this product and will likely purchase it again in the future.</li>
            <li>so I was super nervous about using anything else.</li>
            <li>I used to have my legs waxed which works wonderfully but is much more expensive.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting sooo much more from this product, however it is the same if you shave (messier and more</li>
            <li>I was super nervous so iw arched a video</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome, works long term, and although it&#x27;s a pain, so is everything else, it is pretty goopy, but it totally allows me to be smooth and hair free where I desire.</li>
            <li>(Not recommended for the meek and mild)</li>
            <li>Works well and quickly.  </li>
            <li>It all came off in clumps and quickly.</li>
            <li>It was quick and it was painless.</li>
            <li>over all good, worth the money.i will give only four star for this product.</li>
            <li>My daughter is a pre teen and this would be perfect for her instead of actually shaving.</li>
            <li>My hair grows quickly</li>
            <li>Very effective and doesn&#x27;t burn skin like other products did.</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands that caused a lot of irritation, but this brand and formula (sensitive) is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very crisp, curly, and often standing on end.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin very smooth and really soft and it lasts a lot longer than shaving!</li>
            <li>It works great and the smell doesn&#x27;t knock you down when you use it.</li>
            <li>It works fairly well as long as you follow the directions, I&#x27;ve used it numerous time with pretty good results.</li>
            <li>and I still don&#x27;t see new growth after 3 days:)</li>
            <li>It works very well but the smell is just to strong and sticks around even after i&#x27;ve taken a shower and washed the towels.  </li>
            <li>Treated it with Veet and now, 3 days later, my leg is still shiny and soft and beautiful without any use of lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>I was so excited and missed that the first time.</li>
            <li>Make sure the area you put it on doesn&#x27;t come in contact with any other parts of your body, doing one leg before the other is best.</li>
            <li>i tried doing a brazilian with this product and it worked out pretty well!</li>
            <li>Have used this stuff for years with no problems and no weird reactions!</li>
            <li>My wife simply cannot live without this product, the fact that this seller has it at a great price and prompt shipping is a plus for me zag the end of the day</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling very smooth and soft, and hair growth seems to be slower in comparison to shaving.</li>
            <li>Does the job very thoroughly and quickly!  </li>
            <li>BUT WHEN I PUT THIS ON THICK IN THE BIKINI AREA AND UNDER ARMS, I WAS PLEASANTLY SUPRISED!</li>
            <li>The Veet cleaned off most of the fine, blonde hair.</li>
            <li>It comes with a little spreader/remover thingie that is wonderful, and it helps you spread in areas that you need to be careful :)</li>
            <li>The hair on my legs is very scant and light</li>
            <li>The only problem is that you have to apply it more than once in order make your skin smooth.</li>
            <li>It was faster than shaving and left my skin nice and smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not expect this but for what it&#x27;s worth, the stink makes sense and is highly worth the convenience this product holds over shaving.</li>
            <li>However, the outcome is worth it.  </li>
            <li>The sensitive formula was good but it doesn&#x27;t do a good job at getting all the hair (specially thick hair).</li>
            <li>It says on the bottle not to leave it onfor more then 10 minutes, but even if you have it on for 10 minutes it doesnt completely get rid of the hair.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t think the results were worth the discomfort.</li>
            <li>For around $7, it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>Left it on for 5 minutes then jumped in the shower with warm water, all hair came off.</li>
            <li>Okay here is the reason why I bought this and my experience so far on this</li>
            <li>Yeah, that&#x27;s the part that made me nervous, but the beauty bar blocks any odor and leaves you smelling powder fresh all day(great alternative to deodorant, but I still prefer deodorant anyday).</li>
            <li>Unless you are actually allergic to the cream (read directions), it is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It sat next to the six remaining cases of Veet and with rolling eyes began to tear off its own flesh in a methodical yet detached manner.  </li>
            <li>Suggest that you trim pretty good in that area first prior to applying.  </li>
            <li>The smell is really nice - some essential oil, lavender maybe?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably about the same thing honestly.</li>
            <li>I got my moneys worth</li>
            <li>First, it is easy to dispense thanks to the pump design of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Other than that good product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the product leave my skin smooth, soft and bump free, and is pretty affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My arm hair came right off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hair came right off.</li>
            <li>right after</li>
            <li>shaving just isn&#x27;t an option for her right</li>
            <li>Hair came right off.  </li>
            <li>this one sizzled it right off</li>
            <li>right after using the Veet.</li>
            <li>The hair came right off</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll want to leave the bathroom fan running and throw your washcloth in the laundry right away.</li>
            <li>I took a shower right after using the cream and after my shower the smell was lighter but still there.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I rinsed the cream off from this area right away.</li>
            <li>If you can get past all that than sure, but honestly save your money.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best I tried several versions and brands.</li>
            <li>I received this product in the mail, scared and excited I first preformed a test trial to make sure I did not end up with 3rd degree</li>
            <li>I have really senitive skin and break out from everything, so this is true to its claim because it does not cause any reaction to my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll smell pretty foul while doing this, but it&#x27;ll be worth it.</li>
            <li>Dropped one star because it&#x27;s messy and definitely doesn&#x27;t smell the greatest, but it&#x27;s worth it without a doubt.</li>
            <li>To rinse, I sat on the side of the bathtub with warm water running, but not directly on my legs.</li>
            <li>And  would certainly recommend it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a brief stay in the hospital, I am delighted to report I am nearly completely recovered.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely 0 irritation, although I took a shower immediately after (started with just barely warm water to not open pores until it was washed off).</li>
            <li>but it turns out that it mostly works when there is a lot of hair on the area you want to clear; and I don&#x27;t like to wait and have very hairy legs before I take it out.</li>
            <li>I cannot shave the senitive areas because my skin is just too sensitive and gets irritated easily with shaving.</li>
            <li>My once proud cervical massager retracted with such velocity that it reappeared through my rear gunner only to detach from my body and hiss downwards like a doomed U boat into the unforgiving cream from hell.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle formula that doesn&#x27;t irritate my penile parts area while manscaping.</li>
            <li>I have blonde hair and very light skin.</li>
            <li>and I must say it works very very very well.</li>
            <li>Some areas of my legs are very smooth, some small patches look untreated (mostly the backs of my thighs), and some don&#x27;t have visible hair but feel stubbly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And while she functions at about a 10 year old level, she is very aware of what her peers are doing and recently wants to follow the social norms, which is amazing for us.  </li>
            <li>Leaves stubble, although it did remove most of my coarse hair.</li>
            <li>This stuff works pretty well for me.  </li>
            <li>However you have to follow the directions exactly.</li>
            <li>Waited exactly 5 minutes</li>
            <li>and she said I should have talked to her first</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, timed exactly to five minutes, it did nothing.</li>
            <li>So I waited two more days, then applied the product thicker and waited exactly ten minutes.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it&#x27;ll do.</li>
            <li>The smell is more tolerable than the regular formula.</li>
            <li>did my air pits first.</li>
            <li>First time I used a cream hair remover.</li>
            <li>you just use it, your skin is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I think Veet as a company has thoroughly tried to come up with a scent to make the overall smell more bearable, and</li>
            <li>really do recommend this product!</li>
            <li>* first....</li>
            <li>I just used it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>It worked without burning or irritation and skin was smooth and soft, but I used a lot of it.</li>
            <li>and i am often quiet satisfied after each use.</li>
            <li>Not even sure why it only affected one part of one of my legs.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t work very well at all!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it say, follow the instructions, but be cautious of your skin reaction.</li>
            <li>I used exactly as directed, and it is the &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; product.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to open windows and ventilate your bathroom or it will stink up the house all week.</li>
            <li>Not even 1 second more.</li>
            <li>It leave my skin feeling silky smooth, and soft...</li>
            <li>First of all, it does not get rid of hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying more of these later on</li>
            <li>I recommend you use this while the hot water is running (not while you&#x27;re inside)</li>
            <li>I was pretty conservative and i still shudder at the thought of trying this again.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly I am looking for which  let me wear tank tops, dresses during in summer time.</li>
            <li>exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>this product was a first for me.</li>
            <li>first placed a spot of the product on a hairy area of my body for five minutes, the recommended minimum amount of time.</li>
            <li>I can deal with the smell, and the second time I used it I got more hair off than the first time.</li>
            <li>I love this product, and wish I would only have to do it once!</li>
            <li>The formula doesn&#x27;t bother my skin but after using the spatula it is more tender and shows a couple red spots.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much just like shaving, but more messy and more of a time waster.</li>
            <li>Hair stayed gone for 2 weeks and when it grew back was thinner and more sparse.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin really smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>While it can be used to remove the cream as well, something more textured (such as a washcloth) will grab hairs that are not quite detached.</li>
            <li>Every muscle in my body went into acute spasm and my mouth let forth a silent scream of such torment that trees shed their bark in a bizarre defensive reaction.  </li>
            <li>See which did better or enough.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I am even able to rub it into the patches without further irriation.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time trying it</li>
            <li>for sensitive skin helps keep my legs and underarms smooth.</li>
            <li>so finding a product that works on my sensitive skin is important.</li>
            <li>After the ten minuets the scrapper took off the cream along with most of the hair.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Be sure to not do this after showering or during showering or your pores will open up, and this will go in and it&#x27;ll hurt like lawd.</li>
            <li>First of all, listen to the instructions and don&#x27;t go over 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>The hair did come off way better than my lower legs, the burn was starting to get me.</li>
            <li>It was all covered in white before I removed the product, so I just added more to see if it got rid of it.</li>
            <li>This the first time I&#x27;ve tried Veet.</li>
            <li>It definitely worked much better on my legs</li>
            <li>Especially since it is way more time consuming then just shaving and can get a bit messy.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>Just be sure you leave it on for ten minutes so that it can get all the hair!</li>
            <li>Next time, I plan on scraping the gel and hair off in the shower, as it will be way more easier to keep rinsing the spatula.</li>
            <li>This was the first hair removal product i have used, And i have to say i am amazed.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use it on the same area more than once a week, you won&#x27;t need to but thought i would warn you anyhow.</li>
            <li>This sensitive formula is definitely more gentle, though you may be tempted to leave it on longer to compensate for the somewhat less effective hair removal for thicker hairs</li>
            <li>Never used such an item before and this was such a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li>Other than that the product is amazing</li>
            <li>you want a sensitive skin friendly product, try waxing or sugaring instead.</li>
            <li>i have never used any kind of hair remover other than the razor.</li>
            <li>It did leave a bit of stubble, but that could easily be my own fault due to technique (since I had never used any type of cream like this</li>
            <li>I ordered the sensitive formula but received the original formula.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for pubic areas for a complete clean hair removal.</li>
            <li>Also it does remove hair very fast and gently.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the mother of a special needs 17 year old girl.  </li>
            <li>The smell is pretty strong but you can open a window or use some air freshener.</li>
            <li>She has through her whole life been an avid shaver</li>
            <li>but then again a lot of other people seem like that had way more success than I did.</li>
            <li>So far all looks well, but I have not tried a full leg or arm yet.</li>
            <li>The hair on my legs didn&#x27;t come off completely even though I hung in there to leave it on for the full time suggested (the cream was not burning my legs).</li>
            <li>For anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried it, especially a parent of a special needs girl, give it a shot!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cross between old lady&#x27;s perfume and very strong chemical scents.</li>
            <li>Veet has way more chemicals than nair and doesnt even work not near as well!</li>
            <li>A normal razor definitely works much better.</li>
            <li>White cream that applies easily.</li>
            <li>It was smooth, no burning/itching, and most importantly, no soreness from razor bumps!</li>
            <li>If you are using this on super sensitive areas i don&#x27;t recommend removal with the plastic tool provided.</li>
            <li>Not worth it, invest in a good razor or get professionally waxed instead.</li>
            <li>Lets be smart here.  </li>
            <li>The third time, the front of my right leg was still full of hair.</li>
            <li>It still didn&#x27;t remove all my fine blonde hair somehow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I came back 8mins later, scraped it off, and it was like I just shaved (but even better)!</li>
            <li>I only left the cream on for about 5 minutes and my legs were super smooth!</li>
            <li>(I can&#x27;t shave with a razor, even epilators and hot wax kits weren&#x27;t working particularly well)</li>
            <li>Works pretty decent.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone interested in it.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin smooth for days and hair free with little to no</li>
            <li>Especially for the first time using it, following the directions was very easy as well.</li>
            <li>Does a very thorough job removing hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this product, however, I no longer have to wonder.  </li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t really go by what people say the bottle says not to use on genital areas......</li>
            <li>You have to rinse the bladeless razor after every stroke because the hair/cream will clump up on it, but that&#x27;s not too much of a hassle for me.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t really remove the hair like it</li>
            <li>works just like it says and is gentle</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>I really like the pump because it keeps the stuff from getting everywhere.</li>
            <li>It really does work in just 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have that much hair</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a bit of a scardy cat to do my whole leg, because it says not to rub in, and</li>
            <li>Just smooth skin for a day or two before the hair starts growing back in.</li>
            <li>I also started getting hair bumps which is unusual for me...</li>
            <li>Smooth after second application.&lt;br /&gt;Legs-</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really remove hair well.</li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t have been any happier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never use the Veet on my underarms again because it was too much of an irritant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this was gentle.</li>
            <li>This product was able to remove the hair with minimal irritation.</li>
            <li>I think you would really need two applications for it to work well.</li>
            <li>so I was very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I was really hoping I would like this, but...</li>
            <li>It burns, it hurts, but it doesn&#x27;t really remove all the hair.</li>
            <li>works very well with no skin issues</li>
            <li>Shaving always left my legs with bumps and I could never get them completely smooth.</li>
            <li>it did not work at all!!&lt;br /&gt;i was very unsatisfied with this product</li>
            <li>I used this on my whole leg and bikini area.</li>
            <li>Now I really regret it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>, I like to use these for my underarms, and it doesn&#x27;t run or any of that, and works very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have very hairy legs</li>
            <li>So I thought, yep I&#x27;m doing my whole body.</li>
            <li>I used this on my legs, arms and chest, which at the time were reasonable hairy.  </li>
            <li>This worked very well on my boyfriend and I.</li>
            <li>Well, does it really work???</li>
            <li>It made the whole house smell like a skunk....</li>
            <li>It works fast and is gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>It really works well...</li>
            <li>Works very well on my skin</li>
            <li>it does remove the hair &amp; it is so much easier &amp; faster than shaving with a razor.</li>
            <li>It did not burn however it did not remove much hair at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wiped the product away after and it removed much hair, still with NO</li>
            <li>but this one really really worked .</li>
            <li>It did make my skin softer, so if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for and don&#x27;t really care about stubble, then go for it.</li>
            <li>It works very well in hair removal.</li>
            <li>Veet is much easier on my skin.</li>
            <li>The skin feels very slippery when rinsing (I&#x27;d like to think it&#x27;s the aloe that soaked in, but who knows).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Nair as well, but no matter how much I shave off -- pun intended -- the wait time, I always get an unsightly, itchy chemical rash on my legs.</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t seem like it did much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to get the smelly cream off your arms (or wherever you put it).</li>
            <li>Nair did absolutely nothing</li>
            <li>so after I waited the recommended time in between the process which was 72 hours, I tried again - hoping it would finally get my legs totally smooth.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work how I expected, a Razor blade works better.</li>
            <li>I really like using this hair remover.</li>
            <li>guess because the hair over there is much thicker and coarser....</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>i Applied the cream onto my Legs, waited about 9 minutes, Then gently removed it with the spatula provided.  </li>
            <li>but it really didnt feel like anything since the hairs were already half-way disintegrated.</li>
            <li>works really well</li>
            <li>Scraper didn&#x27;t work really well</li>
            <li>The red bottle for the sensitive skin is way better</li>
            <li>Missed a few spots, but nothing my handy trimmer couldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li>not only that it worked poorly and was spotty at best</li>
            <li>overall i do recommend this product since it leaves your skin soft and smooth AND doesn&#x27;t require searing pain like waxing does!</li>
            <li>most of the other hair removal products just seemed like too much work.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying this product due to the low price and rather good reviews.</li>
            <li>For those whose skin is very sensitive, test it on your arms first before try it all over ur body.</li>
            <li>My skin in that area feels very sensitive to touch right now, and I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal, but it&#x27;s kinda</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t perfect - some hair was left but only a small amount</li>
            <li>I must say, I&#x27;m glad I bought this before I read some of these other reviews...</li>
            <li>This product is awesome and the color of the package I received was not blue but a dark pink purple color.</li>
            <li>Wprked better and faster than any other removal cream I&#x27;ve tried and doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li>Ok so i&#x27;ve used other creams, and waxed, my arms before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a few different hair removal products and this is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to follow the instructions carefully!</li>
            <li>Not as effective as nair but won&#x27;t leave your skin raw</li>
            <li>For now I&#x27;ll keep it, but not sure if it&#x27;s worth buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li>I had a similar experience a decade &amp; a half ago, but figured maybe I didn&#x27;t follow directions or that these products are more advanced now.</li>
            <li>I gave this product five star rating because many products say it&#x27;s for sensitive skin and long and behold your skin starts melting off along with the hair and just about everything else you placed the product on.</li>
            <li>&gt; The sensitive formula is gentle enough for even the most sensitive of areas.</li>
            <li>Although when watching it very close, you still able see a little bit hair root, it is clean enough for me.</li>
            <li>I had to leave it on for the full ten minutes, so it was a wee bit time consuming to do all the areas I wanted to.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, will order again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not painful, and i can deal with it, I&#x27;m just worried that it will worsen later on.</li>
            <li>I left it on for the full 10 min, and the hair did not want to come off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does what its supposed to, though I can&#x27;t really tell right now if it is better than shaving, at least for legs.</li>
            <li>A wet washcloth takes off all the hair easily after leaving the cream on for 5-6 minutes.</li>
            <li>typically exfoliate my skin the day before I use this and make sure I have no scratches.</li>
            <li>After patting dry, my legs were smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>The product did a decent job for my legs, but when it came for my underarms, it reacted and gave me rashes.</li>
            <li>I use a double edged scraper shaped  like a razor that came with a hair remover product I bought several years ago - this works much better and without the discomfort.  </li>
            <li>I used this product because I am particularly prone to skin infections that can result from being nicked/cut by a razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice now with decent results.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>Deep hair removal, no rash, quick..</li>
            <li>and I adopted a steady regime of 4 hours pumping followed by 30 minutes rest, but</li>
            <li>look on my underarms, which are the main issues that I wanted Veet to cure.</li>
            <li>Leave my skin soft and smooth and last longer than using  the razor.</li>
            <li>I bought this mainly for the bikini area but also tried it on my legs.</li>
            <li>and that is the main reason i bought</li>
            <li>Well to start it does work, decently well.</li>
            <li>When the hair did grow back it was prickly, it was soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, and this is only the second hair removal cream I have used, ever, and I like it better than Nair because there really isn&#x27;t a smell, and I feel like it works</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high expectations.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for men and women.</li>
            <li>I should have known with my extremely high maintenance skin (one shower without lotion leaves me with peeling and itching</li>
            <li>Had I applied this during the most recent winter in New England, I could have trundled into my back yard, dropped trou and sat in the snow.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was just me, but I tried a fairly large test area in a sensitive area and did not have any reaction.</li>
            <li>I have to leave in on a little longer then recommended, but it does work for the most part.</li>
            <li>The little spatula thing just scratched my legs though a washcloth worked much better and use plenty of lotion afterwards.</li>
            <li>but I wish they could figure out a way to cover it up a little better.</li>
            <li>i am not giving it 5 stars because you have to leave it on for a little bit longer than the maximum time to make sure all your hair comes off.</li>
            <li>Veet products don&#x27;t seem to have as strong of an odor as some of the other brands.</li>
            <li>Sure, there was a little after-burn (not gonna lie) but the burn subsided after a few minutes (I didn&#x27;t count, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it hurt more than 10 minutes afterwards).</li>
            <li>This really is for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It almost completely stops the itching and the patches will disappear much quicker if you use it.  </li>
            <li>The reviews were more good than bad and it was for sensitive skin, which she and I both have.  </li>
            <li>I normally use the shower one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Most hair removal creams I try either don&#x27;t work or are too harsh for my legs.</li>
            <li>Normally I don&#x27;t write product reviews</li>
            <li>I do leave it on for the max time, 10 minutes, but it&#x27;s still better than having to shave everyday.</li>
            <li>No complaint.</li>
            <li>so there is my excuse, and my leg hair is much more coarse</li>
            <li>I know this is normal for a product like this</li>
            <li>I normally shave my underarms but was on vacation and figured I would use the cream everywhere</li>
            <li>I get a little irritation right after using it but in the morning it&#x27;s completely gone and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Left it on for ten minutes and it wiped off easily and with no irritation.</li>
            <li>so it ends up growing right back in a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have dark curly hair, which on a positive side means I have an awesome thick head of hair but on the downside I also have dark leg hair that grows FAST.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, much better than shaving (razor is potentially dangerous down there).</li>
            <li>The second time and onward have been a much smoother process after having gotten better at applying the cream and also trimming down the areas I intend to apply to.</li>
            <li>The product smells decent and didn&#x27;t burn my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Granted, its not a big deal for me since no one can really see it unless you&#x27;re up close, like real close.</li>
            <li>I shaved my legs as I normally do, and I noticed afterwards that the Veet-ed area grew back much more slowly than the shaved area which was cool, but I never used the Veet again because it was almost completely ineffective and the smell was so toxic that I had to air out my bathroom for a day.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not as near messy as magic shave.  </li>
            <li>Having read and re-read many of the reviews about this product I decided to push the boundaries of human endurance to hitherto unknown limits.</li>
            <li>I want to make that very clear.....</li>
            <li>but I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin is VERY sensitive, so I tried test patches on my arm and leg.</li>
            <li>I still have and use the same bottle, it does&#x27;t run out very fast.</li>
            <li>very sensitive skin soi decided to go with this.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very gentle on your skin especially if you have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always wanted to find an alternative to shaving, as I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend it , very gentle formula for  the skin.</li>
            <li>Got for my daughter who has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Works still has a slightly high smell but maybe my nose is just mega sensitive.</li>
            <li>Easy to use also last me a long time.</li>
            <li>the first time it was used it just broke the hair and left hair stubs.</li>
            <li>It does not get all the way to the roots though, so I&#x27;m not sure if I can say it&#x27;s Better then</li>
            <li>I am amazed with the results I can believe I left one star in my first review.</li>
            <li>After my first use I came back and immediately put this on auto-ship.</li>
            <li>Legs feel divine and soft!</li>
            <li>The small spatula that come with the bottle isn&#x27;t too helpful, it mostly irritates your skin.</li>
            <li>Not only does it work well and FAST!</li>
            <li>The first time I left the cream on for 6 minutes and the time after that for 9 minutes.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I used it, i thought that maybe I didn&#x27;t use enough of the cream.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure how well it works for darker or more course hair.</li>
            <li>However, after using it under my armpit, i could still see some short hair there after first attempt.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it only removed one patch of hair correctly.</li>
            <li>I made sure to take it all off by the time the timer hit 10 minutes, so no more burning.</li>
            <li>I wanted to be careful and clean off any chemicals because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have medium thick hair and this cream removes my stubborn hair so easily!</li>
            <li>The hair is fine so usually I don&#x27;t mess with it.</li>
            <li>The smell was pretty &amp;#34;home-perm&amp;#34; invasive, but for that little inconvenience, still very much worth it.  </li>
            <li>Unless you just have that super sensitive skin and are smart about how long you actually leave it on, it will not burn.  </li>
            <li>You may find a few hairs that didn&#x27;t get fully washed off and those hairs are easily pulled off with your finger tips or tweezers.</li>
            <li>I did use the little plastic razor that&#x27;s included, and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li>So I left the product on for a total of exactly 10 minutes(the absolute longest</li>
            <li>No reactions thus far, very pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>As other reviewers mentioned, the smell is not bad at all.</li>
            <li>The spatula was very useful and made the process less</li>
            <li>only half of the hair came off, applied more for another 3 minutes, all hair came off.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t burn my skin, and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.&lt;br /&gt;For the thick hair in my underarms wasn&#x27;t easy to remove very well.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>She has a few spots on her legs that are still healing from her infection and they were just fine.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy the little scraper that comes with this, too.</li>
            <li>My legs feel silky smooth after using this product i do not have to worry about having cuts or nicks or razor burn or those little bumps that come up after shaving.</li>
            <li>When I used it last time I had to run a razor over my legs to de-fuzz a little more.</li>
            <li>Removes most of the hair in the hard to shave areas.  </li>
            <li>cant remove tough short hair, good for arm and legs</li>
            <li>Which is nice since you can&#x27;t do it for 3 days, so by the third day I&#x27;m a little scruffy but not much, about how much it would be for me to shave it before.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how well it worked without any sensitivity .  </li>
            <li>I guess this is not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Very toxic odor that insulted the entire apartment floor and made my neighbors upset.  </li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>It did about as well as an old razor.</li>
            <li>I will never be buying this again, I feel completely ripped off.</li>
            <li>Having your skin&#x27;s natural oils in place helps prevent burning.  </li>
            <li>Bought for my gf who has had some issues with infections and sensitive skin on her legs.  </li>
            <li>it doesnt take nearly 10 minutes for an application</li>
            <li>Lets&#x27;s face it to some people hair is completely out of the question.</li>
            <li>(Yes, this is at the very bottom of the second page.</li>
            <li>Not really messy.</li>
            <li>I have never considered myself to have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having heard that it burned, I was nervous to try it since I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Oh, and my legs are sensitive and burn when touched by clothing or water.</li>
            <li>Soft as silk.</li>
            <li>The item description states that packaging may vary, but I didn&#x27;t expect to get a quick-working Veet instead of the Veet for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I needed a product that would remove hair around my sensitive parts.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and get razor bumps from shaving, so I wanted to give this a try in spite of my doubts.</li>
            <li>but my hair still doesn&#x27;t come off completely.</li>
            <li>completely gone after 7-8 mins&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>Daughter loves it, and she has sensitive skin, chemical sensitivity and a perfume allergy.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and no issues so far.</li>
            <li>Veet Gel Hair Remover Cream, Sensitive Formula, 13.5 Ounce, was returned unused.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Lasted over a week so far.</li>
            <li>a couple of days after the application - i have developed acne like rash all over the application area which takes months to go away.</li>
            <li>We both have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get rid off all hair in sensitive area.</li>
            <li>, is Veet Gel Cream Pump Sensitive Formula Hair Remover, 13.5 Ounce</li>
            <li>so far this is my review and again I will update as soon as my wife tells me her results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even notice it was the sensitive formula.</li>
            <li>I used it 2 days ago and my legs are still soft.</li>
            <li>and I had some issues with chemical burns in sensitive areas but</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive skin.....</li>
            <li>Use caution with the amount of time you leave this on esp in sensitive areas like groin because it will burn the heck out of your skin.</li>
            <li>The sensitive formula dose work for me, but I have found that the shower cream formula with the sponge seems to get all the hair off easier.  </li>
            <li>My legs are smoother after using the hair removal cream compared to just shaving, but it grows back just as fast.</li>
            <li>you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Throw away your razor and try Veet Sensitive Formula</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Skin feels soft-  </li>
            <li>Eyes and nose bleeding and with the fabric of my ear drums almost completely dissolved</li>
            <li>Very displeased - would definitely not recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it in sensitive areas and had no problems.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t shave the hair against the grain in my arm pits or bikini line without leaving bumps.</li>
            <li>My skin is so sensitive that when I used Sensitive Nair</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really expect it to because of how coarse the hair is.</li>
            <li>of the hair, the thinnest and smallest are completely removed but that&#x27;s not a lot of them.</li>
            <li>Before trying Veet Hair Remover Cream - Sensitive Formula, I haven&#x27;t used a depilatory cream in years.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a gross smell and works fast too.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Veet gel cream and I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive legs</li>
            <li>Sensitive formula?  </li>
            <li>and make sure you moisturize twice a day FOR AT LEAST 3 days after you use it.</li>
            <li>I was ready to go, I started with my legs, left it 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft, no irritation to my tender parts</li>
            <li>Well I have sensitive skin and it burns me, so I&#x27;m going to stay away from it.</li>
            <li>My skin is obnoxiously sensitive.</li>
            <li>recommend this hair removing product to anyone with sensitive skin because this is the product that I use to remove hair that needs to be removed on my person.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t bother me</li>
            <li>For some background, I am a male with a very hairy butt.</li>
            <li>glad I bought the product on clearance at my local drug store, but even then I still think it&#x27;s money wasted.</li>
            <li>Veet was only able to take off a few hairs even after the max time of 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Second time, I applied heavy layers on my leg to make sure the hair was fully covered</li>
            <li>I applied it thickly and let it sit for 6 minutes, I wiped it with a luke warm wash rag and the hair came off instantly.</li>
            <li>The pump is convenient and all the hair was easily removed after the maximum leave-on time of 10 minutes (I have coarse, dark hair).  </li>
            <li>Also, the little tool is simple, effective and ergonomically designed, such that it takes up minimal bathroom space and presumably, retail space, which I think is pretty neat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many other products, especially those that come in spray bottles, annoy me because the cans seem to contain enough to cover just three legs--</li>
            <li>Make sure to use a lot of product (I mean a lot), and get it off by 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently extremely picky about the pants and undies I wear so that they don&#x27;t rub much because I am in so much pain.</li>
            <li>this does work, has an ok smell, but watch it closely on how long you need to keep it on , test a small area to see if hair removes easily and wait maybe a little while before you re apply.</li>
            <li>I have noticed bleeding but it is really rare and always due to bumps/scratches on my skin</li>
            <li>Also If you have it for a really long time the remainder begins to smell weird otherwise its great.</li>
            <li>leg hair was pretty short but above the skin.</li>
            <li>Watched her closely to make sure she wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable or hurting in any way and wiped it off after exactly 5 minutes and NO HAIR.  </li>
            <li>It worked fine on one of my legs but on the other one it left a HUGE red rash that lasted for a few days.</li>
            <li>It removes hair like no other, and despite having relatively sensitive skin I&#x27;ve never had any skin problems from it.</li>
            <li>Not sure if the times in the instructions are accurate...</li>
            <li>Just when the hair grows back it&#x27;s not thick stubble.</li>
            <li>And apparently my armpits are too sensitive for Veet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But just for removing hair off your legs armpits bikini line and following the Directions responsibly this product is definitely for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally shave or anything, actually, but decided to give this a try for kicks.</li>
            <li>so I was hoping to have success in removing the dark underarm and bikini area hair.  </li>
            <li>this is a good product, definitely recommend , especially if you are tired of shaving and in case</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s healthy using this very often down there</li>
            <li>it probably grew back quickly since i didn&#x27;t leave the product on long enough..</li>
            <li>Make sure you follow their warning not to use on your face -- it&#x27;s hard enough on your legs.</li>
            <li>all, it wasn&#x27;t a total disappointment but it wasn&#x27;t exactly great either.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I didn&#x27;t need to use much cream, this should last me for several uses.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t over use it this bottle can last a pretty long time; making it cheaper than razors, razor refills, and shaving cream.</li>
            <li>After the third time, I feel like I don&#x27;t have much product left which means that I have to go buy another bottle of this stuff.</li>
            <li>And the worse part it the smell, make sure you take a shower after using this or no ones gonna want to go near you.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Before you use it, you are supposed to try it in a small area to make sure you won&#x27;t have a reaction to it and to see how long you need it to be on for.</li>
            <li>Even tho I personally need to use a really thick layer for most hairs to come of.</li>
            <li>I just wonder if it&#x27;s a good idea to shave the remaining hair, I feel weird having patches of hair left on my 75% shaven</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving my genital area for years and it always left my skin very sensitive and with razor burns.</li>
            <li>The only bad part was, despite testing it with good results first, that my lady bits got SEVERELY irritated.</li>
            <li>It barely took off any hair under the arms, even keeping it on for 10 minutes!  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin look really pretty, but at the same time I end up with itchy red patches all over my body that last for weeks.  </li>
            <li>but if you have super sensitive skin, I suggest you base your skin by rubbing some Vaseline on the area and rinsing with warm water before applying.</li>
            <li>Works on thick hairs and with quick results!</li>
            <li>The bottle and Veet website give pretty clear instructions, but I still had to leave the cream on a little while longer than they suggested.</li>
            <li>but I am highly convinced it is not made for African American women.</li>
            <li>this product removes the hair of the body and it does not have any bad side effects on my skin, but i am not so happy with the result.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works, I have pretty much shaved my whole life and razors are getting more expensive and shaving is tedious</li>
            <li>Next day, all clear, no burn, no pain, nothing.</li>
            <li>When ready to remove, the hair will look like wet cotton.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it before when a female friend of mine let me borrow it because I was unhappy with my leg hair and wanted a effective way to stunt its growth rate that shaving doesn&#x27;t really help alleviate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>always test a patch , especially if you know you have sensitive</li>
            <li>I prefer the sensitive formula to the regular.  </li>
            <li>It will made your skill sensitive leaving lots of red scratches.</li>
            <li>I am a 17 year old male.</li>
            <li>it comes with especially since the area is sensitive downstairs.  </li>
            <li>Still going to use it but do double check your product if you have sensitive legs.</li>
            <li>wife has used it so far on the following areas:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will not shave again Veet hair removal for sensitive facial skin works.  </li>
            <li>&amp; it barely removed hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only rating this product with one star because it did make my legs soft.  </li>
            <li>The reason behind it was that it was meant to be used by a lovely senior that had a change of heart once she reviewed the instructions.</li>
            <li>It makes me look like I have some kind of weird skin condition.  </li>
            <li>Gets job done if hair is long and thick, otherwise, you are better off with a razor</li>
            <li>My hair grows sooo incredibly quick, but veet makes it a little easier!</li>
            <li>But I am writing a review even though I haven’t used it yet just to let people know that if you do decide to use Nair, I found something that will help calm down the itchy red patches.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick, dark, strong, and grows extremely fast.</li>
            <li>After I removed all the cream, I rinsed my legs VERY well with water only and patted dry.</li>
            <li>Slight burn within the first minute</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other depilatory creams in the past.</li>
            <li>I really like using this product, it absolutely works but one little tip: DON&#x27;T LEAVE IT ON FOR TOO LONG JUST DON&#x27;T</li>
            <li>worked but really irritated my skin and smelled strongly of wet dog!</li>
            <li>Not a single hair came off.</li>
            <li>I would say this is not good at removing thicker, tougher hair but works well for fine hair.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take as long to process and made my legs feel smooth &amp; slick.</li>
            <li>But I like that my skin stays smooth for several weeks without the need to shave, so I put up with the negative.</li>
            <li>I have only used it on my legs so far, and will also end up using it on my back eventually</li>
            <li>/&gt;I decided to try it on my (much longer, just as coarse) arm hair, waited 6-7 minutes and wiped it off with a wet washcloth.</li>
            <li>fourth, I ordered sensitive formula, got regular.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin, and this caused a red rash all over my legs &amp; my bikini area looked like it had a hundred red razor bumps all over.</li>
            <li>After 5mins was up, I used the included spatula to scrape off the gel and hair; some hair did come off, but most was left behind.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I used them was a little bit of a challenge.</li>
            <li>She was a little scared to try this at first but</li>
            <li>Still itchy a little bit at the first time using.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly, using the little scraper to remove it.</li>
            <li>On a pretty hairy little leg that&#x27;s never seen a shaving.  </li>
            <li>A couple years ago, I tried Nair to see if that would work better, and I was disappointed to find that not only was the smell absolutely noxious, but the product burned on my skin and didn&#x27;t really remove any hairs.  </li>
            <li>If you have dark hair you can absolutely forget about it,  bc</li>
            <li>I found this in a Dollar General last year but after I bought it, I was too scared to try it, because I didn&#x27;t know if it would burn or hurt my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have really think dark hair</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, but one minute too long of Nair</li>
            <li>I left it on for the max amount of time and it barely removed any of the hair off my stomach.</li>
            <li>it left a bare, shiny patch of skin with no stubble.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really sure how this&#x27;ll be useful in the slightest</li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s worth the discomfort.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t remove all hair but does get most of it and the hair left behind is downy and very short.</li>
            <li>So I bought this exact product at Fred Meyer, for $11 because I am impatient.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this a few times now, and it takes care of my hair pretty well</li>
            <li>The pump makes it easy to get out the bottle, the pump makes it less messy (glides on skin)</li>
            <li>It works really well on my legs, and although it still takes 5 minutes to take affect it does save me the backache of leaning down to save my legs.</li>
            <li>No redness, not a single hair left.  </li>
            <li>So you use the first time and when the hair grows back does it grow back thw same or does it grow back with less hair?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy with a little too much body hair for my taste, and decided to give this a shot after having done occasional trimming, rare shaves, and a few wax strips (ouch!).</li>
            <li>/&gt;She left it on for 10 minutes after testing a small spot for 5 minutes before applying it all over her legs and it took the hair right off.  </li>
            <li>Hair on my arms are thin and fine and removed it in one use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how fast I could razor all of the cream off in 5 mins with the little razor/having to wash it off</li>

            <li> I have used on my legs and arms with great results.</li>
            <li> The bottle I purchased said it was great for legs, body, bikini area, etc.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s great for when I don&#x27;t have time to wax or in between waxes.</li>
            <li> Product works great, but the plastic razor they give you is garbage.  </li>
            <li> I had great results.</li>
            <li> I used it on both the bikini area and legs, and had great results.</li>

            <li> I was eager to try this, because i&#x27;ve tried waxing and shaving and thought this would be good to try.</li>
            <li> Why would anyone shave when this wonderful product is available.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good produce.</li>
            <li> Good for men too.  </li>

            <li> I have fair skin and allergies-</li>

            <li> Good and satisfactory.</li>

            <li> I am so glad I found this!</li>
            <li> Hair remover cream is so much better than shaving!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> this is perfect if you are a first time shaver or along time shaver.</li>
            <li> Love this cream!</li>
            <li> NAIR is better than this!</li>
            <li> Works like magic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad to have this on amazon and a subscribe and save!</li>
            <li> My skin feels so Smooth, and looks beautiful aswell.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have very good success with this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff works amazingly for me.</li>
            <li> works great legs and every thing i  use it on is smooth</li>
            <li> )I was looking for one of those 10-20 dollar razors,but the one I wanted based on amazing reviews was not in stock</li>
            <li> but this was absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing for me</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> the directions said and it worked amazingly.</li>
            <li> It’s amazing.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> I even would have considered grabbing one of my abundant icicles, snapping off the tip and placing it where it would do the most good.  </li>
            <li> and/or razor burn, no matter what kind of razor I use.  </li>
            <li> THEN I WASHED IT OFF IN THE TUB WITH WARM WATER AND LOOKED.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best hair remover.</li>
            <li> Does anyone click on &amp;#34;really liked it&amp;#34; for a product that is a corrosive chemical designed to burn hair from our bodies and smell like someone holding a lighter to a pile of hair?</li>
            <li> Try for your own results.</li>
            <li> There are so many good things about this product.  </li>
            <li> the shipping was fast and it was packaged ideally!</li>
            <li> And my legs feel sooo nice afterwards.</li>
            <li> so kind of defeated the purpose</li>
            <li> Would I purchase again honestly I wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I suggest you use some kind of petroleum based oil ... or just petroleum jelly around the hairline to protect your skin.</li>
            <li> Honestly, if it worked to remove hair I might have powered through the skin destruction.</li>
            <li> Using it on your legs uses up a lot each use, and it would be nice not having to reorder as often as I do now.</li>
            <li> Its good much better than a razor.</li>
            <li> The tool it came with is handy.</li>
            <li> Rinse with warm water in a bathtub - DO NOT USE SOAP.</li>
            <li> No amount of exfoliating stuff or lotion has made that skin look nice in years.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve kind of kept in my mind that maybe a hair removing lotion is what we&#x27;d be looking at someday.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel like if the razors lasted me longer if I&#x27;m honest.</li>
            <li> This product was nice while using.</li>
            <li> it four stars because the scraper you use to remove the hair is a nice idea,</li>
            <li> it is convenient to use and it is effective.</li>
            <li> It is a quick &amp; easy approach to removing body hair, but I find that I have to use Veet almost as often as I would with shaving...not impressed.</li>
            <li> Best way to use it is i strip naked before going in the shower, apply it to the designated area (use good amount).</li>
            <li> Does have a strong chemical smell though so you need to scrub good after use to get rid of the smell.</li>
            <li> RIGHT AFTER APPLYING VEET!!!</li>
            <li> I liked Veet better than Nair.  </li>
            <li> This would have provided wonderful, albeit temporary relief to my sensitive areas to the detriment of increasing the level of the water table in my neighborhood.  </li>
            <li> If you answered &#x27;yes&#x27; to these answers then this product might be suitable for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had better results using a warm, damp washcloth.</li>
            <li> With this, I was able to go 4 days without having to shave, so I was thrilled.</li>
            <li> This product is by far one of the best.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s more of my own fault and not the product.</li>
            <li> have extremely sensitive skin, but this product works great for me!</li>
            <li> The best product for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> like the large size, and good lord is the pump-style of the bottle convenient (about time, depilatory creams!).  </li>
            <li> and it worked great, came right off and no burning or itching.</li>
            <li> If you have very fine hair...</li>
            <li> Great volume for this price, it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I did my legs first and everything went great.</li>
            <li> First try it was great, all the hair was removed.</li>
            <li> Works great and fast!</li>
            <li> Very good, I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My legs were very smooth after using this product.</li>
            <li> On the upside, it worked very nicely on my legs, they are super smooth with no signs of irritation.</li>
            <li> just okay.</li>
            <li> Within a minute of application in my more nether regions, I abandoned hope of ever reproducing.  </li>
            <li> I buy this from Wal-Mart and I love it....</li>
            <li> But I really love the product....</li>
            <li> i RINSED IT IN THE SINK AND CONTINUED UNTIL MOST OF THE VEET WAS GONE.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use many nair/veet type products</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about how wonderful this stuff works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure the results vary from person-to-person.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE</li>
            <li> This veet cream works okay on your arms and legs.</li>
            <li> Make sure to test it everywhere</li>
            <li> and I was impressed to see how well the hair actually came off.</li>
            <li> There I was, in Walgreens hoping to find something magical.</li>
            <li> I really love this,I even threw away my razor.</li>
            <li> In shower hair removal is way better and alot faster.</li>
            <li> It works though that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> I also used gloves,so I would not have to worry about making sure the product was off my hands.</li>
            <li> works better than shaving</li>
            <li> Great product that works very well for my needs.</li>
            <li> Most of the time it does get quite a bit of the hair but it doesn&#x27;t get all of it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> It is all that I use now and simply love it and the results.</li>
            <li> And it has managed to make the hair follicles on my legs more defined and noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i love most is the cost effectiveness of this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cannot comment on the effectiveness on more \\&quot;delicate\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have the most obnoxious hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Finally, it works wonderfully!  </li>
            <li> This hair remover is ok.</li>
            <li> Shaving might just be a better option.</li>
            <li> It did work for me on the bikini area where a had more and longer hair</li>
            <li> but overall I wasn&#x27;t too impressed.</li>
            <li> I love veet</li>
            <li> Just do not leave it for more then 10 minutes</li>
            <li> Just make sure to moisturize after.</li>
            <li> For my legs, it feels 10x better than shaving.</li>
            <li> If you want a nice a smooth wherever you are using it, look somewhere else.</li>
            <li> A better scraper would have gotten this product 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be better then it is.</li>
            <li> It did an ok job on my hands.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s proving to be much more.</li>
            <li> Better than nair with argan oil</li>
            <li> Works very well, removed a great amount of hair.</li>
            <li> I also enjoyed using the waiting time to let the hair conditioner penetrate my hair.  </li>
            <li> Safe.</li>
            <li> Did it get rid of the hair, sure did----along with layers of skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this product and love it.</li>
            <li> Shave or wax, or better yet get</li>
            <li> Took most of the hair off, but not all...</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I like using the spatula to get most of the cream off</li>
            <li> I think it works better.</li>
            <li> so make sure time yourself while applying this...</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> Thanks and happy shopping.</li>
            <li> this stuff really works great.</li>
            <li> i will be ordering more of this &amp; this will be a socking stuffer at christmas.</li>
            <li> but it can remove most of it.</li>
            <li> It removed most of the hair from my legs, but not quite all of it.</li>
            <li> 7 minutes removed most of my chin and neck hair.</li>
            <li> I save MORE</li>
            <li> I found this was much more convenient than shaving</li>
            <li> I actually bought mine from CVS for a bit more, but it&#x27;s amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I love Veet.</li>
            <li> (Because that&#x27;s so much better than the hair....?)</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> (maybe even 8) minutes instead of 5-6.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> But it worked perfectly on areas where the hair is finer - my belly, lower back, and arms.</li>
            <li> So I reapplied the cream the next day for best result..</li>
            <li> but I think that&#x27;s more user error than the cream itself.</li>
            <li> Sure.  </li>
            <li> I waited another hour just to make sure and then tested it on her.  </li>
            <li> I also love the plastic scraper.</li>
            <li> okay results, better than my lower legs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update my review if I get better results.</li>
            <li> It removed slightly more hair and again, I had no side effects.</li>
            <li> I tried it again yesterday with the max time and more hair was removed this time, but not all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is more time consuming than shaving, but it does leave my legs smoother, so I am satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Buy this you will love it.</li>
            <li> This is so much better than the Nair product that i tried.  </li>
            <li> But if you aren&#x27;t confident, do not try.</li>
            <li> If you have fair or sensitive skin, even if your body hair is fair &amp; fine... I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> Its one of the best quality, like it a lot, lasts long time and it doesnt give me a rush</li>
            <li> Veet works beautifully and it does not irritate or cause issues with my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am so excited about this stuff!</li>
            <li> It does the job quickly and effectively.</li>
            <li> many time does not burn my skin like nair does, no hair bumps, and works well on strong hair,</li>
            <li> Goes on easy - smells OK.</li>
            <li> Quickly hop in the shower and use the spatula to remove it from your body and once you&#x27;ve use the spatula on the area just rinse with water, warm will do the trick.</li>
            <li> this is a safe and easy way to remove hair.</li>
            <li> No bad smell, easy to use, effective.</li>
            <li> worked wonders on my leg hair; the most fine of my body hair.</li>
            <li> I love this because I feel like it works the best out of any other cream removals.</li>
            <li> The sensitive skin formula is great</li>
            <li> There were patches of smooth skin, but many areas that still had hair.</li>
            <li> No cuts, roughness or anything, just smooth and sexy legs.</li>
            <li> My legs are more moisturized, smooth,</li>
            <li> Since it said sensitive I used it on my face, it didn&#x27;t burn it and worked great.  </li>
            <li> You also do not have to apply much of the cream for the optimum hair removal.</li>
            <li> and it works fast and is a good alternative to shaving.</li>
            <li> Good, does its job..wayy easier and sensitive on the skin than shaving, but make sure you follow directions and not leave it on for more than 10mins.</li>
            <li> Use it for the full 10 minutes and any undesirable hair will be gone!</li>
            <li> it works great on the arm pitts as well so smooth so soft no hair</li>
            <li> Makes hair removal easy.</li>
            <li> Its easy.</li>
            <li> so it comes off easily.</li>
            <li> I feel so clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> It does wonders and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Directions easy to follow</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, does not drip.</li>
            <li> I also think that having the hair follicles softened by steam probably helped the hair come off easily.  </li>
            <li> No pain and easy.</li>
            <li> its so easy to just jump in the shower when it&#x27;s time to wash this off.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really easy for me to get razor burn.</li>
            <li> and it was easy to remove.</li>
            <li> It does have a strong odor though but that can be overlooked if it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> People like to complain about the smell, but the smell is just like loation, not anything too strong or offensive.</li>
            <li> It does have a strong smell as you are using it</li>
            <li> It seems to me this isn&#x27;t as strong as the Neet</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt or burn at all, it just has this strong chemical smell, so I would recommend just showering afterward</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an alternative to shaving because I strongly dislike shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Applied and whipped off with a hot warm rag.  </li>
            <li> I waited exactly 5 minutes and wiped it off with a warm washcloth and by God...</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just fine for</li>
            <li> Even for your legs and the rest of your body, it works great and pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I have to shave every two days, but I can use this once a week and be fine.</li>
            <li> This is easy to apply and relatively cheap.</li>
            <li> and what I have is fine.  </li>
            <li> It works fine.</li>
            <li> and yes I&#x27;m gay</li>
            <li> So I just used a cloth and that seemed to do the job just fine.</li>
            <li> I do, however, have fine, blond hair and that may make it easier to remove.</li>
            <li> This, when uses appropriately and not too long on your skin, is great.</li>
            <li> stuff if easy and leaves my legs smooth for days!&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first saw the commercial I ran to the store thinking, This is the greatest thing ever!</li>
            <li> Much more effort than a quick shave in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works quickly and no irritation!</li>
            <li> if it&#x27;s a huge hassle, and I have to shave anyway.</li>
            <li> So that is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m left smooth and happy.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> WASN&#x27;T ANY HAIR AND MY SKIN FELT SO SMOOTH AND SILKY.THIS IS MY ANSWER TO SMOOTH SILKY SKIN WITHOUT SHAVING.</li>
            <li> hairs were longer, some were shorter, in NO way did this product give me that smooth skin it promised.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use a warm wash rag and six minutes is really all you need.</li>
            <li> I swim and having smooth legs</li>
            <li> I liked this so much</li>
            <li> I removed as much as I can, I rinsed the rest with warm water in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> was a simple, painless and great experience.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of trusting it to make my legs smooth and my legs still felt prickly after.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bikini was a total win.</li>
            <li> Removes every hair no rash or burn like a baby skin smooth</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe after another use or two, it will all be smooth.  </li>
            <li> I also enjoy the smooth of kg wife&#x27;s legs</li>
            <li> it leaves you silky smooth.</li>
            <li> This worked AMAZING on my legs, so much smoother than shaving and without all of the razor burn.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t leave me silky smooth, or anything.</li>
            <li> My skin was smooth and there was no irritation afterwards.</li>
            <li> A worry free weekend at the beach with smooth silky tan legs.</li>
            <li> shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy using this product it beats shaving any day.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t feel a burn during or after use and the results are ridiculously smooth and works well no matter</li>
            <li> , the formula is smooth, it hydrates my skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate it either.</li>
            <li> Some places on my legs were smooth and others looked like they hadn&#x27;t been touched.</li>
            <li> I find that Veet is both gentle and effective for all of my hair removal needs.</li>
            <li> Although I prefer to use an exfoliating mitt than the bladeless razor, this product leaves me baby smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anywho, if you don&#x27;t like pain, not a fan of body hair, and like cheap pricing, this is the way to go</li>
            <li> The last bottle I got worked great.</li>
            <li> I get smooth legs and</li>
            <li> But what it did remove seems smooth</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin really, really smooth afterwards as well.</li>
            <li> Keeps me smooth for about 3 days longer compared to shaving.</li>
            <li> Smooth skin and no irritation...</li>
            <li> Hair&lt;br /&gt;regrowth is slower and makes your skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> It is obviously a fantastic exfoliator.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom for 48 hours.</li>
            <li> It was available for about $6 at Target, and I had a $2 coupon as well as a Target Cartwheel for 20% off, so why not?  </li>
            <li> Fortunately after about 10 minutes, it cleared/went away.</li>
            <li> Where it did work it came out really smooth, but</li>
            <li> I tried Veet a couple of weeks before my appointment and my arms stayed smooth and hair free for a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that my legs stay hairless for the same amount of time a good shape would, maybe one day more.</li>
            <li> : Works great on longer hair, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin (even on the bikini line), and washes off pretty easily.</li>
            <li> I was able to was my skin with soap right after applying and no irritation.</li>
            <li> Cheap, easy on our skin and quick.  </li>
            <li> This was easy to use and quick.  </li>
            <li> Quick, easy, clean, and cheap.</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned with naturally dark hair</li>
            <li> It has a strong flowery chemical smell, but it&#x27;s not terrible (much improved from 10 years ago).</li>
            <li> After the first use, it felt better.</li>
            <li> I noticed that birds no longer sang in any of the trees around my castle, and the once familiar bees were swarming as one into the flames of our industrial boiler.  </li>
            <li> First time using it today, applied while wearing a latex glove to avoid touching it with my hands (contact lens wearer</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> but it was worth it!</li>
            <li> (not over the top, more like I got sunburn) , but to top it all off there was a lot of hair left.</li>
            <li> Fast, easy, and no irritation!</li>
            <li> I must say that the product is quite effective, as the hair was rather thoroughly removed, along with several layers of skin and most of my dignity.  </li>
            <li> You are betteroff using Nair if you want super smooth legs.</li>
            <li> I put it on for the max time  (10 mins) and there was no pain and the result was super baby butt smooth.  </li>
            <li> my sister said this product is the best remover cream, especially when you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s safe enough that you can rinse yourself in the shower or bath with warm water.  </li>
            <li> This Veet is so much better then the &amp;#34;Veet in shower cr&amp;egrave;me sensitive formula&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;Nair hair removal lotion&amp;#34; on so many levels.</li>
            <li> When you follow the directions as instructed its easy and even a bit fun to use.</li>
            <li> For underarms I had to leave the product on for 9 minutes to get good removal action; when I tried just 5 minutes it wasn&#x27;t so useful.  </li>
            <li> The spatula that comes with it is a great tool for getting rid of every single hair.</li>
            <li> Veet is the best, least likely to burn you, hair cream on the market, and this is the best Veet option if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Worked okay on certain spots, still had to shave after</li>
            <li> After I apply it, and wait forever, when i take it off (WITH the special remover thing) not all the hair is gone, and it ALL leaves stubble</li>
            <li> so I can wash it right away and the smell goes away!</li>
            <li> AND IT WAS FULL OF HAIR.</li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She tried it last weekend and loved it.  </li>
            <li> It works just as good as the regular formula.  </li>
            <li> I have to leave it on for the full 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> so I thought I&#x27;d try this while it was on sale because my legs are usually full of razor bumps and cuts since I shave so often.</li>
            <li> I tested on my legs and lady bits without any irritation, so I decided to go fo full on hair removal.</li>
            <li> So far, the soothing Neosporin with pain reliever in it is helping nicely.</li>
            <li> I leave it on for the full time</li>
            <li> Washed with soap and water then used finishing cream to cool skin.  </li>
            <li> This time when I scraped it off it actually seemed like it worked fairly well.</li>
            <li> It is literally a dream come true.</li>
            <li> I have given this product multiple chances and still have not seen good results.</li>
            <li> The smell for Veet is not bad at all.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take very much meticulousness, so if you want easy...</li>
            <li> but it reminds me of the smell of Nair just not so strong, and even after a shower it kind of left that chemical stench on my leg.&lt;br /&gt;Now for what its \\&quot;supposed\\&quot; to do...</li>
            <li> It takes care of any hairs that don&#x27;t come off easily the first time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this product would&#x27;ve worked just fine if it wasn&#x27;t 3 years old.</li>
            <li> I am extremely impressed with this product and will likely purchase it again in the future.</li>
            <li> so I was super nervous about using anything else.</li>
            <li> I used to have my legs waxed which works wonderfully but is much more expensive.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting sooo much more from this product, however it is the same if you shave (messier and more</li>
            <li> I was super nervous so iw arched a video</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome, works long term, and although it&#x27;s a pain, so is everything else, it is pretty goopy, but it totally allows me to be smooth and hair free where I desire.</li>
            <li> (Not recommended for the meek and mild)</li>
            <li> Works well and quickly.  </li>
            <li> It all came off in clumps and quickly.</li>
            <li> It was quick and it was painless.</li>
            <li> over all good, worth the money.i will give only four star for this product.</li>
            <li> My daughter is a pre teen and this would be perfect for her instead of actually shaving.</li>
            <li> My hair grows quickly</li>
            <li> Very effective and doesn&#x27;t burn skin like other products did.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands that caused a lot of irritation, but this brand and formula (sensitive) is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very crisp, curly, and often standing on end.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin very smooth and really soft and it lasts a lot longer than shaving!</li>
            <li> It works great and the smell doesn&#x27;t knock you down when you use it.</li>
            <li> It works fairly well as long as you follow the directions, I&#x27;ve used it numerous time with pretty good results.</li>
            <li> and I still don&#x27;t see new growth after 3 days:)</li>
            <li> It works very well but the smell is just to strong and sticks around even after i&#x27;ve taken a shower and washed the towels.  </li>
            <li> Treated it with Veet and now, 3 days later, my leg is still shiny and soft and beautiful without any use of lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I was so excited and missed that the first time.</li>
            <li> Make sure the area you put it on doesn&#x27;t come in contact with any other parts of your body, doing one leg before the other is best.</li>
            <li> i tried doing a brazilian with this product and it worked out pretty well!</li>
            <li> Have used this stuff for years with no problems and no weird reactions!</li>
            <li> My wife simply cannot live without this product, the fact that this seller has it at a great price and prompt shipping is a plus for me zag the end of the day</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling very smooth and soft, and hair growth seems to be slower in comparison to shaving.</li>
            <li> Does the job very thoroughly and quickly!  </li>
            <li> BUT WHEN I PUT THIS ON THICK IN THE BIKINI AREA AND UNDER ARMS, I WAS PLEASANTLY SUPRISED!</li>
            <li> The Veet cleaned off most of the fine, blonde hair.</li>
            <li> It comes with a little spreader/remover thingie that is wonderful, and it helps you spread in areas that you need to be careful :)</li>
            <li> The hair on my legs is very scant and light</li>
            <li> The only problem is that you have to apply it more than once in order make your skin smooth.</li>
            <li> It was faster than shaving and left my skin nice and smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not expect this but for what it&#x27;s worth, the stink makes sense and is highly worth the convenience this product holds over shaving.</li>
            <li> However, the outcome is worth it.  </li>
            <li> The sensitive formula was good but it doesn&#x27;t do a good job at getting all the hair (specially thick hair).</li>
            <li> It says on the bottle not to leave it onfor more then 10 minutes, but even if you have it on for 10 minutes it doesnt completely get rid of the hair.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t think the results were worth the discomfort.</li>
            <li> For around $7, it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> Left it on for 5 minutes then jumped in the shower with warm water, all hair came off.</li>
            <li> Okay here is the reason why I bought this and my experience so far on this</li>
            <li> Yeah, that&#x27;s the part that made me nervous, but the beauty bar blocks any odor and leaves you smelling powder fresh all day(great alternative to deodorant, but I still prefer deodorant anyday).</li>
            <li> Unless you are actually allergic to the cream (read directions), it is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It sat next to the six remaining cases of Veet and with rolling eyes began to tear off its own flesh in a methodical yet detached manner.  </li>
            <li> Suggest that you trim pretty good in that area first prior to applying.  </li>
            <li> The smell is really nice - some essential oil, lavender maybe?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably about the same thing honestly.</li>
            <li> I got my moneys worth</li>
            <li> First, it is easy to dispense thanks to the pump design of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Other than that good product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the product leave my skin smooth, soft and bump free, and is pretty affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My arm hair came right off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hair came right off.</li>
            <li> right after</li>
            <li> shaving just isn&#x27;t an option for her right</li>
            <li> Hair came right off.  </li>
            <li> this one sizzled it right off</li>
            <li> right after using the Veet.</li>
            <li> The hair came right off</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll want to leave the bathroom fan running and throw your washcloth in the laundry right away.</li>
            <li> I took a shower right after using the cream and after my shower the smell was lighter but still there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I rinsed the cream off from this area right away.</li>
            <li> If you can get past all that than sure, but honestly save your money.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best I tried several versions and brands.</li>
            <li> I received this product in the mail, scared and excited I first preformed a test trial to make sure I did not end up with 3rd degree</li>
            <li> I have really senitive skin and break out from everything, so this is true to its claim because it does not cause any reaction to my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;ll smell pretty foul while doing this, but it&#x27;ll be worth it.</li>
            <li> Dropped one star because it&#x27;s messy and definitely doesn&#x27;t smell the greatest, but it&#x27;s worth it without a doubt.</li>
            <li> To rinse, I sat on the side of the bathtub with warm water running, but not directly on my legs.</li>
            <li> And  would certainly recommend it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a brief stay in the hospital, I am delighted to report I am nearly completely recovered.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely 0 irritation, although I took a shower immediately after (started with just barely warm water to not open pores until it was washed off).</li>
            <li> but it turns out that it mostly works when there is a lot of hair on the area you want to clear; and I don&#x27;t like to wait and have very hairy legs before I take it out.</li>
            <li> I cannot shave the senitive areas because my skin is just too sensitive and gets irritated easily with shaving.</li>
            <li> My once proud cervical massager retracted with such velocity that it reappeared through my rear gunner only to detach from my body and hiss downwards like a doomed U boat into the unforgiving cream from hell.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle formula that doesn&#x27;t irritate my penile parts area while manscaping.</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair and very light skin.</li>
            <li> and I must say it works very very very well.</li>
            <li> Some areas of my legs are very smooth, some small patches look untreated (mostly the backs of my thighs), and some don&#x27;t have visible hair but feel stubbly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And while she functions at about a 10 year old level, she is very aware of what her peers are doing and recently wants to follow the social norms, which is amazing for us.  </li>
            <li> Leaves stubble, although it did remove most of my coarse hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff works pretty well for me.  </li>
            <li> However you have to follow the directions exactly.</li>
            <li> Waited exactly 5 minutes</li>
            <li> and she said I should have talked to her first</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, timed exactly to five minutes, it did nothing.</li>
            <li> So I waited two more days, then applied the product thicker and waited exactly ten minutes.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it&#x27;ll do.</li>
            <li> The smell is more tolerable than the regular formula.</li>
            <li> did my air pits first.</li>
            <li> First time I used a cream hair remover.</li>
            <li> you just use it, your skin is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I think Veet as a company has thoroughly tried to come up with a scent to make the overall smell more bearable, and</li>
            <li> really do recommend this product!</li>
            <li> * first....</li>
            <li> I just used it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> It worked without burning or irritation and skin was smooth and soft, but I used a lot of it.</li>
            <li> and i am often quiet satisfied after each use.</li>
            <li> Not even sure why it only affected one part of one of my legs.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work very well at all!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it say, follow the instructions, but be cautious of your skin reaction.</li>
            <li> I used exactly as directed, and it is the &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; product.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to open windows and ventilate your bathroom or it will stink up the house all week.</li>
            <li> Not even 1 second more.</li>
            <li> It leave my skin feeling silky smooth, and soft...</li>
            <li> First of all, it does not get rid of hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying more of these later on</li>
            <li> I recommend you use this while the hot water is running (not while you&#x27;re inside)</li>
            <li> I was pretty conservative and i still shudder at the thought of trying this again.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly I am looking for which  let me wear tank tops, dresses during in summer time.</li>
            <li> exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> this product was a first for me.</li>
            <li> first placed a spot of the product on a hairy area of my body for five minutes, the recommended minimum amount of time.</li>
            <li> I can deal with the smell, and the second time I used it I got more hair off than the first time.</li>
            <li> I love this product, and wish I would only have to do it once!</li>
            <li> The formula doesn&#x27;t bother my skin but after using the spatula it is more tender and shows a couple red spots.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much just like shaving, but more messy and more of a time waster.</li>
            <li> Hair stayed gone for 2 weeks and when it grew back was thinner and more sparse.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin really smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> While it can be used to remove the cream as well, something more textured (such as a washcloth) will grab hairs that are not quite detached.</li>
            <li> Every muscle in my body went into acute spasm and my mouth let forth a silent scream of such torment that trees shed their bark in a bizarre defensive reaction.  </li>
            <li> See which did better or enough.  </li>
            <li> Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I am even able to rub it into the patches without further irriation.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time trying it</li>
            <li> for sensitive skin helps keep my legs and underarms smooth.</li>
            <li> so finding a product that works on my sensitive skin is important.</li>
            <li> After the ten minuets the scrapper took off the cream along with most of the hair.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Be sure to not do this after showering or during showering or your pores will open up, and this will go in and it&#x27;ll hurt like lawd.</li>
            <li> First of all, listen to the instructions and don&#x27;t go over 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> The hair did come off way better than my lower legs, the burn was starting to get me.</li>
            <li> It was all covered in white before I removed the product, so I just added more to see if it got rid of it.</li>
            <li> This the first time I&#x27;ve tried Veet.</li>
            <li> It definitely worked much better on my legs</li>
            <li> Especially since it is way more time consuming then just shaving and can get a bit messy.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Just be sure you leave it on for ten minutes so that it can get all the hair!</li>
            <li> Next time, I plan on scraping the gel and hair off in the shower, as it will be way more easier to keep rinsing the spatula.</li>
            <li> This was the first hair removal product i have used, And i have to say i am amazed.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t use it on the same area more than once a week, you won&#x27;t need to but thought i would warn you anyhow.</li>
            <li> This sensitive formula is definitely more gentle, though you may be tempted to leave it on longer to compensate for the somewhat less effective hair removal for thicker hairs</li>
            <li> Never used such an item before and this was such a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> Other than that the product is amazing</li>
            <li> you want a sensitive skin friendly product, try waxing or sugaring instead.</li>
            <li> i have never used any kind of hair remover other than the razor.</li>
            <li> It did leave a bit of stubble, but that could easily be my own fault due to technique (since I had never used any type of cream like this</li>
            <li> I ordered the sensitive formula but received the original formula.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for pubic areas for a complete clean hair removal.</li>
            <li> Also it does remove hair very fast and gently.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the mother of a special needs 17 year old girl.  </li>
            <li> The smell is pretty strong but you can open a window or use some air freshener.</li>
            <li> She has through her whole life been an avid shaver</li>
            <li> but then again a lot of other people seem like that had way more success than I did.</li>
            <li> So far all looks well, but I have not tried a full leg or arm yet.</li>
            <li> The hair on my legs didn&#x27;t come off completely even though I hung in there to leave it on for the full time suggested (the cream was not burning my legs).</li>
            <li> For anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried it, especially a parent of a special needs girl, give it a shot!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cross between old lady&#x27;s perfume and very strong chemical scents.</li>
            <li> Veet has way more chemicals than nair and doesnt even work not near as well!</li>
            <li> A normal razor definitely works much better.</li>
            <li> White cream that applies easily.</li>
            <li> It was smooth, no burning/itching, and most importantly, no soreness from razor bumps!</li>
            <li> If you are using this on super sensitive areas i don&#x27;t recommend removal with the plastic tool provided.</li>
            <li> Not worth it, invest in a good razor or get professionally waxed instead.</li>
            <li> Lets be smart here.  </li>
            <li> The third time, the front of my right leg was still full of hair.</li>
            <li> It still didn&#x27;t remove all my fine blonde hair somehow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I came back 8mins later, scraped it off, and it was like I just shaved (but even better)!</li>
            <li> I only left the cream on for about 5 minutes and my legs were super smooth!</li>
            <li> (I can&#x27;t shave with a razor, even epilators and hot wax kits weren&#x27;t working particularly well)</li>
            <li> Works pretty decent.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone interested in it.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin smooth for days and hair free with little to no</li>
            <li> Especially for the first time using it, following the directions was very easy as well.</li>
            <li> Does a very thorough job removing hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this product, however, I no longer have to wonder.  </li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t really go by what people say the bottle says not to use on genital areas......</li>
            <li> You have to rinse the bladeless razor after every stroke because the hair/cream will clump up on it, but that&#x27;s not too much of a hassle for me.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t really remove the hair like it</li>
            <li> works just like it says and is gentle</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> I really like the pump because it keeps the stuff from getting everywhere.</li>
            <li> It really does work in just 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have that much hair</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a bit of a scardy cat to do my whole leg, because it says not to rub in, and</li>
            <li> Just smooth skin for a day or two before the hair starts growing back in.</li>
            <li> I also started getting hair bumps which is unusual for me...</li>
            <li> Smooth after second application.&lt;br /&gt;Legs-</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really remove hair well.</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t have been any happier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never use the Veet on my underarms again because it was too much of an irritant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this was gentle.</li>
            <li> This product was able to remove the hair with minimal irritation.</li>
            <li> I think you would really need two applications for it to work well.</li>
            <li> so I was very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I was really hoping I would like this, but...</li>
            <li> It burns, it hurts, but it doesn&#x27;t really remove all the hair.</li>
            <li> works very well with no skin issues</li>
            <li> Shaving always left my legs with bumps and I could never get them completely smooth.</li>
            <li> it did not work at all!!&lt;br /&gt;i was very unsatisfied with this product</li>
            <li> I used this on my whole leg and bikini area.</li>
            <li> Now I really regret it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> , I like to use these for my underarms, and it doesn&#x27;t run or any of that, and works very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very hairy legs</li>
            <li> So I thought, yep I&#x27;m doing my whole body.</li>
            <li> I used this on my legs, arms and chest, which at the time were reasonable hairy.  </li>
            <li> This worked very well on my boyfriend and I.</li>
            <li> Well, does it really work???</li>
            <li> It made the whole house smell like a skunk....</li>
            <li> It works fast and is gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> It really works well...</li>
            <li> Works very well on my skin</li>
            <li> it does remove the hair &amp; it is so much easier &amp; faster than shaving with a razor.</li>
            <li> It did not burn however it did not remove much hair at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wiped the product away after and it removed much hair, still with NO</li>
            <li> but this one really really worked .</li>
            <li> It did make my skin softer, so if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for and don&#x27;t really care about stubble, then go for it.</li>
            <li> It works very well in hair removal.</li>
            <li> Veet is much easier on my skin.</li>
            <li> The skin feels very slippery when rinsing (I&#x27;d like to think it&#x27;s the aloe that soaked in, but who knows).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Nair as well, but no matter how much I shave off -- pun intended -- the wait time, I always get an unsightly, itchy chemical rash on my legs.</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t seem like it did much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier to get the smelly cream off your arms (or wherever you put it).</li>
            <li> Nair did absolutely nothing</li>
            <li> so after I waited the recommended time in between the process which was 72 hours, I tried again - hoping it would finally get my legs totally smooth.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work how I expected, a Razor blade works better.</li>
            <li> I really like using this hair remover.</li>
            <li> guess because the hair over there is much thicker and coarser....</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> i Applied the cream onto my Legs, waited about 9 minutes, Then gently removed it with the spatula provided.  </li>
            <li> but it really didnt feel like anything since the hairs were already half-way disintegrated.</li>
            <li> works really well</li>
            <li> Scraper didn&#x27;t work really well</li>
            <li> The red bottle for the sensitive skin is way better</li>
            <li> Missed a few spots, but nothing my handy trimmer couldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> not only that it worked poorly and was spotty at best</li>
            <li> overall i do recommend this product since it leaves your skin soft and smooth AND doesn&#x27;t require searing pain like waxing does!</li>
            <li> most of the other hair removal products just seemed like too much work.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying this product due to the low price and rather good reviews.</li>
            <li> For those whose skin is very sensitive, test it on your arms first before try it all over ur body.</li>
            <li> My skin in that area feels very sensitive to touch right now, and I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal, but it&#x27;s kinda</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t perfect - some hair was left but only a small amount</li>
            <li> I must say, I&#x27;m glad I bought this before I read some of these other reviews...</li>
            <li> This product is awesome and the color of the package I received was not blue but a dark pink purple color.</li>
            <li> Wprked better and faster than any other removal cream I&#x27;ve tried and doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> Ok so i&#x27;ve used other creams, and waxed, my arms before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different hair removal products and this is pretty good.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to follow the instructions carefully!</li>
            <li> Not as effective as nair but won&#x27;t leave your skin raw</li>
            <li> For now I&#x27;ll keep it, but not sure if it&#x27;s worth buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I had a similar experience a decade &amp; a half ago, but figured maybe I didn&#x27;t follow directions or that these products are more advanced now.</li>
            <li> I gave this product five star rating because many products say it&#x27;s for sensitive skin and long and behold your skin starts melting off along with the hair and just about everything else you placed the product on.</li>
            <li> &gt; The sensitive formula is gentle enough for even the most sensitive of areas.</li>
            <li> Although when watching it very close, you still able see a little bit hair root, it is clean enough for me.</li>
            <li> I had to leave it on for the full ten minutes, so it was a wee bit time consuming to do all the areas I wanted to.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, will order again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not painful, and i can deal with it, I&#x27;m just worried that it will worsen later on.</li>
            <li> I left it on for the full 10 min, and the hair did not want to come off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does what its supposed to, though I can&#x27;t really tell right now if it is better than shaving, at least for legs.</li>
            <li> A wet washcloth takes off all the hair easily after leaving the cream on for 5-6 minutes.</li>
            <li> typically exfoliate my skin the day before I use this and make sure I have no scratches.</li>
            <li> After patting dry, my legs were smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> The product did a decent job for my legs, but when it came for my underarms, it reacted and gave me rashes.</li>
            <li> I use a double edged scraper shaped  like a razor that came with a hair remover product I bought several years ago - this works much better and without the discomfort.  </li>
            <li> I used this product because I am particularly prone to skin infections that can result from being nicked/cut by a razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice now with decent results.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> Deep hair removal, no rash, quick..</li>
            <li> and I adopted a steady regime of 4 hours pumping followed by 30 minutes rest, but</li>
            <li> look on my underarms, which are the main issues that I wanted Veet to cure.</li>
            <li> Leave my skin soft and smooth and last longer than using  the razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly for the bikini area but also tried it on my legs.</li>
            <li> and that is the main reason i bought</li>
            <li> Well to start it does work, decently well.</li>
            <li> When the hair did grow back it was prickly, it was soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, and this is only the second hair removal cream I have used, ever, and I like it better than Nair because there really isn&#x27;t a smell, and I feel like it works</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for men and women.</li>
            <li> I should have known with my extremely high maintenance skin (one shower without lotion leaves me with peeling and itching</li>
            <li> Had I applied this during the most recent winter in New England, I could have trundled into my back yard, dropped trou and sat in the snow.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was just me, but I tried a fairly large test area in a sensitive area and did not have any reaction.</li>
            <li> I have to leave in on a little longer then recommended, but it does work for the most part.</li>
            <li> The little spatula thing just scratched my legs though a washcloth worked much better and use plenty of lotion afterwards.</li>
            <li> but I wish they could figure out a way to cover it up a little better.</li>
            <li> i am not giving it 5 stars because you have to leave it on for a little bit longer than the maximum time to make sure all your hair comes off.</li>
            <li> Veet products don&#x27;t seem to have as strong of an odor as some of the other brands.</li>
            <li> Sure, there was a little after-burn (not gonna lie) but the burn subsided after a few minutes (I didn&#x27;t count, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it hurt more than 10 minutes afterwards).</li>
            <li> This really is for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It almost completely stops the itching and the patches will disappear much quicker if you use it.  </li>
            <li> The reviews were more good than bad and it was for sensitive skin, which she and I both have.  </li>
            <li> I normally use the shower one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Most hair removal creams I try either don&#x27;t work or are too harsh for my legs.</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t write product reviews</li>
            <li> I do leave it on for the max time, 10 minutes, but it&#x27;s still better than having to shave everyday.</li>
            <li> No complaint.</li>
            <li> so there is my excuse, and my leg hair is much more coarse</li>
            <li> I know this is normal for a product like this</li>
            <li> I normally shave my underarms but was on vacation and figured I would use the cream everywhere</li>
            <li> I get a little irritation right after using it but in the morning it&#x27;s completely gone and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Left it on for ten minutes and it wiped off easily and with no irritation.</li>
            <li> so it ends up growing right back in a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have dark curly hair, which on a positive side means I have an awesome thick head of hair but on the downside I also have dark leg hair that grows FAST.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, much better than shaving (razor is potentially dangerous down there).</li>
            <li> The second time and onward have been a much smoother process after having gotten better at applying the cream and also trimming down the areas I intend to apply to.</li>
            <li> The product smells decent and didn&#x27;t burn my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Granted, its not a big deal for me since no one can really see it unless you&#x27;re up close, like real close.</li>
            <li> I shaved my legs as I normally do, and I noticed afterwards that the Veet-ed area grew back much more slowly than the shaved area which was cool, but I never used the Veet again because it was almost completely ineffective and the smell was so toxic that I had to air out my bathroom for a day.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not as near messy as magic shave.  </li>
            <li> Having read and re-read many of the reviews about this product I decided to push the boundaries of human endurance to hitherto unknown limits.</li>
            <li> I want to make that very clear.....</li>
            <li> but I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My skin is VERY sensitive, so I tried test patches on my arm and leg.</li>
            <li> I still have and use the same bottle, it does&#x27;t run out very fast.</li>
            <li> very sensitive skin soi decided to go with this.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very gentle on your skin especially if you have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to find an alternative to shaving, as I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it , very gentle formula for  the skin.</li>
            <li> Got for my daughter who has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Works still has a slightly high smell but maybe my nose is just mega sensitive.</li>
            <li> Easy to use also last me a long time.</li>
            <li> the first time it was used it just broke the hair and left hair stubs.</li>
            <li> It does not get all the way to the roots though, so I&#x27;m not sure if I can say it&#x27;s Better then</li>
            <li> I am amazed with the results I can believe I left one star in my first review.</li>
            <li> After my first use I came back and immediately put this on auto-ship.</li>
            <li> Legs feel divine and soft!</li>
            <li> The small spatula that come with the bottle isn&#x27;t too helpful, it mostly irritates your skin.</li>
            <li> Not only does it work well and FAST!</li>
            <li> The first time I left the cream on for 6 minutes and the time after that for 9 minutes.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I used it, i thought that maybe I didn&#x27;t use enough of the cream.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how well it works for darker or more course hair.</li>
            <li> However, after using it under my armpit, i could still see some short hair there after first attempt.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it only removed one patch of hair correctly.</li>
            <li> I made sure to take it all off by the time the timer hit 10 minutes, so no more burning.</li>
            <li> I wanted to be careful and clean off any chemicals because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have medium thick hair and this cream removes my stubborn hair so easily!</li>
            <li> The hair is fine so usually I don&#x27;t mess with it.</li>
            <li> The smell was pretty &amp;#34;home-perm&amp;#34; invasive, but for that little inconvenience, still very much worth it.  </li>
            <li> Unless you just have that super sensitive skin and are smart about how long you actually leave it on, it will not burn.  </li>
            <li> You may find a few hairs that didn&#x27;t get fully washed off and those hairs are easily pulled off with your finger tips or tweezers.</li>
            <li> I did use the little plastic razor that&#x27;s included, and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li> So I left the product on for a total of exactly 10 minutes(the absolute longest</li>
            <li> No reactions thus far, very pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> As other reviewers mentioned, the smell is not bad at all.</li>
            <li> The spatula was very useful and made the process less</li>
            <li> only half of the hair came off, applied more for another 3 minutes, all hair came off.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t burn my skin, and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.&lt;br /&gt;For the thick hair in my underarms wasn&#x27;t easy to remove very well.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> She has a few spots on her legs that are still healing from her infection and they were just fine.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy the little scraper that comes with this, too.</li>
            <li> My legs feel silky smooth after using this product i do not have to worry about having cuts or nicks or razor burn or those little bumps that come up after shaving.</li>
            <li> When I used it last time I had to run a razor over my legs to de-fuzz a little more.</li>
            <li> Removes most of the hair in the hard to shave areas.  </li>
            <li> cant remove tough short hair, good for arm and legs</li>
            <li> Which is nice since you can&#x27;t do it for 3 days, so by the third day I&#x27;m a little scruffy but not much, about how much it would be for me to shave it before.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well it worked without any sensitivity .  </li>
            <li> I guess this is not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Very toxic odor that insulted the entire apartment floor and made my neighbors upset.  </li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> It did about as well as an old razor.</li>
            <li> I will never be buying this again, I feel completely ripped off.</li>
            <li> Having your skin&#x27;s natural oils in place helps prevent burning.  </li>
            <li> Bought for my gf who has had some issues with infections and sensitive skin on her legs.  </li>
            <li> it doesnt take nearly 10 minutes for an application</li>
            <li> Lets&#x27;s face it to some people hair is completely out of the question.</li>
            <li> (Yes, this is at the very bottom of the second page.</li>
            <li> Not really messy.</li>
            <li> I have never considered myself to have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having heard that it burned, I was nervous to try it since I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Oh, and my legs are sensitive and burn when touched by clothing or water.</li>
            <li> Soft as silk.</li>
            <li> The item description states that packaging may vary, but I didn&#x27;t expect to get a quick-working Veet instead of the Veet for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I needed a product that would remove hair around my sensitive parts.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and get razor bumps from shaving, so I wanted to give this a try in spite of my doubts.</li>
            <li> but my hair still doesn&#x27;t come off completely.</li>
            <li> completely gone after 7-8 mins&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> Daughter loves it, and she has sensitive skin, chemical sensitivity and a perfume allergy.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and no issues so far.</li>
            <li> Veet Gel Hair Remover Cream, Sensitive Formula, 13.5 Ounce, was returned unused.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Lasted over a week so far.</li>
            <li> a couple of days after the application - i have developed acne like rash all over the application area which takes months to go away.</li>
            <li> We both have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get rid off all hair in sensitive area.</li>
            <li> , is Veet Gel Cream Pump Sensitive Formula Hair Remover, 13.5 Ounce</li>
            <li> so far this is my review and again I will update as soon as my wife tells me her results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even notice it was the sensitive formula.</li>
            <li> I used it 2 days ago and my legs are still soft.</li>
            <li> and I had some issues with chemical burns in sensitive areas but</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive skin.....</li>
            <li> Use caution with the amount of time you leave this on esp in sensitive areas like groin because it will burn the heck out of your skin.</li>
            <li> The sensitive formula dose work for me, but I have found that the shower cream formula with the sponge seems to get all the hair off easier.  </li>
            <li> My legs are smoother after using the hair removal cream compared to just shaving, but it grows back just as fast.</li>
            <li> you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Throw away your razor and try Veet Sensitive Formula</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Skin feels soft-  </li>
            <li> Eyes and nose bleeding and with the fabric of my ear drums almost completely dissolved</li>
            <li> Very displeased - would definitely not recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it in sensitive areas and had no problems.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t shave the hair against the grain in my arm pits or bikini line without leaving bumps.</li>
            <li> My skin is so sensitive that when I used Sensitive Nair</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really expect it to because of how coarse the hair is.</li>
            <li> of the hair, the thinnest and smallest are completely removed but that&#x27;s not a lot of them.</li>
            <li> Before trying Veet Hair Remover Cream - Sensitive Formula, I haven&#x27;t used a depilatory cream in years.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a gross smell and works fast too.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Veet gel cream and I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive legs</li>
            <li> Sensitive formula?  </li>
            <li> and make sure you moisturize twice a day FOR AT LEAST 3 days after you use it.</li>
            <li> I was ready to go, I started with my legs, left it 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft, no irritation to my tender parts</li>
            <li> Well I have sensitive skin and it burns me, so I&#x27;m going to stay away from it.</li>
            <li> My skin is obnoxiously sensitive.</li>
            <li> recommend this hair removing product to anyone with sensitive skin because this is the product that I use to remove hair that needs to be removed on my person.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t bother me</li>
            <li> For some background, I am a male with a very hairy butt.</li>
            <li> glad I bought the product on clearance at my local drug store, but even then I still think it&#x27;s money wasted.</li>
            <li> Veet was only able to take off a few hairs even after the max time of 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Second time, I applied heavy layers on my leg to make sure the hair was fully covered</li>
            <li> I applied it thickly and let it sit for 6 minutes, I wiped it with a luke warm wash rag and the hair came off instantly.</li>
            <li> The pump is convenient and all the hair was easily removed after the maximum leave-on time of 10 minutes (I have coarse, dark hair).  </li>
            <li> Also, the little tool is simple, effective and ergonomically designed, such that it takes up minimal bathroom space and presumably, retail space, which I think is pretty neat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Many other products, especially those that come in spray bottles, annoy me because the cans seem to contain enough to cover just three legs--</li>
            <li> Make sure to use a lot of product (I mean a lot), and get it off by 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently extremely picky about the pants and undies I wear so that they don&#x27;t rub much because I am in so much pain.</li>
            <li> this does work, has an ok smell, but watch it closely on how long you need to keep it on , test a small area to see if hair removes easily and wait maybe a little while before you re apply.</li>
            <li> I have noticed bleeding but it is really rare and always due to bumps/scratches on my skin</li>
            <li> Also If you have it for a really long time the remainder begins to smell weird otherwise its great.</li>
            <li> leg hair was pretty short but above the skin.</li>
            <li> Watched her closely to make sure she wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable or hurting in any way and wiped it off after exactly 5 minutes and NO HAIR.  </li>
            <li> It worked fine on one of my legs but on the other one it left a HUGE red rash that lasted for a few days.</li>
            <li> It removes hair like no other, and despite having relatively sensitive skin I&#x27;ve never had any skin problems from it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the times in the instructions are accurate...</li>
            <li> Just when the hair grows back it&#x27;s not thick stubble.</li>
            <li> And apparently my armpits are too sensitive for Veet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But just for removing hair off your legs armpits bikini line and following the Directions responsibly this product is definitely for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally shave or anything, actually, but decided to give this a try for kicks.</li>
            <li> so I was hoping to have success in removing the dark underarm and bikini area hair.  </li>
            <li> this is a good product, definitely recommend , especially if you are tired of shaving and in case</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s healthy using this very often down there</li>
            <li> it probably grew back quickly since i didn&#x27;t leave the product on long enough..</li>
            <li> Make sure you follow their warning not to use on your face -- it&#x27;s hard enough on your legs.</li>
            <li> all, it wasn&#x27;t a total disappointment but it wasn&#x27;t exactly great either.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I didn&#x27;t need to use much cream, this should last me for several uses.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t over use it this bottle can last a pretty long time; making it cheaper than razors, razor refills, and shaving cream.</li>
            <li> After the third time, I feel like I don&#x27;t have much product left which means that I have to go buy another bottle of this stuff.</li>
            <li> And the worse part it the smell, make sure you take a shower after using this or no ones gonna want to go near you.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before you use it, you are supposed to try it in a small area to make sure you won&#x27;t have a reaction to it and to see how long you need it to be on for.</li>
            <li> Even tho I personally need to use a really thick layer for most hairs to come of.</li>
            <li> I just wonder if it&#x27;s a good idea to shave the remaining hair, I feel weird having patches of hair left on my 75% shaven</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving my genital area for years and it always left my skin very sensitive and with razor burns.</li>
            <li> The only bad part was, despite testing it with good results first, that my lady bits got SEVERELY irritated.</li>
            <li> It barely took off any hair under the arms, even keeping it on for 10 minutes!  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin look really pretty, but at the same time I end up with itchy red patches all over my body that last for weeks.  </li>
            <li> but if you have super sensitive skin, I suggest you base your skin by rubbing some Vaseline on the area and rinsing with warm water before applying.</li>
            <li> Works on thick hairs and with quick results!</li>
            <li> The bottle and Veet website give pretty clear instructions, but I still had to leave the cream on a little while longer than they suggested.</li>
            <li> but I am highly convinced it is not made for African American women.</li>
            <li> this product removes the hair of the body and it does not have any bad side effects on my skin, but i am not so happy with the result.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works, I have pretty much shaved my whole life and razors are getting more expensive and shaving is tedious</li>
            <li> Next day, all clear, no burn, no pain, nothing.</li>
            <li> When ready to remove, the hair will look like wet cotton.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it before when a female friend of mine let me borrow it because I was unhappy with my leg hair and wanted a effective way to stunt its growth rate that shaving doesn&#x27;t really help alleviate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> always test a patch , especially if you know you have sensitive</li>
            <li> I prefer the sensitive formula to the regular.  </li>
            <li> It will made your skill sensitive leaving lots of red scratches.</li>
            <li> I am a 17 year old male.</li>
            <li> it comes with especially since the area is sensitive downstairs.  </li>
            <li> Still going to use it but do double check your product if you have sensitive legs.</li>
            <li> wife has used it so far on the following areas:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will not shave again Veet hair removal for sensitive facial skin works.  </li>
            <li> &amp; it barely removed hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only rating this product with one star because it did make my legs soft.  </li>
            <li> The reason behind it was that it was meant to be used by a lovely senior that had a change of heart once she reviewed the instructions.</li>
            <li> It makes me look like I have some kind of weird skin condition.  </li>
            <li> Gets job done if hair is long and thick, otherwise, you are better off with a razor</li>
            <li> My hair grows sooo incredibly quick, but veet makes it a little easier!</li>
            <li> But I am writing a review even though I haven’t used it yet just to let people know that if you do decide to use Nair, I found something that will help calm down the itchy red patches.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, dark, strong, and grows extremely fast.</li>
            <li> After I removed all the cream, I rinsed my legs VERY well with water only and patted dry.</li>
            <li> Slight burn within the first minute</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other depilatory creams in the past.</li>
            <li> I really like using this product, it absolutely works but one little tip: DON&#x27;T LEAVE IT ON FOR TOO LONG JUST DON&#x27;T</li>
            <li> worked but really irritated my skin and smelled strongly of wet dog!</li>
            <li> Not a single hair came off.</li>
            <li> I would say this is not good at removing thicker, tougher hair but works well for fine hair.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take as long to process and made my legs feel smooth &amp; slick.</li>
            <li> But I like that my skin stays smooth for several weeks without the need to shave, so I put up with the negative.</li>
            <li> I have only used it on my legs so far, and will also end up using it on my back eventually</li>
            <li> /&gt;I decided to try it on my (much longer, just as coarse) arm hair, waited 6-7 minutes and wiped it off with a wet washcloth.</li>
            <li> fourth, I ordered sensitive formula, got regular.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin, and this caused a red rash all over my legs &amp; my bikini area looked like it had a hundred red razor bumps all over.</li>
            <li> After 5mins was up, I used the included spatula to scrape off the gel and hair; some hair did come off, but most was left behind.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I used them was a little bit of a challenge.</li>
            <li> She was a little scared to try this at first but</li>
            <li> Still itchy a little bit at the first time using.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly, using the little scraper to remove it.</li>
            <li> On a pretty hairy little leg that&#x27;s never seen a shaving.  </li>
            <li> A couple years ago, I tried Nair to see if that would work better, and I was disappointed to find that not only was the smell absolutely noxious, but the product burned on my skin and didn&#x27;t really remove any hairs.  </li>
            <li> If you have dark hair you can absolutely forget about it,  bc</li>
            <li> I found this in a Dollar General last year but after I bought it, I was too scared to try it, because I didn&#x27;t know if it would burn or hurt my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have really think dark hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, but one minute too long of Nair</li>
            <li> I left it on for the max amount of time and it barely removed any of the hair off my stomach.</li>
            <li> it left a bare, shiny patch of skin with no stubble.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure how this&#x27;ll be useful in the slightest</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s worth the discomfort.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove all hair but does get most of it and the hair left behind is downy and very short.</li>
            <li> So I bought this exact product at Fred Meyer, for $11 because I am impatient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times now, and it takes care of my hair pretty well</li>
            <li> The pump makes it easy to get out the bottle, the pump makes it less messy (glides on skin)</li>
            <li> It works really well on my legs, and although it still takes 5 minutes to take affect it does save me the backache of leaning down to save my legs.</li>
            <li> No redness, not a single hair left.  </li>
            <li> So you use the first time and when the hair grows back does it grow back thw same or does it grow back with less hair?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with a little too much body hair for my taste, and decided to give this a shot after having done occasional trimming, rare shaves, and a few wax strips (ouch!).</li>
            <li> /&gt;She left it on for 10 minutes after testing a small spot for 5 minutes before applying it all over her legs and it took the hair right off.  </li>
            <li> Hair on my arms are thin and fine and removed it in one use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how fast I could razor all of the cream off in 5 mins with the little razor/having to wash it off</li>
            <li> This is a good one for anyone who wants to get rid of the hairs but beware this product have a weird smell and a tiny bit irritating on the skin but nothing severe.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t worth it if your hair is too thick.</li>
            <li> The last time I used it, it worked better than the first few tries, but I still had to push very hard to get the hair to come off, and then I still had to shave!</li>
            <li> Now it is safe to say I could star in a few movies if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> I slightly remembered handling the small flat object on the side but filled with Amazon review hope...</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t get enough hair off after rubbing it off with a towel you must&#x27;ve not applied enough or waited long enough.</li>
            <li> My first experience with Veet was not very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dark blonde with sensitive skin, and this product didn&#x27;t work for me AT ALL.</li>
            <li> cause it wasn&#x27;t left on long enough</li>
            <li> I left it on for 10 minutes, not wanting to redo the test sections if it wasn&#x27;t on long enough.</li>
            <li> The only reason i&#x27;m not re-ordering is it only lasts as long as shaving.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t obviously left it on long enough for the legs,</li>
            <li> : Didn&#x27;t take off all the hair (although mine is pretty thick and coarse), has the rotten egg smell that all hair removal creams do.</li>
            <li> The only problem with it is the smell and that if you don&#x27;t put a good layer of it on the area, it won&#x27;t work. :(</li>
            <li> (I usually sit down and read a book or some other kind of distraction...), but even with leaving it on for so long I still have to sit down and shave anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Notes: I have sensitive skin and dark brown hair.  </li>
            <li> considering that I used so much of it and ended up with iffy results, I&#x27;m not really sure if I&#x27;d buy this again.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as it should.</li>
            <li> The effects, however, do not last long.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long as waxing does</li>
            <li> think the issue I had with my legs was that the hair wasn&#x27;t long enough, but I wasn&#x27;t about to wait a week in the spring to test that theory.</li>
            <li> Not sensitive enough for my skin...</li>
            <li> Even after I leave it long enough, some of the hair is still there.</li>
            <li> only problem is that it burns if it stay kn to long..</li>
            <li> It worked in the recommended 5 minutes with only minor tingling.</li>
            <li> so I guess we&#x27;ll see how long the smoothness lasts, how it grows back, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hair hasn&#x27;t started growing back yet, after 2 days, which is for me, as the bottle claims, twice as long as shaving.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions, but may have left the cream on too long.</li>
            <li> but it takes me so long that I only do it once a week.</li>
            <li> Generous quantity that will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve probably used it about six times now, with liberal application and long legs, and I&#x27;ve still got some left.</li>
            <li> but I probably didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough.</li>
            <li> It does a little bit for hair, but not really that much.</li>
            <li> I completely coated half of my leg with this stuff, waited the recommended amount of time, and then checked to see that it had done nothing.</li>
            <li> I took delivery of 126 cases of Veet and for the next three days pumped every bottle dry into a dump</li>
            <li> I am a woman, but I have dark, noticeable hair in places that women &amp;#34;shouldn&#x27;t.&amp;#34; Shaving is a pain, gives me ingrown hairs, and lasts barely a day before the hair starts growing back.</li>
            <li> If your impatient and remove gel too early it doesn&#x27;t work properly.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive to reacting to harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> It was almost alarming at first, but none the less extremely successful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, definitely worth it if you&#x27;re using it on thick hair!</li>
            <li> The creme has a slight stink to it, kind of like burning hair, and is a little irritating to my skin as well.</li>
            <li> She had mentioned shaving her legs several times (as in constantly) but due to an accident with one of my razors when she was about 12 (still has the scar)</li>
            <li> Sadly, these options are no longer available to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again- too much hassle for not a good enough result.</li>
            <li> So long I forgot I had even tried it this product.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t leave it on too long or you&#x27;ll be feeling it</li>
            <li> I washed my hands well, which had already started to feel strange.</li>
            <li> No matter where I use it (or how long I leave it)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend doing a patch test, starting with the minimal time and working up from there.</li>
            <li> If you leave it on too long your skin WILL get irritated and if you feel a prickling sensation then that&#x27;s TOO long.</li>
            <li> it on too long</li>
            <li> a long time,&lt;br /&gt;-Hair</li>
            <li> it does NOT completely come off.</li>
            <li> B000WOU38S Sensitive Formula Bikini Cream with Green Tea Hair Remover by Nair, 1.7 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> It lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not surprised though.</li>
            <li> It took a long time to work and didn&#x27;t remove all my hair.</li>
            <li> No matter what cream I use my legs or how long I leave it on</li>
            <li> i am using it for long time</li>
            <li> as long as you dont get any of that cream on the inside, it&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li> And doesn&#x27;t need to be on that long to take effect.</li>
            <li> and when I took it off it did take off some hair but left me with nasty red, rough, itchy rashes that didn&#x27;t completely go away for a good two or three months.</li>
            <li> First of all this is false advertising because the bottle is purple and a different shape.</li>
            <li> I tend to have sensitive skin and did experience slight burning/tingling when I used Nair on my legs, but I did not feel a single sensation when I used this Veet--not even on my bikini area!</li>
            <li> I left it on for less than the recommended time cause it left burns on my arms...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It tends to burn only if your pores are open or if you&#x27;ve previously scratched the area you&#x27;re going to treat.  </li>
            <li> Only felt slight, short-term stinging after the application while showering with regular bath soap.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s only thick around my ankles and the rest is so thin you can only see it in the light.</li>
            <li> I now have red bumps and my legs are extremely itchy even after I showered and used a non-scent curing</li>
            <li> I have never tried any other hair remover creams before so after reading a lot of different products reviews I gave this one a shot.</li>
            <li> Red, sore, and extremely tender irritation EVERYWHERE downstairs.</li>
            <li> I have tried other hair removing creams and Veet is the only one that has worked for me.  </li>
            <li> After a wash and no burning, with only a little hair that removed I tried it again the next day with a longer time.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands &amp; formulas and keep coming back to this</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong!</li>
            <li> Just rub off with a dry towel when done.</li>
            <li> I have pretty dark, thick hair and tested this product on my stomach and hands.</li>
            <li> This is good for sensitive skin snd for people who hate razors and waxes!!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never had a single problem with it.</li>
            <li> I have a dark skin and coarse hair...</li>
            <li> Just for the record, I don’t usually have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> My hair is pretty thin</li>
            <li> Be careful you dont leave it on too long.</li>
            <li> but if you loose it ?</li>
            <li> I still prefer it to shaving down there because of razor bumps, so I will definitely continue to use Veet on my bikini area!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Veet</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only did it not remove ANY of the hair on my legs, it made the hair so fine that it was impossible to shave off with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> AND it cleaned up the dry skin!</li>
            <li> I think that my next option is waxing or going back to shaving :/</li>
            <li> I even left it on for the maximum (at one point 5 extra minutes past the maximum) amount of time and all it did was make my hair appear darker and mushy, and I repeatedly tried to wipe if off, but none of the hair came off.</li>
            <li> you will just see tiny black dots like you skipped shaving.</li>
            <li> It actually takes less time to shave with a razor than it does to apply this and wait 10 minutes</li>
            <li> Slight tingle burning sensation but waxing is similar.</li>
            <li> it only removes about half of the hair.  </li>
            <li> There was still a few spots of stubble and the hair near the ankles is still dark just below the skin.</li>
            <li> Same thing, a square about the size of half of a Hershey Bar.  </li>
            <li> Not very good for sensitive ladies like myself I guess.  </li>
            <li> the shower, my skin was very dry</li>
            <li> The smell does not last very long on your legs, but it will linger in the room for a few hours.</li>
            <li> Secondly, it does not have a bad or strong scent.  </li>
            <li> do agree with the reviewers on amazon and others that this product certainly required the maximum time to work well, and this is even on sparse, thin leg hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not any easier or less time consuming than shaving though, and I actually find wiping the cream off to be a bit more annoying, so I&#x27;ll probably only use this for a change of pace sometimes.</li>
            <li> The only reason this didn&#x27;t get 1 star is because i like the little plastic thing that comes with it to remove the cream.</li>
            <li> I put a little on and left it for the minimum of 5mins.</li>
            <li> i had to pull them off a little bit while rinsing with warm water, sounds painful</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and shaving is really hard on it.</li>
            <li> I hate the smell and it doesn&#x27;t feel particularly good, in terms of burning a little bit when I shower after.</li>
            <li> It felt the same as if I were to shave my legs, never extremely smooth,</li>
            <li> Each time I use this product my skin turns pink.</li>
            <li> So be careful and do it in the shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;Update 6/18/12&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;Spatula is not really needed for some hair removal.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s to be expected from hair removal products.</li>
            <li> I expected longer results.</li>
            <li> That being said, if you are not prepared to get messy and/or take the time to remove it properly....</li>
            <li> but you have to be careful around that area.</li>
            <li> I apply the cream and then jump in the shower and wipe it off with a wet washcloth.</li>
            <li> Not much of an odor, no burning, and no rash after using it.</li>
            <li> but it does not really leave a scent on your skin.</li>
            <li> Secondly, the idea that this product could possibly be for sensitive skin is just absurd.</li>
            <li> Careful though, you might get burned with just 6 minutes.</li>
            <li> My hair grows neither harder nor softer.</li>
            <li> As expected and DOES THE JOB</li>
            <li> still had a few stragglers so the following week</li>
            <li> some removers give me a rash, no matter how carefully I follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my legs first, and my hair is dark and rather coarse, so I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> The job it did on the hair removal felt like my legs do after about a day or two after I&#x27;ve shaved with a regular razor - not smooth at all.  </li>
            <li> I had to use a wet towel to get the rest off because the scrapper didn&#x27;t take it all off.</li>
            <li> Took longer than expected to remove hair</li>
            <li> Not the product I expected.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely not.</li>
            <li> I used it, and have absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li> it can get a bit messy and so i recommend not moving around and keeping your legs open so that the cream doesn&#x27;t smudge onto any unwanted areas!</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that I have thick hair and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> , it burned/tingled the entire time, and then left a thick waxy coat of gunk on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and thick hair,</li>
            <li> I hate shaving, but I live in FL, so ten months out of the year, it&#x27;s pretty mandatory.</li>
            <li> I did it in my claw foot tub,  and it turned the entire damn inside of my tub black!</li>
            <li> Just add a thick amount everywhere on dry skin, keep it on long enough as you can stand (20 mins)</li>
            <li> Since I have problem with my hands due to arthritis holding a razor can be difficult if not dangerous</li>
            <li> I had scabs over random pores on my legs &amp; burning for days even though I had tried a test spot with no re-action &amp; waited a few days after the test spot to do the full application as directed.</li>
            <li> You need to put on a thick layer and leave it on long enough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same thing as shaving, just a little less often..</li>
            <li> The only down side I would say it&#x27;s messy, and can go all over the place</li>
            <li> Only down side was that I could still see a few stubbles before they even have grown out</li>
            <li> It does burn a little when you leave it on that long</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> As a male with not super thick hair growth but definitely a man&#x27;s level of hair growth, this stuff worked in a single pass on each leg except a few knobly areas like knees where i should have done those separately.</li>
            <li> I was bracing myself for some burning after seeing some other reviews</li>
            <li> I trust Veet over all other hair removal creams.</li>
            <li> The scent is not over powering like other hair removal products.</li>
            <li> and unfortunately I was pretty disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ran my finger across the small patch and although I could feel the slightest of stubble,  the product left my skin</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this stuff and found it easier to use than the other methods of hair removal I&#x27;d tried in the past.</li>
            <li> other upside is NO RAZOR BUMPS or nicks.</li>
            <li> Or any other time consuming hair removal product??</li>
            <li> I probably have to shave about every other day, everywhere.</li>
            <li> After I decided to try something other then shaving I decided to try veet.</li>
            <li> , you can usually tell when it&#x27;s done if you notice the hairs peeking outside the cream or floating in it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it means I should&#x27;ve left it on longer (than 10 minutes?!)</li>
            <li> but I had a small rash on the back of my legs from eczema and didn&#x27;t notice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other hair removal creams, and they never worked.</li>
            <li> I have no more back hair</li>
            <li> There are other VEET products that are made for face use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> After using this for a couple months it is defiantly easier than shaving every other day.</li>
            <li> This product does remove body hair, but no more so then your razor, and it lasts for the same amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;Why put toxic chemicals on your body, (it smells horrid) if you can avoid it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way !&lt;</li>
            <li> one dark clouds gathered overhead whilst just five miles distant my nearest neighbours basked in glorious sunshine.</li>
            <li> I find it difficult to write in words what happened during the next moments of my now massively altered and shortened life but force myself to do so for the sake of all future users.  </li>
            <li> I had read that some other people had to apply it twice</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and didn&#x27;t experience any skin irritation like I had with other products.</li>
            <li> so I could compare it with the other leg.</li>
            <li> I do it every other week</li>
            <li> Never could I do that using the other hair remover brand.</li>
            <li> I read all the other reviews and thought that I would be immune to an adverse reaction</li>
            <li> Before you attempt to use this product read the instructions very carefully.</li>
            <li> I read the directions very carefully.</li>
            <li> On a whim, I recently decided to try out Veet because I was so tired of the constant struggle to remove the hair.  </li>
            <li> There are always multiple thicker hairs left behind.</li>
            <li> It might&#x27;ve got some that it missed previously and some from in between the processes, but that was it and the bottle was empty.  </li>
            <li> Having extremely sensitive skin, I was even more worried that I&#x27;d have some sort of terrible reaction.</li>
            <li> Super disappointed in this product, especially given some of the rave reviews.</li>
            <li> morning I tried it on a small patch of hair on my leg, immediately there was a very slight burning, but it wasn&#x27;t unbearable, so I left it on for 5 minutes, then wiped some off with a wet wash cloth like the tube said.</li>
            <li> I found Nair worked extremely well, while Veet was less than undesirable.</li>
            <li> Worked guud but hair wasnt gone as long as it says and its a little messy</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointing as I had such high hopes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff on a whim because I&#x27;ve been blessed with dark coarse hair that turns into hard stubble about 12 hours after shaving my legs.</li>
            <li> , i used it in the same spot twice in the same week, that was a bad idea since it resulted in a red rash but as long as I space the time using it</li>
            <li> Try Nair instead at least that actually works.</li>
            <li> It’s just not worth it, however, and I give up.  </li>
            <li> Everywhere else you can still see the dark roots.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the pain.</li>
            <li> you self tan and get those dark spots on your legs?</li>
            <li> My razor works better than this crap.</li>
            <li> Its a good thing nothing horrible happened.</li>
            <li> I kind of hated it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have particularly coarse or thick hair, either.</li>
            <li> I have dark thick leg hair and it only took me about five minutes to remove all of the hair from my legs.</li>
            <li> Even on thick and coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I have coarse hair and kept this on (applied thick) for 20 minutes</li>
            <li> I blame my thick Italian hair gene, so in a couple days I will be trying it again going maybe</li>
            <li> Not to mention, standing at the sink with half your hair melted off, and the other half melted to your skull.....</li>
            <li> I then continued down and around.  </li>
            <li> I might as well have shaved down there and dealt with the razor burn irritation.</li>
            <li> Hopefully the hair calms down by tomorrow</li>
            <li> and I had to scrubs myself down twice to get it all</li>
            <li> I also agree with the other reviewers that the little spatula thing doesn&#x27;t work too well.</li>
            <li> It gets my desired results for some parts, but is total useless or total pain for other parts.</li>
            <li> However if you try and reapply in under 24 hours it will burn, and I mean burn, but the shower stopped it instantly</li>
            <li> Again, for women with dark hair: This disintegrates your hair in the lotion turning the lotion black, while you&#x27;re scraping it.</li>
            <li> Using the little squeegee did NOTHING to remove the hair unless you pressed so hard it left marks on your skin.</li>
            <li> Had very minimal hair to begin with,but afterward the application the hair was still there!</li>
            <li> I waited five minutes longer and rinsed it off to reveal a very small hairless patch in the middle of the part of my leg that I had done.</li>
            <li> It only moderately angered my eczema, and after a little Cortizone TLC, my gams were right as rain.</li>
            <li> About 20% of hair was gone, and in terribly odd patches.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-A lot less work than shaving or waxing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be less work than shaving</li>
            <li> I get home and do the typical 3 minute one spot tester...</li>
            <li> It worked for less than five mins.</li>
            <li> There was a slight cooling and tightening sensation when the application reached about 7 minutes, but no side effects after washing it off.</li>
            <li> do have some issues with itching afterward, but if I keep my legs thoroughly moisturized, that&#x27;s less of an issue.</li>
            <li> like I got &amp;#34;rug burn&amp;#34; and any slight amount of rubbing makes the skin burn a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells like typical hair removing cream, but it gave me a lot of ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> I gave the 24 hour test on my upper thigh where no one would see if it went horribly wrong, left it 15 minutes before cleaning.</li>
            <li> It will feel a bit odd and you may think Wowsers can my skin get any softer lets slather on some lotion</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they altered the formulation from my previous experience to now, or if my skin has changed.</li>
            <li> less mess</li>
            <li> I made a mess all over the sink, this could have been avoided.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it just makes a mess.</li>
            <li> The blue one is no good.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first because I was afraid it was going to burn like Nair.  </li>
            <li> My hair wasn&#x27;t overly long, I had shaved 4 days before using it, and I don&#x27;t have thick leg hair, so to endure the burning to not even have it work</li>
            <li> I saw the tightly wrapped package with the amazon logo on it in my mailbox.</li>
            <li> However, it is not good for thick hair and will still burn if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I did a small patch on my leg before covering my whole leg in the cream just in case of burning or anything going wrong.</li>
            <li> Even within this patch, several long hairs still lurked, proving that even if the Veet had worked on all of my leg that I had wanted it to, I would still have had to shave to rid myself of those random hairs.</li>
            <li> It burned and was pretty painful for a few days even though I was careful to not shave 72 hours before I used Veet.</li>
            <li> It did not burn for me, I used the razor thingy that comes with it and just washed it off ever little</li>
            <li> Or sacrifice my skin&#x27;s condition to ensure every little bit of hair is removed?</li>
            <li> At this point my skin was tingling a little unpleasantly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not quite useless, but nearly!</li>
            <li> I followed all instructions, including doing little &amp;#34;test strips&amp;#34; on the areas you wish to remove hair.</li>
            <li> This lasts a little bit longer than shaving.</li>
            <li> i will say that using the spatula is a mess &amp; a waste of time.</li>
            <li> and if you don&#x27;t put a little pressure on the spatula to scrape it off, all the hair doesn&#x27;t come off</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Effectively removes hair in as little as five minutes&lt;</li>
            <li> There was no burn just a little itchiness and the smell</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little discouraging.</li>
            <li> Works well, put it on and use the little plastic spatula to wipe away hair.</li>
            <li> , i did 9 minutes and ended up with a little burn on my chest and arm.</li>
            <li> I used other creams in the past and couldn&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
            <li> I would follow the time with a little stop watch and follow the directions to the T.</li>
            <li> or that it&#x27;s just not right for my thin hair...but definitely not using it on my thin hair again without further research.</li>
            <li> It smells awful, but it makes my skin feel super soft after using it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t speak for nair, but this worked well for me and my sensitive skin, less than 5 minutes for thin hair, just over 5 for thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Works very well, but burns like crazy.</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical of the product, but I was pleasantly surprised when I tried it out.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> even  after I left it on for longer than the recommended time on thin hair.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work, waste</li>
            <li> Unfortunatelly it was a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> You have to spend a few minutes scrubbing/exfoliating the area to see results.</li>
            <li> caustic, will take your skin off along with the hair, use sparingly and only leave it on for a couple minutes,</li>
            <li> I should have known better with the horrifying ingredients list and lengthy warnings.</li>
            <li> The thing that is used to remove the cream was missing</li>
            <li> This is messy and doesn&#x27;t even get the hairs at the roots.</li>
            <li> so I got out of the shower, dried off and applied it again.</li>
            <li> And then I got cocky ...&lt;</li>
            <li> It does miss a few spots</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> Did not burn and feel like all others are a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> a couple of hairs were left behind though</li>
            <li> This foul smelling torture cream began burning my skin after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> This was a few years ago.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter that I&#x27;m a male, I was given false promises...</li>
            <li> It gave me the feeling of dry skin and having handled dangerous chemicals with bare hands (which</li>
            <li> Be careful, it burns seriously.</li>
            <li> Some say that a blind panther swung down on a rope and plucked me out with it&#x27;s claws, whilst others simply say nothing.</li>
            <li> Usually takes a little longer than 5 minutes, though</li>
            <li> Doggedly pumping the final bottles of Veet into the skip caused the loss of every nail on my hands and my lips to shrivel back hideously back into my face like an poorly preserved mummy, painfully exposing my flapping teeth nerves to the elements .  </li>
            <li> This did work well on the faint, wispy slightly darker hair that occasionally crops up on my face</li>
            <li> First of all, my bad from buying it while searching for Nair products.</li>
            <li> and I was willing to compromise, it did not burn or smell bad, but I didn&#x27;t get even close to what I paid for.</li>
            <li> I tried it once and it irritated my skin pretty badly.</li>
            <li> May work for others but for those with dark, thick hair</li>
            <li> The only 2 bad things are that there is a slight stench to the cream and you have to pay close attention to how long you have it on.</li>
            <li> next time i will try to go for the 10 minutes since it was a little difficult to wash the hairs off.</li>
            <li> buy it for my wife she had porvado other brands but this says that it is easier and less irritating to your skin</li>
            <li> This one however gave me blisters and weepy raw rash.</li>
            <li> But after using this on my legs, my legs felt raw and they burned a bit.</li>
            <li> It smells awful and burns slightly, but I could care less since it removes hair quickly, thoroughly, and without a mess.</li>
            <li> It seemed to work for other people that wrote reviews but it was not a good buy for me.</li>
            <li> I was one of the smart people who read reviews, considered it might burn or smell bad</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try as I have very dark and thick hair on my legs and shaving just doesn&#x27;t do the trick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t smell bad and works really fast.</li>
            <li> This works very well, it just smells bad.  </li>
            <li> and it really doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> after five minutes I checked it by going against the grain in a small section and nothing was coming off.</li>
            <li> Usually i put it on, leave it for seven minutes and hop in the shower.</li>
            <li> Are you lazy?</li>
            <li> But for face no more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> No irritations when used as directed (no more than 10 minutes).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not pleased.</li>
            <li> Usually wait 5-10 minutes</li>
            <li> In the past, the hair on my knees that could not be taken off by depi creams.  </li>
            <li> I usually used nair course hair shower power but wanted to compare brands.</li>
            <li> but i usually use this before shaving</li>
            <li> applied this generously to my legs and tested a small area after the 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have been buying Veet products on and off through the past 10 years (waxing, depilatory creams, in Europe and in the US),each time hoping there are improvements to it.</li>
            <li> We also have tried waxing, which anyone who has waxed knows how expensive it can be to do this properly every month or so.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This will need a few applications if you have thick hair.</li>
            <li> but I am not sure if they recommend it for that.  </li>
            <li> hoping for the next shaving, it won&#x27;t be difficult to remove them.&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
            <li> I unfortunately have the hairy Italian genes.</li>
            <li> I tried about 20 different moisturizers and they all made the problem much worse!  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work that well, hair is usually still there after use.</li>
            <li> , she turned 17 this past week</li>
            <li> I tried my groin, no more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> ugh.&lt;br /&gt;I used this on a small spot as instructed and then waited over 24 hours to use again.</li>
            <li> No more razors!?&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i had to apply the product twice since i was too afraid to apply it near the genital areas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used veet in the past on said butt and had no problems.</li>
            <li> My experience usually leaves me smelling like I bathed in bleach.</li>
            <li> The product is also so thick when wiping it off that it makes it hard to take it off of the little tool.</li>
            <li> Try that with some other moisturizer and you will make it itch worse.  </li>
            <li> So I am very skeptical when it comes to hair removal , I have tried numerous hair removal creams with no success</li>
            <li> Average rating, which means neither good nor bad, since it was not experienced due to cold feet, or should I say, cold legs?</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to but not very good for the  thicker hairs</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work well on my legs or bikini line, where the hair is very thick and dark.</li>
            <li> Not to mention it stings my skin (not good for people with extremely sensitive skins like me) and stinks.</li>
            <li> and I use it today, a new bottle of it but the same style, and it BURNS LIKE CRAZY!!!</li>
            <li> you can leave it on), I took it off against the grain as directed and all it did was make my hair look like I was in a hurry and swiped a dull razor across</li>
            <li> I have some protruding veins on my legs which are really hard to shave over,  so decided to try Veet Hair Remover Cream.  </li>
            <li> and I needed help in shaving places that are hard to reach.</li>
            <li> it works but is hard to use , won&#x27;t buy again  Daryl</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll break out if somebody sneezes on me too hard.</li>
            <li> I highly doubt I would buy this product again. :(</li>
            <li> Pros: It doesn&#x27;t smell as badly as the old versions did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Veet doesn&#x27;t stink that bad, it didn&#x27;t burn my usually sensitive skin, and I would say it removed 80 to 90% of the hair.</li>
            <li> you have ever had a bad reaction with hair removal creams before &amp; want to try this because it says sensitive - don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why some of the post on here say it sucks, or it burns.....</li>
            <li> This product sucks.</li>
            <li> So,for all the negative  reviews below...</li>
            <li> The only gripe I have with this product that may not have been said before is that it stinks.</li>
            <li> It may common knowledge</li>
            <li> I looked for the date too late, as I had already used it and received a rash</li>
            <li> The worst part is even after all that my skin still wasn&#x27;t smooth.</li>
            <li> This pain lasted for at least five hours, although there was no pain on my legs...</li>
            <li> Smells awful, but that is the name of the game with this stuff :)</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair</li>
            <li> I spread a thick layer of the cream over both of my shins.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using for the minimum amount of time and then slowly building up the amount needed.</li>
            <li> I can apply a thick layer to my skin and leave it on 5, 10, or even 20 minutes, but almost no hair comes off.</li>
            <li> I found this worked well when applied thickly.  </li>
            <li> However I had to stop using it because it is so thick that it plugged my bathtub drain</li>
            <li> I placed the product ALL OVER, and lathered it on thick.</li>
            <li> Guys if you have thick hair jump in the shower, otherwise just wipe it off.</li>
            <li> It did, I just hate how much product I have to use for it to get rid of the hair.</li>
            <li> but my hair is a bit too thick for this formula to effecivly work on my underarms;</li>
            <li> IF YOU DONT KNOW WETHER OR NOT UR HAIR IS TOO THICK</li>
            <li> THEN YOUR HAIR IS TOO THICK.</li>
            <li> I apply and keep it for 7 mins and then slowly using the spatula remove the cream.</li>
            <li> (I have fairly thick hair), and whether it worked or not varied</li>
            <li> And when I say all I mean all.</li>
            <li> The scraper that comes with it is too flimsy and too sharp making it uncomfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> No more shaving or razor bumps!</li>
            <li> no more Nair for me!  </li>
            <li> IT DOES MEAN IT WHEN IT SAYS</li>
            <li> But all that seems to mean is that the dissolving power is weaker.  </li>
            <li> I mean don&#x27;t go sniffing &amp; inhaling it.</li>
            <li> Works well does not burn bad like I read in some other reviews will burn a little if there is very little hair to be removed.</li>
            <li> The skin of my underarms became raised, red and very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have it that it has a really bad smell.</li>
            <li> I bought because of all the good reviews, and I sould have listened to the bad ones, because this product is terrible!  </li>
            <li> As for the smell, they must have upgradedthe product because it&#x27;s not near as bad as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spread evenly and ditch that pointless tool.</li>
            <li> I got terrible red bumps on my bikini line, but it worked well on the back of my legs.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I tried in in test patches all around my bikini area for differing periods of time (up to 10 minutes) but the periods of time that removed hair also caused serious skin irritation and still didn&#x27;t remove all the hair.  </li>
            <li> I would say maybe 30% of the hair came off with this as opposed to the hair which took off 95% without having to apply a ridiculous amount of pressure to your legs.</li>
            <li> Seriously just throw it away.</li>
            <li> But I was very disappointed as this seemed to get good reviews :(</li>
            <li> This product does the job though it does make my skin a little bit angry.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but those telling you it doesn&#x27;t work are either stupid or they don&#x27;t know how to use the product.</li>
            <li> Bought this stuff because I always get such bad razor burn.</li>
            <li> i swear to god it left me with burns and rashes and bad smell</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only was it painful, it didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I ended up with what I can only describe as a chemical burn that created painful welts in the creases on my underarms.</li>
            <li> I was not going to risk my groin, results not good</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t noxious, but not pleasant either.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s be honest, we are talking about a product that contains chemicals that dissolve hair, so I don&#x27;t quite understand why some people are shocked at the nasty smell which is the chemicals eating away at the hair protein.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, waste of time, painful, and I have to shave afterward anyway.</li>
            <li> In fact, it is now PAINFUL to wear long pants because my leg hair gets stuck in the fabric and pulls as I move.</li>
            <li> This product works in removing unwanted hair as it aims to but the smell is pretty horrible.</li>
            <li> Although I was disappointed, I decided to try it on my entire bikini area and leave it on for 8mins.</li>
            <li> Never will i subject myself to such horrible burns.</li>
            <li> I had to put very thick layers to make it work somewhat.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil helps and the bumps usually disappears within a couple of days!!  </li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY UNLESS BLONDE OR THIN HAIR!!!</li>
            <li> Not happy with it at all</li>
            <li> Holy crap...left me with the equivalent of the worse sunburn in my life.</li>
            <li> This crap only brakes your hair off at the skin, not the root</li>
            <li> so it looks even worse.</li>
            <li> Alright so I got tired of shaving every couple days and dealing with stubble.</li>
            <li> THis, in addition to the fact that it is so caustic, means I will not guy it again.</li>
            <li> I never experienced burning or anything, that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m taking stars off for.</li>
            <li> I’m tired of looking like</li>
            <li> I was already annoyed, but I decided to give it a try on my thighs</li>
            <li> but i was not happy with the bikini results at all</li>
            <li> you do is apply a thin layer of cream to the area</li>
            <li> IS AN ITEM FOR THOSE WHO HAVE THIN HAIR</li>
            <li> which was frustrating.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving for quite a while and got tired of it.</li>
            <li> smell isn&#x27;t as bad as other reviewers say it is.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No nicks or cuts like you get with shaving, and definitely less painful than waxing.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> and it was not a good deal!</li>
            <li> Does take a little while to wait for product to work but not too bad of a wait.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little bad</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re worried about THICK leg hair like a &#x27;winter-coat you&#x27;ve grown, or what not, don&#x27;t be afraid of usign this for it.</li>
            <li> It is thick and it stinks</li>
            <li> but the root still there plain as day, like I shaved badly.</li>
            <li> No more sitting in my tub slowly shaving my legs and no more expensive, annoying, and painful waxing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bad consumer with these sorts of products and usually leave them on until I feel them burning or tingling</li>
            <li> I hate shaving down there</li>
            <li> ,It was scary and horrible experience full of burning sensation and bloody spots..</li>
            <li> This stuff has a weird smell to it,  just use it before you get in the shower.</li>
            <li> Now I have red dots and scars all over my legs, it hurts a lot and the smell is disgusting, and it feels like my legs are on fire or something.</li>
            <li> Totally not working and smells disgusting</li>
            <li> Too expensive and</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work well at all.</li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s useless on my chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Needless to say I will never try a veet product ever again</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t work at all for me.</li>
            <li> It may work for you, but it&#x27;s useless for me.</li>
            <li> Unless I&#x27;m doing something wrong, it&#x27;s not working for me.  </li>
            <li> The tool that comes with the gel is basically useless.</li>
            <li> We do apologize if posting this review seems unfair, but it keeps appearing in our items to review page, and we are diligent to review all items.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the bikini area thing</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to do this in stores, and don&#x27;t want to try those  scary ways recommended on Youtube.</li>
            <li> The included spatula makes hair removal somewhat difficult.</li>
            <li> i ordered this after reading all the reviews,works well for me but not excellent.....</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a weird smell either.</li>
            <li> The spatula is useless, I just use a loofa thing to scrub away the hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched creams since I hate shaving, it causes tons of bumps and it&#x27;s expensive to buy a razor every few weeks-to a month</li>
            <li> time I wasn&#x27;t going to use my friends horrible advice and actually follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> I will pack it on and leave it for no more than 10 minutes!!!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re skeptical of this product, I&#x27;d say buy it and try it out.</li>
            <li> I bought some of this at the store to use because I find shaving to tedious just to result in a stubbly leg.</li>
            <li> Not perfect</li>
            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t leave that nasty chemical smell behind like the other formula of Veet and Nair.</li>
            <li> My experience years ago with Nair was not good; bad smell and didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always hated shaving as I always cut my legs especially my knees and waxing was just painful</li>
            <li> I gave Veet a shot because I was tired of shaving and waxing is painful.</li>
            <li> I was extremely nervous when applying this product because of the though of it burning my legs and leaving nasty bumps.</li>
            <li> Painful, did not work well and left my bikini area irritated and looks awful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in having to waste all the money and for it not to work.</li>
            <li> It stinks</li>
            <li> , it is dangerous.</li>
            <li> was severely disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would burn my legs or something of that sort, but I had no problems.  </li>
            <li> I thrashed and clawed around in the skip in a desperate attempt to get out</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the product stinks either.</li>
            <li> disappointing.</li>
            <li> For the thin hair, it didn&#x27;t remove it, but it did fry the crap out of it.</li>
            <li> No redness, irritated skin, or any unfortunate side effects for me!</li>
            <li> Recived the wrong product!</li>
            <li> was a bit unpleasant but didn&#x27;t linger</li>
            <li> I WAS VERY SKEPTICAL TO TRY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Very weird.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it at least twice since my terrible experience.</li>
            <li> The rash lasted for for 2 days and made putting on deodorant very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Cannot overemphasize how bad it look.</li>
            <li> Smells too bad.</li>
            <li> People have mentioned a bad odor, which I cannot agree with because there was none.</li>
            <li> when I tried it on my legs it burned so bad</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will be buying this again, it wasn&#x27;t too bad</li>
            <li> I had to spray my arm 3 times and it still smelt bad.</li>
            <li> However, it did not smell to bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, the scraper is as bad as it was 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell all that bad</li>
            <li> It do not have bad smell and also do not irritate my daughter&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> and it did not smell bad.  </li>
            <li> Smells bad during application, but doesn&#x27;t linger and does the job it needs to do.</li>
            <li> I put all kinds of things on my skin with no problem, Nair is just really, really bad for skin.</li>
            <li> product doesnt smell too bad.</li>
            <li> I get razor burn really bad and didn&#x27;t want that to effect my tattoo.</li>
            <li> However, it was HORRIBLE for the rest of my thin leg hair.</li>
            <li> And waxing is too painful.</li>
            <li> Waxing leaves my legs smoother for longer but is painful and expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got sick of shaving my legs so decided to try Veet</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely what I&#x27;d recommend if you&#x27;re sick of getting razor burn/bumps and don&#x27;t have the money or tolerance for a wax.</li>
            <li> This product STINKS!, not in bad quality, but smells, horribly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , she also tried this out and was just as disappointed as I</li>
            <li> I have never been so disappointed by a product.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed, but I thought I would give it another try</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid, this stuff is not going to burn your skin off!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kinda disappointed.</li>
            <li> I just hate it, Please don&#x27;t wast your money on this bad chemical stuff .</li>
            <li> , she&#x27;s very afraid of shaving her legs, even letting me do it.  </li>
            <li> I will say, I was stupid and put it on my ...lower..areas...</li>
            <li> I hate this product are:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> This crap eats your skin off.</li>
            <li> Please dont comment and give me crap about being a guy.</li>
            <li> The plastic scraper gets annoying because the cream and hair build up, even with rinsing it takes a bit to get off.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving because I tend to nick myself and when I have bug bites it hurts to shave.  </li>
            <li> Then to have to shave parts anyway was annoying.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;spatula&amp;#34; as they call it was worthless.  </li>
            <li> BUT, It made my legs itch SO bad!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed by this product.</li>
            <li> This is horrible compared to it.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE.</li>
            <li> Works as it should and doesn&#x27;t smell too terrible.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t smell horrible</li>
            <li> Horrible smell,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a time saver, it smells awful, and it just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> And the smell was absolutely horrific.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Smells horrible, like boiled eggs and perm&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any horrible odors as with some hair removal creams.  </li>
            <li> Worst pain ever.  </li>
            <li> This caused a TERRIBLE rash on my legs!</li>
            <li> Used according to directions and still had horrible results.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful on every level.</li>
            <li> This is the worst Sh%# EVER!!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not even the worst part for me.</li>
            <li> And it smelled horrible!</li>
            <li> I know that the burning is my fault for listening to my friends terrible advice!</li>
            <li> To those who have said that this smells terrible, it isn&#x27;t the worst smell I&#x27;ve ever encountered; to me, it smells like a perm treatment.</li>
            <li> My butt feels like the worst sunburn I&#x27;ve ever had, but no blisters.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use Nair all the time. This is horrible compared to it. It did not remove all the hair even after 10 minutes.  My razor works better than this crap. Not happy with it at all don&#x27;t spend your money on it. Try Nair instead at least that actually works.</li>
            <li> I liked Veet better than Nair.  It didn&#x27;t take as long to process and made my legs feel smooth &amp; slick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars...smack dab in the middle, because it halfway worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it my arms, no problems! Worked great! My arm hair came right off.&lt;br /&gt;No itching, no bumps. Perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my legs also and nope. Worked the same as shaving. I have really thick hair and it grows back if I even get goosebumps. It felt the same as if I were to shave my legs, never extremely smooth, just okay. I feel like I always have stubble.  BUT, It made my legs itch SO bad! I now have red bumps and my legs are extremely itchy even after I showered and used a non-scent curing lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use the rest of the bottle on my arms!</li>
            <li> Leaves stubble, although it did remove most of my coarse hair. The product smells decent and didn&#x27;t burn my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Very gentle formula that doesn&#x27;t irritate my penile parts area while manscaping. Does a very thorough job removing hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 10 minute wait. I didn&#x27;t think they even made these anymore. All hair removals are 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> In the annals of decision-making, my purchase of Veet hair remover was not my finest hour.  I opted to remove my chest hair, as the 70s are over.  I then continued down and around.  Before trying this product, I had never wondered what it would be like to have molten lead applied to my body.  Thanks to this product, however, I no longer have to wonder.  Within a minute of application in my more nether regions, I abandoned hope of ever reproducing.  Had I applied this during the most recent winter in New England, I could have trundled into my back yard, dropped trou and sat in the snow.  This would have provided wonderful, albeit temporary relief to my sensitive areas to the detriment of increasing the level of the water table in my neighborhood.  I even would have considered grabbing one of my abundant icicles, snapping off the tip and placing it where it would do the most good.  Sadly, these options are no longer available to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a brief stay in the hospital, I am delighted to report I am nearly completely recovered.  I must say that the product is quite effective, as the hair was rather thoroughly removed, along with several layers of skin and most of my dignity.  5 stars for effectiveness!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. I was bracing myself for some burning after seeing some other reviews but I truly felt nothing and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> This stuff has a weird smell to it,  just use it before you get in the shower. I was surprised at how well it worked without any sensitivity .  The only problem is that you have to apply it more than once in order make your skin smooth. the first time it was used it just broke the hair and left hair stubs.</li>
            <li> buy it for my wife she had porvado other brands but this says that it is easier and less irritating to your skin this is the second time I buy</li>
            <li> I buy this from Wal-Mart and I love it.... It works great... you can&#x27;t really go by what people say the bottle says not to use on genital areas...... That&#x27;s why some of the post on here say it sucks, or it burns..... Its not for the genital parts.... I want to make that very clear..... The only down side I would say it&#x27;s messy, and can go all over the place cuz it&#x27;s a gel-liquid.... But I really love the product....</li>
            <li> I just used it once on my arms. Applied it as the instructions suggested. But I got a lot of red spots after washing it off. I guess this is not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE. DO NOT BUY. Painful, did not work well and left my bikini area irritated and looks awful. Cannot overemphasize how bad it look. Plus still hurts even though it&#x27;s been several hours. Not worth it, invest in a good razor or get professionally waxed instead.</li>
            <li> LOL...so.  when they say, &amp;#34;Do not use on your head&amp;#34;... dont. It hurts...bad. Not to mention, standing at the sink with half your hair melted off, and the other half melted to your skull.....</li>
            <li> Do not know why this gets good rating all Veet burns my skin even if I leave it on 2 minutes</li>
            <li> Getting rid of my bikini line hair has essentially always been a battle for me.  When I shave the area with a razor, I get cuts and/or razor burn, no matter what kind of razor I use.  A couple years ago, I tried Nair to see if that would work better, and I was disappointed to find that not only was the smell absolutely noxious, but the product burned on my skin and didn&#x27;t really remove any hairs.  On a whim, I recently decided to try out Veet because I was so tired of the constant struggle to remove the hair.  I was extremely skeptical of the product, but I was pleasantly surprised when I tried it out.  I had to leave it on for 10 minutes (the maximum time), but when I pulled the bladeless razor across my skin, all of the hair came off instantly!  You have to rinse the bladeless razor after every stroke because the hair/cream will clump up on it, but that&#x27;s not too much of a hassle for me.  Also, no burning sensation! I am extremely impressed with this product and will likely purchase it again in the future.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t shaved ANYTHING in months. Used this today on EVERYTHING between my neck and knees. And I&#x27;m a man. Hair came right off. Fast, easy, and no irritation! Amazing, and will be ordering more!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. I bought because of all the good reviews, and I sould have listened to the bad ones, because this product is terrible!  it doesn&#x27;t really remove the hair like it they said it should, you can still see some hair, and it itches a lot! Now I have red dots and scars all over my legs, it hurts a lot and the smell is disgusting, and it feels like my legs are on fire or something. And it doesn&#x27;t even do the work right!&lt;br /&gt;So my reasons I hate this product are:&lt;br /&gt;1 it doesn&#x27;t work (doesn&#x27;t remove hair like it should).&lt;br /&gt;2 it burns your skin, and leaves red scars and dots all over your skin.&lt;br /&gt;3 it smells terrible.&lt;br /&gt;So I think that my next option is waxing or going back to shaving :/</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to but not very good for the  thicker hairs</li>
            <li> I WAS VERY SKEPTICAL TO TRY THIS PRODUCT. SOME OF THESE PRODUCT REVIEWS SCARED ME. BUT WHEN I PUT THIS ON THICK IN THE BIKINI AREA AND UNDER ARMS, I WAS PLEASANTLY SUPRISED! I HARDLT SMELLED ANY ODOR AT ALL. I LEFT IT ON FOR 10 MINUTES AND IT NEVER BURNED OR GAVE ME RED BUMPS OR EVEN IRRITATED MY SKIN. I TOOK THE SPATULA AND SWIPED IT AND IT WAS FULL OF HAIR. i RINSED IT IN THE SINK AND CONTINUED UNTIL MOST OF THE VEET WAS GONE. THEN I WASHED IT OFF IN THE TUB WITH WARM WATER AND LOOKED. THERE WASN&#x27;T ANY HAIR AND MY SKIN FELT SO SMOOTH AND SILKY.THIS IS MY ANSWER TO SMOOTH SILKY SKIN WITHOUT SHAVING. I WOULD RECCOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE! i LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Not very good for sensitive ladies like myself I guess.  Very toxic odor that insulted the entire apartment floor and made my neighbors upset.  I don&#x27;t use many nair/veet type products but this stuff had a weird way of making the leg hair look melted before it started to give me an insanely painful chemical burn that lasted a good week or more.</li>
            <li> This crap eats your skin off. Good luck. I&#x27;ll stick to freeking shaving.</li>
            <li> I use this for my ears, ha. NO SHAME! I just put this on, let it sit for 10 minutes, and poof! It&#x27;s gone. I&#x27;ve read some reviews of people complaining about the smell but what do you expect from something that&#x27;s zapping away your hair! I use it before I shower so I can wash it right away and the smell goes away!</li>
            <li> This stuff works pretty well for me.  I use it on my chest, stomach and lower back.  I have to leave in on a little longer then recommended, but it does work for the most part.</li>
            <li> works just like it says and is gentle</li>
            <li> Works really well. Though I do have eczema so I need to soak in oatmeal afterwards to ensure I dont get itchy. Other than that good product.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin! And got chemical burns using nair several years ago so I was super nervous about using anything else. I tested it on a small part of my body (elbow) to start and timed it for exactly 5min. I used the spatula it came with and it worked great, came right off and no burning or itching. I used on legs and underarms now and have not had any issues. However you have to follow the directions exactly. After removing hair I washed with soap (unscented) immediately. I had to moisturize (unscented) right after but that was just precautionary. Would use again.</li>
            <li> I trust Veet over all other hair removal creams. I really enjoy the little scraper that comes with this, too. It works wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended Veet to people on Twitter, Facebook, etc. I cannot say enough about how wonderful this stuff works.</li>
            <li> Took all my hair off.</li>
            <li> Before you attempt to use this product read the instructions very carefully. Veet cannot remain on your skin for any longer than 10min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure the results vary from person-to-person. However, for me the results aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;phenomenal&amp;#34;. Each time I use this product my skin turns pink. It almost makes me want to go back to shaving. It is a quick &amp; easy approach to removing body hair, but I find that I have to use Veet almost as often as I would with shaving...not impressed.</li>
            <li> Works as it should and doesn&#x27;t smell too terrible. I really like the pump because it keeps the stuff from getting everywhere.</li>
            <li> cant remove tough short hair, good for arm and legs</li>
            <li> Best hair remover on the market.  It really does work in just 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> PERFECT! I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND WILL CONTINUE TO BUY!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Works fine. Usually takes a little longer than 5 minutes, though</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t speak for nair, but this worked well for me and my sensitive skin, less than 5 minutes for thin hair, just over 5 for thick hair. Absolutely 0 irritation, although I took a shower immediately after (started with just barely warm water to not open pores until it was washed off).</li>
            <li> I tried this product and it did not work at all. I followed the directions and it didn&#x27;t take any hair off. I even left it on for the maximum (at one point 5 extra minutes past the maximum) amount of time and all it did was make my hair appear darker and mushy, and I repeatedly tried to wipe if off, but none of the hair came off. Because of all the wiping I ended up with irritated skin. Since it left my hair with such a weird texture I wasn&#x27;t even able to shave it off until the next day. The product is also so thick when wiping it off that it makes it hard to take it off of the little tool. It seemed to work for other people that wrote reviews but it was not a good buy for me. I highly doubt I would buy this product again. :(</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!  Does the job very thoroughly and quickly!  I would definitely recommend to everyone - thank you!</li>
            <li> I used to have my legs waxed which works wonderfully but is much more expensive.  I tried Veet for my legs and underarms, using it for the suggested period.  It didn&#x27;t sting, didn&#x27;t smell and did work to remove all the hair.  I don&#x27;t have that much hair but I found it very effective.  I&#x27;d recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> This veet cream works okay on your arms and legs. However, it is not good for thick hair and will still burn if you have sensitive skin. Make sure to test it everywhere you want to use it. Also, I still had to shave after using it because it left some hair... even  after I left it on for longer than the recommended time on thin hair. I would not recommend it unless you just cannot shave your arms and legs for some reason.</li>
            <li> Works well does not burn bad like I read in some other reviews will burn a little if there is very little hair to be removed. Does take a little while to wait for product to work but not too bad of a wait. It does have a strong odor though but that can be overlooked if it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I have never tried any other hair remover creams before so after reading a lot of different products reviews I gave this one a shot. I did a small patch on my leg before covering my whole leg in the cream just in case of burning or anything going wrong. Waited exactly 5 minutes and I was impressed to see how well the hair actually came off. It does not get all the way to the roots though, so I&#x27;m not sure if I can say it&#x27;s Better then shaving. Besides not getting any razor bumps. It did not burn for me, I used the razor thingy that comes with it and just washed it off ever little stroke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does what its supposed to, though I can&#x27;t really tell right now if it is better than shaving, at least for legs. It takes some time and I&#x27;m a bit of a scardy cat to do my whole leg, because it says not to rub in, and I don&#x27;t know how fast I could razor all of the cream off in 5 mins with the little razor/having to wash it off a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to try armpits or bikini area though.</li>
            <li> I really like using this product, it absolutely works but one little tip: DON&#x27;T LEAVE IT ON FOR TOO LONG JUST DON&#x27;T</li>
            <li> Great Product! Makes hair removal easy. The scent is not over powering like other hair removal products. I use it for my armpits and bikini line. It works great on my sisters legs and the re-growth is a lot softer. The sensitive skin formula is great but if you have super sensitive skin, I suggest you base your skin by rubbing some Vaseline on the area and rinsing with warm water before applying. Do not leave on longer than needed. When ready to remove, the hair will look like wet cotton.Give it a try.</li>
            <li> There are some reviews that swear by it, so I figured I would give it a go..&lt;br /&gt;I tried it out on one leg and unfortunately I was pretty disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t smell horrible but it reminds me of the smell of Nair just not so strong, and even after a shower it kind of left that chemical stench on my leg.&lt;br /&gt;Now for what its \\&quot;supposed\\&quot; to do... after five minutes I checked it by going against the grain in a small section and nothing was coming off. So I left the product on for a total of exactly 10 minutes(the absolute longest you can leave it on), I took it off against the grain as directed and all it did was make my hair look like I was in a hurry and swiped a dull razor across my leg.&lt;br /&gt;Some hairs were longer, some were shorter, in NO way did this product give me that smooth skin it promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A day later I talked to my friend about my results with this and she said I should have talked to her first, she also tried this out and was just as disappointed as I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:&lt;br /&gt;So it has been quite a while since this last review. So long I forgot I had even tried it this product. There I was, in Walgreens hoping to find something magical. Sometimes shaving is agonizing for me. After contemplating ripping the hair out with the torture devices that claim to be the best. I turned to Amazon reviews for support. This product was the highest rated one. I slightly remembered handling the small flat object on the side but filled with Amazon review hope... I purchased the product. Again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a small patch of hair for six minutes and wiped it off with a hot rag. Wow. The hair all came off. I ran my finger across the small patch and although I could feel the slightest of stubble,  the product left my skin silky.&lt;br /&gt;24 hours later now both of my legs are done and feeling silky. I am amazed with the results I can believe I left one star in my first review. I just needed to give it another go. As for the smell, they must have upgradedthe product because it&#x27;s not near as bad as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spread evenly and ditch that pointless tool. Use a warm wash rag and six minutes is really all you need.</li>
            <li> The waiting period is unnerving. Do I scrape away now and risk not getting everything? Or sacrifice my skin&#x27;s condition to ensure every little bit of hair is removed? Find out next time on Dragon Ball Z!</li>
            <li> This stuff works amazingly for me. I&#x27;m a guy with a little too much body hair for my taste, and decided to give this a shot after having done occasional trimming, rare shaves, and a few wax strips (ouch!). I have only used it on my legs so far, and will also end up using it on my back eventually I imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used them was a little bit of a challenge. The bottle and Veet website give pretty clear instructions, but I still had to leave the cream on a little while longer than they suggested. Around 7-8 minutes as opposed to 5-6.  The second time and onward have been a much smoother process after having gotten better at applying the cream and also trimming down the areas I intend to apply to. No redness, irritated skin, or any unfortunate side effects for me! Just smooth skin for a day or two before the hair starts growing back in. I only use it every 2-4 weeks and it&#x27;s just fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this stuff and found it easier to use than the other methods of hair removal I&#x27;d tried in the past.</li>
            <li> used once and did really good</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed by this product. The first time I used it, timed exactly to five minutes, it did nothing. But I only had two days of growth on my legs. So I waited two more days, then applied the product thicker and waited exactly ten minutes. It did about as well as an old razor. There were patches of smooth skin, but many areas that still had hair. And if I have to go over it again with a razor to get the desired effect, I might as well just shave anyway! Plus, I can&#x27;t imagine waiting to be that hairy every time I wish to use it. I will never be buying this again, I feel completely ripped off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dude. I put this on my junk. It took the hair off. It did not hurt. I&#x27;m happy. Follow the instructions. Some advice - Don&#x27;t shower before applying this stuff.  Having your skin&#x27;s natural oils in place helps prevent burning.  If you&#x27;ve been working out or whatever, wait for the skin to recover a day or so before applying this.</li>
            <li> I like this product. Does exactly what it says it&#x27;ll do.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a replacement after being a lifetime Nair user. Purchased this after reading reviews that this did not burn. I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, but one minute too long of Nair and I was immediately patchy red, which turned into bumps and scabs for several days to a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Hair drying cream for all your hair removal needs</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a keeper!! After my first use I came back and immediately put this on auto-ship. Absolutely the best hair remover. LOVE the pump bottle!! 5 minutes and hair is GONE!! Hair is gone for a lot longer than with shaving my legs!  Veet Gel doesn&#x27;t drip or run.  It doesn&#x27;t burn, doesn&#x27;t sting!!  The spatula that comes with it is a great tool for getting rid of every single hair.</li>
            <li> Bought for my gf who has had some issues with infections and sensitive skin on her legs.  She was a little scared to try this at first but shaving just isn&#x27;t an option for her right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She tried it last weekend and loved it.  It wasn&#x27;t perfect - some hair was left but only a small amount and as she gets used to it she informed me she thinks she&#x27;ll get it all next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She left it on for 10 minutes after testing a small spot for 5 minutes before applying it all over her legs and it took the hair right off.  She has a few spots on her legs that are still healing from her infection and they were just fine.  No burns or discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be ordering this again!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re worried about THICK leg hair like a &#x27;winter-coat you&#x27;ve grown, or what not, don&#x27;t be afraid of usign this for it. it doesnt take nearly 10 minutes for an application so theres no worry about going over jsut because you feel inclined to with thicker or courser hair. As a male with not super thick hair growth but definitely a man&#x27;s level of hair growth, this stuff worked in a single pass on each leg except a few knobly areas like knees where i should have done those separately. I&#x27;ve used it before when a female friend of mine let me borrow it because I was unhappy with my leg hair and wanted a effective way to stunt its growth rate that shaving doesn&#x27;t really help alleviate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other upside is NO RAZOR BUMPS or nicks. always test a patch , especially if you know you have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Lets&#x27;s face it to some people hair is completely out of the question. This is where Veet comes in. I purchased the Pump bottle and it came in three days. I saw the tightly wrapped package with the amazon logo on it in my mailbox. I teared through the tape and ran into the bathroom. I propped my leg on the counter and went to work with the spatula, spreading the cream on my legs. Waited the five minutes with a song playing. I took the spatula and removed the cream washing the spatula off in the sink. I admired the smoothness of legs. No cuts, roughness or anything, just smooth and sexy legs. People like to complain about the smell, but the smell is just like loation, not anything too strong or offensive. I really love this,I even threw away my razor. Veet all the way baby. But follow the instructions, do it in the shower. I made a mess all over the sink, this could have been avoided. So be careful and do it in the shower. Please dont comment and give me crap about being a guy. I swim and having smooth legs helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;Update 6/18/12&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;Spatula is not really needed for some hair removal. Sometimes it just makes a mess. Usually i put it on, leave it for seven minutes and hop in the shower.</li>
            <li> This product sucks. All it did was make me break out in red bumps all over the area that I applied it. Veet In shower hair removal is way better and alot faster.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work, waste if money and it made my skin bleed</li>
            <li> I prefer the sensitive formula to the regular.  The smell is more tolerable than the regular formula. It works just as good as the regular formula.  Its removed all leg hair with 4 minutes. The spatula was very useful and made the process less messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great product and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I liked this so much I used it all up, I will be placing another order soon.</li>
            <li> Great volume for this price, it works pretty well. Like it</li>
            <li> Does anyone click on &amp;#34;really liked it&amp;#34; for a product that is a corrosive chemical designed to burn hair from our bodies and smell like someone holding a lighter to a pile of hair? It works though that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> Very effective and doesn&#x27;t burn skin like other products did.</li>
            <li> It does not get to the root of the hair as deeply as I&#x27;d like. I&#x27;m a waxer but am in an environment where waxing can&#x27;t be done so I opted for the Veet hair gel so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about coarse hair from shaving... well, I ended up having to shave anyway. The day or or next day... This doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as it should. I also started getting hair bumps which is unusual for me... before I shaved.</li>
            <li> works great legs and every thing i  use it on is smooth</li>
            <li> I use this for my thigh areas - works for the most part, not perfect.  Removes most of the hair in the hard to shave areas.  Does what I need.  Try for your own results.</li>
            <li> I read some of the one star reviews below, and Im not sure,but maybe the formula has improved or something... because this product worked great for me! I actually bought this at CVS (ugh since summer is  coming and I needed to shave...(does not look forward to it..)I was looking for one of those 10-20 dollar razors,but the one I wanted based on amazing reviews was not in stock so I ended up purchasing this instead to try. I must say, I&#x27;m glad I bought this before I read some of these other reviews... On with my review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you dislike shaving?Waxing? Or any other time consuming hair removal product?? Are you lazy? If you answered &#x27;yes&#x27; to these answers then this product might be suitable for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, you are suppose to test an area and leave it on for 5-10 mins max and see what happens within 24 hours. (Yes, this is at the very bottom of the second page. Yes, I know... I was so excited and missed that the first time.Its a good thing nothing horrible happened.( I did do a test swatch,just did not wait the 24 hours after) So,for all the negative  reviews below... perhaps you did not do that??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did my air pits first. 5-6 minutes per side, separate applications. I did time my application like the directions said. Apply ample amount of cream otherwise, everything wont come off. Do not skimp on the application,you have a whole container that should  last you a few months.I read from one of the reviews to wipe off using a rag. This was a great tip.This product is cream based, so a rag works best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My results:&lt;br /&gt;Arm pits-smooth day one,day 6 (today) feels as if I shaved.&lt;br /&gt;Bikini area-first application missed bits and pieces of hair. I waited 72 hrs,as per directions. Smooth after second application.&lt;br /&gt;Legs- Had very minimal hair to begin with,but afterward the application the hair was still there! Granted, its not a big deal for me since no one can really see it unless you&#x27;re up close, like real close. You are betteroff using Nair if you want super smooth legs. I normally use the shower one.&lt;br /&gt;I did not shave my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;I like it. Its easy.Not really messy.I also used gloves,so I would not have to worry about making sure the product was off my hands. I recommend to everyone who is not a big fan of shaving!</li>
            <li> works better than shaving</li>
            <li> First time I used a cream hair remover. As other reviewers mentioned, the smell is not bad at all. I used it on my bikini line and the back of my legs. I got terrible red bumps on my bikini line, but it worked well on the back of my legs. I can&#x27;t say that it lasts a lot longer than shaving. I also agree with the other reviewers that the little spatula thing doesn&#x27;t work too well. A wet washcloth takes off all the hair easily after leaving the cream on for 5-6 minutes.</li>
            <li> I left it on for less than the recommended time cause it left burns on my arms... I have never considered myself to have sensitive skin. Obviously didn&#x27;t remove all hair cause it wasn&#x27;t left on long enough</li>
            <li> Works on thick hairs and with quick results! Just follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> This review is specific for men out there who are looking for cream to remove hair from the genital area.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving my genital area for years and it always left my skin very sensitive and with razor burns. My wife suggested I try a hair removal cream so I decided to give this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;This cream worked great for me. It removed all my hair and it didn&#x27;t burn at all. Even the smell wasn&#x27;t bad.&lt;br /&gt;Once I applied the cream all over, I waited 9 minutes (didn&#x27;t want to risk the 10 minutes maximum) and then used the spatula to remove all the cream and hair. I would recommend wipe the hair on tissue paper and throw it in the trash since you don&#x27;t want this goo in your drain.&lt;br /&gt;Once I removed as much as I can, I rinsed the rest with warm water in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;After the shower, my skin was very dry so I used moisturizing cream on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;This was a simple, painless and great experience. It was faster than shaving and left my skin nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Since I didn&#x27;t need to use much cream, this should last me for several uses.</li>
            <li> worked but really irritated my skin and smelled strongly of wet dog!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome and the color of the package I received was not blue but a dark pink purple color. The only gripe I have with this product that may not have been said before is that it stinks. I did not expect this but for what it&#x27;s worth, the stink makes sense and is highly worth the convenience this product holds over shaving.</li>
            <li> Great product that works very well for my needs. Thank you for offering a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  Need to leave on a bit longer though.</li>
            <li> This sensitive formula is definitely more gentle, though you may be tempted to leave it on longer to compensate for the somewhat less effective hair removal for thicker hairs</li>
            <li> I use this for my nether regions. It&#x27;s great, much better than shaving (razor is potentially dangerous down there). It does the job quickly and effectively. No bumps, no burns, no cuts</li>
            <li> To get rid of any hair you have to smother it on and then I wait the 10 minutes sometimes longer. Then I wipe it off in the shower like another review said. Most of the time it does get quite a bit of the hair but it doesn&#x27;t get all of it. I still end up having to shave after. I made the mistake of trusting it to make my legs smooth and my legs still felt prickly after. Also the hair grows back just as if I had shaved. I will not be buying this products again.</li>
            <li> I felt my skin sting after using it.</li>
            <li> Works well for me.I have to leave it on for the full 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Most hair removal creams I try either don&#x27;t work or are too harsh for my legs. NOT THIS ONE. It is simply amazing and a great price for the quantity too! I don&#x27;t have any burning sensations at all and when I finish, all the hair is gone! The effects, however, do not last long. I&#x27;ve found that my legs stay hairless for the same amount of time a good shape would, maybe one day more.</li>
            <li> I was expecting sooo much more from this product, however it is the same if you shave (messier and more expensive!).&lt;br /&gt;When you just use it, your skin is smooth and soft. But in the next day you&#x27;ll have hairs growing up everywhere!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> The product did a decent job for my legs, but when it came for my underarms, it reacted and gave me rashes. Ouch!&lt;br /&gt;If you want a sensitive skin friendly product, try waxing or sugaring instead.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have tried other brands that caused a lot of irritation, but this brand and formula (sensitive) is wonderful.  It is all that I use now and simply love it and the results.</li>
            <li> It smells awful and burns slightly, but I could care less since it removes hair quickly, thoroughly, and without a mess.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really remove hair well. Horrible smell, but that&#x27;s to be expected from hair removal products.</li>
            <li> Does the job. Smells too bad. It will made your skill sensitive leaving lots of red scratches.</li>
            <li> I have never been so disappointed by a product. I used this before a big event to make my legs \\&quot;silky smooth\\&quot; as they promise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let it sit for 10 minutes, the max it recommends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did it not remove ANY of the hair on my legs, it made the hair so fine that it was impossible to shave off with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the hair literally will not come off my legs. And it has managed to make the hair follicles on my legs more defined and noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I bought the product on clearance at my local drug store, but even then I still think it&#x27;s money wasted.</li>
            <li> Totally not working and smells disgusting</li>
            <li> Seriously. Anything this stuff touches is gone. Just don&#x27;t leave it on too long or you&#x27;ll be feeling it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years. The first couple I LOVED it!! I really couldn&#x27;t have been any happier. However, ever since last year I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t work at all. I&#x27;m a bad consumer with these sorts of products and usually leave them on until I feel them burning or tingling (I usually sit down and read a book or some other kind of distraction...), but even with leaving it on for so long I still have to sit down and shave anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only assumption is that last year the product formula got changed. What a bummer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got to give this product 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s be honest, we are talking about a product that contains chemicals that dissolve hair, so I don&#x27;t quite understand why some people are shocked at the nasty smell which is the chemicals eating away at the hair protein. I think Veet as a company has thoroughly tried to come up with a scent to make the overall smell more bearable, and this I appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do agree with the reviewers on amazon and others that this product certainly required the maximum time to work well, and this is even on sparse, thin leg hair.  However, the outcome is worth it.  Also, the little tool is simple, effective and ergonomically designed, such that it takes up minimal bathroom space and presumably, retail space, which I think is pretty neat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What i love most is the cost effectiveness of this product. Many other products, especially those that come in spray bottles, annoy me because the cans seem to contain enough to cover just three legs-- Too expensive and inconvenient!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the product leave my skin smooth, soft and bump free, and is pretty affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cannot comment on the effectiveness on more \\&quot;delicate\\&quot; areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this with 2 week unshaven legs (school&#x27;s out... give me a break!). Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work well at all. Extremely disappointing as I had such high hopes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having heard that it burned, I was nervous to try it since I have sensitive skin. However, I gave it a go tonight. I spread a thick layer of the cream over both of my shins. I washed my hands well, which had already started to feel strange. It gave me the feeling of dry skin and having handled dangerous chemicals with bare hands (which, I suppose I just did). If I try this again it&#x27;ll be with gloves. I set a timer on my phone and waited. At the five minute mark, I used the included spatula to scrape some of the cream off. The hair remained, so I waited another three minutes. At this point my skin was tingling a little unpleasantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stepped into the shower and hosed off my legs. The cream still remained, so I needed to wash it off with my hands. I removed the last of the cream with a paper towel and examined my legs. About 20% of hair was gone, and in terribly odd patches. I read another review on here which suggested to wipe hair off against the growth, which I then did. I used up a handful of paper towels wiping my legs upward, which after five minutes of constant scrubbing I ended up with 66% of hair gone. That left another 1/3 still there in the oddest of places and patterns. There&#x27;s no way I could go out like this, so I ended up having to shave afterwards. I&#x27;m not really sure how this&#x27;ll be useful in the slightest if it&#x27;s a huge hassle, and I have to shave anyway. Oh, and my legs are sensitive and burn when touched by clothing or water.</li>
            <li> It burns read this s*** first....TRUST ME</li>
            <li> It removes hair, which is what it  is supposed to. I hate the smell and it doesn&#x27;t feel particularly good, in terms of burning a little bit when I shower after. But I like that my skin stays smooth for several weeks without the need to shave, so I put up with the negative.</li>
            <li> I have the most obnoxious hair. It&#x27;s thick, dark, strong, and grows extremely fast. I probably have to shave about every other day, everywhere. It&#x27;s not such a big deal in winter, but come summer I want hair gone. I&#x27;ve used various gel removers and on a whim decided to try Veet. I tried it on my chest, underarms, bikini, and legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My chest hair is the thickest, stubbornest, and fastest growing hair on all of my body. Veet was only able to take off a few hairs even after the max time of 10 minutes. So, it&#x27;s useless on my chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My underarms couldn&#x27;t handle it. It burned and was pretty painful for a few days even though I was careful to not shave 72 hours before I used Veet. It was probably on my underarms for about 3 minutes. I&#x27;ll never use the Veet on my underarms again because it was too much of an irritant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bikini was a total win. I put it on for the max time  (10 mins) and there was no pain and the result was super baby butt smooth.  Loved it! However, my stubborn hair started growing back after 3 days...better than shaving, but still! I expected longer results. I still prefer it to shaving down there because of razor bumps, so I will definitely continue to use Veet on my bikini area!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Veet worked wonders on my leg hair; the most fine of my body hair. I only left the cream on for about 5 minutes and my legs were super smooth! Hair didn&#x27;t grow back for about 4 days. Not bad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, Veet is a total hit or miss on my body. It gets my desired results for some parts, but is total useless or total pain for other parts. For now I&#x27;ll keep it, but not sure if it&#x27;s worth buying more when I run out. Once the bottle is finished I&#x27;ll probably try to find another product or move on to sugaring.</li>
            <li> It causes some breakout on the areas that i used it in but it does do the job. I would recommend using for the minimum amount of time and then slowly building up the amount needed.</li>
            <li> I am a member of the Veet Vixens on Crowdtap &amp; may receive perks &amp; rewards as a member. I love this product. It doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin and works perfectly! I would recommend this is anyone.</li>
            <li> The sensitive formula was good but it doesn&#x27;t do a good job at getting all the hair (specially thick hair). It also split have way through the bottle and I had to through it out. The red bottle for the sensitive skin is way better and I am currently using it. The blue one is no good.</li>
            <li> Removes every hair no rash or burn like a baby skin smooth</li>
            <li> I just used it for the first time.  I slathered up both legs, waited 10 minutes (I wanted to see if my skin would start burning, just so I would know) then hopped in the shower and wiped it off with a washcloth.  Some areas of my legs are very smooth, some small patches look untreated (mostly the backs of my thighs), and some don&#x27;t have visible hair but feel stubbly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe after another use or two, it will all be smooth.  I&#x27;m going to wait a day or two and try again, to see how it works then.</li>
            <li> works great but beware of burns</li>
            <li> It works fairly well as long as you follow the directions, I&#x27;ve used it numerous time with pretty good results. People have mentioned a bad odor, which I cannot agree with because there was none. That being said, if you are not prepared to get messy and/or take the time to remove it properly....stick to shaving or waxing.</li>
            <li> This was very effective! Especially for the first time using it, following the directions was very easy as well. It doesn&#x27;t harm your skin either. I guess that depends on the person but I have very sensitive skin and this was gentle.</li>
            <li> Soft as silk. Will buy it again!</li>
            <li> It says on the bottle not to leave it onfor more then 10 minutes, but even if you have it on for 10 minutes it doesnt completely get rid of the hair. This is only gunna work if you have thin light hair. Its only worked for me if i shave the day before. It does work, its just not as great as i thought it was.</li>
            <li> The item description states that packaging may vary, but I didn&#x27;t expect to get a quick-working Veet instead of the Veet for sensitive skin. My skin is VERY sensitive, so I tried test patches on my arm and leg. So far all looks well, but I have not tried a full leg or arm yet. I will follow others&#x27; advice on use.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that I have thick hair and sensitive skin. This product was able to remove the hair with minimal irritation.</li>
            <li> I needed a product that would remove hair around my sensitive parts. This is it! I will never shave there again nor will I ever wax, no need to with this product. It worked without burning or irritation and skin was smooth and soft, but I used a lot of it. You need to put on a thick layer and leave it on long enough. I think I left it on for 11 minutes and then stepped in the shower to remove it. Color me happy AND hairless!</li>
            <li> There are so many good things about this product.  First, it is easy to dispense thanks to the pump design of the bottle.  Secondly, it does not have a bad or strong scent.  Thirdly, it does not burn when left on the skin for the directed amount of time.  Finally, it works wonderfully!  My legs have never been so smoooth!</li>
            <li> I have tried this product several times, and it just doesn&#x27;t work. I leave it on the max amount of time, and I still have to SCRAPE with the spatula they give you. The last time I used it, it worked better than the first few tries, but I still had to push very hard to get the hair to come off, and then I still had to shave! It takes me a good 10-15 minutes to shave in the shower, and by using this product I added another 20 minutes! It&#x27;s not a time saver, it smells awful, and it just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This hair remover is ok. I think you would really need two applications for it to work well. The skin still feels prickly and hurts somewhat. I also get ingrown hairs. The hair is back in about four days. Shaving might just be a better option.</li>
            <li> I have a dark skin and coarse hair... this product did not work for me at all. Unfortunatelly it was a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> After I decided to try something other then shaving I decided to try veet. I tested it on my arm and it worked and didn&#x27;t burn at all however when I tried it on my legs it burned so bad and when I took it off it did take off some hair but left me with nasty red, rough, itchy rashes that didn&#x27;t completely go away for a good two or three months. Needless to say I will never try a veet product ever again</li>
            <li> I am a 17 year old male. I just got this and just used it. I was super nervous so iw arched a video then tried this.&lt;br /&gt;I applyed it with my hans to my thighs for 10-15 minutes and the hair came off, end of story.&lt;br /&gt;Then I used it on my face, 10 min later the hair came off, end of story.&lt;br /&gt;Then I decided to try the private area. And it worked perfect. 10 minutes and it was all off with no burn.&lt;br /&gt;The hands werebunaffected through the entire exposure and 1 hour later so... However if you try and reapply in under 24 hours it will burn, and I mean burn, but the shower stopped it instantly so I was very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;This obviously is for guys and everyone does have a different sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;Girls, I don&#x27;t know as you would want to risk it, it tinggles open cuts and will make them all white, so... Be carful.</li>
            <li> It stinks but it works well. Even tho I personally need to use a really thick layer for most hairs to come of.</li>
            <li> I was eager to try this, because i&#x27;ve tried waxing and shaving and thought this would be good to try. I used it on my legs and my armpits.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-I was quite impressed with how the hair came off on my legs, leaving it nice and silky smooth. Especially the knees, which I always cut when I&#x27;m shaving.&lt;br /&gt;-The smell isn&#x27;t as bad as other reviewers say it is.&lt;br /&gt;-A lot less work than shaving or waxing.&lt;br /&gt;-No missed hairs&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It is a bit messy.&lt;br /&gt;-Part of my knee with skinned and I thought since it wasn&#x27;t an open wound, there would be no burn. WRONG!&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t work too well with coarse armpit hair. Much more effort than a quick shave in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would use it again with my legs, but not my armpits. Legs feel divine and soft! Great product!</li>
            <li> great deal, works great</li>
            <li> used this product many time does not burn my skin like nair does, no hair bumps, and works well on strong hair,</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking that it would replace shaving for me but it turns out that it mostly works when there is a lot of hair on the area you want to clear; and I don&#x27;t like to wait and have very hairy legs before I take it out. I tried it on my underarms and legs when the hair was short and it didn&#x27;t work at all. It did work for me on the bikini area where a had more and longer hair but you have to be careful around that area. The small spatula that come with the bottle isn&#x27;t too helpful, it mostly irritates your skin. The smell isn&#x27;t too pleasant but it is bearable. I don&#x27;t think I will be buying this again, it wasn&#x27;t too bad but overall I wasn&#x27;t too impressed.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome, works long term, and although it&#x27;s a pain, so is everything else, it is pretty goopy, but it totally allows me to be smooth and hair free where I desire.</li>
            <li> worked for my legs and arms.</li>
            <li> I love veet I use it on my bikini line and it works fantastically. My hair is pretty thin so it comes off easily. I like this opposed to shaving because my skin does not get irritated.&lt;br /&gt;Also the shipping was fast and it was packaged ideally!</li>
            <li> Great for pubic area. I&#x27;ve used this for pubic areas for a complete clean hair removal. Works perfectly with the plastic razor it comes with especially since the area is sensitive downstairs.  Just do not leave it for more then 10 minutes otherwise it will get irritated. I cannot shave the senitive areas because my skin is just too sensitive and gets irritated easily with shaving. This product is a great altetnative. Even for your legs and the rest of your body, it works great and pretty fast. I&#x27;ve used it on my face too and it works great. But for face no more than 5 minutes. This really is for sensitive skin. No irritations when used as directed (no more than 10 minutes).</li>
            <li> It works well.It removed all of my hair that I had on my arm.The only complaint I have it that it has a really bad smell.I had to spray my arm 3 times and it still smelt bad.I ended up putting a hevy scented lotion on to cover up the smell</li>
            <li> My wife simply cannot live without this product, the fact that this seller has it at a great price and prompt shipping is a plus for me zag the end of the day I also enjoy the smooth of kg wife&#x27;s legs</li>
            <li> This is a good one for anyone who wants to get rid of the hairs but beware this product have a weird smell and a tiny bit irritating on the skin but nothing severe. Its enough volume to last like forever and i am often quiet satisfied after each use.</li>
            <li> I am not liking the fact that it jeeps on being mailed to me I hope this message gets to someone and for me to get help !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Works well when used as directed.  You definitely need to apply liberally, though.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me. I completely coated half of my leg with this stuff, waited the recommended amount of time, and then checked to see that it had done nothing. I waited five minutes longer and rinsed it off to reveal a very small hairless patch in the middle of the part of my leg that I had done. Even within this patch, several long hairs still lurked, proving that even if the Veet had worked on all of my leg that I had wanted it to, I would still have had to shave to rid myself of those random hairs. I shaved my legs as I normally do, and I noticed afterwards that the Veet-ed area grew back much more slowly than the shaved area which was cool, but I never used the Veet again because it was almost completely ineffective and the smell was so toxic that I had to air out my bathroom for a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never tried any hair removal creams before so I thought I&#x27;d try this while it was on sale because my legs are usually full of razor bumps and cuts since I shave so often. I was really hoping I would like this, but... I kind of hated it. It worked fine on one of my legs but on the other one it left a HUGE red rash that lasted for a few days. Not even sure why it only affected one part of one of my legs. Very weird. And the smell was absolutely horrific. I changed clothes and took a shower and it still seemed to linger for hours afterward. I think I&#x27;ll stick to shaving.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! For years I have searched for the perfect product to get rid of the hair on my legs and this is it. The ONLY downside is you have the feeling that something is on them afterwards but it just feels like lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t smell bad and works really fast. I am middle eastern and this gets alllll the hairs. I have used on my legs and arms with great results. It leaves your skin smooth for days and hair free with little to no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically exfoliate my skin the day before I use this and make sure I have no scratches. I have noticed bleeding but it is really rare and always due to bumps/scratches on my skin</li>
            <li> Pros: It doesn&#x27;t smell as badly as the old versions did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It doesn&#x27;t work the same way on each hair, and leg hair isn&#x27;t uniform. The result was bleeding pores on some parts of my legs and the thicker hair remaining on my leg.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work very well at all! It burns, it hurts, but it doesn&#x27;t really remove all the hair. No matter where I use it (or how long I leave it) it leaves a lot of hair intact. Not quite useless, but nearly!</li>
            <li> my sister said this product is the best remover cream, especially when you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t write product reviews but this was absolutely amazing. Not only does it work well and FAST! it leaves you silky smooth. I was skeptical at first but those telling you it doesn&#x27;t work are either stupid or they don&#x27;t know how to use the product. I used it on all regions. And when I say all I mean all. (Not recommended for the meek and mild) But it didn&#x27;t burn, didn&#x27;t leave a rash. It was perfect. I feel so clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> I got this product yesterday at Target. I followed all instructions, including doing little &amp;#34;test strips&amp;#34; on the areas you wish to remove hair. I tested on my legs and lady bits without any irritation, so I decided to go fo full on hair removal. This worked AMAZING on my legs, so much smoother than shaving and without all of the razor burn. Just make sure to moisturize after. The only bad part was, despite testing it with good results first, that my lady bits got SEVERELY irritated. The bottle I purchased said it was great for legs, body, bikini area, etc. Do NOT us on bikini area! I&#x27;m currently extremely picky about the pants and undies I wear so that they don&#x27;t rub much because I am in so much pain. Red, sore, and extremely tender irritation EVERYWHERE downstairs. I might as well have shaved down there and dealt with the razor burn irritation. So far, the soothing Neosporin with pain reliever in it is helping nicely. On the upside, it worked very nicely on my legs, they are super smooth with no signs of irritation. For my legs, it feels 10x better than shaving.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy - smells OK. It removed underarm and leg hair as promised. My legs did sting for a couple of hours afterwards, but no redness.</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair and very light skin. This doesn&#x27;t work anywhere for me. I&#x27;ll stick to waxing.</li>
            <li> works very well with no skin issues</li>
            <li> This product does not work at all.  I applied on legs and let it sit for 10 minutes and used spatula to remove.  Not a single hair came off.</li>
            <li> It does wonders and is easy to use. I have medium thick hair and this cream removes my stubborn hair so easily! I am so glad I found this!</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t leave me silky smooth, or anything. In fact, I can get a smoother effect with shaving. It does, however, lend to my laziness and just having to leave it on there. It doesn&#x27;t take very much meticulousness, so if you want easy... this is it. If you want a nice a smooth wherever you are using it, look somewhere else.</li>
            <li> Hair remover cream is so much better than shaving! I always get razor burn and itching from shaving, but I don&#x27;t get it from this cream! It did not irritate my skin at all. This lasts a little bit longer than shaving. I have to shave every two days, but I can use this once a week and be fine. It doesn&#x27;t last as long as waxing does but it&#x27;s great for when I don&#x27;t have time to wax or in between waxes.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and get razor bumps from shaving, so I wanted to give this a try in spite of my doubts. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t work at all for me. I can apply a thick layer to my skin and leave it on 5, 10, or even 20 minutes, but almost no hair comes off. I don&#x27;t even have particularly coarse or thick hair, either. The creme has a slight stink to it, kind of like burning hair, and is a little irritating to my skin as well. It may work for you, but it&#x27;s useless for me.</li>
            <li> I found this worked well when applied thickly.  One time I skimped and ended up using a razor.  The scraper that comes with it is too flimsy and too sharp making it uncomfortable to use.  I use a double edged scraper shaped  like a razor that came with a hair remover product I bought several years ago - this works much better and without the discomfort.  A better scraper would have gotten this product 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Works very well, but burns like crazy. Make sure you follow their warning not to use on your face -- it&#x27;s hard enough on your legs. Not sure if it&#x27;s worth the discomfort.</li>
            <li> Well, VEET, it works as it should.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product. No more sitting in my tub slowly shaving my legs and no more expensive, annoying, and painful waxing. Removes about 95% of the hair on legs when I use it. And my legs feel sooo nice afterwards.</li>
            <li> In love wit this product!!!!!</li>
            <li> I thought this would be better then it is. I leave it on for the full time but my hair still doesn&#x27;t come off completely. When I used it last time I had to run a razor over my legs to de-fuzz a little more.</li>
            <li> Unless I&#x27;m doing something wrong, it&#x27;s not working for me.  It barely took off any hair under the arms, even keeping it on for 10 minutes!  Then the hair grows back as if I did not use it at all!  I&#x27;m not pleased.</li>
            <li> Worked okay on certain spots, still had to shave after so kind of defeated the purpose</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Hair completely gone after 7-8 mins&lt;br /&gt;Love the spatula&lt;br /&gt;A lot of product to use&lt;br /&gt;Directions easy to follow&lt;br /&gt;Did not burn&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Smells horrible, like boiled eggs and perm&lt;br /&gt;Original time does not work for me&lt;br /&gt;smell takes 15-30 minutes to leave</li>
            <li> I use this for my legs and torso. I have fairly coarse hair and this does the trick. Best way to use it is i strip naked before going in the shower, apply it to the designated area (use good amount). Usually wait 5-10 minutes, you can usually tell when it&#x27;s done if you notice the hairs peeking outside the cream or floating in it. Quickly hop in the shower and use the spatula to remove it from your body and once you&#x27;ve use the spatula on the area just rinse with water, warm will do the trick. You may find a few hairs that didn&#x27;t get fully washed off and those hairs are easily pulled off with your finger tips or tweezers. The smell is pretty strong but you can open a window or use some air freshener. Never had any skin reactions to it but then again i don&#x27;t use it on non recommended areas like the pubic area. Make sure the area you put it on doesn&#x27;t come in contact with any other parts of your body, doing one leg before the other is best.</li>
            <li> Product works great, but the plastic razor they give you is garbage.  I had better results using a warm, damp washcloth.</li>
            <li> I just cant leave without this product!</li>
            <li> Amazed there is no irritation or funky smell. Works well and quickly.  Daughter loves it, and she has sensitive skin, chemical sensitivity and a perfume allergy.  Reluctant to try it but the metal in razors were giving her rash.  No reactions thus far, very pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> I used this product on my bikini and underarms. I had great results. I applied it thickly and let it sit for 6 minutes, I wiped it with a luke warm wash rag and the hair came off instantly. But you must apply evenly or else it will miss some areas.</li>
            <li> Super disappointed in this product, especially given some of the rave reviews. I have pretty dark, thick hair and tested this product on my stomach and hands. I left it on for the max amount of time and it barely removed any of the hair off my stomach. It did an ok job on my hands. The tool that comes with the gel is basically useless. You have to spend a few minutes scrubbing/exfoliating the area to see results. I was hoping this would be less work than shaving but it&#x27;s proving to be much more. Probably won&#x27;t use again. Ugh.</li>
            <li> Better than nair with argan oil</li>
            <li> caustic, will take your skin off along with the hair, use sparingly and only leave it on for a couple minutes, didn&#x27;t think the results were worth the discomfort.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair removal cream! I&#x27;ve used Nair before and only recently decided to try this one because a lot of women use it on the bikini area. I used it on both the bikini area and legs, and had great results. The first time I left the cream on for 6 minutes and the time after that for 9 minutes. I tend to have sensitive skin and did experience slight burning/tingling when I used Nair on my legs, but I did not feel a single sensation when I used this Veet--not even on my bikini area! So that is a huge plus for me. Thank goodness! No more shaving or razor bumps! The plastic scraper gets annoying because the cream and hair build up, even with rinsing it takes a bit to get off. I apply the cream and then jump in the shower and wipe it off with a wet washcloth. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so some might experience sensitivity issues, but I did not! For around $7, it&#x27;s worth a try. I&#x27;d recommend doing a patch test, starting with the minimal time and working up from there.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff on a whim because I&#x27;ve been blessed with dark coarse hair that turns into hard stubble about 12 hours after shaving my legs. Didn&#x27;t work on my legs at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try it on my (much longer, just as coarse) arm hair, waited 6-7 minutes and wiped it off with a wet washcloth. It all came off in clumps and quickly. Missed a few spots, but nothing my handy trimmer couldn&#x27;t fix. I have sensitive skin and no issues so far. Lasts about 4-5 days before regrowth, but I&#x27;m part Yetti so I will take what I can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the issue I had with my legs was that the hair wasn&#x27;t long enough, but I wasn&#x27;t about to wait a week in the spring to test that theory.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any horrible odors as with some hair removal creams.  The pump is convenient and all the hair was easily removed after the maximum leave-on time of 10 minutes (I have coarse, dark hair).  My skin was smooth and there was no irritation afterwards.</li>
            <li> Veet Gel Hair Remover Cream, Sensitive Formula, 13.5 Ounce, was returned unused. The reason behind it was that it was meant to be used by a lovely senior that had a change of heart once she reviewed the instructions. We do apologize if posting this review seems unfair, but it keeps appearing in our items to review page, and we are diligent to review all items. Average rating, which means neither good nor bad, since it was not experienced due to cold feet, or should I say, cold legs? 3 Stars.</li>
            <li> I was extremely nervous when applying this product because of the though of it burning my legs and leaving nasty bumps. However that was not the case. I have dark thick leg hair and it only took me about five minutes to remove all of the hair from my legs. It was quick and it was painless. And once the hair goes away it&#x27;s gone for days. A worry free weekend at the beach with smooth silky tan legs. Shaving always left my legs with bumps and I could never get them completely smooth. The best method is to cover everywhere you want the hair to be removed from with veet, start prepping your shower, and then hop in, just wash it off and continue with your regular shower routine. You also do not have to apply much of the cream for the optimum hair removal. If you don&#x27;t over use it this bottle can last a pretty long time; making it cheaper than razors, razor refills, and shaving cream.</li>
            <li> It burns! It burns! and it smells like rotting flesh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get a razor and some barbasol instead.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it say, follow the instructions, but be cautious of your skin reaction. I still have and use the same bottle, it does&#x27;t run out very fast.</li>
            <li> it did not work at all!!&lt;br /&gt;i was very unsatisfied with this product and i paid for it and it was not a good deal!</li>
            <li> So there are pros and cons. I used this on my whole leg and bikini area. I have obvious hair around the bikini, and for my legs it&#x27;s only thick around my ankles and the rest is so thin you can only see it in the light. I don&#x27;t normally shave or anything, actually, but decided to give this a try for kicks. Basically, it was great for the bikini line and around my ankles. However, it was HORRIBLE for the rest of my thin leg hair. I left it on for 10 minutes, not wanting to redo the test sections if it wasn&#x27;t on long enough. For the thin hair, it didn&#x27;t remove it, but it did fry the crap out of it. Like...severely damaged leg hair. It&#x27;s very crisp, curly, and often standing on end. In fact, it is now PAINFUL to wear long pants because my leg hair gets stuck in the fabric and pulls as I move. Ahhh. Even after washing and using lotion. I had no idea this could happen! Not sure if it means I should&#x27;ve left it on longer (than 10 minutes?!) or that it&#x27;s just not right for my thin hair...but definitely not using it on my thin hair again without further research. Hopefully the hair calms down by tomorrow so I can wear pants again!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, definitely worth it if you&#x27;re using it on thick hair! I also have very fair, sensitive skin, and there was no irritation, so that&#x27;s good!</li>
            <li> Do not use of you have any kind of rash! It may common knowledge but I had a small rash on the back of my legs from eczema and didn&#x27;t notice so I used it anyways. Now I really regret it. I have chemical burns on the backs of my legs and under my arms and I didn&#x27;t even keep on for 10mins. Do not use of you have eczema!!</li>
            <li> So my hubby bought this as a gift for me. Don&#x27;t get me wrong I like it as a product but I am highly convinced it is not made for African American women. The formula also irritated my skin. However, it did not smell to bad. Would I purchase again honestly I wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have some protruding veins on my legs which are really hard to shave over,  so decided to try Veet Hair Remover Cream.  I should have been using this way before now.  Easy to apply, does not drip. Not much of an odor, no burning, and no rash after using it. My legs look like a bald man&#x27;s head.....shiny and smooth.  I have only had to use this twice in one month.  Why would anyone shave when this wonderful product is available.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great item would buy again</li>
            <li> Not sensitive enough for my skin...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this product would&#x27;ve worked just fine if it wasn&#x27;t 3 years old. I looked for the date too late, as I had already used it and received a rash</li>
            <li> If you want skin that looks like you sustained second degree burns, then buy this product.  I used exactly as directed, and it is the &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; product.  My underarms and upper legs look like chemical burns.  Worst pain ever.  Should be taken off the market, it is dangerous.</li>
            <li> Works well everywhere. No burning sensation. Doesn&#x27;t remove all hair but does get most of it and the hair left behind is downy and very short.</li>
            <li> Works very well, removed a great amount of hair. This product did not irritate my skin at all, great buy.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Veet products since ages. Works amazingly well. Even on thick and coarse hair. It deserves 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This product does the job. I have sensitive skin and I had become weary of razors (nicks, bumps, scarring) and most of the other hair removal products just seemed like too much work. This is easy to apply and relatively cheap. Each application last about four days. If you leave it on too long your skin WILL get irritated and if you feel a prickling sensation then that&#x27;s TOO long. Also If you have it for a really long time the remainder begins to smell weird otherwise its great.</li>
            <li> Very good, I have very sensitive skin and I didn&#x27;t get any bumps or burn at all! I have tried alot of these products and this is the best!</li>
            <li> I love this because I feel like it works the best out of any other cream removals. It comes with a little spreader/remover thingie that is wonderful, and it helps you spread in areas that you need to be careful :)&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, and this is only the second hair removal cream I have used, ever, and I like it better than Nair because there really isn&#x27;t a smell, and I feel like it works faster.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I like to use these for my underarms, and it doesn&#x27;t run or any of that, and works very well.&lt;br /&gt;I really only buy a bottle per year because I just shave in the winter, if I even show my legs at all.&lt;br /&gt;This bottle lasts from march to November for me, using it once every two weeks or so.</li>
            <li> Wprked better and faster than any other removal cream I&#x27;ve tried and doesn&#x27;t burn. I was skeptical about the bikini area thing so I hesitated to buy, but it works. Shaving that area never seems to work, not to mention having a blade around that area probably isn&#x27;t the best idea. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s healthy using this very often down there so be cautious, and don&#x27;t.leave it on too long or you&#x27;ll cut yourself somehow.</li>
            <li> Wow!  I didn&#x27;t have high expectations.  I hate shaving because I tend to nick myself and when I have bug bites it hurts to shave.  This was easy to use and quick.  I don&#x27;t have very hairy legs and what I have is fine.  I had 1/4&amp;#34; growth.  In the past, the hair on my knees that could not be taken off by depi creams.  I also enjoyed using the waiting time to let the hair conditioner penetrate my hair.  I also think that having the hair follicles softened by steam probably helped the hair come off easily.  It also left my legs softer than after shaving.</li>
            <li> Very nice removal cream.....</li>
            <li> I got sick of shaving my legs so decided to try Veet and it works fast and is a good alternative to shaving. Its formula does not adversely affect my skin at all. It&#x27;s a good produce.</li>
            <li> So, I tried this Veet Gel. I read the directions very carefully. So I applied some on my arms(PCOS). Waited 3 minutes only half of the hair came off, applied more for another 3 minutes, all hair came off. So I thought, yep I&#x27;m doing my whole body. Left it on for 5 minutes then jumped in the shower with warm water, all hair came off. No rash, redness or itching. Safe. Lasted over a week so far.</li>
            <li> Works great and it is very easy to use with the built in pump. It does have a strong smell as you are using it but it does not really leave a scent on your skin. Just follow the instructions and pat on - do not rub in.</li>
            <li> Be careful, it burns seriously.</li>
            <li> My sister actually recommended this product to me.  I was hesitant at first because I was afraid it was going to burn like Nair.  It does have an order but it&#x27;s not as near messy as magic shave.  I&#x27;ve used it everywhere!!! Arms, Legs, Underarms, Upper Lip and Bikini area!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies for your bikini area... I suggest you use some kind of petroleum based oil ... or just petroleum jelly around the hairline to protect your skin. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend baby oil.  Also, that spatula is just a waste of time and will actually cause you to get a chemical burn because you aren&#x27;t removing the chemical fast enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s safe enough that you can rinse yourself in the shower or bath with warm water.  Just don&#x27;t rub it in... or use soap to rinse it off.  You can use a bath scrungy to remove the hair. Go against the grain. That means wipe upward toward your belly and away from your genitals. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend you use this product after you&#x27;ve showered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tends to burn only if your pores are open or if you&#x27;ve previously scratched the area you&#x27;re going to treat.  While waxing does last longer... I tell you this definitely last longer than shaving.  If you&#x27;re prone to hair bumps and ingrown hairs.... Tea tree oil helps and the bumps usually disappears within a couple of days!!  DO NOT USE THE TEA TREE OIL RIGHT AFTER APPLYING VEET!!! LOL no I&#x27;ve never done it... and I suggest you don&#x27;t do it either!!! Unless you want to burn!</li>
            <li> my cousin recommend this product. i used it but it didnt work on me. only made my hair become darker and stronger.</li>
            <li> This caused a TERRIBLE rash on my legs! I usually used nair course hair shower power but wanted to compare brands. Veet has way more chemicals than nair and doesnt even work not near as well! NEVER EVER BUY THIS!</li>
            <li> Good for men too.  I used this on my legs, arms and chest, which at the time were reasonable hairy.  Worked great.  Applied and whipped off with a hot warm rag.  Hair came right off.  excellent product.</li>
            <li> It works fine. I have rather coarse leg hair so I have to leave it on for about 15-20 min. Only downside is it reeks. Make sure to open windows and ventilate your bathroom or it will stink up the house all week.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for hair removal. The only 2 bad things are that there is a slight stench to the cream and you have to pay close attention to how long you have it on. DO NOT KEEP IT ON FOR LONGER THAN 10 MINUTES. Not even 1 second more.</li>
            <li> What your skin burnt? Then this is the stuff to buy. Holy crap...left me with the equivalent of the worse sunburn in my life. Used according to directions and still had horrible results. Did it get rid of the hair, sure did----along with layers of skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other hair removal creams, and they never worked. But I was going on vacation, and didn&#x27;t want to worry about bringing my razor along. I have really stubborn leg hair, and have to shave everyday; stubble already popping up before the end of the day. With this, I was able to go 4 days without having to shave, so I was thrilled. I do leave it on for the max time, 10 minutes, but it&#x27;s still better than having to shave everyday.</li>
            <li> Great hair removal. No complaint. It remove all the hair on my leg with maxim 7 minutes. It leave my skin feeling silky smooth, and soft... Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this product it beats shaving any day. Im not a fan of the smell but i usually use this before shaving</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY!! This stuff is awful on every level. First of all, it does not get rid of hair. At all. Secondly, the idea that this product could possibly be for sensitive skin is just absurd. I should have known better with the horrifying ingredients list and lengthy warnings. Honestly, if it worked to remove hair I might have powered through the skin destruction. But it didn&#x27;t remove the slightest bit of stubble. Back to razors it is.</li>
            <li> It works like a charm it&#x27;s amazing for me there was no burning or anything but it didn&#x27;t get to the roots of the hairs but it does kinda stun em so they don&#x27;t grow back for a while so for that I give it 4 stars but trust me it&#x27;s amazing I&#x27;m buying more of these later on</li>
            <li> I would buy this again this sh** works with my wife&#x27;s help to put on my back I have no more back hair</li>
            <li> I have used this product and love it. I have very sensitive skin soi decided to go with this. It has a great smell and texture. Easy to use also last me a long time. I don&#x27;t have to use alot either. It&#x27;s also inexpensive too. I am a member of Veet Vixens on Crowdtap &amp; may receive perks and rewards as a member.</li>
            <li> First of all, my bad from buying it while searching for Nair products. For some reason this was the second result and I didn&#x27;t read close enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the scraper is as bad as it was 10 years ago. It&#x27;s a plastic scraper with a soft-plastic edge.. Held in place by a bit of glue and two pointy edges, one on each side.&lt;br /&gt;Now guess what happens when you use it and that edge falls off meanwhile. There&#x27;s blood..! Oh god all this blood...!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third - NOT FOR MEN. Applied to my manly, yet not overly hair, legs. Let it sit. And tried to scrape off...&lt;br /&gt;It ended up with a big ball of whatever it turns the hair into and I had to scrubs myself down twice to get it all off.&lt;br /&gt;My follicles still have hair in them though and I&#x27;m a bit prickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And fourth, I ordered sensitive formula, got regular. Still going to use it but do double check your product if you have sensitive legs.</li>
            <li> So I bought this exact product at Fred Meyer, for $11 because I am impatient. I get home and do the typical 3 minute one spot tester... I use the spatula thing and nothing comes off. Assuming because I&#x27;m a man and yes I&#x27;m gay so there is my excuse, and my leg hair is much more coarse I thought I would need to leave it on longer. I do the max 6 minutes on another spot and same results, I try again with 5 mins on another spot but this time with a thicker layer and still nothing. My scientific conclusion is now... I WANT REFUND NOW!!! I was one of the smart people who read reviews, considered it might burn or smell bad and I was willing to compromise, it did not burn or smell bad, but I didn&#x27;t get even close to what I paid for. It doesn&#x27;t matter that I&#x27;m a male, I was given false promises... DO NOT BUY UNLESS BLONDE OR THIN HAIR!!!</li>
            <li> avoid at all cost. a couple of days after the application - i have developed acne like rash all over the application area which takes months to go away. i wish i hadn&#x27;t touched this product at all and just let the hair be</li>
            <li> It works like a charm. This doesn&#x27;t smell all that bad but it&#x27;s very gentle on your skin especially if you have very sensitive skin. It also does a great job in removing all that unwanted hair. I recommend you use this while the hot water is running (not while you&#x27;re inside) so the steam can open up your pores, you apply, and rinse off with oil and/or lukewarm water.</li>
            <li> This is the worst Sh%# EVER!! I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin, and this caused a red rash all over my legs &amp; my bikini area looked like it had a hundred red razor bumps all over. I had to apply organic aloe, thank God I had some, all over to get the burning to stop. The worst part is even after all that my skin still wasn&#x27;t smooth. This crap only brakes your hair off at the skin, not the root so you can definitely still feel it. It feels like what my skin feels like after 2days of not shaving. If you have dark hair you can absolutely forget about it,  bc you will just see tiny black dots like you skipped shaving. That&#x27;s not even the worst part for me. Again, for women with dark hair: This disintegrates your hair in the lotion turning the lotion black, while you&#x27;re scraping it. I did it in my claw foot tub,  and it turned the entire damn inside of my tub black! I washed it for hours, bleach, comet, u name it... It has faded but I can still see gray in my bath tub! It won&#x27;t come off! I&#x27;m so pissed off about this product &amp;  all the reviews I read saying it was so great. Shave or wax, or better yet get the Flash n Go permanent hair removal at home laser. I&#x27;m saving for one,  and will NEVER use Nair again!</li>
            <li> It seems to me this isn&#x27;t as strong as the Neet I used in the sixties.  I had to leave it on for about 15 minutes before scrubbing it off with a waffle weave kitchen washcloth.  (I tossed the scraper.)  My method worked and I didn&#x27;t suffer any redness or rash at all.</li>
            <li> Never will i subject myself to such horrible burns. I was pretty conservative and i still shudder at the thought of trying this again. not only that it worked poorly and was spotty at best</li>
            <li> It works very well but the smell is just to strong and sticks around even after i&#x27;ve taken a shower and washed the towels.  Other than that the product is amazing i don&#x27;t feel a burn during or after use and the results are ridiculously smooth and works well no matter where you try it out.</li>
            <li> Works well. I have very coarse hair so it takes about 10 minutes for it to get the hair off. However, I have hair stubble like 2 days later.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the times in the instructions are accurate... but this does the job. Careful though, you might get burned with just 6 minutes.</li>
            <li> I use this product to remove under-arm hair. I don&#x27;t want to do this in stores, and don&#x27;t want to try those  scary ways recommended on Youtube. I and looking for a product to put on for 15 min, then take a shower, then the hair gone. No pain and easy. This product is exactly I am looking for which  let me wear tank tops, dresses during in summer time. Although when watching it very close, you still able see a little bit hair root, it is clean enough for me.</li>
            <li> This worked very well on my boyfriend and I. We both have sensitive skin. I did use the little plastic razor that&#x27;s included, and it worked just fine. The only reason i&#x27;m not re-ordering is it only lasts as long as shaving. Just when the hair grows back it&#x27;s not thick stubble.</li>
            <li> Took most of the hair off, but not all... No spatula included in box for removing foam when time is up.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I use it on my thighs so I don&#x27;t have to shave as often and on my tummy. I like using the spatula to get most of the cream off (so I don&#x27;t rub it in accidentally) in the shower and then rinse off any remaining cream I missed. I leave it on for ten minutes. It doesn&#x27;t hurt or burn at all, it just has this strong chemical smell, so I would recommend just showering afterward so there is no residual smell left over. It leaves my skin very smooth and really soft and it lasts a lot longer than shaving! I wish the bottle came in a larger size, though. Using it on your legs uses up a lot each use, and it would be nice not having to reorder as often as I do now.</li>
            <li> This Veet is so much better then the &amp;#34;Veet in shower cr&amp;egrave;me sensitive formula&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;Nair hair removal lotion&amp;#34; on so many levels. The pump makes it easy to get out the bottle, the pump makes it less messy (glides on skin), the formula is smooth, it hydrates my skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate it either. I use it only on my arms and I don&#x27;t use the spatula it comes with; I use a washcloth I think it works better. Also it doesn&#x27;t leave that nasty chemical smell behind like the other formula of Veet and Nair. (Did not buy on Amazon but at Walmart).</li>
            <li> Works great.  My legs have never been smoother.  However, if you intend to use it on the bikini area, use caution.  I did my legs first and everything went great. But when I started on the bikini area, my skin burned from the power of a thousand suns.  This pain lasted for at least five hours, although there was no pain on my legs...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an alternative to shaving because I strongly dislike shaving.&lt;br /&gt;This was definitely worse.&lt;br /&gt;I applied this generously to my legs and tested a small area after the 5 minutes. It seemed to have had no effect, so I left it on for the maximum 10 minutes (5 before testing and 5 after). About the time I went to remove it, it started to burn. I worked to remove it all while in severe pain from the burning. My skin is still in pain 2 days later.&lt;br /&gt;Not only was it painful, it didn&#x27;t work well. Some places on my legs were smooth and others looked like they hadn&#x27;t been touched. My hair wasn&#x27;t overly long, I had shaved 4 days before using it, and I don&#x27;t have thick leg hair, so to endure the burning to not even have it work was severely disappointing. It took longer than shaving would have, and the stuff is a pain to get off your skin afterward, even with the body wash and pouf I used.&lt;br /&gt;I will NOT use it again, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. Waste of money, waste of time, painful, and I have to shave afterward anyway.</li>
            <li> The thing that is used to remove the cream was missing</li>
            <li> I actually picked up this from my local store because I had a coupon at that time and I needed help in shaving places that are hard to reach. I had to put very thick layers to make it work somewhat. Well, does it really work??? No. Not technically. Even after I leave it long enough, some of the hair is still there. Not to mention it stings my skin (not good for people with extremely sensitive skins like me) and stinks. It made the whole house smell like a skunk.... I&#x27;m going back to waxing and shaving again....</li>
            <li> Veet Gel Cream Hair Remover is a great product! It do not have bad smell and also do not irritate my daughter&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> I have been buying Veet products on and off through the past 10 years (waxing, depilatory creams, in Europe and in the US),each time hoping there are improvements to it. It never 100%  worked for me. There are always multiple thicker hairs left behind. I never have this problem with Nair, therefore, I promise myself not to buy Veet ever again, and don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Quick, easy, clean, and cheap. Works great for this man.</li>
            <li> Great on skin. Very effective and feel comfort on skin after shaving. I have used a different one and it I felt itchy after shaving</li>
            <li> Still itchy a little bit at the first time using. After the first use, it felt better. Can&#x27;t get rid off all hair in sensitive area. My hair grows neither harder nor softer.</li>
            <li> It works fast and is gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> As expected and DOES THE JOB</li>
            <li> It really works well... only problem is that it burns if it stay kn to long.. so make sure time yourself while applying this...</li>
            <li> Worked guud but hair wasnt gone as long as it says and its a little messy</li>
            <li> Works very well on my skin and actually I feel nothing when I spread it over my skin</li>
            <li> I just got it and used, it works great !!! Although it took me time to remove it I left it like for 10 min I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Works but use in a well ventilated area</li>
            <li> exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Good product for hair removal, non-irritating.  However I had to stop using it because it is so thick that it plugged my bathtub drain not once nut twice!  so am back using a blade...</li>
            <li> I find that Veet is both gentle and effective for all of my hair removal needs. Although I prefer to use an exfoliating mitt than the bladeless razor, this product leaves me baby smooth. Also, when the hair grows back, it&#x27;s not as stubbly feeling as when you use a razor.</li>
            <li> very good for me and&lt;br /&gt;so love it , is Veet Gel Cream Pump Sensitive Formula Hair Remover, 13.5 Ounce</li>
            <li> Okay here is the reason why I bought this and my experience so far on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this item for my wife. She has through her whole life been an avid shaver and she has been through the bumps and the ingrown hairs and never ending itchiness. We also have tried waxing, which anyone who has waxed knows how expensive it can be to do this properly every month or so. We thought about an epilator, but we were scared at the idea that it is basically 46 tweezers pulling hairs out in rapid sequence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As my wife uses the product I will continue to update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has used it so far on the following areas:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Armpits - Left on just like the directions said and it worked amazingly. No pain at all.&lt;br /&gt;- Bikini - She had some mixed comments on this area. First try it was great, all the hair was removed. Second time it missed some areas. Maybe she used not enough cream.&lt;br /&gt;- Belly area - worked amazingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife is healing from ingrown hairs from shaving so we will continue to update as we use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: DO NOT use on face. On the directions from what my wife told me it says not to use on face. There are other VEET products that are made for face use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well so far this is my review and again I will update as soon as my wife tells me her results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this review helped you please let me know. Thanks and happy shopping.</li>
            <li> this product was a first for me. i have never used any kind of hair remover other than the razor. this stuff really works great. after using this i will no longer be buying razors. i will say that using the spatula is a mess &amp; a waste of time. you do have to find what time will work for you. it says 5 minutes min. 10 minutes max. its so easy to just jump in the shower when it&#x27;s time to wash this off. it does remove the hair &amp; it is so much easier &amp; faster than shaving with a razor. you do not get cuts &amp; nicks no razor burn no bumps. this is perfect if you are a first time shaver or along time shaver. is great for both girls &amp; guys. i have not smelled any odor while using this product. i will be ordering more of this &amp; this will be a socking stuffer at christmas. My legs feel silky smooth after using this product i do not have to worry about having cuts or nicks or razor burn or those little bumps that come up after shaving. it works great on the arm pitts as well so smooth so soft no hair no stuble no nicks no cuts no bumps. this is a must for anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this because shaving kept causing itchy razor bumps on my knees. I didn&#x27;t even notice it was the sensitive formula. My experience years ago with Nair was not good; bad smell and didn&#x27;t work.  The smell for Veet is not bad at all. It worked in the recommended 5 minutes with only minor tingling. I used the bladeless razor and ALL the hair came off. My legs are more moisturized, smooth, no razor bumps and I still don&#x27;t see new growth after 3 days:)</li>
            <li> So here is the deal, I will answer the question we all want to know. As a guy, should I use this for my &amp;#34;downstairs parts&amp;#34;? Here is my story and what you should do. I received this product in the mail, scared and excited I first preformed a test trial to make sure I did not end up with 3rd degree burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first placed a spot of the product on a hairy area of my body for five minutes, the recommended minimum amount of time. It did not burn however it did not remove much hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trial #2: I did the same thing but placed it on a different spot for ten minutes. I wiped the product away after and it removed much hair, still with NO burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final mission: I placed the product ALL OVER, and lathered it on thick. Waited ten minutes, jumped in the shower. Side note: Guys if you have thick hair jump in the shower, otherwise just wipe it off. and the hair came pouring off my body. It was almost alarming at first, but none the less extremely successful.&lt;br /&gt;I still had a few stragglers so the following week I repeated the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will need a few applications if you have thick hair. Now it is safe to say I could star in a few movies if you know what I mean. You should apply lotion on your skin after though because when the hair grows back it can cause some razor bumps.</li>
            <li> Does not remove all hair</li>
            <li> excellent seller, item as described</li>
            <li> No irriation at all. I use it on my .... and it works great. I hate shaving down there so I use veet instead ^_^</li>
            <li> Good, does its job..wayy easier and sensitive on the skin than shaving, but make sure you follow directions and not leave it on for more than 10mins. Leaves skin feeling very smooth and soft, and hair growth seems to be slower in comparison to shaving.</li>
            <li> Bought this stuff because I always get such bad razor burn. I&#x27;ve learned to use it always at night before bed. I use it on legs and bikini area. I get a little irritation right after using it but in the morning it&#x27;s completely gone and smooth.  It lasts longer than shaving so I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> So I am very skeptical when it comes to hair removal , I have tried numerous hair removal creams with no success but this one really really worked . I used it 2 days ago and my legs are still soft. Only down side was that I could still see a few stubbles before they even have grown out but it could be from always shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anywho, if you don&#x27;t like pain, not a fan of body hair, and like cheap pricing, this is the way to go</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other depilatory creams in the past. This product is by far one of the best. The smell isn&#x27;t as offensive as others in this category. You get a lot for the price as well. I like the design of the bottle. The pump make for easier and cleaner application. The included spatula makes hair removal somewhat difficult. If used with water or in the shower, the spatula can be helpful. My legs were very smooth after using this product.</li>
            <li> this product removes the hair of the body and it does not have any bad side effects on my skin, but i am not so happy with the result. when i use it,  It seems like shaving and I do not like that.</li>
            <li> I had mixed results with the Veet Gel Cream.  I am very fair skinned with naturally dark hair so I was hoping to have success in removing the dark underarm and bikini area hair.  The hair on my legs is very scant and light so I did not use this for my legs.  I tried in in test patches all around my bikini area for differing periods of time (up to 10 minutes) but the periods of time that removed hair also caused serious skin irritation and still didn&#x27;t remove all the hair.  Same for the underarms.  This did work well on the faint, wispy slightly darker hair that occasionally crops up on my face but I am not sure if they recommend it for that.  I would say this is not good at removing thicker, tougher hair but works well for fine hair.</li>
            <li> The product can&#x27;t remove the root of the hairs but it can remove most of it. I don&#x27;t like the smell...</li>
            <li> I never used any product before to remove my leg hair... this one sizzled it right off and it did not smell bad.  I was afraid it would burn my legs or something of that sort, but I had no problems.  The scrapper thingy though did nick me, perhaps I didnt use it correctly?  So I just used a cloth and that seemed to do the job just fine.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin. I was able to leave this on for the max of ten minutes without suffering any ill effects. No itchy skin, no dryness or flaking, no redness. It removed most of the hair from my legs, but not quite all of it. It did leave a bit of stubble, but that could easily be my own fault due to technique (since I had never used any type of cream like this before).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not any easier or less time consuming than shaving though, and I actually find wiping the cream off to be a bit more annoying, so I&#x27;ll probably only use this for a change of pace sometimes.</li>
            <li> Works well on me! For those whose skin is very sensitive, test it on your arms first before try it all over ur body.</li>
            <li> One thing I noticed was that this doesn&#x27;t remove the hair from the root. It will burn the hair out and I had some issues with chemical burns in sensitive areas but that&#x27;s more of my own fault and not the product.</li>
            <li> I used this product because I am particularly prone to skin infections that can result from being nicked/cut by a razor. And waxing is too painful. I&#x27;ve used it twice now with decent results.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Works great on longer hair, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin (even on the bikini line), and washes off pretty easily. No nicks or cuts like you get with shaving, and definitely less painful than waxing.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Didn&#x27;t take off all the hair (although mine is pretty thick and coarse), has the rotten egg smell that all hair removal creams do. I had to leave it on for the full ten minutes, so it was a wee bit time consuming to do all the areas I wanted to.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, will order again. I can deal with the smell, and the second time I used it I got more hair off than the first time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the deal is. But this stuff didn&#x27;t work well for me. I even left it on for the max 10 min. My bikini area was smoother but still lots of bumps and hairs. My underarms were scorched!!! Big red marks and still all the hair so it looks even worse. I will be trying something else and maybe use this just on my legs. But I was very disappointed as this seemed to get good reviews :(</li>
            <li> Its good much better than a razor.</li>
            <li> This works very well, it just smells bad.  It is thick and it stinks and if you don&#x27;t put a little pressure on the spatula to scrape it off, all the hair doesn&#x27;t come off and you have to reapply it.  I always leave it on for the max of 10 minutes.  It does burn a little when you leave it on that long and it does not last any longer than shaving, like it states on the bottle.  My legs felt nubby the very next day after using it. It actually takes less time to shave with a razor than it does to apply this and wait 10 minutes and then scrape it off each leg. This is just a safer way.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive skin..... it doesn&#x27;t burn my skin, and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.&lt;br /&gt;For the thick hair in my underarms wasn&#x27;t easy to remove very well.&lt;br /&gt;Just hoping for the next shaving, it won&#x27;t be difficult to remove them.&lt;br /&gt;However, It worked wonderfully on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;No matter using the cream for the underarms or legs, it doesn&#x27;t let my skin irritated.&lt;br /&gt;It works great.........</li>
            <li> Does what it says it does. Use caution with the amount of time you leave this on esp in sensitive areas like groin because it will burn the heck out of your skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product, and wish I would only have to do it once! My hair grows sooo incredibly quick, but veet makes it a little easier!</li>
            <li> Followed the directions on the product, and when I rinsed it off, I had to scrape my skin to get the removed hair off of it. If I am using a hair remover, it needs to remove the hair as I rinse. This did not do that.</li>
            <li> After using this for a couple months it is defiantly easier than shaving every other day. The sensitive formula dose work for me, but I have found that the shower cream formula with the sponge seems to get all the hair off easier.  The formula doesn&#x27;t bother my skin but after using the spatula it is more tender and shows a couple red spots.</li>
            <li> Love this cream! It smells awful, but it makes my skin feel super soft after using it. It doesn&#x27;t give me any irritation or ingrown hairs like shaving or waxing does, and it WORKS. Use it for the full 10 minutes and any undesirable hair will be gone!</li>
            <li> Recommended by a friend so I tried it.  7 minutes removed most of my chin and neck hair. Then tried corners of mouth mustache and didnt work in 5 minutes. Tgen tried again for 3 and worked.  Removed with tissue and hair came out.  Washed with soap and water then used finishing cream to cool skin.  Will not shave again Veet hair removal for sensitive facial skin works.  Slight tingle burning sensation but waxing is similar. Thats why i gave it a 4. Just be patient and follow directions.  I do recommend for mustache and chin and neck.</li>
            <li> i ordered this after reading all the reviews,works well for me but not excellent.....over all good, worth the money.i will give only four star for this product.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Deep hair removal, no rash, quick.. Even worked well on bikini/brazilian area. Sure, there was a little after-burn (not gonna lie) but the burn subsided after a few minutes (I didn&#x27;t count, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it hurt more than 10 minutes afterwards). It even has the same ingredients (Vitamin E and Aloe Vera) as the baby oil I use to apply after shaving, so all-in-all I save MORE money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely what I&#x27;d recommend if you&#x27;re sick of getting razor burn/bumps and don&#x27;t have the money or tolerance for a wax.</li>
            <li> This is messy and doesn&#x27;t even get the hairs at the roots. It&#x27;s pretty much just like shaving, but more messy and more of a time waster.</li>
            <li> after used it I can feel hurt</li>
            <li> It works really well on my legs, and although it still takes 5 minutes to take affect it does save me the backache of leaning down to save my legs. My legs are smoother after using the hair removal cream compared to just shaving, but it grows back just as fast. I found this was much more convenient than shaving and I have therefore thrown out all my razors.</li>
            <li> This Veet Hair remover doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I use it on my legs and after leaving it on for about 9 minutes (label says 10 minutes max) it only removes about half of the hair.  I always have to go back with a razor or trimmer to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, i thought that maybe I didn&#x27;t use enough of the cream.  Second time, I applied heavy layers on my leg to make sure the hair was fully covered and I got the same results.  Patchy hair left over and needing to shave with a razor to finish the hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes: I have sensitive skin and dark brown hair.  Didn&#x27;t burn my skin.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This product does remove body hair, but no more so then your razor, and it lasts for the same amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;Why put toxic chemicals on your body, (it smells horrid) if you can avoid it.&lt;br /&gt;Unless you have a pressing reason not to use a razor this will work.&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin do not use this product it will cause skin irritation, dryness, and redness, also depending on your skin or the area&#x27;s it can causes rashes and itching.</li>
            <li> The last bottle I got worked great. This one however gave me blisters and weepy raw rash. I did the skin test beforehand with no indication. I will never use again.</li>
            <li> I actually bought mine from CVS for a bit more, but it&#x27;s amazing!!! I tried it on my underarms and it took 2-3 weeks to start growing back. I&#x27;m kinda one of those girls who didn&#x27;t have anyone teach them how to shave, but there&#x27;s nothing to worry about. Just wash the area with un-perfumed soap(such as a beauty bar), apply veet generously with the back of the spatula, wait the given amount of time, and take it off with the spatula. Then afterwards wash the area again. If it&#x27;s your underarms, you&#x27;d have to wait a day until you use deodorant. Yeah, that&#x27;s the part that made me nervous, but the beauty bar blocks any odor and leaves you smelling powder fresh all day(great alternative to deodorant, but I still prefer deodorant anyday). Hope this helps :D</li>
            <li> It does a little bit for hair, but not really that much. A normal razor definitely works much better. It did make my skin softer, so if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for and don&#x27;t really care about stubble, then go for it. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again- too much hassle for not a good enough result.</li>
            <li> Throw away your razor and try Veet Sensitive Formula&lt;br /&gt;Why ?&lt;br /&gt;-Skin feels soft-  Cream contains  Aloe Vera and Vitamin E&lt;br /&gt;-Effectively removes hair in as little as five minutes&lt;br /&gt;-Lasts a long time,&lt;br /&gt;-Hair grows in finer&lt;br /&gt;-No nicks or bumps and no burning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Hair stayed gone for 2 weeks and when it grew back was thinner and more sparse. I have fair skin and allergies- but I experienced no bumps, rash or burning. A little goes a long way !&lt;br /&gt;“I am a member of the Veet Vixens on Crowdtap &amp; may receive perks &amp; rewards as a member.”</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was just me, but I tried a fairly large test area in a sensitive area and did not have any reaction. But when I used it on my calves, I wound up getting chemical burns. I do not have any reaction any where else. I do not know why it happened. I also did NOT like the smell.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin really smooth and soft. It worked for less than five mins. And the price was a deal.</li>
            <li> It works very well in hair removal. However, the three bottles would probably last me two lifetimes. I need to find someone else who needs hair removal.</li>
            <li> I love Veet. I have sensitive skin and shaving is really hard on it. Veet is much easier on my skin. It works great, too. I do, however, have fine, blond hair and that may make it easier to remove. I don&#x27;t know if that makes a difference or not. I am not sure how well it works for darker or more course hair. For me it is the perfect solution.</li>
            <li> some removers give me a rash, no matter how carefully I follow the instructions. this one does not. Veet products don&#x27;t seem to have as strong of an odor as some of the other brands.</li>
            <li> So you use the first time and when the hair grows back does it grow back thw same or does it grow back with less hair? Please someone help mee</li>
            <li> This product is a great alternative to shaving/waxing. The tool it came with is handy. I actually applied the cream with it so I didn&#x27;t have to wash my hands over and over. While it can be used to remove the cream as well, something more textured (such as a washcloth) will grab hairs that are not quite detached. It has a strong flowery chemical smell, but it&#x27;s not terrible (much improved from 10 years ago). The smell does not last very long on your legs, but it will linger in the room for a few hours. Unless you are actually allergic to the cream (read directions), it is great for sensitive skin. No razor burn, no pulling/pinching, no friction, no redness. There was a slight cooling and tightening sensation when the application reached about 7 minutes, but no side effects after washing it off. It does take a good 30 minutes if you do one leg at a time between application/waiting/rinsing. Rinse with warm water in a bathtub - DO NOT USE SOAP. The skin feels very slippery when rinsing (I&#x27;d like to think it&#x27;s the aloe that soaked in, but who knows). After patting dry, my legs were smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving, but I live in FL, so ten months out of the year, it&#x27;s pretty mandatory. I&#x27;ve tried Nair as well, but no matter how much I shave off -- pun intended -- the wait time, I always get an unsightly, itchy chemical rash on my legs. (Because that&#x27;s so much better than the hair....?) That never happens with Veet. I get smooth legs and no rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have some issues with itching afterward, but if I keep my legs thoroughly moisturized, that&#x27;s less of an issue.</li>
            <li> Veet is the best, least likely to burn you, hair cream on the market, and this is the best Veet option if you have sensitive skin. The 3-5 minute one is too aggressive, and this 5-10 minute one you can leave on for 10 minutes, let it thoroughly do the job, and still not be burned.</li>
            <li> Having read and re-read many of the reviews about this product I decided to push the boundaries of human endurance to hitherto unknown limits. The reason I did this are a mystery to me to this day.  One week after placing my order and £13,211 lighter I took delivery of 126 cases of Veet and for the next three days pumped every bottle dry into a dump skip pre-lined with carbon fibre impregnated lead. Initially all went well with my pumping and I adopted a steady regime of 4 hours pumping followed by 30 minutes rest, but as the hours rolled by it seemed as though nature itself had started to cry.  By the end of day one dark clouds gathered overhead whilst just five miles distant my nearest neighbours basked in glorious sunshine. At 3.18 pm on day two I noticed that birds no longer sang in any of the trees around my castle, and the once familiar bees were swarming as one into the flames of our industrial boiler.  As dawn broke on day three a wolf walked out of the forest in a state of total delirium.  It sat next to the six remaining cases of Veet and with rolling eyes began to tear off its own flesh in a methodical yet detached manner.  As the wolf finally expired I noticed that the fumes from the Veet skip had already dissolved every hair on my body and the enamel surrounding the nerves of my teeth had entirely disappeared. Doggedly pumping the final bottles of Veet into the skip caused the loss of every nail on my hands and my lips to shrivel back hideously back into my face like an poorly preserved mummy, painfully exposing my flapping teeth nerves to the elements .  Eyes and nose bleeding and with the fabric of my ear drums almost completely dissolved I could only just detect the enormous crash of thunder and flash of lightning as I finally removed my clothes and prepared to dive naked into my bath of destiny.  I find it difficult to write in words what happened during the next moments of my now massively altered and shortened life but force myself to do so for the sake of all future users.  Every muscle in my body went into acute spasm and my mouth let forth a silent scream of such torment that trees shed their bark in a bizarre defensive reaction.  I thrashed and clawed around in the skip in a desperate attempt to get out but my liquified fingers melted mockingly against the edges of the skip.  My once proud cervical massager retracted with such velocity that it reappeared through my rear gunner only to detach from my body and hiss downwards like a doomed U boat into the unforgiving cream from hell.  How I eventually came to get out of the skip no one truly knows.  Some say that a blind panther swung down on a rope and plucked me out with it&#x27;s claws, whilst others simply say nothing. I have bought Veet, I have pumped Veet, I lain with Veet.  I am Veet</li>
            <li> Left it on for twice the recommended time and it still did not work.</li>
            <li> I love this it makes me fell so good</li>
            <li> Smells bad during application, but doesn&#x27;t linger and does the job it needs to do.</li>
            <li> Yep, takes the hair out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dark blonde with sensitive skin, and this product didn&#x27;t work for me AT ALL. The directions say to leave it on your skin between 5-10mins and then scrape it off... so I tried to split the difference and do 7-8mins... not only did it not work, it burned/tingled the entire time, and then left a thick waxy coat of gunk on my skin. Very displeased - would definitely not recommend.</li>
            <li> Alright so I got tired of shaving every couple days and dealing with stubble. I have to wear shorts to work out every morning (I&#x27;m in the Army) so I feel like its obvious when I don&#x27;t shave. I decided to try Veet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At $9.99 I figured it wasn&#x27;t the cheapest thing to try but its cheaper than buying razors all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My leg hair was pretty short but above the skin. I applied the veet and waited 6 or 7 minutes (recommended time is 5-10 minutes). I followed the directions exactly, using the little scraper to remove it. It really didn&#x27;t seem like it did much. I had read that some other people had to apply it twice so I got out of the shower, dried off and applied it again. This time I waited 10 minutes, the maximum time recommended. This time when I scraped it off it actually seemed like it worked fairly well. There was still a few spots of stubble and the hair near the ankles is still dark just below the skin. You can&#x27;t feel it but you can see it. But I guess there&#x27;s nothing that can be done about that short of waxing to rip the actual follicles out. I shaved the stubble and called it a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, it wasn&#x27;t a total disappointment but it wasn&#x27;t exactly great either. Since it took two applications it ended up taking like 30 minutes which is definitely longer than shaving. Then to have to shave parts anyway was annoying. But what it did remove seems smooth so I guess we&#x27;ll see how long the smoothness lasts, how it grows back, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I would recommend this to others but then again a lot of other people seem like that had way more success than I did.</li>
            <li> If you have very fine hair...this may work for you.  I have coarse hair and kept this on (applied thick) for 20 minutes &amp; it barely removed hair.  I definitely had to go back &amp; shave.  THis, in addition to the fact that it is so caustic, means I will not guy it again.</li>
            <li> Ok so i&#x27;ve used other creams, and waxed, my arms before. NAIR is better than this! After I apply it, and wait forever, when i take it off (WITH the special remover thing) not all the hair is gone, and it ALL leaves stubble it does NOT completely come off. The only reason this didn&#x27;t get 1 star is because i like the little plastic thing that comes with it to remove the cream. It&#x27;s much easier to get the smelly cream off your arms (or wherever you put it).</li>
            <li> Lets be smart here.  Unless you just have that super sensitive skin and are smart about how long you actually leave it on, it will not burn.  Take it from a man who put it on the bits.... it did not burn, not even the slightest.  Tingle maybe, but no burn.  Suggest that you trim pretty good in that area first prior to applying.  Test two areas the size of quarters.  Stop at 10 minutes on one, stop at 13 on the second.  See which did better or enough.  Repeat in 72 hours on the rest of the area.  The &amp;#34;spatula&amp;#34; as they call it was worthless.  Just rub off with a dry towel when done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to find an alternative to shaving, as I have very sensitive skin and it&#x27;s really easy for me to get razor burn. I found this in a Dollar General last year but after I bought it, I was too scared to try it, because I didn&#x27;t know if it would burn or hurt my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning I tried it on a small patch of hair on my leg, immediately there was a very slight burning, but it wasn&#x27;t unbearable, so I left it on for 5 minutes, then wiped some off with a wet wash cloth like the tube said. Some of the hair came off, so I left it on for another minute and wiped it all off. There&#x27;s still a couple hairs left behind, but my skin feels mostly smooth. My skin in that area feels very sensitive to touch right now, and I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal, but it&#x27;s kinda like I got &amp;#34;rug burn&amp;#34; and any slight amount of rubbing makes the skin burn a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if I don&#x27;t have a reaction to it, I will leave it on for 6-7 (maybe even 8) minutes instead of 5-6. I have very thick hair so I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to get everything in 5 minutes minimum.</li>
            <li> It removed the excess hair in the areas I needed it too.  I followed the directions and didn&#x27;t experience any skin irritation like I had with other products.</li>
            <li> No issues with sensitivity, for me.  Leave it on for 5 minutes and it will remove every bit of hair it contacts.  A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Does the trick. I&#x27;ve used it in sensitive areas and had no problems.</li>
            <li> it works but is hard to use , won&#x27;t buy again  Daryl</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t shave the hair against the grain in my arm pits or bikini line without leaving bumps. This, when uses appropriately and not too long on your skin, is great. It doesn&#x27;t leave a weird smell either. Leaves my skin really, really smooth afterwards as well. My boyfriend even uses it on his back hair. I would highly recommend this product for men and women.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of ingrown hairs and stubble look on my underarms, which are the main issues that I wanted Veet to cure. Veet doesn&#x27;t stink that bad, it didn&#x27;t burn my usually sensitive skin, and I would say it removed 80 to 90% of the hair. For underarms I had to leave the product on for 9 minutes to get good removal action; when I tried just 5 minutes it wasn&#x27;t so useful.  I had to use a razor for touchup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BEST part of this product was when I used it on my legs. We moved to the desert where it never rains and for 3 years I&#x27;ve had dusty/dry looking skin on my legs. The hair is fine so usually I don&#x27;t mess with it. But I wanted to experiment with the Veet. So, I used it on one leg so I could compare it with the other leg. The Veet cleaned off most of the fine, blonde hair. AND it cleaned up the dry skin! No amount of exfoliating stuff or lotion has made that skin look nice in years. Treated it with Veet and now, 3 days later, my leg is still shiny and soft and beautiful without any use of lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note, I did use a soap called Epil Stop [[ASIN:B008N0QE8G Epil Stop Perfect Finish Neutralizing After Wash,6 Oz (Pack of 4)]] right after using the Veet. I wanted to be careful and clean off any chemicals because I have sensitive skin. My skin is so sensitive that when I used Sensitive Nair [[ASIN:B000WOU38S Sensitive Formula Bikini Cream with Green Tea Hair Remover by Nair, 1.7 Ounce]] before, I was left with red blisters/burst blood vessels all over my legs.</li>
            <li> I unfortunately have the hairy Italian genes. I am a woman, but I have dark, noticeable hair in places that women &amp;#34;shouldn&#x27;t.&amp;#34; Shaving is a pain, gives me ingrown hairs, and lasts barely a day before the hair starts growing back. I was looking for an alternative so I decided to try Veet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This didn&#x27;t work well on my legs or bikini line, where the hair is very thick and dark. I didn&#x27;t really expect it to because of how coarse the hair is. But it worked perfectly on areas where the hair is finer - my belly, lower back, and arms. I only had to keep it on for the minimum of 5 minutes. I didn&#x27;t have any burning, itching, or irritation. The hair hasn&#x27;t started growing back yet, after 2 days, which is for me, as the bottle claims, twice as long as shaving.</li>
            <li> Its one of the best quality, like it a lot, lasts long time and it doesnt give me a rush</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. If your impatient and remove gel too early it doesn&#x27;t work properly. Keeps me smooth for about 3 days longer compared to shaving.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have very good success with this product. I tried it once and it irritated my skin pretty badly. It has been sitting untouched under my sink for a year now.</li>
            <li> Since it said sensitive I used it on my face, it didn&#x27;t burn it and worked great.  Haven&#x27;t obviously left it on long enough for the legs, that did not work out well..... armpits worked great though!</li>
            <li> Good and satisfactory.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse hair. I bought this to do my bikini line &amp; shape my lady area. I left it on as directed for no longer than 10 minutes. I never experienced burning or anything, that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m taking stars off for. I don&#x27;t think the product stinks either. It just doesn&#x27;t remove all of the hair. I&#x27;m left with the tops of the hair gone but the root still there plain as day, like I shaved badly. It doesn&#x27;t remove hair from the root so it ends up growing right back in a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the hair, the thinnest and smallest are completely removed but that&#x27;s not a lot of them. I didn&#x27;t get any upsetting bumps or anything. May work for others but for those with dark, thick hair this may not work so well. Will try something else.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works, I have pretty much shaved my whole life and razors are getting more expensive and shaving is tedious so I thought I&#x27;d try this. First time using it today, applied while wearing a latex glove to avoid touching it with my hands (contact lens wearer so I touch my eyes a lot), let it on for the max time because I have thicker hair. Hopped in the shower and scraped all the hair off, this stuff is miraculous, I may never go back to shaving</li>
            <li> inconsistent back hair removal.  Not an answer for me</li>
            <li> I am a member of the Veet Vixens on Crowdtap &amp; may receive perks &amp; rewards as a member.&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely sensitive skin, but this product works great for me! Smooth skin and no irritation...WONDERFUL..!!</li>
            <li> Did not work for me...and No..I&#x27;m not a hairy gorilla.... Lol..just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This does not work at all I&#x27;m very disappointed in having to waste all the money and for it not to work.</li>
            <li> Before trying Veet Hair Remover Cream - Sensitive Formula, I haven&#x27;t used a depilatory cream in years. Remember when Nair was the only hair removal cream on the market? And it smelled horrible! I gave Veet a shot because I was tired of shaving and waxing is painful. This product has it&#x27;s pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my legs first, and my hair is dark and rather coarse, so I was skeptical. I left it on for 9-10 minutes and it worked! The directions tell you to apply a liberal amount and then use a damp washcloth to remove the cream. The hair came right off and I rinsed my legs in the shower to remove any residual cream. The smell isn&#x27;t noxious, but not pleasant either. You&#x27;ll want to leave the bathroom fan running and throw your washcloth in the laundry right away. It only moderately angered my eczema, and after a little Cortizone TLC, my gams were right as rain. And then I got cocky ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my armpits. I followed the directions, but may have left the cream on too long. Anyway, I ended up with what I can only describe as a chemical burn that created painful welts in the creases on my underarms. Ladies (and gents!), please remember that this product contains chemicals that will harm your skin. And apparently my armpits are too sensitive for Veet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, I&#x27;ll finish out the rest of the bottle on my legs. But since I burned my underarms and the results are about the same as shaving - I plan to stick to razors and Veet wax strips.</li>
            <li> I rate this product 100%. The best product for sensitive skin. Hair&lt;br /&gt;regrowth is slower and makes your skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> I have a love/hate relationship with Nair.  It makes my skin look really pretty, but at the same time I end up with itchy red patches all over my body that last for weeks.  It makes me look like I have some kind of weird skin condition.  It is obviously a fantastic exfoliator.  It’s just not worth it, however, and I give up.  I’m reading here that Veet doesn’t cause irritation so I’m looking forward to trying it.  But I am writing a review even though I haven’t used it yet just to let people know that if you do decide to use Nair, I found something that will help calm down the itchy red patches.  I tried about 20 different moisturizers and they all made the problem much worse!  Then I tried  Aveeno Moisturizer (with Colloidal Oatmeal and Dimethicone).  It almost completely stops the itching and the patches will disappear much quicker if you use it.  It’s amazing.  I am even able to rub it into the patches without further irriation.  Try that with some other moisturizer and you will make it itch worse.  I am jumping ship and trying the Veet, no more Nair for me!  I’m tired of looking like I’ve got a skin condition.  Just for the record, I don’t usually have sensitive skin.  I put all kinds of things on my skin with no problem, Nair is just really, really bad for skin.</li>
            <li> Never used such an item before and this was such a pleasant experience. When you follow the directions as instructed its easy and even a bit fun to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always hated shaving as I always cut my legs especially my knees and waxing was just painful so I decided to try the hair removers. Nair did absolutely nothing so I tried Veet instead. It worked wonderfully on my legs and underarms. The little spatula thing just scratched my legs though a washcloth worked much better and use plenty of lotion afterwards. There was no burn just a little itchiness and the smell was a bit unpleasant but didn&#x27;t linger and it was easy to remove.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only rating this product with one star because it did make my legs soft.  The job it did on the hair removal felt like my legs do after about a day or two after I&#x27;ve shaved with a regular razor - not smooth at all.  I was disappointed, but I thought I would give it another try so after I waited the recommended time in between the process which was 72 hours, I tried again - hoping it would finally get my legs totally smooth.  It might&#x27;ve got some that it missed previously and some from in between the processes, but that was it and the bottle was empty.  Still no smoothness, it just feels like I had shaved a couple days prior.  And it stained under my nails brown so if I was to ever try creams again, I&#x27;d go with using gloves to apply it.</li>
            <li> Albeit supposed to be for women. But this works well for the men as well. This is the first time trying it and I must say it works very very very well. It doesn&#x27;t have a gross smell and works fast too.</li>
            <li> The smell is really nice - some essential oil, lavender maybe?  Also it does remove hair very fast and gently. However, after using it under my armpit, i could still see some short hair there after first attempt. So I reapplied the cream the next day for best result..</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work that well, hair is usually still there after use.</li>
            <li> “I am a member of the Veet Vixens on Crowdtap &amp; may receive perks &amp; rewards as a member.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Veet for sensitive skin helps keep my legs and underarms smooth. Since I have problem with my hands due to arthritis holding a razor can be difficult if not dangerous so finding a product that works on my sensitive skin is important. Veet works beautifully and it does not irritate or cause issues with my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different hair removal products and this is pretty good. Not as effective as nair but won&#x27;t leave your skin raw.. I will be making another purchase</li>
            <li> I purchased the Veet gel cream and I am pleasantly surprised. I used it as soon as I got home with it. I applied to both legs, lower part only, and left it on for 10 mins. To rinse, I sat on the side of the bathtub with warm water running, but not directly on my legs. I used to \\&quot;spatula\\&quot; that came with it. It removed 99% of the hair on my legs! It does have an odor, similar to hair perm solution, but nothing intolerable. After I removed all the cream, I rinsed my legs VERY well with water only and patted dry. My daughter is a pre teen and this would be perfect for her instead of actually shaving. Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work how I expected, a Razor blade works better.</li>
            <li> This product works in removing unwanted hair as it aims to but the smell is pretty horrible. It&#x27;s a cross between old lady&#x27;s perfume and very strong chemical scents. It&#x27;s a little discouraging. I know this is normal for a product like this but I wish they could figure out a way to cover it up a little better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times now, and it takes care of my hair pretty well, I don&#x27;t use it twice a week like I should to keep my hair away, so I still have leg hair a lot of the time, but it doesn&#x27;t really start to prickle for a few days after I use it. It does miss a few spots but I think that&#x27;s more user error than the cream itself. The spatula is useless, I just use a loofa thing to scrub away the hair and I&#x27;m smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom for 48 hours. Which is nice since you can&#x27;t do it for 3 days, so by the third day I&#x27;m a little scruffy but not much, about how much it would be for me to shave it before. but it takes me so long that I only do it once a week.</li>
            <li> AWESOME! It lasts a really long time. The only problem with it is the smell and that if you don&#x27;t put a good layer of it on the area, it won&#x27;t work. :(</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife and she has used this product for several years. Works great and is safe for bikini area.</li>
            <li> No bad smell, easy to use, effective. White cream that applies easily. Leave on upper lip 5-6 minutes and wipe off with moistened cotton pad. Gets rid of all the hair with no burning and no redness afterwards. Generous quantity that will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Omg. This product is amazing. I did not purchase if from Amazon, bought it from Kroger&#x27;s for 10 bucks but it was worth it! Also, it says don&#x27;t use around pubic area. I have sensitive skin and thick hair, when I used it around my vaginal area, 6 minutes later it was all gone! Works like magic! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I have really senitive skin and break out from everything, so this is true to its claim because it does not cause any reaction to my skin. Works well, put it on and use the little plastic spatula to wipe away hair. IT DOES MEAN IT WHEN IT SAYS NO LONGER THEN 10 MINUTES, i did 9 minutes and ended up with a little burn on my chest and arm.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive legs (I can&#x27;t shave with a razor, even epilators and hot wax kits weren&#x27;t working particularly well) and I had all but given up until I discovered Veet! It works like a charm and my legs don&#x27;t itch or get razor burn. It is literally a dream come true.</li>
            <li> If you have fair or sensitive skin, even if your body hair is fair &amp; fine... I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this. I had scabs over random pores on my legs &amp; burning for days even though I had tried a test spot with no re-action &amp; waited a few days after the test spot to do the full application as directed. It still didn&#x27;t remove all my fine blonde hair somehow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have ever had a bad reaction with hair removal creams before &amp; want to try this because it says sensitive - don&#x27;t. I had a similar experience a decade &amp; a half ago, but figured maybe I didn&#x27;t follow directions or that these products are more advanced now. Nope, my skin is still too sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have no problems with these products, my MIL keeps a bottle in her shower &amp; uses it regularly so I figured I would try it for myself, no go.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t worth it if your hair is too thick.</li>
            <li> Smells like typical hair removing cream, but it gave me a lot of ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> Works just as advertised</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a depilatory cream guru, or a newbie.  I use them rarely, not regularly, but have dabbled for probably ten years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the large size, and good lord is the pump-style of the bottle convenient (about time, depilatory creams!).  But....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not one of the best out there.  Sensitive formula?  Sure.  But all that seems to mean is that the dissolving power is weaker.  Left it on longer than instructed, used PLENTY of cream, and it didn&#x27;t even take the hair off my legs, never mind thicker hair around the underarms or bikini area.  I&#x27;ve not met a cream - until now - that has a problem with my leg hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the stuff.</li>
            <li> I ordered the sensitive formula but received the original formula. I decided to keep it and try it our. Product works rather well. I did not get any burning or itching formula. After the ten minuets the scrapper took off the cream along with most of the hair. I had to use a wet towel to get the rest off because the scrapper didn&#x27;t take it all off. I like this product and will order again.</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money for me. I decided to give this a try as I have very dark and thick hair on my legs and shaving just doesn&#x27;t do the trick. The first time I used it, it only removed one patch of hair correctly. Everywhere else you can still see the dark roots. I have given this product multiple chances and still have not seen good results.</li>
            <li> Did what it was supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the mother of a special needs 17 year old girl.  And while she functions at about a 10 year old level, she is very aware of what her peers are doing and recently wants to follow the social norms, which is amazing for us.  It started with shaving her armpits (I do it for her) since she swims several times a week, as well as for hygiene.  She had mentioned shaving her legs several times (as in constantly) but due to an accident with one of my razors when she was about 12 (still has the scar), she&#x27;s very afraid of shaving her legs, even letting me do it.  So I&#x27;ve kind of kept in my mind that maybe a hair removing lotion is what we&#x27;d be looking at someday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, she turned 17 this past week and it&#x27;s summer, so I figured we&#x27;d go for it.  It was available for about $6 at Target, and I had a $2 coupon as well as a Target Cartwheel for 20% off, so why not?  The reviews were more good than bad and it was for sensitive skin, which she and I both have.  I tested it on myself first, a small strip on my shin, which hadn&#x27;t been shaved in a couple of days.  I waited exactly 5 minutes and wiped it off with a warm washcloth and by God...it left a bare, shiny patch of skin with no stubble.  No burning, no itching, no redness.  I waited another hour just to make sure and then tested it on her.  Same thing, a square about the size of half of a Hershey Bar.  Watched her closely to make sure she wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable or hurting in any way and wiped it off after exactly 5 minutes and NO HAIR.  On a pretty hairy little leg that&#x27;s never seen a shaving.  No redness, not a single hair left.  I&#x27;m really impressed, guys.  Cheap, easy on our skin and quick.  No one&#x27;s bleeding, no one&#x27;s soaked from leaning into someone else&#x27;s shower..this is a big deal for us.  The smell was pretty &amp;#34;home-perm&amp;#34; invasive, but for that little inconvenience, still very much worth it.  For anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried it, especially a parent of a special needs girl, give it a shot!</li>
            <li> Leave my skin soft and smooth and last longer than using  the razor. I definitely recommend it , very gentle formula for  the skin.</li>
            <li> This product works great! Exactly as advertised. Couldn&#x27;t be happier. I would highly recommend this product to anyone interested in it.</li>
            <li> Awesome hair removal cream for all the parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll smell pretty foul while doing this, but it&#x27;ll be worth it. Be sure to not do this after showering or during showering or your pores will open up, and this will go in and it&#x27;ll hurt like lawd. Just add a thick amount everywhere on dry skin, keep it on long enough as you can stand (20 mins) If you don&#x27;t get enough hair off after rubbing it off with a towel you must&#x27;ve not applied enough or waited long enough. Don&#x27;t bother with the scraper that it comes with, just throw that thing out.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best I tried several versions and brands. No comparison. Nair still has an order and the spray ones tend to drip. I also love the plastic scraper. These worked so well too off massive amounts of hair from a mans legs and chest. Did not burn and feel like all others are a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Be careful you dont leave it on too long. and make sure you moisturize twice a day FOR AT LEAST 3 days after you use it.</li>
            <li> But, for some one who doesn&#x27;t mind the smell of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly...  This product STINKS!, not in bad quality, but smells, horribly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it works, but not that great, it will still leave you with a lot of hair, if you have a lot of body hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried other hair removing creams and Veet is the only one that has worked for me.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My brother uses it for his head &amp; he suggested I try it for my legs. It somewhat worked, but not entirely. Some hair stuck around. I&#x27;m not surprised though.</li>
            <li> First of all this is false advertising because the bottle is purple and a different shape. Second it barely removes any hair and if you keep on too long it will be red and hurt for days. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> First of all, listen to the instructions and don&#x27;t go over 10 minutes. Save yourself from getting the burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend recommended me this product, I personally was iffy about trying it because of the reviews. I&#x27;ve searched creams since I hate shaving, it causes tons of bumps and it&#x27;s expensive to buy a razor every few weeks-to a month (I don&#x27;t shave too often). My friend suggested me to leave it on for 15 minutes, he said that it didn&#x27;t burn him or anything and next time he would try it longer. I gave the 24 hour test on my upper thigh where no one would see if it went horribly wrong, left it 15 minutes before cleaning. Next day, all clear, no burn, no pain, nothing. I was ready to go, I started with my legs, left it 15 minutes. Slight burn within the first minute, it stopped soon enough, and so I kept it there. 15 minutes came up, I started clearing it up with the tool it came with. When I started using the tool, the burning began, my legs started getting red. Pain! (not over the top, more like I got sunburn) , but to top it all off there was a lot of hair left. I was already annoyed, but I decided to give it a try on my thighs next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time I wasn&#x27;t going to use my friends horrible advice and actually follow the instructions. I packed it on and see if this time it got rid of all of the hair unlike my legs! 10 minutes came up, and I started clearing it up. The hair did come off way better than my lower legs, the burn was starting to get me. Fortunately after about 10 minutes, it cleared/went away. My lower legs are still tingling an hour after finishing with them. It&#x27;s not painful, and i can deal with it, I&#x27;m just worried that it will worsen later on. I tried my armpits for about 8 minutes, okay results, better than my lower legs. No pain/burn. I tried my groin, no more than 5 minutes. I was not going to risk my groin, results not good (thank god that there was no burn though). So I will give it a try in 3 days to a week again on my lower legs. I will pack it on and leave it for no more than 10 minutes!!!! I&#x27;ll update my review if I get better results. The 3 stars are for the fact that it didn&#x27;t get rid of all the hair. I know that the burning is my fault for listening to my friends terrible advice! I just wonder if it&#x27;s a good idea to shave the remaining hair, I feel weird having patches of hair left on my 75% shaven legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it at least twice since my terrible experience. I gave it another star because the hair did come off the second time I used it. Everything came off, but I had to use a lot. I made sure to take it all off by the time the timer hit 10 minutes, so no more burning. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for you to be rebellious and go over the 10 minutes. It&#x27;s not worth the pain. Make sure to use a lot of product (I mean a lot), and get it off by 10 minutes. After the third time, I feel like I don&#x27;t have much product left which means that I have to go buy another bottle of this stuff. I feel like if the razors lasted me longer if I&#x27;m honest. 2 bottles of this for about 10 dollars at my local store Vs a $10 razor. It&#x27;s probably about the same thing honestly. I&#x27;m just trying to find a way to save on shaving. The third time, the front of my right leg was still full of hair. It was all covered in white before I removed the product, so I just added more to see if it got rid of it. It did, I just hate how much product I have to use for it to get rid of the hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this specifically to use just on my arms and it&#x27;s perfect. Wherever the cream touches removes all hair. Hair on my arms are thin and fine and removed it in one use. The smell is a little bad but I leave it on for 5 mins and remove hair then wash off with water and soap and it&#x27;s all gone. It stays that way for  a week. I do it every other week and I haven&#x27;t had problems with the hair growing back thicker or darker.</li>
            <li> Took longer than expected to remove hair</li>
            <li> kinda burns and leaves red marks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had good luck with hair removers. I&#x27;m Italian and have very coarse hair. It took a long time to work and didn&#x27;t remove all my hair.</li>
            <li> Got for my daughter who has very sensitive skin. She says it works great and doesn&#x27;t irritate her skin.</li>
            <li> Works great,&lt;br /&gt;just buy it OTC from a local pharmacy.&lt;br /&gt;amazon is over prices on such items</li>
            <li> This product was nice while using. I did not have any skin problem or sensitiveness problem after using this product.</li>
            <li> Best depilatory I&#x27;ve ever used...</li>
            <li> I have used this product, and also Nair. I found Nair worked extremely well, while Veet was less than undesirable. I left it on for the full 10 min, and the hair did not want to come off. Using the little squeegee did NOTHING to remove the hair unless you pressed so hard it left marks on your skin. I would say maybe 30% of the hair came off with this as opposed to the hair which took off 95% without having to apply a ridiculous amount of pressure to your legs. I tried this Veet product on 3 separate occasions, and sadly the results did not get any better.</li>
            <li> comes off quicly...less mess</li>
            <li> This the first time I&#x27;ve tried Veet. I used other creams in the past and couldn&#x27;t stand the smell. It works great and the smell doesn&#x27;t knock you down when you use it. Lol</li>
            <li> I really like using this hair remover. Leaves my skin soft, no irritation to my tender parts and it really doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as the others I&#x27;ve tried. My hair grows quickly so I use this weekly. I have it on subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work, I sent it back</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly for the bikini area but also tried it on my legs. It definitely worked much better on my legs but i was not happy with the bikini results at all and that is the main reason i bought this.&lt;br /&gt;I guess because the hair over there is much thicker and coarser.... but it left patches of hair and also did not get a clean/close job. ugh.&lt;br /&gt;I used this on a small spot as instructed and then waited over 24 hours to use again. But after using this on my legs, my legs felt raw and they burned a bit. I did not go over the 10 minute maximum time to use this.&lt;br /&gt;That burning feeling went away by the next morning, but still, I do not think I will use this again. Especially since it is way more time consuming then just shaving and can get a bit messy.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Works. This is good for sensitive skin snd for people who hate razors and waxes!! I have eczema and i do not have any side effects from this.</li>
            <li> I am so excited about this stuff! I have dark curly hair, which on a positive side means I have an awesome thick head of hair but on the downside I also have dark leg hair that grows FAST. When I shave my legs I have stubble by the night or next morning. Waxing leaves my legs smoother for longer but is painful and expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff if easy and leaves my legs smooth for days!&lt;br /&gt;All you do is apply a thin layer of cream to the area, wait 5-10 minutes, then wipe it off. That&#x27;s it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have stated it does smell, I would compare it to perm or hair dye. I took a shower right after using the cream and after my shower the smell was lighter but still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle I received looks different than the bottle in the picture but is the same thing. I attached the picture to show what the bottle actually looks like.</li>
            <li> i purched this item because i had never used a prodct like this before and worked great on my legs but my hair is a bit too thick for this formula to effecivly work on my underarms; with that said i purchsed this orginal formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS AN ITEM FOR THOSE WHO HAVE THIN HAIR ON THEIR UNDER ARMS AND LEGS! IF YOU DONT KNOW WETHER OR NOT UR HAIR IS TOO THICK THEN YOUR HAIR IS TOO THICK. haha just in case you didnt know.</li>
            <li> No matter what cream I use my legs or how long I leave it on it doesnt work for me but it does work for my boyfriend so its not a total loss</li>
            <li> Not the product I expected.  It&#x27;s the same thing as shaving, just a little less often..</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive to reacting to harsh chemicals. I read the instructions and applied it to the areas I needed to treat. Left it on for ten minutes and it wiped off easily and with no irritation. I was able to was my skin with soap right after applying and no irritation. Never could I do that using the other hair remover brand. I will purchase this again!</li>
            <li> My first experience with Veet was not very pleasant. When I first saw the commercial I ran to the store thinking, This is the greatest thing ever! No more razors!?&lt;br /&gt;To my dismay, I was left with burning and literally, bleeding skin. I should have known with my extremely high maintenance skin (one shower without lotion leaves me with peeling and itching skin).&lt;br /&gt;While roaming on Amazon I saw this &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34; formula and thought I should give it another chance.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I tried it last week and I was terrified.&lt;br /&gt;I started with the minimum time. After a wash and no burning, with only a little hair that removed I tried it again the next day with a longer time. It removed slightly more hair and again, I had no side effects. I tried it again yesterday with the max time and more hair was removed this time, but not all. I blame my thick Italian hair gene, so in a couple days I will be trying it again going maybe a minute over the max time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is more time consuming than shaving, but it does leave my legs smoother, so I am satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again! Yay, (almost) no razors!</li>
            <li> this is a safe and easy way to remove hair. i am using it for long time i did not notice any side effect</li>
            <li> As promised work perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again, price is great also.&lt;br /&gt;I am using it for years and it is great</li>
            <li> Well to start it does work, decently well. Can it be a replacement to shaving? Yes. Will I use it to replace shaving? Absolutely not. Yes it works, but it doesn&#x27;t get every hair so you have to apply it again and again and again. And the worse part it the smell, make sure you take a shower after using this or no ones gonna want to go near you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So do I suggest buying this? If you can get past all that than sure, but honestly save your money.</li>
            <li> Well I have sensitive skin and it burns me, so I&#x27;m going to stay away from it. Back to just shaving.</li>
            <li> Product worked well.  Only felt slight, short-term stinging after the application while showering with regular bath soap.</li>
            <li> Did work for me. I am just using it for underarms. I apply and keep it for 7 mins and then slowly using the spatula remove the cream. It does work for underarms. Have to apply again after 2 to 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Great product! Works great and fast! Best hair remover that I&#x27;ve used!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid, this stuff is not going to burn your skin off! Guys and ladies, this works like a dream. I&#x27;ve used it on my entire lower body, chest, and underarms with no problems. Just be sure you leave it on for ten minutes so that it can get all the hair! I used it, and have absolutely no complaints. BUY IT NOW!</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this, I was weary after reading some of the reviews on Amazon. Having extremely sensitive skin, I was even more worried that I&#x27;d have some sort of terrible reaction. Anyway, I purchased it from the store and planned to try it on my bikini area. Before you use it, you are supposed to try it in a small area to make sure you won&#x27;t have a reaction to it and to see how long you need it to be on for. I put a little on and left it for the minimum of 5mins. After 5mins was up, I used the included spatula to scrape off the gel and hair; some hair did come off, but most was left behind. Although I was disappointed, I decided to try it on my entire bikini area and leave it on for 8mins. I came back 8mins later, scraped it off, and it was like I just shaved (but even better)! It was smooth, no burning/itching, and most importantly, no soreness from razor bumps! The area was red for a while afterwards, but the redness went away. Next time, I plan on scraping the gel and hair off in the shower, as it will be way more easier to keep rinsing the spatula. To those who have said that this smells terrible, it isn&#x27;t the worst smell I&#x27;ve ever encountered; to me, it smells like a perm treatment. If you&#x27;re skeptical of this product, I&#x27;d say buy it and try it out. Just be sure to follow the instructions carefully!</li>
            <li> I gave this product five star rating because many products say it&#x27;s for sensitive skin and long and behold your skin starts melting off along with the hair and just about everything else you placed the product on. So just for keeping its integrity on that basis alone, gets five stars in my book. Also surprisingly the smell is not too nauseous I mean don&#x27;t go sniffing &amp; inhaling it. But just for removing hair off your legs armpits bikini line and following the Directions responsibly this product is definitely for sensitive skin. My skin is obnoxiously sensitive. I&#x27;ll break out if somebody sneezes on me too hard. I would with the greatest confidence recommend this hair removing product to anyone with sensitive skin because this is the product that I use to remove hair that needs to be removed on my person.</li>
            <li> This products works perfect for me. I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t bother me, I even leave it on for 10 minutes. If the plastic scraper doesn&#x27;t get all the hair, I grab my louffa to scrub off the rest. After the shower, I use a body oil to keep my skin moisturized and happy. I&#x27;m so glad to have this on amazon and a subscribe and save!</li>
            <li> Works still has a slightly high smell but maybe my nose is just mega sensitive. Not upset at this buy.</li>
            <li> Works quickly and no irritation! Love it</li>
            <li> This was the first hair removal product i have used, And i have to say i am amazed. i Applied the cream onto my Legs, waited about 9 minutes, Then gently removed it with the spatula provided.  My skin feels so Smooth, and looks beautiful aswell. i Will continue to buy this Hair Remover And  would certainly recommend it!</li>
            <li> this does work, has an ok smell, but watch it closely on how long you need to keep it on , test a small area to see if hair removes easily and wait maybe a little while before you re apply. GAve it four stars because the scraper you use to remove the hair is a nice idea, but if you loose it ? what then? and the end where you scrape the hair off could be a bit thinner so it is easier for it to grab the hair closer to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is a good product, definitely recommend , especially if you are tired of shaving and in case you self tan and get those dark spots on your legs? This product helped some....but still I have not 100% cure for the spots&lt;br /&gt;tried shaving after the self tanner, before, 1 day before etc.</li>
            <li> Seriously just throw it away. I have never had a problem getting burned by this product and it always takes care of my hair removal, even coarse hair around my bikini line. I don&#x27;t even leave it on for the maximum time. The trick is to apply it generously and then when it&#x27;s time to take it off I hop in the shower and rub a loofa that is reserved exclusively for this purpose against the direction of hair growth, like you would if you were shaving. It takes care of any hairs that don&#x27;t come off easily the first time and I&#x27;m left smooth and happy.</li>
            <li> i tried doing a brazilian with this product and it worked out pretty well! a couple of hairs were left behind though and i had to apply the product twice since i was too afraid to apply it near the genital areas. i also left it on for only about 5 minutes, since i was also scared of all the reviews that said it might give me a chemical burn! next time i will try to go for the 10 minutes since it was a little difficult to wash the hairs off. i had to pull them off a little bit while rinsing with warm water, sounds painful but it really didnt feel like anything since the hairs were already half-way disintegrated. it can get a bit messy and so i recommend not moving around and keeping your legs open so that the cream doesn&#x27;t smudge onto any unwanted areas! two days later hair started growing back but it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. it probably grew back quickly since i didn&#x27;t leave the product on long enough.. overall i do recommend this product since it leaves your skin soft and smooth AND doesn&#x27;t require searing pain like waxing does!</li>
            <li> Came perfectly as described. I got my moneys worth</li>
            <li> works just as advertised!  goodbye unwanted hair</li>
            <li> awsome helps me a lot for hair  removeing</li>
            <li> Have used this stuff for years with no problems and no weird reactions! Smells awful, but that is the name of the game with this stuff :)</li>
            <li> works really well, i used it in the same spot twice in the same week, that was a bad idea since it resulted in a red rash but as long as I space the time using it it works great</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands &amp; formulas and keep coming back to this one.&lt;br /&gt; The sensitive formula is gentle enough for even the most sensitive of areas. (Yeah, you know what i&#x27;m talkin bout.) Just don&#x27;t use it on the same area more than once a week, you won&#x27;t need to but thought i would warn you anyhow. If you are using this on super sensitive areas i don&#x27;t recommend removal with the plastic tool provided. Just jump in the shower and wipe it away with a wash cloth under running water &amp; rinse well. BAM smooooooth. Remember as the package says do NOT over rub it, and do not use soap after rinsing. It will feel a bit odd and you may think Wowsers can my skin get any softer lets slather on some lotion..don&#x27;t. Wait 24 hours before putting ANYthing on it.&lt;br /&gt;For legs, arms, and under arms the removal tool can be used but is not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;Just Buy this you will love it.</li>
            <li> Burned when I placed it on my legs.  Won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li> I bought some of this at the store to use because I find shaving to tedious just to result in a stubbly leg. I ended up using 3/4 of the bottle (I have fairly thick hair), and whether it worked or not varied which was frustrating. I ended up with random patches of hairs everywhere, and I had to go back over everything with a razor just to make sure every thing was even. Where it did work it came out really smooth, but considering that I used so much of it and ended up with iffy results, I&#x27;m not really sure if I&#x27;d buy this again.</li>
            <li> I read all the other reviews and thought that I would be immune to an adverse reaction but I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong! This foul smelling torture cream began burning my skin after a few minutes. I normally shave my underarms but was on vacation and figured I would use the cream everywhere (well, almost everywhere). The skin of my underarms became raised, red and very uncomfortable. I rinsed the cream off from this area right away. The rash lasted for for 2 days and made putting on deodorant very uncomfortable. The hair on my legs didn&#x27;t come off completely even though I hung in there to leave it on for the full time suggested (the cream was not burning my legs). I will stick with my Sally Hansen In the Shower depilatory. Works great every time with no reactions!</li>
            <li> Works fastest and best on fine hair. Courser hair was still removed, it just took the longest time. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I use this product all over my body and I&#x27;ve never had a single problem with it. It removes hair like no other, and despite having relatively sensitive skin I&#x27;ve never had any skin problems from it. I&#x27;ve probably used it about six times now, with liberal application and long legs, and I&#x27;ve still got some left. Dropped one star because it&#x27;s messy and definitely doesn&#x27;t smell the greatest, but it&#x27;s worth it without a doubt.</li>
            <li> it is convenient to use and it is effective. i will recommend to my friends definitely.</li>
            <li> Best thing, I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Does not get rid of the roots. I&#x27;m kinda disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is so much better than the Nair product that i tried.  it doesn&#x27;t burn your skin like nair.  I am planning on buying this again in the future.  i am not giving it 5 stars because you have to leave it on for a little bit longer than the maximum time to make sure all your hair comes off.</li>
            <li> Recived the wrong product!</li>
            <li> Gets job done if hair is long and thick, otherwise, you are better off with a razor</li>
            <li> I bought today and i tried it i swear to god it left me with burns and rashes and bad smell plus there&#x27;s was blood coming out of the area that i used it on it ,It was scary and horrible experience full of burning sensation and bloody spots..I just hate it, Please don&#x27;t wast your money on this bad chemical stuff .</li>
            <li> For some background, I am a male with a very hairy butt. I&#x27;ve used veet in the past on said butt and had no problems. This was a few years ago. I would follow the time with a little stop watch and follow the directions to the T. It worked well for me then. Flash to now and I use it today, a new bottle of it but the same style, and it BURNS LIKE CRAZY!!! My butt feels like the worst sunburn I&#x27;ve ever had, but no blisters. I don&#x27;t know if they altered the formulation from my previous experience to now, or if my skin has changed. After this experience I can not recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there is currently no hair on my buttocks. So, two stars.</li>
            <li> Works pretty decent. Does have a strong chemical smell though so you need to scrub good after use to get rid of the smell.</li>
            <li> Automatic purchases of this product is great.  Keeps the wife happy and reduces my time looking for coupons for the product on the internet.</li>
            <li> Left it on for 6 minutes. Scraper didn&#x27;t work really well so I just gave it and use a scrubber. Worked well enough. I have really think dark hair so I still have about 2 mm of hair but I probably didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough. in another 3 days i&#x27;ll retry and maybe it will work. I will say, I was stupid and put it on my ...lower..areas...as long as you dont get any of that cream on the inside, it&#x27;s alright. But if you aren&#x27;t confident, do not try. I am a very experienced hair remover XD&lt;br /&gt;Also product doesnt smell too bad. My experience usually leaves me smelling like I bathed in bleach. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> It works and best thing is that is not bad on the SKin And doesn&#x27;t need to be on that long to take effect.</li>
            <li> I decided that I would try this product before I got my sleeve tattoo. I get razor burn really bad and didn&#x27;t want that to effect my tattoo. I tried Veet a couple of weeks before my appointment and my arms stayed smooth and hair free for a week. When the hair did grow back it was prickly, it was soft and smooth. I plan on using Veet on my legs and bikini area, next time.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving for quite a while and got tired of it. I ended up buying this product due to the low price and rather good reviews. This product does the job though it does make my skin a little bit angry. Not perfect but it helps.</li>
