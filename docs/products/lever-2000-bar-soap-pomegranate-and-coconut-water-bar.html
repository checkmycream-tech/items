            <li>Really great soap with nice sent and it leaves your skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>Plus, the scent is really nice.</li>
            <li>I like the clean scent of the original better if they could add aloe to the originial forumla without adding the \\&quot;scent\\&quot; of the aloe it would be the perfect bar of soap!</li>
            <li>Safe for kids.</li>
            <li>As for the product, I love Lever 2000 with Aloe.</li>
            <li>And best of all.... it has actually started clearing up my skin!</li>
            <li>Aloe only was the best.</li>
            <li>its is OK.   </li>
            <li>Nice feel on body super clean feel...</li>
            <li>The Aloe is even more mild than the original.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my skin smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>All in all, we both enjoy using Lever 2000 products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We often use this soap and its soft on the skin and give you a good lather.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We have always used the original Lever</li>
            <li>I think that makes a huge difference in how quickly it gets used up.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice and fresh without being over powering as highly scented soaps</li>
            <li>The design of the soap bar is even cool</li>
            <li>Bathing with this product give the sense of feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>They killed this great soap when they added cucumber.  </li>
            <li>For years I have switched among the more skin sensitive stuff.</li>
            <li>Also, the price was right on target.</li>
            <li>bath bar has a very nice subtle fresh clean scent which is pleasing, passing the girly test.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Lever since it first came out</li>
            <li>Sure the bathroom has extra boxes of toothpaste lying around, but I won&#x27;t be running out for a while to come.</li>
            <li>Our whole family has been using this brand of soap for years.</li>
            <li>Lever gets you clean while feeling nice and fresh afterward without a residual soap scum left on your skin.  </li>
            <li>The aloe soap comes with a total of 24 bars while the original bars come with 32.  </li>
            <li>I particularly like this soap as it&#x27;s scent</li>
            <li>Clean and long lasting...not as moisturizing as i would like...</li>
            <li>It rinses nicely, doesn&#x27;t leave soap scum in the shower</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this scent (Fresh Aloe) and</li>
            <li>I was browsing through amazon looking for something new and came across a review for this product and was intrigued.</li>
            <li>and I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying this soap if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry the skin like so many other soaps.  </li>
            <li>Imagine my surprise when the Lever 2000 soap made an obvious and fast change to my skin&#x27;s texture.      </li>
            <li>These days, most soaps seem to just melt away after only a few uses.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean rinsing and leaves no residue that I can detect that can make my skin feel tight and itchy.  </li>
            <li>is more subtle.</li>
            <li>So, I ordered the large package through Amazon and later compared prices via local stores.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come in the same quantity as the original Lever 2000 bars.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lever since it first came out and I have very sensitive skin.  It smells nice and fresh without being over powering as highly scented soaps are no good for your skin anyway.  Lever gets you clean while feeling nice and fresh afterward without a residual soap scum left on your skin.  Non-drying / non-irritating formula.  The Aloe is even more mild than the original.  The design of the soap bar is even cool so it stays in your hand in the slippery shower while you wash!!  Safe for kids. **USE CAUTION ESPECIALLY WITH CHILDREN:  PUT THOSE LITTLE NON-SLIP RUBBER STICKYS DOWN IN YOUR TUB OR USE A MAT!!**</li>
            <li> This is a great soap at a good price.  I&#x27;m happy to be able to purchase it in bulk from Amazon and not have to worry about running out for a while.  My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come in the same quantity as the original Lever 2000 bars.  The aloe soap comes with a total of 24 bars while the original bars come with 32.  My wife and I like to alternate the 2 bars so that we never get bored with any one scent.  This is still a great value and convenience!</li>
            <li> I praise God everyday when I order from Amazon. I am not a well person, plus I am not able to go to get the products I need so going online is best solution for me. As for the product, I love Lever 2000 with Aloe. It keeps my skin smooth and moisturized. Also, the price was right on target.</li>
            <li> I have searched for quite sometime for an everyday soap that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin with regular use. For years I have switched among the more skin sensitive stuff. Once my skin gets used to one it begins to react then I switch up. I was browsing through amazon looking for something new and came across a review for this product and was intrigued. So, I went to the store and bought a two bar pack. That was enough to determine if my skin would allow it&#x27;s use. And it did.  So, I ordered the large package through Amazon and later compared prices via local stores. Way big savings here on amazon folks. Way big.  But, the soap itself is great stuff! Very nice scent, not overpowering at all. It rinses nicely, doesn&#x27;t leave soap scum in the shower/tub like some other fancier ones do. Doesn&#x27;t melt in the dish like others do. Lasts quite a while. Lathers nicely and does a great job at cleaning. And best of all.... it has actually started clearing up my skin! Not completely... but getting there after 3 bars.  I highly recommend trying this soap if you have sensitive skin. You cannot beat the price nor the cleaning power, lack of skin reactions and wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> I particularly like this soap as it&#x27;s scent is more subtle. It isn&#x27;t perfumey.  Our whole family has been using this brand of soap for years.</li>
            <li> They killed this great soap when they added cucumber.  Aloe only was the best.</li>
            <li> Really great soap with nice sent and it leaves your skin feeling smooth. Too bad the size of the bar keeps shrinking what used to be a 5 oz bar is now 4 oz.</li>
            <li> The quality of this soap is really great! These days, most soaps seem to just melt away after only a few uses. But this soap is solid, and lasts a really long time. Plus, the scent is really nice. Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s supposed to be a count of 8. I only got one count of 1. In a small Amazon box.  Giving it a posting of 3 so it&#x27;s not disregarded.  Be Careful...</li>
            <li> I do like lever 2000 orinigal and aloe I like the clean scent of the original better if they could add aloe to the originial forumla without adding the \\&quot;scent\\&quot; of the aloe it would be the perfect bar of soap!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry the skin like so many other soaps.  Pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> This review is because I stayed over my man&#x27;s house...used his product, which is fair...and can happily say...its is OK.   Clean and long lasting...not as moisturizing as i would like...but that is a small critique. Cheers!</li>
            <li> I started using Lever 2000 soap about one year ago after my dermatologist noticed some dry, scaly skin and suggested the Lever 2000 brand.  I was skeptical since I had used mass market soap in the past and found, if anything, that it dried out my skin more than the specialty brands available for 2 to 3 times their cost.  Imagine my surprise when the Lever 2000 soap made an obvious and fast change to my skin&#x27;s texture.      I&#x27;ve only used this scent (Fresh Aloe) and like it because its scent is very subtle.</li>
            <li> Amazon has a gold box deal from time to time on Lever soaps and the last time they did, they had a 8-Count(Pack of 3) for $14.38 which is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We often use this soap and its soft on the skin and give you a good lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing about the soap is as you use it to it&#x27;s end, it becomes literally hard(like stone), I wish it did just melt away at the end.</li>
            <li> This was my second order. Yes, I like this soap however, it is hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> Our family has use Lever 2000 bath soap for years now.  We have always used the original Lever but I thought I would try something a little different.  I have to be careful and not get a scent that&#x27;s too &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; for my husband so I thought what could be girly about aloe and cucumber, for goodness sake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bath bar has a very nice subtle fresh clean scent which is pleasing, passing the girly test.  It&#x27;s clean rinsing and leaves no residue that I can detect that can make my skin feel tight and itchy.  Therefore there is no skin irritation.  This eight pack last quite a long time but we have the bar placed where the shower doesn&#x27;t hit it.  I think that makes a huge difference in how quickly it gets used up.  All in all, we both enjoy using Lever 2000 products.</li>
            <li> Bathing with this product give the sense of feeling fresh and clean.  It also has a lasting effect without being over powering.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent soap and great shipping</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with being able to stock up and buy multipack of items. Sure the bathroom has extra boxes of toothpaste lying around, but I won&#x27;t be running out for a while to come.</li>
            <li> Came just in time. Great product. I will be ordering again once I run out of soap. Nice feel on body super clean feel...</li>
