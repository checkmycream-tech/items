            <li>These 2 products are fabulous, they work perfect in my hair.</li>

            <li>really loved the shampoo me and my wife</li>
            <li>and the conditioner is so good as well.</li>
            <li>and it smells good</li>
            <li>and my hair feels good.</li>
            <li>Bought this at my salon, loved it</li>
            <li>These work so well, that I will continue to buy them here for the insanely good price.  </li>
            <li>I bought pumps that fit the bottles perfectly, so now I don&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
            <li>The quality is really good too.</li>
            <li>I started using this when i lived in Australia and loved it...</li>
            <li>I loved this shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>Good stuff - was nervous that I wouldn&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li>I thought I loved it</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, they did not harm to the condition of my hair, which remained straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved the Sebastian penetrait as well.</li>
            <li>This is really good shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I saw the Sebastian brand and how good the reviews were and thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li>My hair has been chemical treated more times than I can remember so I need a good shampoo and conditioner and this has been great.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner are exceptional.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the shampoo and conditioner that I&#x27;m very satisfied with.</li>
            <li>Based on what I see from the hair that falls out from detangling and blow-drying, I have experienced more hair fall with this set of shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and conditioner!  </li>

            <li>Just try this ..you will love it!</li>
            <li>I was going to pay more for the 10 oz bottles of this than I could get for the 33.8 oz bottles on here!</li>

            <li>My girls love it!</li>

            <li>Just amazing.</li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>

            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s still a nice product.</li>
            <li>Not as good for my dryer hair as pureology, but it was okay.</li>
            <li>Smells nice too.</li>
            <li>The absolute best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money, since it smells so good and keeps coloured hair from maximum damage!</li>
            <li>the product also has a very mild, yet pleasant, fragrance.</li>

            <li>Love this conditioner and shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love Sebastian products.</li>
            <li>my scalp got better.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried so many products that claim to do all these things</li>
            <li>I do mostly my ends and then work my way up to the scalp.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t remember for sure.</li>
            <li>and you will fall in love with how your hair feels</li>
            <li>you Amazon for selling this at such a great deal!</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I never used to splurge on salon brands but in my quest for better hair</li>
            <li>So I did and I knew I finally found the perfect conditioner!</li>
            <li>Shell out a bit more for the Alterna Caviar shampoo and conditioner, which has no sulfates or sodium</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo ever since my hairdressor used it on me.</li>
            <li>But after using it you can tell that it&#x27;s authentic.</li>
            <li>My hair has never ever been more frizzy.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner set.</li>
            <li>But drench gives me so much more body and softness.</li>
            <li>or I find something better.</li>
            <li>They made my hair look nice, feel smooth, etc, but also caused bumps to appear on my scalp.</li>
            <li>and immediately I fell in love with this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>then you&#x27;ll love this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely high quality and my hair feels great after I use</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a long time now and this is the best buy I have found!</li>
            <li>Works great and smells great, but a little on the pricey side.</li>
            <li>Sebastian products are wonderful and leave my hair feeling nice rather than heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li>Great smell and my hair is so soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>It leaves hair smelling great and feel so soft!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shampoo bottle is better and that works just fine.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of keeping my hair soft and manageable without the frizziness.</li>
            <li>My hair smells great and feels so soft</li>
            <li>Just wish it were available more places.</li>
            <li>- my hair feels fantastic :)</li>
            <li>Good price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much of this product to work up a good lather.</li>
            <li>After using the Drench Shampoo and the Drench Conditioner, I still had to use Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Skinny Balm to easily run a comb through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They help my hair shining and they turn the easy break hair strong.</li>
            <li>I like the way it makes my hair feel clean and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I like this shampoo and conditioner and its easy to have it shipped to my door instead of going into a salon to purchase it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ultimately I just don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s worth paying for salon brands if they&#x27;re not going to do something awesome for my hair above and beyond what something like Pantene can do.</li>
            <li>My hair always feels super clean without any kind of residue build up over time.</li>
            <li>Never fails to make my blond locks beautiful, luscious, shiny, soft and mend my split ends :)</li>
            <li>Hands down the BEST shampoo and conditioner on the planet.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, and it will not weigh hair down.</li>
            <li>additionally, you don&#x27;t need to use very much of the shampoo because it lathers up so nicely and the conditioner is rich but not over the top rich like a hair masque.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived quick!</li>
            <li>The shampoo doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, I dont have fly aways, and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I really do just love the shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li>This is a great deal for this shampoo/conditioner, and it makes my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>- they smell amazing and leave my hair soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a HUGE difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell, but most importantly, controls the dryness and frizz and leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shampoo and conditioner were shrink wrapped together, but the product I recieved was the Sebastian Light, not the Drench.</li>
            <li>This set makes your hair feel so silky and smooth..</li>
            <li>This really helps to reduce the frizziness of my hair on warm days as well.</li>
            <li>My hair stylist constantly comments about the great condition my hair is in</li>
            <li>Great buy, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>we did both really enjoy this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe my product was switched for a cheap product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not anything like some cheap brand.  </li>
            <li>Feels primarily oil-based.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, keeps my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>When I use this shampoo for a good length of time my hair improves considerably.</li>
            <li>My stylist recommended it when I was taking prenatal vitamins and my hair was getting totally wacky and this seemed to create the right balance</li>
            <li>The scent is light but clean.  </li>
            <li>My hair is clean, and basically smooth.</li>
            <li>your hair is left feeling so clean, smooth and refreshed!!!</li>
            <li>I have used Sebastian Drench shampoo and conditioner for the past couple of months and they are wonderful</li>
            <li>It arrived promptly and well padded with paper in the box, but something had been cut off of the original packaging, presumably by the seller, and the shampoo/conditioner set was wrapped in torn seran wrap.</li>
            <li>It had originally said \\&quot;2 for $49.99.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>LOVE this so much!</li>
            <li>I noticed better hair after my first use.</li>
            <li>It feels so rich in your hands.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Great for long hair.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, but it&#x27;s also very frizzy.</li>
            <li>I think the Drench conditioner would work great for you if you have dry hair and skin.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel clean.</li>
            <li>Great for dry, color treated hair.</li>
            <li>You do not need very much to clean your hair.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing, my hair is light and soft.</li>
            <li>The conditioner did a decent job of detangling, which meant more product deposits on my fine hair.</li>
            <li>This product is hard to find and the price was excellent.</li>
            <li>As well as that bonus, this Drench pair are moisturizing without weighing hair down, a great thing if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li>not as good as the stuff I buy at salon locally.</li>
            <li>it is nice to have it shipped directly to me.</li>
            <li>I love these so much</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bottles are still close to full.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found some things work better than others, but not so much so that it warrants the price difference.</li>
            <li>It smells great and is extremely luxurious to use.  </li>
            <li>and this one leaves my head feeling great not like other products that leave a residue feeling on my head making me dig at it.</li>
            <li>The delivery was quick and product was NOT damaged.</li>
            <li>Overall, I give these products 10 out of 10, I am very happy to have found Sebastian Drench after years of searching for the ultimate moisturizing color care for my hair, it&#x27;s a winner.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other, more expensive shampoos and honestly this stuff works the best.</li>
            <li>my hair is silky smooth - curly OR straight!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m happy to weigh it down a bit.  </li>
            <li>No other professional products worked for my hair, but sebastian drench leaves my hair super soft and it smells good also!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why there are so many good reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to get back on track and get it to were it is healthy!</li>
            <li>Love it so far!</li>
            <li>My favorite combination so far!  </li>
            <li>Which is like 4 times the amount for only $5 more per bottle!</li>
            <li>:)  If the natural thing doesn&#x27;t work out, I&#x27;ll be back for more of this!</li>
            <li>Item was packaged securely, arrived in timely manner, &amp; was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t figure out if it was intentional, for them to get rid of extra product, or if it was an honest mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>we both use it and the smell is so nice and last longer.</li>
            <li>(I need to go back to sulfate free shampoos), however, I do love the conditioner.</li>
            <li>Order processing took much longer than than I expected, but I&#x27;m happy with the product and would order again</li>
            <li>This shampoo &amp; Conditioner is really worth it.</li>
            <li>I have a tried a lot of shampoos and conditioners and this is still, by far, my favorite.</li>
            <li>, nothing had ever felt this good in my whole entire life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is worth trying.</li>
            <li>Definately worth the money.</li>
            <li>I prefer a more natural approach and wish this shampoo and conditioner was formulated without sulfates and parabens.</li>
            <li>it makes your hair soft and shiny and feeling and looking healthy.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to spend the extra money on something nice.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and makes them look healthy.</li>
            <li>If you use a dispenser at home or don&#x27;t mind transferring the contents to another bottle, it might be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth</li>
            <li>Here I was able to save a considerable amount of money.</li>
            <li>The shampoo makes my hair feel clean without making it feel like it&#x27;s been stripped completely, and the conditioner is nice and thick, and wonderfully conditioning especially in the winter months.</li>
            <li>It is thick and does a good job!</li>
            <li>It was much better for my hair than the 2 different kinds of paul mitchell (special tea tree and lavender) shampoo/conditioner sets I tried.</li>
            <li>She was so right.  </li>
            <li>and it clears it right</li>
            <li>This product is great for thick hair / dry hair and works really good.  </li>
            <li>my hair has improved greatly over the past nine months of using it.</li>
            <li>I have very fine naturally curly hair, most of the time it feels dry and looks frizzy.</li>
            <li>I kept it, though, because it would have been more hassle than it was worth to send it back (and I wonder if they bet on that, too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it moisturizes you hair while not making it really greasy quickly.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair strong and soft just use once</li>
            <li>Shipping was also very fast.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>but I just like the clean feeling of shamppoing normally</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair, please stay far away from it.</li>
            <li>The scent of both products is pleasant, lingering on your hair for long enough to enjoy the whole day after washing.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty overworked and dry.&lt;br /&gt;Sebastian</li>
            <li>The cost of the Drench products is reasonable and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>So much better than any shampoo and conditioner combo from your local drug or grocery store!</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time in my salon and had to get it.</li>
            <li>Was very pissed  bottles where busted and leaking!  </li>
            <li>product is so much better than Pantene and definitely Wen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more when I finally run out</li>
            <li>This is the first I ordered the drench</li>
            <li>so this was an impulse buy for me that worked out very well!</li>
            <li>but I found it is easier to spread if you rub it in your hands first.</li>
            <li>My hair has not accumulated any by-product and is still bouncy, shiny, and in control as the first day</li>
            <li>Before this I tried Bed Head Recovery and at first</li>
            <li>The first two ingredients of the shampoo were sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate.</li>
            <li>and it leaves my hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not nearly as expensive.  </li>
            <li>At this price I could go back to what I love and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair doesn&#x27;t break as often too, and most importantly for me, the frizz factor has gone way down.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my hair soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>My hair is clean and soft</li>
            <li>I have tried many different shampoos/conditioners, my hair is very picky.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;The seller was very professional &amp; quick to respond to my questions.</li>
            <li>I read hundreds of positive reviews about this shampoo and conditioner but it did not work well for me.</li>
            <li>My hair has been long for most of my life.</li>
            <li>have tried pretty much everything on the market--</li>
            <li>At last a shampoo that is so gentle on color that I can leave my salon visits for longer and be confident my color is still true right through til my next treatment.</li>
            <li>I immediately noticed a huge difference in my hair after only the first wash.</li>
            <li>is the first shampoo and conditioner that I&#x27;ve bought on Amazon that I really felt was the real shampoo and conditioner and not a knockoff.</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair so super soft.</li>
            <li>the shampoo is good, but the conditioner just isn&#x27;t moisturizing enough for my dry</li>
            <li>And the bottles are so huge they last forever.</li>
            <li>bottles are huge so will last forever.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve started using this shampoo I have seen a huge difference in the health of my hair, and I actually think it had helped with growth.</li>
            <li>and it seems &#x27;too much&#x27; for my hair.  </li>
            <li>It was really helpful</li>
            <li>Showed up on time and I really like the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>When you lather it in you really can feel the difference.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>My hair is so much softer than it has ever been.&lt;br</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t need much of it to wash and condition your hair.</li>
            <li>and it seems like no matter how much I use it</li>
            <li>No seal on either bottle - conditioner was unusually overfilled.</li>
            <li>so much</li>
            <li>This is the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much.  </li>
            <li>Would buy from again, thanks</li>
            <li>I am very picky about hair products</li>
            <li>The shampoo is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It really mosturizes your hair.</li>
            <li>I REALLY wanted to be amazed by this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s not saying much.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this set!</li>
            <li>I have owned this product for about 8 months now; I really like it.  </li>
            <li>fast delivery and delivered as shown</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>the price of this kind of drives you away, note that these are rather large bottles and will last for quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually spend a lot of money on this sort of thing, but I&#x27;m glad I tried this!  </li>
            <li>It smelled nice and was easy to lather into my hair, but I wasn&#x27;t actually seeing any great results with my hair, at least nothing that could justify the price of a salon brand, nothing amazing compared to what much less expensive brands will do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying all kind of different shampoo and conditioners lately trying to find something that will make my long, medium-thickness blond hair feel super silky and healthy.</li>
            <li>I would recommend if you have super dry hair and are looking for a cure buy this product along with the Babyface Pure Protein and use it along with Sebastian Drench Conditioner!</li>
            <li>It is an excellant product that softens the hair, makes it more manageble but doesn&#x27;t weight it down so it has plenty of body.</li>
            <li>and it did not flatten it down, but made is smooth and shiny!  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a new shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li>Thank you for delivering so quickly, a day earlier than predicted.  </li>
            <li>Decent shampoo and conditioner, but</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>the conditioner wasn&#x27;t so hard to squeeze out of the bottle although once out, it was an amazing texture and creaminess</li>
            <li>My favorite everyday shampoo</li>
            <li>And the more you do it the more the bottle loses its shape and it becomes even harder to get out...</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older (40+yr.), I&#x27;ve gotten my hair professionally colored and/or highlighted.  </li>
            <li>but suddenly I realized that it wasn&#x27;t really doing THAT much.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to products...trust me I&#x27;ve tried just about everything</li>
            <li>Even the shampoo is soft!</li>
            <li>Plus, it makes your hair feel so soft afterward!</li>
            <li>I wish the company offers overseas delivery!</li>
            <li>They are gentle and the scent is subtle and lovely.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m too busy to hit my local mall to continue on Aveda and as an avid Amazon junkie</li>
            <li>The bottles don&#x27;t come packaged in the wrapper like they do at the salon, I noticed right away that the fragrance is way off (and barely there), and the texture and thickness of the products is completely different.</li>
            <li>I have very long thick hair and also an ombr&amp;eacute; and this product is good for color treated hair.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is light and the conditioner is a little thicker but helps a lot with softness and is not heavy.</li>
            <li>but it does feel soft.  </li>
            <li>seems to leave my hair soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely buying this same shampoo and conditioner when I run out of them.</li>
            <li>Since my hair is naturally wavy</li>
            <li>Hair is soft and conditioned.</li>
            <li>after showering, it becomes extremely soft and it stays quite soft for the rest of the day/night (depending on when i shower).</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, so I am always buying moisturizing shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>However, I was pleasantly surprised with this set -</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, so don&#x27;t do that a lot.  </li>
            <li>it makes hair really soft, shiny and managable.</li>
            <li>They said their hair feels really soft after using this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly/wavy with a lot of body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Makes her hair soft &amp; nourished, since she has her hair color treated.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>WOW I could immediately tell a difference in my hair texture.</li>
            <li>I tried these two Sebastian products and they made my hair soft and silky again.</li>
            <li>- This shampoo and conditioner is super moisturizing and can over time weight my hair down.</li>
            <li>I Googled an image of the original packaging just to see what I was missing.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need more than a quarter-sized drop so it might last longer than some of the drug store brands have in the past.</li>
            <li>The price was worth it because the bottles will last for a long time.</li>
            <li>After years of coloring and styling my hair with hot irons, my hair has gotten very dry.</li>
            <li>My hair is extremely dry on the ends, very oily at the scalp.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and never dry feeling or looking.</li>
            <li>I tried all of Redken, Paul Mitchell and none of them left my hair feeling light, it was always heavy and oily.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m not too sure how i&#x27;ll squeeze it out when there is only a little left... not a big deal though.</li>
            <li>But it does seem to perform better than other products (if only slightly).</li>
            <li>I used it a couple of times and noticed that the fragrance is way off and barely there.</li>
            <li>The only reason I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again is I&#x27;m looking to make the switch to natural</li>
            <li>I ordered the same set from Amazon for my 24 year old daughter</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a guy who keeps his hair long (for as long as I still have it, I&#x27;m keeping as much as I can!).</li>
            <li>I blow dry my curly hair straight every time I shower,  so heat damage is a big concern.  </li>
            <li>And, its not very expensive in the long run b/c it lasts for a long time</li>
            <li>The shampoo smells very neutral with maybe a slight favor towards males.</li>
            <li>I was exhausted with it and ready to chop it all off, but I thought I&#x27;d try changing products first.  </li>
            <li>It softens thick wavy hair and keeps it super moisturized.</li>
            <li>I have put my hair through pure torcher the last few years being naturally blonde</li>
            <li>only thing i don&#x27;t like is that the conditioner isn&#x27;t really liquidy so it can be a little more difficult to get out of the bottle than the shampoo.</li>

            <li> this shampoo and conditioner is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Shampoo--this stuff alone is amazing!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner, I origonally purchased it from my salon and am so happy that I can now order it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells good, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> These 2 products are fabulous, they work perfect in my hair.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re as good as the reviews say.</li>
            <li> I tried Wen and really loved it as well</li>
            <li> really loved the shampoo me and my wife</li>
            <li> and the conditioner is so good as well.</li>
            <li> and it smells good</li>
            <li> and my hair feels good.</li>
            <li> Bought this at my salon, loved it</li>
            <li> These work so well, that I will continue to buy them here for the insanely good price.  </li>
            <li> I bought pumps that fit the bottles perfectly, so now I don&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
            <li> The quality is really good too.</li>
            <li> I started using this when i lived in Australia and loved it...</li>
            <li> I loved this shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> Good stuff - was nervous that I wouldn&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> I thought I loved it</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, they did not harm to the condition of my hair, which remained straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved the Sebastian penetrait as well.</li>
            <li> This is really good shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I saw the Sebastian brand and how good the reviews were and thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> My hair has been chemical treated more times than I can remember so I need a good shampoo and conditioner and this has been great.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner are exceptional.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the shampoo and conditioner that I&#x27;m very satisfied with.</li>
            <li> Based on what I see from the hair that falls out from detangling and blow-drying, I have experienced more hair fall with this set of shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner!  </li>

            <li> Just try this ..you will love it!</li>
            <li> I was going to pay more for the 10 oz bottles of this than I could get for the 33.8 oz bottles on here!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and am grateful my hair stylist recommended it!</li>
            <li> My girls love it!</li>

            <li> It is amazing.</li>

            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s still a nice product.</li>
            <li> Not as good for my dryer hair as pureology, but it was okay.</li>
            <li> Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> The absolute best.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the money, since it smells so good and keeps coloured hair from maximum damage!</li>
            <li> the product also has a very mild, yet pleasant, fragrance.</li>
            <li> It was honestly the most amazing thing I&#x27;ve ever felt.  </li>

            <li> Very creamy shampoo with a great scent.</li>
            <li> bought this at the same time I bought the conditioner, and I have to say I wasn&#x27;t all that impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> I really love washing my hair with them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with Sebastian products.</li>

            <li> I only use the shampoo out of the set with Pantene BB conditioner (LOVE), the combination is perfect for my hair type.  </li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo/conditioner.  </li>
            <li> but I LOVE this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product I&#x27;ve used it for 2 days now and can see and feel a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> This is what they use and I love it.</li>
            <li> Product came fast and is at a great price.</li>
            <li> my hair has also become a lot more manageable</li>
            <li> and i have been able to style it with much more</li>
            <li> Smells great and really moisturizes.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand of shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> this shampoo/conditioner keeps my shoulder length hair healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Made my hair so healthy again.</li>
            <li> and I fell in love..</li>
            <li> I have a mix of wavy/curly hair, and I tend to have more oily hair.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love the moisture these products add to my hair.  </li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t leave a buildup on your hair and my hair is more manageable than it has been in years.</li>
            <li> love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the Sebastian Penetraitt repair shampoo and conditioner more though.</li>
            <li> The women I go to the gym with ask to borrow it all the time. :-)</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner set.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of products but this one I have come to really love.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and can smell it all day without a burnt scent from my dryer or straightner.</li>
            <li> LOVE it and recommend to everyone</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with the smell</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner and shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love Sebastian products.</li>
            <li> my scalp got better.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried so many products that claim to do all these things</li>
            <li> I do mostly my ends and then work my way up to the scalp.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t remember for sure.</li>
            <li> and you will fall in love with how your hair feels</li>
            <li> you Amazon for selling this at such a great deal!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I never used to splurge on salon brands but in my quest for better hair</li>
            <li> So I did and I knew I finally found the perfect conditioner!</li>
            <li> Shell out a bit more for the Alterna Caviar shampoo and conditioner, which has no sulfates or sodium</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo ever since my hairdressor used it on me.</li>
            <li> But after using it you can tell that it&#x27;s authentic.</li>
            <li> My hair has never ever been more frizzy.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner set.</li>
            <li> But drench gives me so much more body and softness.</li>
            <li> or I find something better.</li>
            <li> They made my hair look nice, feel smooth, etc, but also caused bumps to appear on my scalp.</li>
            <li> and immediately I fell in love with this product.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell.  </li>
            <li> then you&#x27;ll love this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely high quality and my hair feels great after I use</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time now and this is the best buy I have found!</li>
            <li> Works great and smells great, but a little on the pricey side.</li>
            <li> Sebastian products are wonderful and leave my hair feeling nice rather than heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> Great smell and my hair is so soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> It leaves hair smelling great and feel so soft!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shampoo bottle is better and that works just fine.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of keeping my hair soft and manageable without the frizziness.</li>
            <li> My hair smells great and feels so soft</li>
            <li> Just wish it were available more places.</li>
            <li> - my hair feels fantastic :)</li>
            <li> Good price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much of this product to work up a good lather.</li>
            <li> After using the Drench Shampoo and the Drench Conditioner, I still had to use Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Skinny Balm to easily run a comb through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They help my hair shining and they turn the easy break hair strong.</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my hair feel clean and healthy.  </li>
            <li> I like this shampoo and conditioner and its easy to have it shipped to my door instead of going into a salon to purchase it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ultimately I just don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s worth paying for salon brands if they&#x27;re not going to do something awesome for my hair above and beyond what something like Pantene can do.</li>
            <li> My hair always feels super clean without any kind of residue build up over time.</li>
            <li> Never fails to make my blond locks beautiful, luscious, shiny, soft and mend my split ends :)</li>
            <li> Hands down the BEST shampoo and conditioner on the planet.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, and it will not weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> additionally, you don&#x27;t need to use very much of the shampoo because it lathers up so nicely and the conditioner is rich but not over the top rich like a hair masque.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrived quick!</li>
            <li> The shampoo doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, I dont have fly aways, and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I really do just love the shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> This is a great deal for this shampoo/conditioner, and it makes my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> - they smell amazing and leave my hair soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a HUGE difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell, but most importantly, controls the dryness and frizz and leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shampoo and conditioner were shrink wrapped together, but the product I recieved was the Sebastian Light, not the Drench.</li>
            <li> This set makes your hair feel so silky and smooth..</li>
            <li> This really helps to reduce the frizziness of my hair on warm days as well.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist constantly comments about the great condition my hair is in</li>
            <li> Great buy, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> we did both really enjoy this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe my product was switched for a cheap product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not anything like some cheap brand.  </li>
            <li> Feels primarily oil-based.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, keeps my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> When I use this shampoo for a good length of time my hair improves considerably.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended it when I was taking prenatal vitamins and my hair was getting totally wacky and this seemed to create the right balance</li>
            <li> The scent is light but clean.  </li>
            <li> My hair is clean, and basically smooth.</li>
            <li> your hair is left feeling so clean, smooth and refreshed!!!</li>
            <li> I have used Sebastian Drench shampoo and conditioner for the past couple of months and they are wonderful</li>
            <li> It arrived promptly and well padded with paper in the box, but something had been cut off of the original packaging, presumably by the seller, and the shampoo/conditioner set was wrapped in torn seran wrap.</li>
            <li> It had originally said \\&quot;2 for $49.99.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> LOVE this so much!</li>
            <li> I noticed better hair after my first use.</li>
            <li> It feels so rich in your hands.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Great for long hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, but it&#x27;s also very frizzy.</li>
            <li> I think the Drench conditioner would work great for you if you have dry hair and skin.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel clean.</li>
            <li> Great for dry, color treated hair.</li>
            <li> You do not need very much to clean your hair.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing, my hair is light and soft.</li>
            <li> The conditioner did a decent job of detangling, which meant more product deposits on my fine hair.</li>
            <li> This product is hard to find and the price was excellent.</li>
            <li> As well as that bonus, this Drench pair are moisturizing without weighing hair down, a great thing if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li> not as good as the stuff I buy at salon locally.</li>
            <li> it is nice to have it shipped directly to me.</li>
            <li> I love these so much</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bottles are still close to full.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found some things work better than others, but not so much so that it warrants the price difference.</li>
            <li> It smells great and is extremely luxurious to use.  </li>
            <li> and this one leaves my head feeling great not like other products that leave a residue feeling on my head making me dig at it.</li>
            <li> The delivery was quick and product was NOT damaged.</li>
            <li> Overall, I give these products 10 out of 10, I am very happy to have found Sebastian Drench after years of searching for the ultimate moisturizing color care for my hair, it&#x27;s a winner.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other, more expensive shampoos and honestly this stuff works the best.</li>
            <li> my hair is silky smooth - curly OR straight!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m happy to weigh it down a bit.  </li>
            <li> No other professional products worked for my hair, but sebastian drench leaves my hair super soft and it smells good also!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why there are so many good reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to get back on track and get it to were it is healthy!</li>
            <li> Love it so far!</li>
            <li> My favorite combination so far!  </li>
            <li> Which is like 4 times the amount for only $5 more per bottle!</li>
            <li> :)  If the natural thing doesn&#x27;t work out, I&#x27;ll be back for more of this!</li>
            <li> Item was packaged securely, arrived in timely manner, &amp; was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t figure out if it was intentional, for them to get rid of extra product, or if it was an honest mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> we both use it and the smell is so nice and last longer.</li>
            <li> (I need to go back to sulfate free shampoos), however, I do love the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Order processing took much longer than than I expected, but I&#x27;m happy with the product and would order again</li>
            <li> This shampoo &amp; Conditioner is really worth it.</li>
            <li> I have a tried a lot of shampoos and conditioners and this is still, by far, my favorite.</li>
            <li> , nothing had ever felt this good in my whole entire life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is worth trying.</li>
            <li> Definately worth the money.</li>
            <li> I prefer a more natural approach and wish this shampoo and conditioner was formulated without sulfates and parabens.</li>
            <li> it makes your hair soft and shiny and feeling and looking healthy.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to spend the extra money on something nice.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and makes them look healthy.</li>
            <li> If you use a dispenser at home or don&#x27;t mind transferring the contents to another bottle, it might be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth</li>
            <li> Here I was able to save a considerable amount of money.</li>
            <li> The shampoo makes my hair feel clean without making it feel like it&#x27;s been stripped completely, and the conditioner is nice and thick, and wonderfully conditioning especially in the winter months.</li>
            <li> It is thick and does a good job!</li>
            <li> It was much better for my hair than the 2 different kinds of paul mitchell (special tea tree and lavender) shampoo/conditioner sets I tried.</li>
            <li> She was so right.  </li>
            <li> and it clears it right</li>
            <li> This product is great for thick hair / dry hair and works really good.  </li>
            <li> my hair has improved greatly over the past nine months of using it.</li>
            <li> I have very fine naturally curly hair, most of the time it feels dry and looks frizzy.</li>
            <li> I kept it, though, because it would have been more hassle than it was worth to send it back (and I wonder if they bet on that, too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it moisturizes you hair while not making it really greasy quickly.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair strong and soft just use once</li>
            <li> Shipping was also very fast.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> but I just like the clean feeling of shamppoing normally</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair, please stay far away from it.</li>
            <li> The scent of both products is pleasant, lingering on your hair for long enough to enjoy the whole day after washing.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty overworked and dry.&lt;br /&gt;Sebastian</li>
            <li> The cost of the Drench products is reasonable and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> So much better than any shampoo and conditioner combo from your local drug or grocery store!</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time in my salon and had to get it.</li>
            <li> Was very pissed  bottles where busted and leaking!  </li>
            <li> product is so much better than Pantene and definitely Wen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering more when I finally run out</li>
            <li> This is the first I ordered the drench</li>
            <li> so this was an impulse buy for me that worked out very well!</li>
            <li> but I found it is easier to spread if you rub it in your hands first.</li>
            <li> My hair has not accumulated any by-product and is still bouncy, shiny, and in control as the first day</li>
            <li> Before this I tried Bed Head Recovery and at first</li>
            <li> The first two ingredients of the shampoo were sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate.</li>
            <li> and it leaves my hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not nearly as expensive.  </li>
            <li> At this price I could go back to what I love and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair doesn&#x27;t break as often too, and most importantly for me, the frizz factor has gone way down.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my hair soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> My hair is clean and soft</li>
            <li> I have tried many different shampoos/conditioners, my hair is very picky.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;The seller was very professional &amp; quick to respond to my questions.</li>
            <li> I read hundreds of positive reviews about this shampoo and conditioner but it did not work well for me.</li>
            <li> My hair has been long for most of my life.</li>
            <li> have tried pretty much everything on the market--</li>
            <li> At last a shampoo that is so gentle on color that I can leave my salon visits for longer and be confident my color is still true right through til my next treatment.</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed a huge difference in my hair after only the first wash.</li>
            <li> is the first shampoo and conditioner that I&#x27;ve bought on Amazon that I really felt was the real shampoo and conditioner and not a knockoff.</li>
            <li> and it makes my hair so super soft.</li>
            <li> the shampoo is good, but the conditioner just isn&#x27;t moisturizing enough for my dry</li>
            <li> And the bottles are so huge they last forever.</li>
            <li> bottles are huge so will last forever.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve started using this shampoo I have seen a huge difference in the health of my hair, and I actually think it had helped with growth.</li>
            <li> and it seems &#x27;too much&#x27; for my hair.  </li>
            <li> It was really helpful</li>
            <li> Showed up on time and I really like the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> When you lather it in you really can feel the difference.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> My hair is so much softer than it has ever been.&lt;br</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t need much of it to wash and condition your hair.</li>
            <li> and it seems like no matter how much I use it</li>
            <li> No seal on either bottle - conditioner was unusually overfilled.</li>
            <li> so much</li>
            <li> This is the real thing.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much.  </li>
            <li> Would buy from again, thanks</li>
            <li> I am very picky about hair products</li>
            <li> The shampoo is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It really mosturizes your hair.</li>
            <li> I REALLY wanted to be amazed by this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not saying much.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this set!</li>
            <li> I have owned this product for about 8 months now; I really like it.  </li>
            <li> fast delivery and delivered as shown</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> the price of this kind of drives you away, note that these are rather large bottles and will last for quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually spend a lot of money on this sort of thing, but I&#x27;m glad I tried this!  </li>
            <li> It smelled nice and was easy to lather into my hair, but I wasn&#x27;t actually seeing any great results with my hair, at least nothing that could justify the price of a salon brand, nothing amazing compared to what much less expensive brands will do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying all kind of different shampoo and conditioners lately trying to find something that will make my long, medium-thickness blond hair feel super silky and healthy.</li>
            <li> I would recommend if you have super dry hair and are looking for a cure buy this product along with the Babyface Pure Protein and use it along with Sebastian Drench Conditioner!</li>
            <li> It is an excellant product that softens the hair, makes it more manageble but doesn&#x27;t weight it down so it has plenty of body.</li>
            <li> and it did not flatten it down, but made is smooth and shiny!  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a new shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> Thank you for delivering so quickly, a day earlier than predicted.  </li>
            <li> Decent shampoo and conditioner, but</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> the conditioner wasn&#x27;t so hard to squeeze out of the bottle although once out, it was an amazing texture and creaminess</li>
            <li> My favorite everyday shampoo</li>
            <li> And the more you do it the more the bottle loses its shape and it becomes even harder to get out...</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older (40+yr.), I&#x27;ve gotten my hair professionally colored and/or highlighted.  </li>
            <li> but suddenly I realized that it wasn&#x27;t really doing THAT much.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to products...trust me I&#x27;ve tried just about everything</li>
            <li> Even the shampoo is soft!</li>
            <li> Plus, it makes your hair feel so soft afterward!</li>
            <li> I wish the company offers overseas delivery!</li>
            <li> They are gentle and the scent is subtle and lovely.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m too busy to hit my local mall to continue on Aveda and as an avid Amazon junkie</li>
            <li> The bottles don&#x27;t come packaged in the wrapper like they do at the salon, I noticed right away that the fragrance is way off (and barely there), and the texture and thickness of the products is completely different.</li>
            <li> I have very long thick hair and also an ombr&amp;eacute; and this product is good for color treated hair.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is light and the conditioner is a little thicker but helps a lot with softness and is not heavy.</li>
            <li> but it does feel soft.  </li>
            <li> seems to leave my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely buying this same shampoo and conditioner when I run out of them.</li>
            <li> Since my hair is naturally wavy</li>
            <li> Hair is soft and conditioned.</li>
            <li> after showering, it becomes extremely soft and it stays quite soft for the rest of the day/night (depending on when i shower).</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, so I am always buying moisturizing shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> However, I was pleasantly surprised with this set -</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, so don&#x27;t do that a lot.  </li>
            <li> it makes hair really soft, shiny and managable.</li>
            <li> They said their hair feels really soft after using this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> and it makes my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly/wavy with a lot of body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Makes her hair soft &amp; nourished, since she has her hair color treated.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> WOW I could immediately tell a difference in my hair texture.</li>
            <li> I tried these two Sebastian products and they made my hair soft and silky again.</li>
            <li> - This shampoo and conditioner is super moisturizing and can over time weight my hair down.</li>
            <li> I Googled an image of the original packaging just to see what I was missing.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need more than a quarter-sized drop so it might last longer than some of the drug store brands have in the past.</li>
            <li> The price was worth it because the bottles will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> After years of coloring and styling my hair with hot irons, my hair has gotten very dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely dry on the ends, very oily at the scalp.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and never dry feeling or looking.</li>
            <li> I tried all of Redken, Paul Mitchell and none of them left my hair feeling light, it was always heavy and oily.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not too sure how i&#x27;ll squeeze it out when there is only a little left... not a big deal though.</li>
            <li> But it does seem to perform better than other products (if only slightly).</li>
            <li> I used it a couple of times and noticed that the fragrance is way off and barely there.</li>
            <li> The only reason I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again is I&#x27;m looking to make the switch to natural</li>
            <li> I ordered the same set from Amazon for my 24 year old daughter</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a guy who keeps his hair long (for as long as I still have it, I&#x27;m keeping as much as I can!).</li>
            <li> I blow dry my curly hair straight every time I shower,  so heat damage is a big concern.  </li>
            <li> And, its not very expensive in the long run b/c it lasts for a long time</li>
            <li> The shampoo smells very neutral with maybe a slight favor towards males.</li>
            <li> I was exhausted with it and ready to chop it all off, but I thought I&#x27;d try changing products first.  </li>
            <li> It softens thick wavy hair and keeps it super moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have put my hair through pure torcher the last few years being naturally blonde</li>
            <li> only thing i don&#x27;t like is that the conditioner isn&#x27;t really liquidy so it can be a little more difficult to get out of the bottle than the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Living in a very humid locale lends itself to frizzy curls, but Sebastian products not only tame them but make them the shiniest my hair has EVER looked.</li>
            <li> My issue has always been that I need to get the oil under control, but washing too much always made my bottom half of my hair frizzy and dry.</li>
            <li> By the end of the day, my dry hair looked greasy, which means I actually need a shampoo but not one that left a greasy coat on my hair.</li>
            <li> This wil last a long time and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and shiny, without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> My thick, curly hair is silky, shiny and smooth when dried and flat ironed.</li>
            <li> this shampoo leaves my hair soft, silky and less frizzy</li>
            <li> I have moderately thick straight-ish hair that gets oily fast, and this stuff definitely does the job.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick straight hair with a tiny bit of......</li>
            <li> It has sulfates, parabens, and fragrance, and I personally am trying to avoid those things and other harmful chemicals as much as possible.</li>
            <li> I am of a mixed background, being half Mexican, quarter Indian, and a quarter German.</li>
            <li> My hair is super thick &amp; heavy and the length is approaching my elbows (not there yet, but I&#x27;m trying to grow it out)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of expensive shampoos and cheap shampoos and all sorts of things.</li>
            <li> This is a really big bottle, and I had to put some in an empty shampoo bottle to use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I have curly long hair</li>
            <li> Then after my hair dried, it was SO soft.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stop for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t grow up learning how to keep long hair, so I&#x27;ve had to experiment to find out how to take care of it.</li>
            <li> While visiting my mom (she has thick straight hair)</li>
            <li> I do not blow dry my hair, so when it dried I was pleasantly surprised how shiny and bouncy my hair</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be, because it lasts three times as long as other similar products.</li>
            <li> I went through a dark phase then back to blonde and then to dark red!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this set to anyone with coloured or long hair!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Later that day my shampoo ran out, and the only other shampoo in my house was this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny, moisturized and not waxy looking like other &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; hair products have left my hair.</li>
            <li> And unlike other products that claim they do, this one you actually feel it.</li>
            <li> With other products I use a larger amount.</li>
            <li> I bought this set and two other brands at the same time.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo when I want to blow dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> my scalp got really really dry, itchy and flaky and my hair was dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> Redkin, Bed Head, Paul Mitchell, products for curly hair, products for ethnic hair, products for frizzy hair, dry hair, and so on.</li>
            <li> My hair can be frizzy and dry.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding the liter bottles where I live so</li>
            <li> It does weigh down your  hair, but mine is coarse and frizzy</li>
            <li> But only a little goes a long way, which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> Expect it&#x27;ll last me half a year.</li>
            <li> i have very dry, brittle, frizzy, and oily hair</li>
            <li> Once a week if my hair starts feeling dry, or beat up from my blow dryer and flat iron, I&#x27;ll use the Drench conditioner, but only on my ends as its really thick</li>
            <li> Order arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of it a few years ago - just enough for two or three washes - and told myself I&#x27;d splurge and buy it eventually.</li>
            <li> If you want to use it as a deep conditioner, sit under the dryer with a cap on your head for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I bought this set without reading the reviews carefully and when they arrived, I looked at the ingredient list.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair moisturized &amp; shiny with minimal frizz</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that I use a flatiron on frequently and</li>
            <li> Poorly packed, got almost the items leaking and couple with the top broken, seems like they just threw my stuff in the box without any protections.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously, I ordered and needed the extra moisturizing formula for a reason, so I was disappointed to receive the Light instead of the Drench.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taken me a while to narrow it down, but I&#x27;ve finally isolated this shampoo and conditioner as the culprits.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in an extremely timely manner, so I can&#x27;t complain about the shipping one bit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely hesitant to re-order.</li>
            <li> Tried lots of other products but some of the leave in conditioners are drying.  </li>
            <li> shipping failed for the first time in forever</li>
            <li> It does not make my hair greasy, which other moisturing shampoos and conditioners seem to do.</li>
            <li> I ended up ordering this set of the shampoo and conditioner in the 33.8 ounce size from Amazon because the salon charges me $15 for an 8 ounce bottle, but I found this set for roughly $40 for both!</li>
            <li> Like its name suggests, &amp;#34;Drench&amp;#34; is extremely moisturising.</li>
            <li> That said, it&#x27;s definitely not too heavy for summer, either!</li>
            <li> Any other claims?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even noticed that it takes less time to dry and less heat and effort to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> Exactly like what I buy in a salon, but in a bigger bottle and less expensive!</li>
            <li> These products are concentrated so you don&#x27;t need a lot, maybe half of what you&#x27;ve used in the past with other products, so that&#x27;s a $ saving to boot - especially if you purchase in the 1 liter size bottles.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally buy expensive shampoo sets but my husband was having some dry scalp issues</li>
            <li> I put in on and leave it in for about 5 minutes while I do what else i need to do in the shower and when I get out I have about 90% less tangles than with any other products ive used</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this set is that it is hard to get the product out of the bottles.</li>
            <li> These are super expensive products and getting them in this size at this price is a steal!</li>
            <li> only complaint is the packaging.</li>
            <li> I might try Nexxus, but if that fails me too I&#x27;m going to be a sad panda and go back to cheap brands.</li>
            <li> only complaint:</li>
            <li> I have to be careful with a heavy conditioner like this one.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair shiny, manageable, without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I have thicker, curly hair and it tones that thickness down by making it softer.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other moisture shampoos and conditioners - they have all dried out my hair and nothing</li>
            <li> Twice the amount for the price I used to pay for half its size.</li>
            <li> have now used this duo for about a month and a half.</li>
            <li> I want less chemicals in my life.</li>
            <li> But heavy for short medium thick hair</li>
            <li> I have long thick, color treated hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always a little nervous about buying a product like this off the internet.</li>
            <li> Not very impressive, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> These jumbo-sized containers are a serious savings; I transfer the shampoo and conditioner to small containers for daily use or traveling.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a year now - and was never convinced that expensive professional hair product made a difference until I tried this.  </li>
            <li> And if they worked, it was too heavy and my hair would look waxy.</li>
            <li> and while I like it, it&#x27;s just too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> so if you wash your hair everyday you can use the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I even tried using an anti-residue shampoo a few times to see if I just had build-up that was keeping my hair from benefiting</li>
            <li> /&gt;Throughout the day, my hair looked limp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Spend the extra couple bucks at a salon and get the real stuff...what you&#x27;ll get here is repackaged dollar store crap at a 40x markup.</li>
            <li> I usually leave it on a few minutes as I wash my face.</li>
            <li> I put my usual grooming product and dried my hair.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it&#x27;s worth the outrageous price, but I admit to having saved about $15 by buying it on Amazon instead of from my local beauty supply store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s infusing my hair with moisture</li>
            <li> Not sure what this is, but I&#x27;m not going to be using it on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I buy it online when I&#x27;m feeling too lazy to go to the store.</li>
            <li> will try to post some pictures of the packaging, but that is irrelevant to the actual product.</li>
            <li> I usually have to fill my hand up with conditioner because my hair gets so knotty</li>
            <li> But after writing my past review and requesting to return the item, someone emailed me saying there must have been a mistake when pulling the item and that they would send me the items I ordered and allowed me to keep the order that was a mistake.  </li>
            <li> The salon that offered the Aveda products went out of business over this past summer</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to buying expensive shampoos (the Aveda equivalent for the shampoo ONLY was around $85)</li>
            <li> It has the same feel, smell and results of an expensive shampoo</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I was allergic to in the ingredients</li>
            <li> They are much less expensive than other salon products,too.</li>
            <li> Very soon, I shall take a deep breath and ruthlessly bin them.</li>
            <li> and I noticed my hair was dry, weak, and not happy</li>
            <li> I used it about 10 years ago for about 6 years and when money got tight I switched to something less expensive.</li>
            <li> I have tried expensive conditioners and keratin products, but my hair is still dry.</li>
            <li> I have over processed hair with split ends that is hard to get tangles out of -</li>
            <li> Between the weight and slippery hands, it was just too clumsy to handle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was curious about ordering from Amazon despite all of the reviews calling out fake Sebastian products and decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, THESE ARE NOT REAL SEBASTIAN PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> and they came a day late</li>
            <li> I have medium thick hair, shoulder length.  </li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and my hair just LOVES this combo.</li>
            <li> , I have Curly thick hair and</li>
            <li> and thick).</li>
            <li> products might work well for those with thick and unruly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is always shiney and thick after I use it, and I will order it again.</li>
            <li> I have moderately long, extremely thick hair that gets crazy frizzy in the humidity.  </li>
            <li> so they give the product a one star rating, but you seriously need the jaws of life to squeeze the conditioner out of this bottle.</li>
            <li> only bad thing about this product is that after 3 or 4 uses (if you wash you hair every day like i do) then you do get some build up and the hair looks oily/wet.</li>
            <li> As moisturizing as it is, I was afraid that my hair would be limp from the weight (this happened to me when I used an olive oil type conditioner in the past.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin, hers is thick.</li>
            <li> Conditioner---this stuff is thick!</li>
            <li> but it was so expensive in the salon, so I went on my trusted Amazon account and found it for half the price!!</li>
            <li> , she can pry this shampoo out of my cold, dead, silken-haired corpse-hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I was really annoyed when the shampoo came in and was not what I had ordered.  </li>
            <li> I am skeptical about things that are too moisture-rich for my hair because of the texture.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had to give it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Both did it when used separately, but the shampoo was definitely the worst.</li>
            <li> So sad.</li>
            <li> This shampoo can be so expensive at the salon.</li>
            <li> You can&#x60;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> know its sounds awful petty, like the people who are upset their shipping box was slightly discolored</li>
            <li> FAKE!</li>
            <li> I bought it from DNA Fulfillment - Amazon should check for fake products!</li>
            <li> Very sad...</li>
            <li> Am going to attempt to return item as I think I may have gotten a bad set or something.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed in Amazon and the sub-company this came from.</li>
            <li> I cant use :-(.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it and will try to return - very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Who knows but I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the worst my hair has ever been.</li>

            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s infusing my hair with moisture but it does feel soft.  need pumps to dispense easiers</li>
            <li> Very creamy shampoo with a great scent. This is a really big bottle, and I had to put some in an empty shampoo bottle to use it in the shower. Between the weight and slippery hands, it was just too clumsy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this at the same time I bought the conditioner, and I have to say I wasn&#x27;t all that impressed with the results. My hair felt too oily after shampooing, and I rinsed it for what seemed eons; I get a cleaner feeling with Suave&#x27;s Coconut Shampoo at a fraction of the price. After using the Drench Shampoo and the Drench Conditioner, I still had to use Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Skinny Balm to easily run a comb through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells good, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> just now trying this  product.  seems to leave my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I have curly long hair and I do not process my hair. These 2 products are fabulous, they work perfect in my hair. I really love washing my hair with them. I like the size. I&#x27;m absolutely buying this same shampoo and conditioner when I run out of them. I&#x27;m in love with Sebastian products. They&#x27;re as good as the reviews say. I&#x27;m glad I bought this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner ever</li>
            <li> My hair has been long for most of my life. Since my hair is naturally wavy and I don&#x27;t care for the look, I have used a straightener for the last twelve years.  As I&#x27;ve gotten older (40+yr.), I&#x27;ve gotten my hair professionally colored and/or highlighted.  My hair is pretty overworked and dry.&lt;br /&gt;Sebastian Drench shampoo/conditioner is the best products on the market.  It has a nice smell, but most importantly, controls the dryness and frizz and leaves my hair soft. The cost of the Drench products is reasonable and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner!  This duo was a great deal.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually spend a lot of money on this sort of thing, but I&#x27;m glad I tried this!  I have moderately long, extremely thick hair that gets crazy frizzy in the humidity.  I was exhausted with it and ready to chop it all off, but I thought I&#x27;d try changing products first.  I&#x27;ve been using these for about a month now, and my hair is calmer and glossier than I ever remember it being. I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair doesn&#x27;t break as often too, and most importantly for me, the frizz factor has gone way down.  I&#x27;ve also found that it helps to wash and condition with cooler water so that the hair shaft smooths out.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I ordered the Sebastian Drench shampoo and conditioner set. The product arrived in an extremely timely manner, so I can&#x27;t complain about the shipping one bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo and conditioner were shrink wrapped together, but the product I recieved was the Sebastian Light, not the Drench. The bar code label that was glued to the front of the shrink wrap was for the Drench, which I assume is why the mistake was made. I can&#x27;t figure out if it was intentional, for them to get rid of extra product, or if it was an honest mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, I ordered and needed the extra moisturizing formula for a reason, so I was disappointed to receive the Light instead of the Drench. I kept it, though, because it would have been more hassle than it was worth to send it back (and I wonder if they bet on that, too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still a nice product. the shampoo is good, but the conditioner just isn&#x27;t moisturizing enough for my dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed in Amazon and the sub-company this came from. I&#x27;m extremely hesitant to re-order.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Sebastian Drench shampoo and conditioner.  I only use the shampoo out of the set with Pantene BB conditioner (LOVE), the combination is perfect for my hair type.  I have medium thick hair, shoulder length.  The shampoo doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, I dont have fly aways, and it smells amazing. Once a week if my hair starts feeling dry, or beat up from my blow dryer and flat iron, I&#x27;ll use the Drench conditioner, but only on my ends as its really thick and it seems &#x27;too much&#x27; for my hair.  I think the Drench conditioner would work great for you if you have dry hair and skin.  Since I have combination to oily skin I have to be careful with a heavy conditioner like this one.</li>
            <li> This set makes your hair feel so silky and smooth..</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Excellent moisture without being greasy. I can go 3 days without washing my hair sometimes, and it looks great the whole time! I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
            <li> It was really helpful</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo/conditioner.  Exactly like what I buy in a salon, but in a bigger bottle and less expensive!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a year now - and was never convinced that expensive professional hair product made a difference until I tried this.  I feel a bit like an infomercial but I LOVE this shampoo and conditioner.  It does a great job of keeping my hair soft and manageable without the frizziness.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;The seller was very professional &amp; quick to respond to my questions. The delivery was quick and product was NOT damaged. I would purchase from them again.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Showed up on time and I really like the way it makes my hair feel. Even the shampoo is soft!</li>
            <li> I have used Sebastian Drench shampoo and conditioner for the past couple of months and they are wonderful - they smell amazing and leave my hair soft and healthy. I was curious about ordering from Amazon despite all of the reviews calling out fake Sebastian products and decided to give it a shot. Needless to say, THESE ARE NOT REAL SEBASTIAN PRODUCTS. The bottles don&#x27;t come packaged in the wrapper like they do at the salon, I noticed right away that the fragrance is way off (and barely there), and the texture and thickness of the products is completely different. Not sure what this is, but I&#x27;m not going to be using it on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spend the extra couple bucks at a salon and get the real stuff...what you&#x27;ll get here is repackaged dollar store crap at a 40x markup.</li>
            <li> Just can&#x27;t say enough about the quality of this hair product, and the way it leaves my hair smelling and feeling.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> Love this! Smells terrific and helped my hair tremedsly.</li>
            <li> I love this line of shampoo and conditioner! It&#x27;s well worth the money, since it smells so good and keeps coloured hair from maximum damage! It leaves hair smelling great and feel so soft! I would recommend this set to anyone with coloured or long hair! Completely amazing set! So much better than any shampoo and conditioner combo from your local drug or grocery store!</li>
            <li> I have put my hair through pure torcher the last few years being naturally blonde I went through a dark phase then back to blonde and then to dark red! I&#x27;m trying to get back on track and get it to were it is healthy! I tried Wen and really loved it as well but I just like the clean feeling of shamppoing normally so I tend to switch between the 2. I absolutely love this product I&#x27;ve used it for 2 days now and can see and feel a difference in my hair. Even my fianc&amp;eacute; says it looks softer. I love the way it looks, feels, and smells now! I would recommend if you have super dry hair and are looking for a cure buy this product along with the Babyface Pure Protein and use it along with Sebastian Drench Conditioner! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Not as good for my dryer hair as pureology, but it was okay.</li>
            <li> My hair changed dramatically when I started using this set.  I can never go back to buying grocery store S&amp;C.  This stuff is way too good!</li>
            <li> Il n&#x27;y a pas besoin d&#x27;utiliser beaucoup de produit pour faire un shampoing moussant, l&#x27;odeur du produit rappelle les salons de coiffure, les cheveux deviennent souples apr&amp;eacute;s utilisation.&lt;br /&gt;Par contre il est cher &amp;agrave; l&#x27;achat</li>
            <li> Order arrived sooner than expected. Hair is soft and conditioned. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Shampoo and conditioner smells great. My hear are silky and shinny after wash.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Just amazing.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo &amp; cream rinse on the market.  Leaves my hair shiny, manageable, without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> This product is very good.  It smells great and is extremely luxurious to use.  When you lather it in you really can feel the difference.  Plus, it makes your hair feel so soft afterward!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend who is taking cosmetology has done my hair several times now at her school. This is what they use and I love it. My hair has been chemical treated more times than I can remember so I need a good shampoo and conditioner and this has been great. I would definitely recommend these products.</li>
            <li> Sebastian products are wonderful and leave my hair feeling nice rather than heavy and greasy. Plus the price is great ^_^</li>
            <li> Product came fast and is at a great price. I love this shampoo and conditioner, I origonally purchased it from my salon and am so happy that I can now order it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> My hairstylest recommended using this but it was so expensive in the salon, so I went on my trusted Amazon account and found it for half the price!! I have long thick, color treated hair and I noticed my hair was dry, weak, and not happy so I bought some!! First try as of today and my hair feels light, smooth, and very happy!! Love it so far!</li>
            <li> after using this set for about a month, i can tell that my hair has had a noticeable change. after showering, it becomes extremely soft and it stays quite soft for the rest of the day/night (depending on when i shower). the product also has a very mild, yet pleasant, fragrance. my hair has also become a lot more manageable and i have been able to style it with much more ease.&lt;br /&gt;if the price of this kind of drives you away, note that these are rather large bottles and will last for quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;the only thing i don&#x27;t like is that the conditioner isn&#x27;t really liquidy so it can be a little more difficult to get out of the bottle than the shampoo. i&#x27;m not too sure how i&#x27;ll squeeze it out when there is only a little left... not a big deal though. great product!</li>
            <li> Great price; great product!</li>
            <li> really loved the shampoo me and my wife we both use it and the smell is so nice and last longer. and the conditioner is so good as well. i will definetly recomenned it</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful.  My hair gets noticeably cleaner when I use these products, as opposed to when I used drugstore shampoo and conditioner.  This shampoo and conditioner also clearer up my dandruff by providing a lot moisture than the drugstore shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo/conditioner!  Great smell and my hair is so soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time in my salon and had to get it. It&#x27;s wonderful. Smells great and really moisturizes. Definitely will repurchse</li>
            <li> not as good as the stuff I buy at salon locally.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, so I am always buying moisturizing shampoos and conditioners. This shampoos isn&#x27;t for me (I need to go back to sulfate free shampoos), however, I do love the conditioner. It is thick and does a good job! Would I buy this again? No, not as a set. I would definitely buy the conditioner again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product the best</li>
            <li> Order processing took much longer than than I expected, but I&#x27;m happy with the product and would order again</li>
            <li> The best shampoo and conditioner for your hair!</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair soft and clean.  Tried lots of other products but some of the leave in conditioners are drying.  This one adds moisture.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand of shampoo/conditioner. It&#x27;s very moisturizing. I buy it online when I&#x27;m feeling too lazy to go to the store.</li>
            <li> This shampoo &amp; Conditioner is really worth it. It is part of my every day hair care routine. My hair dresser suggested I try it &amp; I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo and conditioner! I have a tried a lot of shampoos and conditioners and this is still, by far, my favorite. My hair always feels super clean without any kind of residue build up over time. It softens thick wavy hair and keeps it super moisturized. My stylist recommended it when I was taking prenatal vitamins and my hair was getting totally wacky and this seemed to create the right balance and I never stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Was very pissed  bottles where busted and leaking!  Never buy again!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. I have thick hair that I use a flatiron on frequently and this shampoo/conditioner keeps my shoulder length hair healthy. I have a hard time finding the liter bottles where I live so it is nice to have it shipped directly to me.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product! I got a sample of it a few years ago - just enough for two or three washes - and told myself I&#x27;d splurge and buy it eventually. I&#x27;m glad I did. My hair is so much softer than it has ever been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need much of it to wash and condition your hair. My hair is super thick &amp; heavy and the length is approaching my elbows (not there yet, but I&#x27;m trying to grow it out) and I don&#x27;t need more than a quarter-sized drop so it might last longer than some of the drug store brands have in the past. In my opinion, it&#x27;s worth the outrageous price, but I admit to having saved about $15 by buying it on Amazon instead of from my local beauty supply store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the packaging. It arrived promptly and well padded with paper in the box, but something had been cut off of the original packaging, presumably by the seller, and the shampoo/conditioner set was wrapped in torn seran wrap. Not very impressive, especially for the price. I Googled an image of the original packaging just to see what I was missing. It had originally said \\&quot;2 for $49.99.\\&quot; I paid $52 for the set. I guess the seller doesn&#x27;t want us to know that they&#x27;re ripping us off for all of $2?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try to post some pictures of the packaging, but that is irrelevant to the actual product. I really do just love the shampoo and conditioner! I am a Sebastian fan for life.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time now and this is the best buy I have found! I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a new shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> Am going to attempt to return item as I think I may have gotten a bad set or something. After 5 washes, my hair is like a hay stack. It&#x27;s the worst my hair has ever been.</li>
            <li> The only shampoo and conditioner I will use. Made my hair so healthy again.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my mom on mothers day because they stopped carrying them in the salon she goes to, Amazon Prime 2 day shipping failed for the first time in forever and they came a day late so I couldn&#x27;t give them to her on mothers day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later that day my shampoo ran out, and the only other shampoo in my house was this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed my hair and then got out of the shower thinking nothing of it.  It was JUST shampoo after all......  Then after my hair dried, it was SO soft.  It felt like running my hands through silk shag carpet.  I couldn&#x27;t stop for a long time.  It was honestly the most amazing thing I&#x27;ve ever felt.  Softer than a kitten, smoother than 20 year scotch, and as beautiful as I had ever seen my hair be, nothing had ever felt this good in my whole entire life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I went to the store and bought my mom flowers, she can pry this shampoo out of my cold, dead, silken-haired corpse-hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this shampoo.  It is amazing. And the bottles are so huge they last forever.</li>
            <li> My hair smells great and looks softer ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
            <li> Works great and smells great, but a little on the pricey side. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!! I have very fine naturally curly hair, most of the time it feels dry and looks frizzy. With this duo my hair feels like silk. I usually have to fill my hand up with conditioner because my hair gets so knotty and it seems like no matter how much I use it still is not enough but with this conditioner I do not have to use alot. I put in on and leave it in for about 5 minutes while I do what else i need to do in the shower and when I get out I have about 90% less tangles than with any other products ive used and it smells good and my hair feels good. it does not leave an oliy resude or look greesy either! It is worth trying. I just recently got samples from my hair dresser to take on a cruise and I fell in love.. iI ordered it off here as soon as I got back</li>
            <li> Sebastian Drench Shampoo and Conditioner are wonderful products used at the salon.  They are gentle and the scent is subtle and lovely.  These jumbo-sized containers are a serious savings; I transfer the shampoo and conditioner to small containers for daily use or traveling.  Thank you for delivering so quickly, a day earlier than predicted.  I will order these again!</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about this shampoo and conditioner! I was introduced to it by my hairstylist at a local salon, and have been hooked ever since. I have a mix of wavy/curly hair, and I tend to have more oily hair. I am skeptical about things that are too moisture-rich for my hair because of the texture. However, I was pleasantly surprised with this set - my hair is silky smooth - curly OR straight! This really helps to reduce the frizziness of my hair on warm days as well.</li>
            <li> My hair smells great and feels so soft ðŸ˜ƒ&lt;br /&gt;Wish the conditioner wasn&#x27;t so hard to squeeze out of the bottle although once out, it was an amazing texture and creaminess</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shampoo and conditioner! I got the set cheaper from my hair dresser for $26</li>
            <li> These products are awesome for both my husband&#x27;s  and my hair, leaving the hair soft and easy to manage. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. This is the best product out there. It makes my hair feel clean. I recommend this shampoo!</li>
            <li> FAKE! Bottles arrived just shrink wrapped together. No seal on either bottle - conditioner was unusually overfilled. I used it a couple of times and noticed that the fragrance is way off and barely there. The shampoo doesn&#x27;t foam and the conditioner makes my hair fizzy. I had an allergic reaction to the product on my shoulders - never happened to me before. The texture and thickness of both products are not what I&#x27;m used too. I stopped using it and will try to return - very disappointed. I bought it from DNA Fulfillment - Amazon should check for fake products!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the shampoo and conditioner that I&#x27;m very satisfied with. I have been using these two for about 7 years now. Of coarse I&#x27;ve tried others over the years but always goes back to Sebastian Drench!</li>
            <li> Love the moisture these products add to my hair.  The scent is light but clean.  I have always purchased these at a salon but won&#x27;t do that again as this is a much better deal!</li>
            <li> Hands down the BEST shampoo and conditioner on the planet. Living in a very humid locale lends itself to frizzy curls, but Sebastian products not only tame them but make them the shiniest my hair has EVER looked.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this set and buying here is the price of what the salon charges for the 18oz! Awesome deal!</li>
            <li> This is a great deal for this shampoo/conditioner, and it makes my hair super soft. Absolutely LOVE IT! Before you buy this just know what your hair needs if you don&#x27;t need a moisturizing shampoo don&#x27;t buy one.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, I have tried a lot of shampoo and conditioners. This wil last a long time and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery great Shampoo and Conditioner. I wish the company offers overseas delivery!</li>
            <li> I have tried other moisture shampoos and conditioners - they have all dried out my hair and nothing seemed to work. And if they worked, it was too heavy and my hair would look waxy. This product has been so amazing. My hair is shiny, moisturized and not waxy looking like other &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; hair products have left my hair. LOVE this so much! And, its not very expensive in the long run b/c it lasts for a long time</li>
            <li> Bought this at my salon, loved it but I did not want to pay their price!</li>
            <li> These work so well, that I will continue to buy them here for the insanely good price.  The salons charge triple for the both of them.</li>
            <li> The very best product!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by my hair stylist. I used to use Pantene, then was using Wen for 2+ years.&lt;br /&gt;This product is so much better than Pantene and definitely Wen. The product doesn&#x27;t leave a buildup on your hair and my hair is more manageable than it has been in years. Not going to go back to Wen or store products.</li>
            <li> Poorly packed, got almost the items leaking and couple with the top broken, seems like they just threw my stuff in the box without any protections. Very sad...</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo when I want to blow dry my hair.  I have naturally curly hair, so don&#x27;t do that a lot.  It makes my hair soft and never dry feeling or looking.</li>
            <li> I bought to switch now and then from Penetraitt. It&#x27;s a good product, keeps my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> love this shampoo and conditioner.  so much so I bought for my sisters.  But one colors her hair and she says that it takes out her darker hair color because it is not sulfate freeâ€¦. It works great for me and my daughter!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner.  It works.  What else is there?</li>
            <li> My go to brand for shampoo and conditioner. Never fails to make my blond locks beautiful, luscious, shiny, soft and mend my split ends :) Definately worth the money. I prefer the Sebastian Penetraitt repair shampoo and conditioner more though.</li>
            <li> WAY cheaper than in-store prices (for fewer ounces!) and a great product.  Prompt, too!</li>
            <li> This is the real thing.  Not fake.&lt;br /&gt;Best hair products I have ever bought. Recommended by my hair dresser, as I highlightmy hair with 40 volume bleach! Eeek! It strengthens my hair. Smells amazing. The women I go to the gym with ask to borrow it all the time. :-) . It does not make my hair greasy, which other moisturing shampoos and conditioners seem to do.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner set. It leaves my hair soft and shiny, without weighing it down. I have very fine hair, but it&#x27;s also very frizzy. This set helps control the frizz. The smell is very pleasant as well. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this set is that it is hard to get the product out of the bottles. I bought pumps that fit the bottles perfectly, so now I don&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
            <li> Good price and fast shipping. Sebastian makes a very good product. Unfortunately I had to give it to a friend. It has a sulfate in it I cant use :-(.</li>
            <li> if you want a product that works for any type of hair this is your one stop shop. I am very sensitive to products...trust me I&#x27;ve tried just about everything and this one leaves my head feeling great not like other products that leave a residue feeling on my head making me dig at it. The shampoo is light and the conditioner is a little thicker but helps a lot with softness and is not heavy.</li>
            <li> My favorite everyday shampoo</li>
            <li> Just try this ..you will love it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product without thoroughly searching the ingredients list, and I now regret buying it. It has sulfates, parabens, and fragrance, and I personally am trying to avoid those things and other harmful chemicals as much as possible. I prefer a more natural approach and wish this shampoo and conditioner was formulated without sulfates and parabens.</li>
            <li> At last a shampoo that is so gentle on color that I can leave my salon visits for longer and be confident my color is still true right through til my next treatment. As well as that bonus, this Drench pair are moisturizing without weighing hair down, a great thing if you have fine hair. The scent of both products is pleasant, lingering on your hair for long enough to enjoy the whole day after washing. These products are concentrated so you don&#x27;t need a lot, maybe half of what you&#x27;ve used in the past with other products, so that&#x27;s a $ saving to boot - especially if you purchase in the 1 liter size bottles. Overall, I give these products 10 out of 10, I am very happy to have found Sebastian Drench after years of searching for the ultimate moisturizing color care for my hair, it&#x27;s a winner.</li>
            <li> This product was reccomended by my beautician.  She was so right.  It is an excellant product that softens the hair, makes it more manageble but doesn&#x27;t weight it down so it has plenty of body.</li>
            <li> These are super expensive products and getting them in this size at this price is a steal! I&#x27;ll be ordering more when I finally run out</li>
            <li> Amazing shampoo and conditioner!  And I&#x27;ve tried a lot.  Can&#x27;t beat the price for the quality!!</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of products but this one I have come to really love. I noticed better hair after my first use. I love the smell and can smell it all day without a burnt scent from my dryer or straightner. LOVE it and recommend to everyone</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It was recommended by my stylist, and I&#x27;ve been using it now for 6 months. My hair is soft, very healthy and feels and looks great. A little goes a long way. This product is great for thick hair / dry hair and works really good.  If you want to use it as a deep conditioner, sit under the dryer with a cap on your head for a few minutes.  I&#x27;ve noticed a HUGE difference in my hair. Again, excellent product that will not dissapoint.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.  This product is hard to find and the price was excellent. It arrived in two days and packaged well.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This is the first shampoo and conditioner that I&#x27;ve bought on Amazon that I really felt was the real shampoo and conditioner and not a knockoff. I am absolutely in love with the smell and it makes my hair so super soft. I was going to pay more for the 10 oz bottles of this than I could get for the 33.8 oz bottles on here! Great buy!</li>
            <li> So I was really annoyed when the shampoo came in and was not what I had ordered.  But after writing my past review and requesting to return the item, someone emailed me saying there must have been a mistake when pulling the item and that they would send me the items I ordered and allowed me to keep the order that was a mistake.  I appreciate them allowing me to keep the smaller bottles and for owning up to the mistake.</li>
            <li> Twice the amount for the price I used to pay for half its size. The quality is really good too.</li>
            <li> I have not used it yet but i heard it is great.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner and shampoo. Great for dry, color treated hair. It does weigh down your  hair, but mine is coarse and frizzy so I&#x27;m happy to weigh it down a bit.  My hair stylist constantly comments about the great condition my hair is in and I owe it all to Sebastian Drench!  Just wish it were available more places. Amazon is the only place I can find it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, and it will not weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> the product is really great. it makes hair really soft, shiny and managable. bottles are huge so will last forever.</li>
            <li> Item was packaged securely, arrived in timely manner, &amp; was reasonably priced. For those that hesitate about buying online, everyone I have dealt with have been great. Would buy from again, thanks</li>
            <li> I love Sebastian products. This is the first I ordered the drench and while I like it, it&#x27;s just too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> Like these. They help my hair shining and they turn the easy break hair strong.</li>
            <li> I started using this when i lived in Australia and loved it... now i use it in America and it is the best product out there!!! your hair is left feeling so clean, smooth and refreshed!!!</li>
            <li> The best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve EVER used.</li>
            <li> I read hundreds of positive reviews about this shampoo and conditioner but it did not work well for me. It might work for others but no for me. After 5 days of using the shampoo and conditioner my scalp got really really dry, itchy and flaky and my hair was dry and brittle. Do not buy the big bottles if you have not used it before, it may not be for you. As soon as I stopped using this shampoo and conditioner my scalp got better. Now I don&#x27;t know what to do with those big bottles.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and am grateful my hair stylist recommended it! My hair is stronger and straightens easier than it did before using this shampoo/conditioner. The price was worth it because the bottles will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my hair feel clean and healthy.  I am very picky about hair products so this was an impulse buy for me that worked out very well!</li>
            <li> Great product, I&#x27;ve been using it for years!&lt;br /&gt;Great price on amazon!</li>
            <li> My girls and I have think hair and I saw this combo pack here on Amazon, decided to give it a try. My girls love it! They said their hair feels really soft after using this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Been using the shampoo and conditioner for a while now and it makes my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> this shampoo and conditioner is AMAZING! i have very dry, brittle, frizzy, and oily hair and I&#x27;ve tried so many products that claim to do all these things but this product actually does what it says. it moisturizes you hair while not making it really greasy quickly. it makes your hair soft and shiny and feeling and looking healthy. additionally, you don&#x27;t need to use very much of the shampoo because it lathers up so nicely and the conditioner is rich but not over the top rich like a hair masque. so if you wash your hair everyday you can use the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only bad thing about this product is that after 3 or 4 uses (if you wash you hair every day like i do) then you do get some build up and the hair looks oily/wet. but don&#x27;t worry just use an anti-residue shampoo (neutrogena has one that  is great and its about $6.00) and it clears it right up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so all in all get this product you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Great buy, especially for the price! I have tried many other, more expensive shampoos and honestly this stuff works the best.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and my hair just LOVES this combo. It is moisturizing and smells great too!</li>
            <li> If I could give 1,000 stars, I would. This duo pair of Drench by Sebastian is the best on the market. I am of a mixed background, being half Mexican, quarter Indian, and a quarter German. My hair is extremely dry on the ends, very oily at the scalp. My issue has always been that I need to get the oil under control, but washing too much always made my bottom half of my hair frizzy and dry. My hair is naturally curly/wavy with a lot of body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried pretty much everything on the market--Redkin, Bed Head, Paul Mitchell, products for curly hair, products for ethnic hair, products for frizzy hair, dry hair, and so on. I saw this product on a show on what the best products are and decided to take a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shampoo--this stuff alone is amazing! You do not need very much to clean your hair. My hair goes to the bottom of my shoulder blades and I use about a quarter size blob. The shampoo is very moisturizing. And unlike other products that claim they do, this one you actually feel it. Even before putting the conditioner in, my hair was already soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Conditioner---this stuff is thick! Again, you won&#x27;t need a ton but I found it is easier to spread if you rub it in your hands first. I do mostly my ends and then work my way up to the scalp. I usually leave it on a few minutes as I wash my face. As moisturizing as it is, I was afraid that my hair would be limp from the weight (this happened to me when I used an olive oil type conditioner in the past. I do not blow dry my hair, so when it dried I was pleasantly surprised how shiny and bouncy my hair was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now used this duo for about a month and a half. My hair has not accumulated any by-product and is still bouncy, shiny, and in control as the first day I tried it. I PRAY Sebastian will never change this product!</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about this product. It was much better for my hair than the 2 different kinds of paul mitchell (special tea tree and lavender) shampoo/conditioner sets I tried. The shampoo smells very neutral with maybe a slight favor towards males. The conditioner seem to be scentless but I don&#x27;t remember for sure. My hair is clean and soft so I will probably get this again.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this shampoo &amp; conditioner. Had it on her wishlist. Makes her hair soft &amp; nourished, since she has her hair color treated.</li>
            <li> for years I have battle against dandruff.  I thought I had some type of infection until I started using this shampoo and conditioner.  They both hydrate my scalp and now I do not suffer from dandruff or opaque hair.</li>
            <li> I have used the products for a couple of months now and LOVE them! My thick, curly hair is silky, shiny and smooth when dried and flat ironed. I&#x27;ve even noticed that it takes less time to dry and less heat and effort to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> I loved this shampoo/conditioner. No other professional products worked for my hair, but sebastian drench leaves my hair super soft and it smells good also!! definitely recommend this!!</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo and conditioner and its easy to have it shipped to my door instead of going into a salon to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair strong and soft just use once and you will fall in love with how your hair feels</li>
            <li> My favorite combination so far!  I use it in combination with Penetraitt Deep Straightening and Repair Mask and my hair has never felt or looked better.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon for selling this at such a great deal!</li>
            <li> I use the shampoo daily and alternate the conditioner with a color conditioner. Great product. I have been using it for years. It really mosturizes your hair. Great price!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li> my wife loves these products and the price on amazon is well below retail outlets.</li>
            <li> smells wonderful, I have Curly thick hair and this shampoo leaves my hair soft, silky and less frizzy</li>
            <li> Good stuff - was nervous that I wouldn&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; stuff but its all kosher.  Smells great, feels great, works great - my hair feels fantastic :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally buy expensive shampoo sets but my husband was having some dry scalp issues and I wanted to spend the extra money on something nice. While this didn&#x27;t totally help (just the regular head and shoulders was conditioning enough for him in the end!) we did both really enjoy this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quick! I remember that, even though it was a while ago that we ordered now. We still have a ton. It doesn&#x27;t take much of this product to work up a good lather. It feels so rich in your hands. It&#x27;s definitely high quality and my hair feels great after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it&#x27;s the brand you&#x27;re looking for, it&#x27;s a good deal. The only reason I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again is I&#x27;m looking to make the switch to natural and I have had a couple recommendations for the Aveda line. So I&#x27;m going to try that next. I want less chemicals in my life. Might as well start with what I&#x27;m putting on and in my body.  :)  If the natural thing doesn&#x27;t work out, I&#x27;ll be back for more of this!</li>
            <li> Hair feels like straw afterwards!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner. Leaves my hair soft and silky. Smells great too! It is worth every penny! Love it!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for about a month now and my hair looks and smells phenomenal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WILL buy again. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying all kind of different shampoo and conditioners lately trying to find something that will make my long, medium-thickness blond hair feel super silky and healthy. I never used to splurge on salon brands but in my quest for better hair I&#x27;ve been giving it a go. Before this I tried Bed Head Recovery and at first I thought I loved it but suddenly I realized that it wasn&#x27;t really doing THAT much. It smelled nice and was easy to lather into my hair, but I wasn&#x27;t actually seeing any great results with my hair, at least nothing that could justify the price of a salon brand, nothing amazing compared to what much less expensive brands will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw the great ratings for Sebastian Drench here on Amazon and decided to try again. I&#x27;m telling you I REALLY wanted to be amazed by this shampoo and conditioner. But my experience was just like with Bed Head. It&#x27;s not doing anything to write home about. My hair is clean, and basically smooth. Smoother than it would be if I hadn&#x27;t used conditioner at all but that&#x27;s not saying much. I even tried using an anti-residue shampoo a few times to see if I just had build-up that was keeping my hair from benefiting but I saw no difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately I just don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s worth paying for salon brands if they&#x27;re not going to do something awesome for my hair above and beyond what something like Pantene can do. I might try Nexxus, but if that fails me too I&#x27;m going to be a sad panda and go back to cheap brands.</li>
            <li> Simply amazing. !! Makes my hair soft and makes them look healthy. Got a similar shine for what I had to use a serum. Guess it worked for my hair type(dry and thick).</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever tried! I had never heard of it before and my hairdresser recommended the conditioner to me last time I saw her. So I did and I knew I finally found the perfect conditioner! Makes my hair so soft and smells amazing!! I have very long thick hair and also an ombr&amp;eacute; and this product is good for color treated hair. I ended up ordering this set of the shampoo and conditioner in the 33.8 ounce size from Amazon because the salon charges me $15 for an 8 ounce bottle, but I found this set for roughly $40 for both! Which is like 4 times the amount for only $5 more per bottle! I love these so much I ordered the same set from Amazon for my 24 year old daughter and she loves it too!!</li>
            <li> I bought this set without reading the reviews carefully and when they arrived, I looked at the ingredient list. Holy smoke! The first two ingredients of the shampoo were sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate. Both the shampoo and conditioner contain sodium chloride. They are not meant to be used on my keratin-treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was feeling plucky that day and experimented with the shampoo and conditioner. Surprisingly, they did not harm to the condition of my hair, which remained straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like about the set. Like its name suggests, &amp;#34;Drench&amp;#34; is extremely moisturising. The shampoo left a coat of silicone (?) on my hair, making it feel lank and greasy even when I tried my best to rinse it out. The conditioner did a decent job of detangling, which meant more product deposits on my fine hair. Based on what I see from the hair that falls out from detangling and blow-drying, I have experienced more hair fall with this set of shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout the day, my hair looked limp. By the end of the day, my dry hair looked greasy, which means I actually need a shampoo but not one that left a greasy coat on my hair. This non-virtuous cycle is not the most pleasant feeling in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products might work well for those with thick and unruly hair. If you have fine hair, please stay far away from it. Shell out a bit more for the Alterna Caviar shampoo and conditioner, which has no sulfates or sodium chloride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles are still close to full. Very soon, I shall take a deep breath and ruthlessly bin them. They are not for my hair.</li>
            <li> love this stuff! great price, too</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shampoo I have ever used. I have long, thick straight hair with a tiny bit of......lets call it &amp;#34;fuzz&amp;#34; after I blowdry it. This shampoo/conditioner cleans great, smells great, lathers great (very important to me), and makes my hair super soft. Price is great for the size you get of a salon product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only need a quarter size dollop of shampoo and conditioner. With other products I use a larger amount. I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo ever since my hairdressor used it on me. It does not cause any build up and it leaves my hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Decent shampoo and conditioner, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy again unless the bottle design is changed. If you use a dispenser at home or don&#x27;t mind transferring the contents to another bottle, it might be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know its sounds awful petty, like the people who are upset their shipping box was slightly discolored so they give the product a one star rating, but you seriously need the jaws of life to squeeze the conditioner out of this bottle. And the more you do it the more the bottle loses its shape and it becomes even harder to get out...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo bottle is better and that works just fine.</li>
            <li> Product Worked great, no problems at all. As advertised on line. Shipping was also very fast. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always a little nervous about buying a product like this off the internet. But after using it you can tell that it&#x27;s authentic.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I ordered this shampoo and conditioner and also got the Sebastian penetraitt masque. I used the shampoo and immediately noticed it felt like it stripped my hair. So I used the masque and left it in for over 5 minutes then rinsed. When I combed my hair out it felt like straw. I put my usual grooming product and dried my hair. My hair has never ever been more frizzy. I&#x27;m not sure why there are so many good reviews. Maybe my product was switched for a cheap product. Who knows but I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo! I haven&#x27;t had to switch shampoos once I started using this on a regular basis about 2 years ago.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner set. The shampoo makes my hair feel clean without making it feel like it&#x27;s been stripped completely, and the conditioner is nice and thick, and wonderfully conditioning especially in the winter months. That said, it&#x27;s definitely not too heavy for summer, either! I have moderately thick straight-ish hair that gets oily fast, and this stuff definitely does the job.</li>
            <li> Love, love LOVE IT!  I have very fine hair and it did not flatten it down, but made is smooth and shiny!  Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> Great product! I loved the Sebastian penetrait as well. But drench gives me so much more body and softness. It smells great. I would highly recommend this set!</li>
            <li> This is really good shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a guy who keeps his hair long (for as long as I still have it, I&#x27;m keeping as much as I can!). I didn&#x27;t grow up learning how to keep long hair, so I&#x27;ve had to experiment to find out how to take care of it. I&#x27;ve tried a number of expensive shampoos and cheap shampoos and all sorts of things. I&#x27;ve found some things work better than others, but not so much so that it warrants the price difference. $10 of Pantene works 85% as well as $70 imported salon product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I decided to give this a go and I am very pleased. It works 98% as well as imported fancy salon product at a quarter the price. It has a very pleasant, but not-too-effeminate scent (though the scent works well for either gender).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my shampoo - until the price goes up or I find something better.</li>
            <li> I have owned this product for about 8 months now; I really like it.  Both do what they are suppose to do.</li>
            <li> I have over processed hair with split ends that is hard to get tangles out of - this shampoo and conditioner is the only one on the market that works for me.</li>
            <li> This is he best ever!! My hair looks and feels amazing!!</li>
            <li> Product as described! ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
            <li> The absolute best. Makes my hair so soft. I blow dry my curly hair straight every time I shower,  so heat damage is a big concern.  Since I&#x27;ve started using this shampoo I have seen a huge difference in the health of my hair, and I actually think it had helped with growth.</li>
            <li> fast delivery and delivered as shown</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for 3 years now and it has worked GREAT for my super spiral curly hair. It leaves my hair moisturized &amp; shiny with minimal frizz (As a curly hair girl I&#x27;ve accepted that frizz is inevitable!). Before these two products, I used multiple drug store brands. While visiting my mom (she has thick straight hair) I used her shampoo/conditioner which was the Sebastian drench. WOW I could immediately tell a difference in my hair texture. It&#x27;s definitely worth the extra $$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**TIP - This shampoo and conditioner is super moisturizing and can over time weight my hair down. I like to give my hair a break by using a basic drug store shamp/cond so my hair has a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feel. I do this once or twice a month and I&#x27;ve found it helps bring back \\&quot;bounce\\&quot; to my curls.</li>
            <li> I bought this set and two other brands at the same time. It&#x27;s taken me a while to narrow it down, but I&#x27;ve finally isolated this shampoo and conditioner as the culprits. They made my hair look nice, feel smooth, etc, but also caused bumps to appear on my scalp. Both did it when used separately, but the shampoo was definitely the worst. So sad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an avid Aveda user for the past 2 years.  The salon that offered the Aveda products went out of business over this past summer and I&#x27;m too busy to hit my local mall to continue on Aveda and as an avid Amazon junkie, I decided to find an alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this shampoo/conditioner set and immediately I fell in love with this product.  I have thicker, curly hair and it tones that thickness down by making it softer.  I love the smell.  It&#x27;s a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint: PUT PUMPS ON THE BOTTLES!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that...absolutely awesome.  If you&#x27;re used to buying expensive shampoos (the Aveda equivalent for the shampoo ONLY was around $85) then you&#x27;ll love this product.  It&#x27;s not anything like some cheap brand.  It has the same feel, smell and results of an expensive shampoo but it&#x27;s not nearly as expensive.  Try it!</li>
            <li> This shampoo can be so expensive at the salon. Here I was able to save a considerable amount of money. The shampoo and conditioner are exceptional. My hair can be frizzy and dry. When I use this shampoo for a good length of time my hair improves considerably. I used it about 10 years ago for about 6 years and when money got tight I switched to something less expensive. At this price I could go back to what I love and my hair has improved greatly over the past nine months of using it. I will never use anything else again!</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing. Great for long hair. But heavy for short medium thick hair</li>
            <li> I have tried many different shampoos/conditioners, my hair is very picky. I tried all of Redken, Paul Mitchell and none of them left my hair feeling light, it was always heavy and oily. I&#x27;m not sure what I was allergic to in the ingredients but I saw the Sebastian brand and how good the reviews were and thought I would give it a try. I immediately noticed a huge difference in my hair after only the first wash. The smell is amazing, my hair is light and soft. Even the next day its not tangled and looks like it needs to be washed again like it used to. My hair is thanking me! I will be sticking to this brand!</li>
            <li> Feels primarily oil-based. But only a little goes a long way, which I appreciate. A dab will literally do you, and these are big bottles. Didn&#x27;t get it from a salon. Conditioner seems to be only a thicker version of regular shampoo. Put off by the price? Don&#x27;t be, because it lasts three times as long as other similar products. Expect it&#x27;ll last me half a year. It&#x27;s almost scentless. Any other claims? That it improves hair quality, texture, thickness, etc? No, it doesn&#x27;t do any of that. But it does seem to perform better than other products (if only slightly).</li>
            <li> After years of coloring and styling my hair with hot irons, my hair has gotten very dry. I have tried expensive conditioners and keratin products, but my hair is still dry. I tried these two Sebastian products and they made my hair soft and silky again. They are much less expensive than other salon products,too.</li>
            <li> I have several shampoos and this is one of my faverites. It does what it says. My hair is always shiney and thick after I use it, and I will order it again. I also sent it to my sister who lives in Calf, she has great hair anysways, but she loves the way it works. My hair is thin, hers is thick. You can&#x60;t go wrong with this product.</li>
