            <li>It keeps my hair really healthy.</li>
            <li>My favorite shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>I totally love that product also.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the shampoo; it&#x27;s like a juicy pineapple.</li>
            <li>It  is ok.</li>
            <li>I was expecting something better</li>
            <li>Better off buying from a certified salon.</li>
            <li>They really do moisturize and leave my hair smelling so good :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s another good Bed Head product for a decent price :)</li>
            <li>I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>I am fed up with grocery store cheap shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conditioner is very rich and also very moisturizing, but I still use olive oil on my hair once in awhile.</li>
            <li>I love that I only need less than a dime-size dollop for my whole head, it smells great and is rich and creamy!</li>
            <li>Scalp is better and hair is glossy and soft.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clean or condition the hair very well.</li>
            <li>This happened after the first washing.  </li>
            <li>Also, dumb blonde is wonderful to use when i can go to my mothers house and wash my hair with city water.</li>
            <li>Worked as expected :)</li>
            <li>Bed Head works very well for me as a step up.</li>
            <li>An organic chemical which is very toxic to all mammals.</li>
            <li>Once again, great product but poor shipping and faulty bottle.</li>
            <li>Is it our water (we have a whole house water Softner system)?  </li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and leaves no residue.  </li>
            <li>the combination of the Bed Head  shampoo and conditioner work very well without leaving a greasy feel.</li>
            <li>It feels soft and thick and there is no build-up, smells great, too.  </li>
            <li>I have always used a love moisture maniac by Bed Head, however, when I purchased this product it arrived a complete mess.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding this recently, but will happily keep getting it on Amazon as long as they&#x27;ll sell it.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t notice a difference between the different ones.</li>
            <li>I have to completely unscrew the pump and pour into my hand.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair so soft.  </li>
            <li>One of the bottles of shampoo had a loose top and about an inch and a half leaked out.  </li>
            <li>it was a little more money than some of the other bed head sets-</li>

            <li> I have been using this for a few months and lately my hair had been getting a bit more dry.</li>
            <li> I need to use a flat iron after every shampoo  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Using them both leaves my hair soft but not super silky as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> I have long color treated hair.</li>
            <li> and I have long hair.</li>
            <li> I notice it strips all the oil off your hair and my hair was dry and breaks off.</li>
            <li> I have auburn hair that tends to be dry in our Idaho climate.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find a shampoo that didn&#x27;t give me the frizzies or make my hair too dry.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and a dry scalp</li>
            <li> so my hair tends to get very dry  </li>
            <li> I have thick and coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> and it is the only shampoo that I have found that doesn&#x27;t dry my scalp out and make the eczema worse.  </li>
            <li> I heard them throw the box down.</li>
            <li> Feels watered down.</li>
            <li> Toxic, allergenic, carcinogenic, can cause reproductive problems (involuntary abortion of a fetus and other issues), and 0.37 ounces of it can kill humans!</li>
            <li> On one, the pump tip had completely broken off and on the other, the pump would not release open when twisting it.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse hair, so it takes a lot to tame the beast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair was not healthy after a few usage of it.  </li>
            <li> It takes very little conditioner to condition my hair</li>
            <li> Not sure...  </li>
            <li> Had small micro-clumps in it.</li>
            <li> It has made my shower very inconvenient and everyday I waste a large amount of this expensive shampoo when trying to use it.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for at least 10 years.  </li>
            <li> The USA really needs to get some regulations on beauty and health products, this is horrifying.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for approximately 6 months and have seen a dramatic change in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Very frustrating.  </li>
            <li> That said, once she started using this product at home her hair immediately returned to its frizzy crazy state.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed when I received both bottles with broken tops.  </li>
            <li> I have bad luck with shampoo and conditioners on Amazon...</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>

            <li> Product is great!  One of the bottles of shampoo had a loose top and about an inch and a half leaked out.  It could have happened when th delivery was made.  I heard them throw the box down.</li>
            <li> I am giving TIGI Bed Head Shampoo &amp; Conditioner a big FIVE STARS for economy and function! I love that I only need less than a dime-size dollop for my whole head, it smells great and is rich and creamy! These bottles last me about six months, if not longer! They leave my hair looking healthy, which is saying a lot since I&#x27;ve colored it for YEARS! I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Feels watered down. Doesn&#x27;t clean or condition the hair very well.</li>
            <li> This shampoo set smells great- I wish the smell lasted on my hair though.  it was a little more money than some of the other bed head sets- next time I will get a cheaper one. I really don&#x27;t notice a difference between the different ones.</li>
            <li> Product is ok.  Was very disappointed when I received both bottles with broken tops.  On one, the pump tip had completely broken off and on the other, the pump would not release open when twisting it.  Very frustrating.  The shampoo and and conditioner were ok so I gave the set to my daughter.  I have a lot of very coarse hair and I had to use a ton of it just to detangle my hair.  Will not order again.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for at least 10 years.  I LOVE IT. My hair loves it.  It feels soft and thick and there is no build-up, smells great, too.  I have well-water and anytime I try to buy a cheaper store-brand shampoo, it&#x27;ll only work for about a week before my hair feels like straw.  I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding this recently, but will happily keep getting it on Amazon as long as they&#x27;ll sell it.  Best shampoo ever.</li>
            <li> I am fed up with grocery store cheap shampoos and conditioners. Bed Head works very well for me as a step up. My hair doesn&#x27;t get stringy or lanky, and feels nice throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I notice it strips all the oil off your hair and my hair was dry and breaks off. I have thick and coarse hair.  My hair was not healthy after a few usage of it.  I won&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> At last. Something that works!  Scalp is better and hair is glossy and soft.</li>
            <li> Gunks up my hair.  Trying to find someone to give them to.</li>
            <li> This Duo is wonderful !!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few months and lately my hair had been getting a bit more dry. I thought &amp;#34;maybe this shampoo/conditioner has alcohol in it which is drying out my hair?&amp;#34; so I checked the ingredients. While it doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol, it does contain formaldehyde. An organic chemical which is very toxic to all mammals. Toxic, allergenic, carcinogenic, can cause reproductive problems (involuntary abortion of a fetus and other issues), and 0.37 ounces of it can kill humans! Why would this chemical be put in a hair product? The USA really needs to get some regulations on beauty and health products, this is horrifying.</li>
            <li> They really do moisturize and leave my hair smelling so good :)</li>
            <li> I love Bed Head TIGI products. It makes my hair feel as though I am going to a hairdresser. This shampoo takes control of my hair, my split ends, and works marvelous. I will never go to another shampoo or conditioner. They get my products to my home quickly and give me Great business.</li>
            <li> Excellent hair product.  Works great.  Delivery nice and smooth.  This is a great way to purchase the product and it helps curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have always used a love moisture maniac by Bed Head, however, when I purchased this product it arrived a complete mess.  The conditioner had exploded inside the box and the shampoo bottle could not be opened.  I have to completely unscrew the pump and pour into my hand. It has made my shower very inconvenient and everyday I waste a large amount of this expensive shampoo when trying to use it.  Once again, great product but poor shipping and faulty bottle.</li>
            <li> My daughter has course frizzy out of control hair. She returned from her friends house w/ awesome, shinny &amp; frizz free hair - I was awestruck.  I immediately bought the set, given the fact that I think it&#x27;s discontinued I even worried about her future supply (I can&#x27;t find the product on Tigi&#x27;s website). That said, once she started using this product at home her hair immediately returned to its frizzy crazy state. This happened after the first washing.  I&#x27;m bewildered!  Is it our water (we have a whole house water Softner system)?  It it this &#x27;lot&#x27; of product?  Could this product be counterfit?  Not sure...  Don&#x27;t know how I could confirm the reason save her using her friends product at our house.  If I discover the reason I&#x27;ll update my post.  Moreover, if anyone else has noticed a difference for whatever reason, I&#x27;d ❤ to hear from you.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fabulous shampoo/conditioner!  I have auburn hair that tends to be dry in our Idaho climate.  I have been using the product for approximately 6 months and have seen a dramatic change in my hair.  It is very lightweight and leaves no residue.  Also this product smells wonderful, a bit like grapefruit.  I have also notice that my hair may be growing a bit faster than it did before.</li>
            <li> love this shampoo.I have fine hair. I couldn&#x27;t find a shampoo that didn&#x27;t give me the frizzies or make my hair too dry. This makes my hair so soft.  I thought it was supposed to be discontinued, but still for sale on amazon.</li>
            <li> I have long color treated hair. I need to use a flat iron after every shampoo  so my hair tends to get very dry  I found&lt;br /&gt;That the combination of the Bed Head  shampoo and conditioner work very well without leaving a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It keeps my hair really healthy.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> Very happy with the products &amp; delivery was speedy too!</li>
            <li> I have well water and this product was perfect.  It totally cleans and moisturizes my hair.  It does not leave it feeling like straw. It takes very little conditioner to condition my hair and I have long hair. I will keep using it from now on. Also, dumb blonde is wonderful to use when i can go to my mothers house and wash my hair with city water. I totally love that product also.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the shampoo; it&#x27;s like a juicy pineapple. The condition smells good, but not as strong as the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using them both leaves my hair soft but not super silky as I&#x27;d hoped. I have very thick, coarse hair, so it takes a lot to tame the beast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner is very rich and also very moisturizing, but I still use olive oil on my hair once in awhile. I do wish they made this stuff sulfate-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, would buy again. It&#x27;s another good Bed Head product for a decent price :)</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling great and looking shiny!</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo and conditioner for years.  I have eczema and a dry scalp and it is the only shampoo that I have found that doesn&#x27;t dry my scalp out and make the eczema worse.  It has been a great shampoo and conditioner for me.</li>
            <li> It  is ok. I was expecting something better</li>
            <li> Horrible! Diluted. Old. Had small micro-clumps in it. Not the official product. I have bad luck with shampoo and conditioners on Amazon... Better off buying from a certified salon.</li>
