            <li>very nice product</li>
            <li>After successfully applying your three layers, now you can take the Sina Cleaner and rub off the tacky</li>
            <li>After successfully three layers rub off taky layer with Sina Cleaner and you are done!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great product for the cheap price!!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, excellent for price, good bonder gives you good adherence so get one, can easily do two sets per jar.</li>
            <li>to practice is very good :) and</li>

            <li>It seem OK not that good gel</li>
            <li>a nice rest of the day&lt;br /&gt;goodbye</li>
            <li>Nice staff.</li>
            <li>I personally liked it, but have not been spoiled by another brand.</li>
            <li>Even though you could get the nails to look nice they seemed to crack off within 1-4 hours.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this if you do your own nails.</li>
            <li>I am glad that i bought these since this was a test run to see if i could get my nails looking nice before going for the pricer IBD gel.</li>
            <li>but I have been doing my own nails for many years.</li>
            <li>The best gel ever I had for a such a price and speed amazing.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more product, it leaked.</li>
            <li>I didnt want to invest a lot since I am just starting with gel nails,  but this product is great!</li>
            <li>I have since ordered more.</li>
            <li>The UV gels work okay</li>
            <li>but I am not yet sure where.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>God product to practice :)</li>
            <li>And you get a lot of product in the box :)</li>
            <li>i will by again :)</li>
            <li>If you decide not to add nail art, then take the UV Top coat, apply one layer making sure not to get onto the skin and then cure for 2 min.</li>
            <li>though they do not let you know that you should not use with more than 9 watt lamp if it is used with more than a 9 watt lamp</li>
            <li>It took a while but is ok</li>
            <li>The clear and pink are perfect, work wonderfully esp when mixing with clitters.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very excited to get it.</li>
            <li>I feel like I am pretty good at \\&quot;building\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Great product for the price!&lt;br /&gt;Downside is the package is cheap and when i received mine the clear had spilled all over.</li>
            <li>I used this with reverse forms with this product and it cured just fine.</li>
            <li>so I wanted to start out cheap.</li>
            <li>IT DOESNT FREEZE WITH UV LIGHT</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to beginners and advanced alike.</li>
            <li>I have a 36W UV light.</li>
            <li>This product is cheap and it shows.</li>
            <li>Also good for strengthening natural nails, or mending a cracked nail.</li>
            <li>This is a case where its better to spend a little more to get a good product.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going to want to use to clean up if your gel spills.</li>
            <li>They would break or fall off and never felt super secure.</li>
            <li>I am super excited to use</li>
            <li>Good luck to you in future sales.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>Full cure in 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>adding nail art I can do a full set of nails in about an hour and with nail art about an hour and a half.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they feel much more secure and natural.</li>
            <li>but it is definitely worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I like these gels because they are cheap and you don&#x27;t want to waste good product on practice hands or fingers</li>
            <li>Love the shine and strength it gives my natural nails.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty quick with my application process but by the time I get it to the lamp it has &amp;#34;self leveled&amp;#34; all the way over the cuticle.</li>
            <li>Very easy to file, if you&#x27;re willing to take the time to do a lot of layers to get the look you want then go for it, just remember to store flat at all times to avoid having to clean this sticky stuff off everything.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pure awfulness!  </li>
            <li>It felt so hot that I wanted o rip the gel off my finger nails</li>
            <li>this is okay for a low cost alternative.</li>
            <li>Overall, the product is okay</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M PRETTY.</li>
            <li>As with anything, do your research first.</li>
            <li>My clear feel builder wasn&#x27;t full all the way.</li>
            <li>Spend a little more and get a brand name or you will feel the BURN!</li>
            <li>I saw some tutorials using this product and it looked easy enough!</li>
            <li>I really like this product I have done several sets of nails with this gel using just a 9v light to cure.  </li>
            <li>Better then I expected.</li>
            <li>Also, this product Self levels maybe a bit too much...</li>
            <li>Went straight into the trash.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t forget to have your UV light before using otherwise your nails will not cure properly!</li>
            <li>but maybe I just really dont like the gels.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for all you have done for me.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I was also really please with how fast it shipped</li>
            <li>i never get that much lifting.</li>
            <li>The gel itself is adequate and needs to be cured properly with a bulb higher than 9w.</li>
            <li>Does not dry adequately.</li>
            <li>but if its on or close to cuticles it does lift the pink looks clear but for the price it is actually better than I thought and it dries</li>
            <li>to spend a little more money.</li>
            <li>ive been doing my nails for years it does fine all except it lifts but other than that</li>
            <li>Also they peeled right off 3 days later.</li>
            <li>However, when I put the clear gel on my prepped nails and set it, my finger nails felt like they were on FIRE!</li>
            <li>stuff lasts longer than any of sally&#x27;s clear gel!</li>
            <li>I have only used the pink one so far (it actually looks pretty much clear) but if the clear and white are as good as it this will be the only gel I&#x27;ll ever need for my extensions.</li>
            <li>This package came with 3 times as much product, it&#x27;s only a couple days into my new extensions</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just clear.</li>
            <li>The clear gel is thicker than clear soak-off gel, but it feels stronger once it&#x27;s cured.</li>
            <li>I had to throw out the clear.</li>
            <li>waste of money even though cheap</li>
            <li>It arrived about a week before the date said it would, which surprised me.</li>
            <li>I had to use the majority of my (already owned) nail cleanser for nearly 20 minutes to try and get it off</li>
            <li>This product does not adhere well to the natural nail bed.</li>
            <li>All I wanted it for was to extend my natural nails&lt;</li>
            <li>Every application so far has led to under 24 hrs wear before the nails lift and pop off.</li>
            <li>I am by no means a professional</li>
            <li>Prep and buff natural</li>
            <li>but you cant expect professional quality for this price.</li>
            <li>Wish this was soak off but does the job (overlay for my natural nails)</li>
            <li>Looks great on my nails, it&#x27;s a little difficult to use at first, but watching a couple tutorials clarifies things.</li>
            <li>The quality of the product is not bad, a little runny</li>
            <li>Had major air bubbles.</li>
            <li>The clear and pink, which is actually clear, can be applied thicker like a normal builder gel.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t get hard under UV/LED light.</li>
            <li>I barely have to file my nails when done.</li>
            <li>Cures fully in my 9W lamp just takes a little time and with the right priming etc</li>
            <li>Okay, biggest con I had was the white needs to be cured in thin layers.</li>

            <li> Okay, biggest con I had was the white needs to be cured in thin layers.</li>
            <li> The two fingers I have used this stuff on so far are a mess- sore and breaking out with tiny watery blisters around the cuticle.  </li>
            <li> First, this is a builder gel, it is suppose to be thick.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is thick, but this type of builder gel does have a higher viscosity than others</li>
            <li> they sent two pink, one white and no clear 2)</li>
            <li> It did the job, no burning (as long as bonder was totally dry on my nail).</li>
            <li> It takes that long (or shorter) at a nail salon!  </li>
            <li> my fingers are going to be sore and/or takes to long to fix just one!  </li>
            <li> In the clear case there was very little gel in it.</li>
            <li> VERY sticky and hard to spread on the nail and takes forever to set/dry!  </li>
            <li> Without wiping away primer, take small bead of Gel (clear, or pink)</li>
            <li> middle fingernail got broken, so I used the clear gel and nail form to extend it.</li>
            <li> it is what I have found to work on the nails I do, it is also long lasting, I usually do my moms every 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I received the three gels on time but when i opened the package the pink gel leaked out got all over the three containers.</li>
            <li> I ended up putting scotch tape around the containers but they are still sticky and the pink still leaked out somehow</li>
            <li> my pink one came with dirt inside and a hair.</li>
            <li> Ive ordered this product from other vendors before and never had that issue.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll never get it to spread or dry!!!  </li>
            <li> you the pink color is basically clear, apply thin layer of Gel and cure 2 min.</li>
            <li> Its hard to work with because it&#x27;s so thick and the pink is pink in the jar but not pink on your nails</li>
            <li> The other two did nothing but make a mess.</li>
            <li> I bought this gel to do repairs or extend the life of my gels until I can get to the salon, but not really worth</li>
            <li> I had a good time laughing at how horrible the product is as it made the oddest shapes on my nail.</li>
            <li> I just filed it down after it set.</li>
            <li> and I now have to go over about 50 bottles of polish with a nail prep soaked paper towel to get rid of the sticky mess.</li>
            <li> , they just take a little longer under the lamp (around 2 minutes).</li>
            <li> It just takes a little longer.</li>
            <li> Gels are sticky, even expensive ones, (I&#x27;ve used a few), so don&#x27;t be surprised when this one is.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this item before learning the difference between regular gel and soak-off gel, but I tired it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that a few opaque gels need this.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this stuff-</li>
            <li> to work with ,but they run to the edges of the nails quickly :(  </li>
            <li> A little slow</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> The shipping was slow</li>
            <li> upall product seems kinda thick</li>
            <li> Decent product for beginners, but keep it SEPARATE from your other nail stuff and anything that you care about, they leak terribly</li>
            <li> Not only do I seem to be having a bad reaction to this stuff</li>
            <li> Very hard to remove.</li>
            <li> arrived leaking seals broken .I</li>
            <li> but by then it had already set and continued to burn my poor fingers!</li>
            <li> but id rather practice with this than expensive stuff</li>
            <li> even after 5 minutes under a uv lamp it was still runny and useless.</li>
            <li> To compensate for this I apply very thin layers</li>
            <li> even when you use a thin lag in the nail :(&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Anyone who uses this knows just how sticky and impossible it is to remove.  </li>
            <li> When I went to cure them they burned so bad.</li>
            <li> This gel overheats and burns like crazy under the lamp!</li>
            <li> And they burn a lot :(</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> hated it .</li>
            <li> it will cause a very bad heat spike and be very painful.</li>
            <li> Packaging was terrible.</li>
            <li> The worst product ever.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s the worst &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve ever seen or used.  </li>

            <li> I like this product, it does burn if cured without a fan.</li>
            <li> I have never used structure gel before so I wanted to start out cheap. This was a good deal! However, when I put the clear gel on my prepped nails and set it, my finger nails felt like they were on FIRE! It felt so hot that I wanted o rip the gel off my finger nails but by then it had already set and continued to burn my poor fingers! I would not recommend this to any one. Spend a little more and get a brand name or you will feel the BURN!</li>
            <li> I was expecting more product, it leaked. but otherwise works well</li>
            <li> Better then I expected. Good product and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Decent product for beginners, but keep it SEPARATE from your other nail stuff and anything that you care about, they leak terribly and I now have to go over about 50 bottles of polish with a nail prep soaked paper towel to get rid of the sticky mess. Also, this product Self levels maybe a bit too much... I&#x27;m pretty quick with my application process but by the time I get it to the lamp it has &amp;#34;self leveled&amp;#34; all the way over the cuticle. To compensate for this I apply very thin layers but this is still an issue, and one-by-one application is out of the question for me. Very easy to file, if you&#x27;re willing to take the time to do a lot of layers to get the look you want then go for it, just remember to store flat at all times to avoid having to clean this sticky stuff off everything. FYI, the nail cleanser product you use to remove the sticky layer after curing.. That&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going to want to use to clean up if your gel spills.</li>
            <li> Packaging was terrible. By the time this made it to me it was everywhere!!  Anyone who uses this knows just how sticky and impossible it is to remove.  Went straight into the trash.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t last and spilled over the packaging it came in.</li>
            <li> arrived leaking seals broken .I hated it . waste of money even though cheap</li>
            <li> This product was garbage. I bought it to have a backup when I ran out but it is NOT uv gel. It melted all over when I put it under my lamp. Ruined my lamp and I had to start over. I want my money back.</li>
            <li> My clear feel builder wasn&#x27;t full all the way.</li>
            <li> These gels do not work well at all after I put them on they started lifting. In the clear case there was very little gel in it.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re  so tiny. Even with three in the mail it shouldnt be $4, hardy works</li>
            <li> I Still haven&#x27;t get it! :/ so I don&#x27;t know the quality of it! Hope I can get it some time soon!</li>
            <li> this is okay for a low cost alternative. I used this with reverse forms with this product and it cured just fine.</li>
            <li> It arrived before the estimated delivery date, ordered on March 6th and delivered on the 18th. Looks great on my nails, it&#x27;s a little difficult to use at first, but watching a couple tutorials clarifies things. Love the product!</li>
            <li> It seem OK not that good gel but I didn&#x27;t expect anything fancy for that price  I only use it once</li>
            <li> I am so aggravated with this product and seller . This so called UV GEL DOES NOT WORK IT DOESNT FREEZE WITH UV LIGHT AT ALL. SO PLS BEWARE OF THIS PRODUCT. DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> Its hard to work with because it&#x27;s so thick and the pink is pink in the jar but not pink on your nails, it&#x27;s just clear. Also they peeled right off 3 days later.</li>
            <li> I didnt want to invest a lot since I am just starting with gel nails,  but this product is great! I have since ordered more.</li>
            <li> I received these yesterday! I am super excited to use I saw some tutorials using this product and it looked easy enough! Just don&#x27;t forget to have your UV light before using otherwise your nails will not cure properly!</li>
            <li> Products lids were open in the bag. They leaked in the bag.</li>
            <li> I dont think that i dont like the product necessarily but maybe I just really dont like the gels. they never seem to fully cure and then when I have to remove any excess the shine goes away.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for all you have done for me. Good luck to you in future sales.&lt;br /&gt;Have a nice rest of the day&lt;br /&gt;goodbye</li>
            <li> The UV gels work okay, they just take a little longer under the lamp (around 2 minutes). Also, there was white gel inside the package, yet the white gel pot was sealed. It arrived about a week before the date said it would, which surprised me. Overall, the product is okay and I would recommend it to beginners and advanced alike.</li>
            <li> Garbage. Product came unsealed. Threw it out.</li>
            <li> Product does not cure with led like lights.  I wish the manufacturer Mentioned this in  the description.</li>
            <li> I put in a return request for this item. I didn&#x27;t like this product one bit. It didn&#x27;t make my natural nails any harder. Didn&#x27;t get hard under UV/LED light. Had major air bubbles. Will not reorder this product.</li>
            <li> NEVER RECIVED THEM. I&#x27;M PRETTY. UPSET. WITH. IT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this item before learning the difference between regular gel and soak-off gel, but I tired it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;My middle fingernail got broken, so I used the clear gel and nail form to extend it. The clear gel is thicker than clear soak-off gel, but it feels stronger once it&#x27;s cured. I applied two coats and each coat took only 2 minutes to get cured with a UV lamp.</li>
            <li> I received the three gels on time but when i opened the package the pink gel leaked out got all over the three containers. I had to use the majority of my (already owned) nail cleanser for nearly 20 minutes to try and get it off but they were still sticky afterwards. I ended up putting scotch tape around the containers but they are still sticky and the pink still leaked out somehow but I am not yet sure where.</li>
            <li> Nice staff. I love it.</li>
            <li> very good product excellent</li>
            <li> First, this is a builder gel, it is suppose to be thick. Gels are sticky, even expensive ones, (I&#x27;ve used a few), so don&#x27;t be surprised when this one is.  Okay, biggest con I had was the white needs to be cured in thin layers. I&#x27;ve found that a few opaque gels need this. The clear and pink, which is actually clear, can be applied thicker like a normal builder gel. This product does self level, and if you know how to use gel properly, can be applied to the required thickness, or thinness, that you desire. I barely have to file my nails when done. This product does cure under a 9w uv lamp. It just takes a little longer. Full cure in 2-3 minutes. This product does not adhere well to the natural nail bed. I use IBD bonder which works great, no lifting, and I&#x27;m a problem lifter.  If you have never used before then get a practice finger and practice, practice, practice. Otherwise, excellent for price, good bonder gives you good adherence so get one, can easily do two sets per jar.</li>
            <li> I personally liked it, but have not been spoiled by another brand. All I wanted it for was to extend my natural nails&lt;br /&gt;(2 broke)  just a bit to match my others. It did the job, no burning (as long as bonder was totally dry on my nail). My next purchase is Ibd Gel. I feel like I am pretty good at \\&quot;building\\&quot; to spend a little more money. This is a great product for the cheap price!! You get all three colors, for 8$!! Yes, it is thick, but this type of builder gel does have a higher viscosity than others, it&#x27;s purpose is to \\&quot;build\\&quot; a nail. I just filed it down after it set. I have a 36W UV light.</li>
            <li> I personally did not like it at all</li>
            <li> my pink one came with dirt inside and a hair. Not too happy with product.</li>
            <li> A little slow but it is definitely worth the wait. Price was cheapest that I have found.</li>
            <li> I am glad that i bought these since this was a test run to see if i could get my nails looking nice before going for the pricer IBD gel. only the white would cure. The other two did nothing but make a mess. Even though you could get the nails to look nice they seemed to crack off within 1-4 hours. I don&#x27;t think i will be buying this product again. The shipping was slow but i knew that going in it took about a month to get to the USA.</li>
            <li> Just started doing uv gels nails. I really like it.</li>
            <li> This gel overheats and burns like crazy under the lamp! Every application so far has led to under 24 hrs wear before the nails lift and pop off. Time to get pricier ibd</li>
            <li> Good for building nails . But had a big problem with the delivery and the buyer</li>
            <li> The best gel ever I had for a such a price and speed amazing. It holds forever and I like it so much.thank you</li>
            <li> This UV gel ordered met my expectations. I found that the wattage of the bulb used in the curing lamp determines the&lt;br /&gt;end result. The gel itself is adequate and needs to be cured properly with a bulb higher than 9w. I would order this&lt;br /&gt;product again.</li>
            <li> God product to practice :) And you get a lot of product in the box :)&lt;br /&gt;easy to work with ,but they run to the edges of the nails quickly :(  And they burn a lot :( even when you use a thin lag in the nail :(&lt;br /&gt;But to practice is very good :) and i will by again :)</li>
            <li> Screw Sallys! LOL&lt;br /&gt;This stuff lasts longer than any of sally&#x27;s clear gel! AND it&#x27;s 1/3 the price here on amazon!!&lt;br /&gt;Most of my sets will last around a month to two months now! LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS GEL!!!!</li>
            <li> I received the product as described, wish it came with directions thought.  Thank you appreciate it give a rating of B</li>
            <li> I really like this product I have done several sets of nails with this gel using just a 9v light to cure.  I was also really please with how fast it shipped I will be buying again! Love the price too!</li>
            <li> One canister had leaked in transit.  Gel did not cure at all.  Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Hah! This was a joke. I had a good time laughing at how horrible the product is as it made the oddest shapes on my nail. Its so runny that it would take forever to build on to my nail. The worst product ever. This is a case where its better to spend a little more to get a good product.</li>
            <li> I like these gels because they are cheap and you don&#x27;t want to waste good product on practice hands or fingers I do my nails as well and I use dehydrant and primer but if its on or close to cuticles it does lift the pink looks clear but for the price it is actually better than I thought and it dries upall product seems kinda thick but id rather practice with this than expensive stuff</li>
            <li> I have good experience with this product</li>
            <li> I thought this was a great product.,At a Great price, And Speedy delivery. I would recommend this if you do your own nails. As with anything, do your research first. This is something that takes practice and is not for everyone. Do Not cure with product on skin. Very hard to remove. There are several tutorials on YouTube. I am by no means a professional but I have been doing my own nails for many years. Love the shine and strength it gives my natural nails.</li>
            <li> It does not work. Does not dry adequately. I was very excited to get it. Its not something that any manicurist would want to have in their salon nor for a person wanting to do them at home. Does not bond well.</li>
            <li> Step by step using a 36W UV lamp&lt;br /&gt;1. Prep and buff natural nail.&lt;br /&gt;2. Apply Sina Primer on nail.&lt;br /&gt;3. After appying primer cure for 2 min.&lt;br /&gt;4. Without wiping away primer, take small bead of Gel (clear, or pink) mind you the pink color is basically clear, apply thin layer of Gel and cure 2 min. Repeat this a total of 3 times.&lt;br /&gt;5. After successfully applying your three layers, now you can take the Sina Cleaner and rub off the tacky layer.&lt;br /&gt;6. If you decide not to add nail art, then take the UV Top coat, apply one layer making sure not to get onto the skin and then cure for 2 min. And Without rubbing off tacky layer repeat 3 times.&lt;br /&gt;7. After successfully three layers rub off taky layer with Sina Cleaner and you are done!&lt;br /&gt;8. If you want to do nail art do so after step 5.&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;Without adding nail art I can do a full set of nails in about an hour and with nail art about an hour and a half.&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;Now these instructions might not work for everyone, but after trial and error it is what I have found to work on the nails I do, it is also long lasting, I usually do my moms every 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pure awfulness!  The two fingers I have used this stuff on so far are a mess- sore and breaking out with tiny watery blisters around the cuticle.  Not only do I seem to be having a bad reaction to this stuff, it&#x27;s the worst &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve ever seen or used.  VERY sticky and hard to spread on the nail and takes forever to set/dry!  I have all correct salon equipment and took an hour to do 2 nails!! It takes that long (or shorter) at a nail salon!  I bought this gel to do repairs or extend the life of my gels until I can get to the salon, but not really worth it is my fingers are going to be sore and/or takes to long to fix just one!  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this stuff- you&#x27;ll never get it to spread or dry!!!  One star because I had to!</li>
            <li> very nice product though they do not let you know that you should not use with more than 9 watt lamp if it is used with more than a 9 watt lamp it will cause a very bad heat spike and be very painful.</li>
            <li> Its good ive been doing my nails for years it does fine all except it lifts but other than that its okay!</li>
            <li> It took a while but is ok</li>
            <li> This product is cheap and it shows. It was all over the place when I opened the package. When I went to cure them they burned so bad. Threw them all away!!! I will never buy from this place again.</li>
            <li> The clear and pink are perfect, work wonderfully esp when mixing with clitters.&lt;br /&gt;However the white did not set at all. even after 5 minutes under a uv lamp it was still runny and useless.</li>
            <li> I honestly would have given this product a good four stars had it not been for 1) they sent two pink, one white and no clear 2) the fossilized tiny bug floating in one of the just opened pinks like a scene from Jurassic Park... Ive ordered this product from other vendors before and never had that issue. Not to say the vendors is at fault since it was factory sealed. The quality of the product is not bad, a little runny but you cant expect professional quality for this price. Cures fully in my 9W lamp just takes a little time and with the right priming etc i never get that much lifting. Wish this was soak off but does the job (overlay for my natural nails)</li>
            <li> I was doing my nail extensions with ibd that I bought for $15 at Sally&#x27;s. They would break or fall off and never felt super secure. This package came with 3 times as much product, it&#x27;s only a couple days into my new extensions and they feel much more secure and natural. I have only used the pink one so far (it actually looks pretty much clear) but if the clear and white are as good as it this will be the only gel I&#x27;ll ever need for my extensions. Also good for strengthening natural nails, or mending a cracked nail.</li>
            <li> Product leaks idk why. I had to throw out the clear. Good product though.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price!&lt;br /&gt;Downside is the package is cheap and when i received mine the clear had spilled all over.</li>
