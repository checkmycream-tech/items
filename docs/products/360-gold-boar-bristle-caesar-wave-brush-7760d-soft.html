            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>If you are starting out waving this is the best brush to start out on.</li>
            <li>Makes  your waves more uniform and adds shine to your hair.</li>

            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>This brush helped me to enhance my hair and gave it better texture and connections.</li>
            <li>This brush just out right feels good on your scalp and hair.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s exactly like everyone been telling me about how good the Crown brushes are.</li>
            <li>If you are searching for this product then you are already familiar with the hype it has genreated!</li>
            <li>The bristles on this brush are soft and contours to your head for great feel when brushing.</li>
            <li>I think this brush is very unique in its ability to form fit to your scalp and hair.</li>
            <li>Easy to grip handles makes it effortless.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best softy brush on the market.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t typically write reviews but this brush is simply perfect!</li>
            <li>Luckily I&#x27;m doing ok when it comes to finances but</li>
            <li>overall it is a great brush</li>
            <li>it felt so cheap</li>
            <li>After having a brushing session with this particular brush (after brushing with the medium) I noticed that my hair had a nice shine too it</li>
            <li>But surprised me all the more in polishing and showing my waves even more also helping with the connection.</li>
            <li>Great brush specially for low cuts lays your hair dowm great and the brush is so big that one stroke on brushes ur whole side which is important cause sides is the hardest part to get waves on</li>
            <li>Get this brush right here!</li>
            <li>This is the vest brush on the market hand down, feel good in the hands and head, it&#x27;s very comfortable to hold and anyone can tell it&#x27;s well made.</li>
            <li>Where the medium brush for me is for when you have a nice amount of hair on your head, with the soft</li>
            <li>Let me tell you after reading a lot of reviews about &#x27;hype&#x27; and what not, but there is no hype, a noticeable difference after a quick session with this brush.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak on results yet  because I&#x27;m a first time user, but i can honestly say the results are near!</li>
            <li>Did take a while to be delivered though over a week, maybe I&#x27;m used to stuff on amazon shipping real fast...</li>
            <li>its worth its weight in DIAMONDS..</li>
            <li>shipping was slowww, but definetly worth it.      </li>
            <li>i use this when i got a fresh cut or after i go in with my medium beast</li>
            <li>I you wanna get waves get this brush its worth the buck.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but well worth the money, because you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>worth the buy</li>
            <li>The brush also feels really good on my head due to the contour of it.</li>
            <li>A++ 5 star brush that has an AMAZING feel and leaves my hair actually looking shiny and soft, the way it shapes to your head is also a strong point with this brush, hefty price and its worth every cent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m like meduim length right now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d planned on going to the company&#x27;s website and ordering the med/soft brush just to have another brush in transit while I send this one back, but my time is worth more than the effort it takes to return and receive another $16 product.</li>
            <li>Best brush hands down!!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love w/ pretty much all the Crown Brushes that I have so far, if that tells you anything...</li>
            <li>It happened so fast!</li>
            <li>And actually the ceaser brushes cover more of my head then the handle brushes</li>
            <li>(And that was before I put any product in my hair at all) and over time my connections definitely got better.</li>
            <li>Shipped on time and does exactly what its supposed to.</li>
            <li>First use, I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li>This Crown 360 Gold Ceaser brush does exactly what it says it&#x27;s designed to do, create waves.</li>
            <li>The design of the brush is pure genius and makes brushing actually somewhat enjoyable.</li>
            <li>If you are a TRUE waver, you already know that you need a few different firmness&#x27; to obtain and maintain your 360 waves but this makes a great addition to anyone arsenal.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think i will buy any other kind of brush</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had different soft brushes down through the years &amp; this one seemed to give me the best results of them all.</li>
            <li>: well the only con i have is that my paint came off too easily at the grip of the brush</li>
            <li>&quot; Session is over so I can reap the full benefits of this brush, through a fresh low cut!!!</li>
            <li>The only knock on these brushes is that if you completely lay your palm on the center of the brush while brushing for a while the beautiful craftsman ship of the brush begins to fade.</li>
            <li>My only con is the logo coming off , but Crown Quality products has definitely created a grade A top notch brush!</li>
            <li>Good brush feels a little harder than a soft Diane 8169 and I like the caesar better than the handle crown</li>
            <li>If you are trying to get waves, and dont have time for much brushing, then this is the brush for you.</li>
            <li>its kinda soft but its also suggested that you get a fresh cut.</li>
            <li>This is really a must have brush if you are a waver.</li>
            <li>I recommend anybody that wants trained waves to get this brush</li>
            <li>but it really does.</li>
            <li>Never quit if you really want waves</li>
            <li>Thank you 360 Gold for such a fantastic brush.</li>
            <li>I waited like it was Christmas eve night on these to arrive, as my waves have been progressing very well.</li>
            <li>I ordered this brush, received it in a short period of time and enjoy the way the brush feels and its coverage of the head.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I really do fill like i&#x27;m getting a head massage after I finish working out the waves.</li>
            <li>you can have a low cut or have a nice amount of hair on your head &amp; you get the same results.</li>
            <li>and this brush is the best i&#x27;ve tried hands down absolutely worth the $ about to order the black onyx next</li>
            <li>well the only way you can clean the bristles is by putting it all the way in water and that cracks the finish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve definately have seen greater depth in my wave pattern and the way my hair lays down after removing  my du-rag.</li>
            <li>would have gave this particular brush 4 1/2 stars had it wouldn&#x27;t have came used and in a beaten up box without instructions</li>
            <li>This brush with my normal regiment has enhanced the way my hair looks.</li>
            <li>just wished I would have received a brand new brush</li>
            <li>My right side was my troubled side to wave up, but with these brushes it makes it almost TOO easy to wave up the right side.</li>
            <li>I purchased the medium one prior to this and knew exactly what I was getting.</li>
            <li>If you add up $4.68 for the first brush + $3-4 to send it back + $4.68 to order another brush that equals $12-$14 in shipping costs for a $16 brush, in addition to buying a box and standing in a post office line to return it!!</li>
            <li>Definitely works on any type of hair, exactly what you need to get waves on a any problem areas.</li>
            <li>The only thing that bothers me about the product is my first purchase I got the medium</li>
            <li>It seems to get more of your head than a regular brush and it doesn&#x27;t hurt like heck just to lay your hair down.</li>
            <li>My waves have gone to a whole new level that I didn&#x27;t think was possible.</li>
            <li>and I must say they are worth every single penny!</li>
            <li>B005AVMR28 360 Gold Boar Bristle Caesar Wave Brush # 7760D Soft]]</li>
            <li>Used this brush for a couple days and then tried to use my old wave enforcer...</li>
            <li>After seeing results from the medium that I ordered I went and ordered the soft one.</li>
            <li>My problem is that the brush developed a crack extending from the bristle holes to the end of the brush.</li>
            <li>This brush will deepen your wave pattern and add a natural shine to your hair.</li>
            <li>I will never buy another soft brush unless it is from Robert Watson and the Crown Fam.</li>
            <li>so i dont see this one going anywhere for a pretty long time.</li>
            <li>I got another brush (soft)</li>
            <li>I knew that my Diane&#x27;s could only take me so far without me having major brush sessions, which I really dont like brushing for 15-20 minutes at a time.</li>
            <li>ive ben usin it for 3 days and got 360 waves already i definetliy recommend this brush for serious wavers and im definetly going to buy more cqp products</li>
            <li>Just wet your hair with a hot towel, brush, then put on durag and you will start to see the improvement.</li>
            <li>my brush obviously was used even though it claimed the condition was new</li>
            <li>Soft bristles were too soft &amp; I didn&#x27;t have a return packing slip to get the medium bristle brush in the future a return slip would be helpful.</li>
            <li>The way it contours to the shape of your head is like no other.</li>
            <li>, they thought I was dumb for spending about $20.00 or more dollars (shipping) for a brush when I already had three.</li>
            <li>This is only the soft brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more stiff than your typical soft brush though.</li>

            <li> This is the vest brush on the market hand down, feel good in the hands and head, it&#x27;s very comfortable to hold and anyone can tell it&#x27;s well made.</li>
            <li> Where the medium brush for me is for when you have a nice amount of hair on your head, with the soft</li>
            <li> Let me tell you after reading a lot of reviews about &#x27;hype&#x27; and what not, but there is no hype, a noticeable difference after a quick session with this brush.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak on results yet  because I&#x27;m a first time user, but i can honestly say the results are near!</li>
            <li> Did take a while to be delivered though over a week, maybe I&#x27;m used to stuff on amazon shipping real fast...</li>
            <li> its worth its weight in DIAMONDS..</li>
            <li> shipping was slowww, but definetly worth it.      </li>
            <li> i use this when i got a fresh cut or after i go in with my medium beast</li>
            <li> I you wanna get waves get this brush its worth the buck.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey, but well worth the money, because you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> worth the buy</li>
            <li> The brush also feels really good on my head due to the contour of it.</li>
            <li> A++ 5 star brush that has an AMAZING feel and leaves my hair actually looking shiny and soft, the way it shapes to your head is also a strong point with this brush, hefty price and its worth every cent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m like meduim length right now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d planned on going to the company&#x27;s website and ordering the med/soft brush just to have another brush in transit while I send this one back, but my time is worth more than the effort it takes to return and receive another $16 product.</li>
            <li> Best brush hands down!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love w/ pretty much all the Crown Brushes that I have so far, if that tells you anything...</li>
            <li> It happened so fast!</li>
            <li> And actually the ceaser brushes cover more of my head then the handle brushes</li>
            <li> (And that was before I put any product in my hair at all) and over time my connections definitely got better.</li>
            <li> Shipped on time and does exactly what its supposed to.</li>
            <li> First use, I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> This Crown 360 Gold Ceaser brush does exactly what it says it&#x27;s designed to do, create waves.</li>
            <li> The design of the brush is pure genius and makes brushing actually somewhat enjoyable.</li>
            <li> If you are a TRUE waver, you already know that you need a few different firmness&#x27; to obtain and maintain your 360 waves but this makes a great addition to anyone arsenal.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think i will buy any other kind of brush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had different soft brushes down through the years &amp; this one seemed to give me the best results of them all.</li>
            <li> : well the only con i have is that my paint came off too easily at the grip of the brush</li>
            <li> &quot; Session is over so I can reap the full benefits of this brush, through a fresh low cut!!!</li>
            <li> The only knock on these brushes is that if you completely lay your palm on the center of the brush while brushing for a while the beautiful craftsman ship of the brush begins to fade.</li>
            <li> My only con is the logo coming off , but Crown Quality products has definitely created a grade A top notch brush!</li>
            <li> Good brush feels a little harder than a soft Diane 8169 and I like the caesar better than the handle crown</li>
            <li> If you are trying to get waves, and dont have time for much brushing, then this is the brush for you.</li>
            <li> its kinda soft but its also suggested that you get a fresh cut.</li>
            <li> This is really a must have brush if you are a waver.</li>
            <li> I recommend anybody that wants trained waves to get this brush</li>
            <li> but it really does.</li>
            <li> Never quit if you really want waves</li>
            <li> Thank you 360 Gold for such a fantastic brush.</li>
            <li> I waited like it was Christmas eve night on these to arrive, as my waves have been progressing very well.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush, received it in a short period of time and enjoy the way the brush feels and its coverage of the head.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I really do fill like i&#x27;m getting a head massage after I finish working out the waves.</li>
            <li> you can have a low cut or have a nice amount of hair on your head &amp; you get the same results.</li>
            <li> and this brush is the best i&#x27;ve tried hands down absolutely worth the $ about to order the black onyx next</li>
            <li> well the only way you can clean the bristles is by putting it all the way in water and that cracks the finish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definately have seen greater depth in my wave pattern and the way my hair lays down after removing  my du-rag.</li>
            <li> would have gave this particular brush 4 1/2 stars had it wouldn&#x27;t have came used and in a beaten up box without instructions</li>
            <li> This brush with my normal regiment has enhanced the way my hair looks.</li>
            <li> just wished I would have received a brand new brush</li>
            <li> My right side was my troubled side to wave up, but with these brushes it makes it almost TOO easy to wave up the right side.</li>
            <li> I purchased the medium one prior to this and knew exactly what I was getting.</li>
            <li> If you add up $4.68 for the first brush + $3-4 to send it back + $4.68 to order another brush that equals $12-$14 in shipping costs for a $16 brush, in addition to buying a box and standing in a post office line to return it!!</li>
            <li> Definitely works on any type of hair, exactly what you need to get waves on a any problem areas.</li>
            <li> The only thing that bothers me about the product is my first purchase I got the medium</li>
            <li> It seems to get more of your head than a regular brush and it doesn&#x27;t hurt like heck just to lay your hair down.</li>
            <li> My waves have gone to a whole new level that I didn&#x27;t think was possible.</li>
            <li> and I must say they are worth every single penny!</li>
            <li> B005AVMR28 360 Gold Boar Bristle Caesar Wave Brush # 7760D Soft]]</li>
            <li> Used this brush for a couple days and then tried to use my old wave enforcer...</li>
            <li> After seeing results from the medium that I ordered I went and ordered the soft one.</li>
            <li> My problem is that the brush developed a crack extending from the bristle holes to the end of the brush.</li>
            <li> This brush will deepen your wave pattern and add a natural shine to your hair.</li>
            <li> I will never buy another soft brush unless it is from Robert Watson and the Crown Fam.</li>
            <li> so i dont see this one going anywhere for a pretty long time.</li>
            <li> I got another brush (soft)</li>
            <li> I knew that my Diane&#x27;s could only take me so far without me having major brush sessions, which I really dont like brushing for 15-20 minutes at a time.</li>
            <li> ive ben usin it for 3 days and got 360 waves already i definetliy recommend this brush for serious wavers and im definetly going to buy more cqp products</li>
            <li> Just wet your hair with a hot towel, brush, then put on durag and you will start to see the improvement.</li>
            <li> my brush obviously was used even though it claimed the condition was new</li>
            <li> Soft bristles were too soft &amp; I didn&#x27;t have a return packing slip to get the medium bristle brush in the future a return slip would be helpful.</li>
            <li> The way it contours to the shape of your head is like no other.</li>
            <li> , they thought I was dumb for spending about $20.00 or more dollars (shipping) for a brush when I already had three.</li>
            <li> This is only the soft brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more stiff than your typical soft brush though.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair and been using this brush with the blk hard brush and just oil, and no pomade</li>
            <li> then on th same side of the paper it says \\&quot;brush maitenance\\&quot;:rinse bristles with water and dry or take out loose hairs with a comb.</li>
            <li> Only down fall is the price, it doesn&#x27;t need to be so expensive, the quality is unmatched and they don&#x27;t use any more quality materials than other manufacturers.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this brush to serious wavers, read tons of reviews and watched several videos on you tube about these brushes.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m starting to see waves it had only been little over 2 weeks...</li>
            <li> The price is a bit to swallow but after brushing my head with this brush for only a few minutes I was hooked and totally understood.</li>
            <li> I could actually hear it splitting when I put it down and started watching tv.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought the soft, soft/medium (premium), medium, and hard brushes</li>
            <li> The brush is not to hard and not to soft</li>
            <li> but it was my fault my hands were wet...</li>
            <li> It only took a week or too before they would come to my place and ALWAYS pick up my brush and brush their hair a few times just to see and feel the differene.</li>
            <li> Just what my son expected he keeps it close to him at all times.</li>
            <li> I can also use the pouch which helps since im in the military</li>
            <li> This brush makes your waves deeper and stretched out Hands down a flabbergasting product.</li>
            <li> I would recommend getting the hard get the medium coarse one thats firm enough.</li>
            <li> and I have 2 other CQP brushes as well.</li>
            <li> Any other time that I&#x27;ve had a problem with an order from Amazon, either I pay for return shipping and receive a replacement item at no additional shipping cost, or they just send a replacement item.</li>
            <li> Also be prepared to wait after purchasing, it took mine 14 days to arrive other than that its a keeper.</li>
            <li> new to the wave game</li>
            <li> CQP Bring back that \\&quot;Hard</li>
            <li> I am a believer and will be purchasing the hard one and the regular medium to support the growth of my wave pattern.</li>
            <li> and it didnt feel that much different from one of the hard brushes I had.  </li>
            <li> The medium one brush thick hair giid and short hair.</li>
            <li> i go in with this just a little bit...</li>
            <li> dead on some spots in my hair</li>
            <li> Im looking towards the medium, and hard bristle brush also.</li>
            <li> I intend to purchase the medium and hard brushes as well</li>
            <li> After you apply that hard or medium brush to those waves you HAVE TO put the softie on there.</li>
            <li> Not one complaint.</li>
            <li> If you are serious about having 360 waves the crown brushes are where its at.  </li>
            <li> If you are serious about waves this brush is a must have.</li>
            <li> matter of Fact buy them all if your serious about getting Waves!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Brush, step yo game up and get one.</li>
            <li> to charge outrageous prices for a brush is sad.  </li>

            <li> Great brush specially for low cuts lays your hair dowm great and the brush is so big that one stroke on brushes ur whole side which is important cause sides is the hardest part to get waves on but i suggest as soon as u get it tape the logo so it wont fade off.

            <li> Because the brush is good and I will love to buy another one because it&#x27;s just to gud to be true</li>
            <li> MY rating for this 360 gold brush is a  5 ANYBODY that is trying to get waves and those of you that have waves this brush will take you to the next level!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This brush feels good. It makes you want to brush your hair. Its good for wave building. I would recommend getting the hard get the medium coarse one thats firm enough. The medium one brush thick hair giid and short hair. I you wanna get waves get this brush its worth the buck.</li>
            <li> Ordered this brush back in July when it came the box was smashed it didn&#x27;t come with instructions and it looked as if had tape on it and someone removed it my brush obviously was used even though it claimed the condition was new which was a piss off don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t return it I ended up using it one day and it does work well just wished I would have received a brand new brush would have gave this particular brush 4 1/2 stars had it wouldn&#x27;t have came used and in a beaten up box without instructions</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of any cons. At the end of the day a brush is a brush...but this seems to be so much more. Used this brush for a couple days and then tried to use my old wave enforcer...it felt so cheap and it didn&#x27;t have the same effect. This is only the soft brush. I intend to purchase the medium and hard brushes as well soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received my brush and showed my friends, they thought I was dumb for spending about $20.00 or more dollars (shipping) for a brush when I already had three. It only took a week or too before they would come to my place and ALWAYS pick up my brush and brush their hair a few times just to see and feel the differene. Now, they both want me to order them one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So satisfied!</li>
            <li> I purchased the medium one prior to this and knew exactly what I was getting. But surprised me all the more in polishing and showing my waves even more also helping with the connection.</li>
            <li> Just what my son expected he keeps it close to him at all times. Thank you 360 Gold for such a fantastic brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is the DRE Beats of brushes. I could not be more impressed with this brush, it is a must have for all TRUE wavers.</li>
            <li> Good brush feels a little harder than a soft Diane 8169 and I like the caesar better than the handle crown</li>
            <li> This brush is a must have for wavers out there. The bristles on this brush are soft and contours to your head for great feel when brushing. Will be buying more CQP brushes!</li>
            <li> This brush goes in!!! I&#x27;m like meduim length right now and this brush still helps to stimulate the devolopment of my waves... Can&#x27;t wait til&#x27; this 8 week \\&quot;Wolfing\\&quot; Session is over so I can reap the full benefits of this brush, through a fresh low cut!!! I love the color, the contour of the bristles, and the Logo!! This brush here, man.. I&#x27;m in love w/ pretty much all the Crown Brushes that I have so far, if that tells you anything... Buy this brush. matter of Fact buy them all if your serious about getting Waves!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;@ CQP Bring back that \\&quot;Hard White\\&quot;!!!</li>
            <li> new to the wave game and this brush is the best i&#x27;ve tried hands down absolutely worth the $ about to order the black onyx next</li>
            <li> I love this  brush and would recommend to anyone wanting to improve or get waves. It has a nice shape and it grips your hair very nicely...I can also use the pouch which helps since im in the military</li>
            <li> I waited like it was Christmas eve night on these to arrive, as my waves have been progressing very well. I knew that my Diane&#x27;s could only take me so far without me having major brush sessions, which I really dont like brushing for 15-20 minutes at a time. Let me tell you after reading a lot of reviews about &#x27;hype&#x27; and what not, but there is no hype, a noticeable difference after a quick session with this brush. Only down fall is the price, it doesn&#x27;t need to be so expensive, the quality is unmatched and they don&#x27;t use any more quality materials than other manufacturers. I think its just matter of standing out by the price. Like i say, product is five stars, price isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles were too soft &amp; I didn&#x27;t have a return packing slip to get the medium bristle brush in the future a return slip would be helpful.</li>
            <li> Have about 7-8 brushs that lost there job. Put it like that lol. Only brushing with CQP from now on. Must have for Any waver.</li>
            <li> After seeing results from the medium that I ordered I went and ordered the soft one. Once again I was impressed. I&#x27;ve had different soft brushes down through the years &amp; this one seemed to give me the best results of them all. After having a brushing session with this particular brush (after brushing with the medium) I noticed that my hair had a nice shine too it (And that was before I put any product in my hair at all) and over time my connections definitely got better. This was the perfect compliment to my medium brush. Where the medium brush for me is for when you have a nice amount of hair on your head, with the soft you can have a low cut or have a nice amount of hair on your head &amp; you get the same results. Fantastic brush!</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing! It&#x27;s a little more stiff than your typical soft brush though. That&#x27;s no big deal though.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable.  My sons use it on their hair. Use on tender headed and short hair to help with 360 waves.  I love this product</li>
            <li> Best used on the shortest hair while trying to get waves (use the Medium brush for longer hair). Excellent results.</li>
            <li> If you are starting out waving this is the best brush to start out on. I have straight hair and been using this brush with the blk hard brush and just oil, and no pomade and I&#x27;m starting to see waves it had only been little over 2 weeks... Did take a while to be delivered though over a week, maybe I&#x27;m used to stuff on amazon shipping real fast... Keep brushing</li>
            <li> Shipped on time and does exactly what its supposed to. Makes  your waves more uniform and adds shine to your hair.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome, but this is another example of exploitation of the target audience.  Luckily I&#x27;m doing ok when it comes to finances but to charge outrageous prices for a brush is sad.  Please reconsider the price Crown Quality Products.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing. It definitely gave me waves faster than using my regular. The brush is shape differently and I can feel it on my scout. Amazing brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is definitely AWESOME! The look, the way it contours to your head, and how it lays your hair. It&#x27;s pricey, but well worth the money, because you get what you pay for. I can&#x27;t speak on results yet  because I&#x27;m a first time user, but i can honestly say the results are near!</li>
            <li> This is the vest brush on the market hand down, feel good in the hands and head, it&#x27;s very comfortable to hold and anyone can tell it&#x27;s well made. Not one complaint.</li>
            <li> Before I got this brush my waves were ok...dead on some spots in my hair but this brush has the perfect consistency and good for low cuts and getting your waves to stay in.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush, received it in a short period of time and enjoy the way the brush feels and its coverage of the head. My problem is that the brush developed a crack extending from the bristle holes to the end of the brush. To the company&#x27;s credit they offered to refund the price of the product after I return the brush, but this means that I have to buy another brush, pay for shipping, and deal with the post office. If you add up $4.68 for the first brush + $3-4 to send it back + $4.68 to order another brush that equals $12-$14 in shipping costs for a $16 brush, in addition to buying a box and standing in a post office line to return it!! Any other time that I&#x27;ve had a problem with an order from Amazon, either I pay for return shipping and receive a replacement item at no additional shipping cost, or they just send a replacement item. I&#x27;d planned on going to the company&#x27;s website and ordering the med/soft brush just to have another brush in transit while I send this one back, but my time is worth more than the effort it takes to return and receive another $16 product. I&#x27;ll probably just use this until it breaks then decide whether I want to buy another one or just go back to my Diane.</li>
            <li> Great brush, after 2 weeks of brushn and letting my hair grow out my waves were on point.</li>
            <li> I think this brush is very unique in its ability to form fit to your scalp and hair. I&#x27;ve definately have seen greater depth in my wave pattern and the way my hair lays down after removing  my du-rag. I think this brush does what the description of it entails. This brush will deepen your wave pattern and add a natural shine to your hair. ALso I think this brush is a bit firmer then the premimiun medium crown quality brush, but every ones sensitivity in their scalp is different. this brush works on shorter length hair as well as hair that has been growing for several weeks.I am a believer and will be purchasing the hard one and the regular medium to support the growth of my wave pattern. This brush just out right feels good on your scalp and hair.The only knock on these brushes is that if you completely lay your palm on the center of the brush while brushing for a while the beautiful craftsman ship of the brush begins to fade. Also be prepared to wait after purchasing, it took mine 14 days to arrive other than that its a keeper.</li>
            <li> This brush makes your waves deeper and stretched out Hands down a flabbergasting product. I will never buy another soft brush unless it is from Robert Watson and the Crown Fam.</li>
            <li> A++ 5 star brush that has an AMAZING feel and leaves my hair actually looking shiny and soft, the way it shapes to your head is also a strong point with this brush, hefty price and its worth every cent. I would buy another one if i had to but the quality is amazing so i dont see this one going anywhere for a pretty long time. Ive already recommended it to plenty friends and select family</li>
            <li> Mannnnn, let me tell you something. Get this brush right here! After you apply that hard or medium brush to those waves you HAVE TO put the softie on there. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I really do fill like i&#x27;m getting a head massage after I finish working out the waves. The fact that it adds that shine in you hair... You won&#x27;t understand until you get it. First use, I&#x27;m hooked. It seems to get more of your head than a regular brush and it doesn&#x27;t hurt like heck just to lay your hair down. Team CQP ALL DAY!</li>
            <li> Must have for the wavey guys! The curved bristles hug the head great! And the carry bag is a nice bonus! Best brush hands down!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love it my boys love  my wife loves it to best brush out there I recommend this brush to to anyone who want deep waves</li>
            <li> great product. such a wonder on your head. will do my waves wonders i hope. i love this product. worth the buy</li>
            <li> This Crown 360 Gold Ceaser brush does exactly what it says it&#x27;s designed to do, create waves. I guess it&#x27;s the contoured shape that covers every side of of your head when brushing.</li>
            <li> Definitely works on any type of hair, exactly what you need to get waves on a any problem areas. Easy to grip handles makes it effortless.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Probably one of the best brushes I&#x27;ve used.  I am a licensed barber so I try to stay up on the newest products.  I say they are a step above the Diane products.  The only thing that bothers me about the product is my first purchase I got the medium and it didnt feel that much different from one of the hard brushes I had.  I looked at the instructions and it said to run luke warm water over the bristles....I did and the brush split.  I could actually hear it splitting when I put it down and started watching tv.  I sent it back and Amazon/Crown rectified the problem ad sent me my money back.  I got another brush (soft) and I am very happy.  I plan to get the handled one next.  I will recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> I cut and style my own hair. Low curly hair waves) has always been my forte. This brush helped me to enhance my hair and gave it better texture and connections. This brush with my normal regiment has enhanced the way my hair looks.</li>
            <li> Best brush ever! ive ben usin it for 3 days and got 360 waves already i definetliy recommend this brush for serious wavers and im definetly going to buy more cqp products</li>
