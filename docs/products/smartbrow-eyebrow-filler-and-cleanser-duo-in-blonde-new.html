            <li>Except for that, it&#x27;s the best eyebrow filler I&#x27;ve found for my very light eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Amazing!  </li>
            <li>And it will stay on perfectly for two days or more.  </li>
            <li>Nice to have red/blonde eyebrows again to frame my face!</li>
            <li>It is a good product, although you need to practice on how to use it.</li>
            <li>but if you do there are some really good YouTube vids on how to apply it.</li>
            <li>I ordered this from another store I saw on FB and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I am fair and after a life of hypothyroidism, have the daintiest blond eyebrows.</li>
            <li>It works good</li>
            <li>Good for the &amp;#34;big, drawn-on, crunchy&amp;#34</li>
            <li>takes getting used to - and with my tremors can be a challenge - but looks good and lasts until washed off.  </li>
            <li>I really LOVED this product.</li>
            <li>This is really good for in between tints.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li>And she was so excited about the results she showed me, and her eyebrows LOOKED GOOD!!!</li>
            <li>When I saw the tutorial on how to use SmartBrow Filler, I thought it would for sure be a great product for me.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already ordered 2 more!  </li>
            <li>My eye brows have never looked better!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product and I don&#x27;t want to be without it.  </li>
            <li>It is otherwise a nice product.</li>
            <li>The color matches my blonde hair perfectly, and it does a great job of filling in and shaping.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if they sold the two items separately.</li>
            <li>But this product is spectacular.</li>
            <li>; color is too warm and &amp;#34;gold&amp;#34; to blend.</li>
            <li>It dries nicely and truly does stay on until you take it off.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s included.</li>
            <li>I found it very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Although the color is great and I love the way it looks on, they are selling it to you as if it were a waterproof product that needs a special cleanser for removal.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, and I get better results every time I use it!</li>
            <li>It is the first product I have ever used that gives my scanty eyebrows even color and great shape.</li>
            <li>But I do have to say the color is great - exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Product is good but be lucky if it lasts a month.</li>
            <li>I use cheaper brow products that work better, so I&#x27;m returning the product.  </li>
            <li>I like it better than the brand I used before (Wonder Brow).</li>
            <li>Love the color and stay-on power.</li>
            <li>I am glad I didn&#x27;t b/c</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Blonde color is perfect for highlighted brown hair.  </li>
            <li>Might be great for someone who doesn&#x27;t have much to fill in I guess.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and I will stay with it.  </li>
            <li>I am so pleased with outcome after using this product.  </li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s tempting to want to  be in a hurry and just get those eyebrows filled in!</li>
            <li>I love this eyebrow product.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I do better with a pencil</li>
            <li>A Maybelline pencil and an eyebrow brush work way better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m comparing it to an eyebrow pencil that I&#x27;ve used for years and this is waaaayyy better.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to achieve these kinds of results with a pencil.</li>
            <li>I now love it.</li>
            <li>I bought this product in Blonde from Dermastore and it is perfect.</li>
            <li>I decided to order more before the price went up</li>
            <li>Seems to be more of a brow wax</li>
            <li>Anastasia Brow Powder is so much more flattering.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>my favorite) to fill in &#x27;hairless&#x27; areas.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the color &amp; filler doesn&#x27;t work, meaning the color went on ok if you can draw, but the filler fibers had nothing to cling to.  </li>
            <li>If some one out there knows of anything that would work on &amp;#34;no brows&amp;#34; I sure like to hear about it.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product because it&#x27;s the first time in many years that my eye brows look normal.</li>
            <li>If you have full brows, and need consistent color - it&#x27;s very nice.</li>
            <li>I am much better off using the fine line &amp;#34;tattoo&amp;#34; eyebrow filler pen.</li>
            <li>The blonde color works perfectly with my hair color and original brows.  </li>
            <li>The provided cleaner does a very good job with just a tiny dab.</li>
            <li>We are nearing our 50&#x27;s, so looking for something natural, and it did look great on her.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>The product is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Make sure brows are clean with no moisturizer on it.</li>
            <li>BEST EYEBROW MAKEUP HANDS DOWN</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the fine line filler bc</li>
            <li>The color is fine for my my blonde/light brown/grey eyebrows.</li>
            <li>: 1) more colors (in cool tones) and 2) being cruelty free.</li>
            <li>If you like super prominent brows though, you may prefer the darker color.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m a believer in coloring your eyebrows if they are super light!</li>
            <li>I am able to achieve great full brows which make me look younger.</li>
            <li>I love the applicator and the cleanser is fantastic for quick removal</li>
            <li>You might as well buy a cheap eye brow pencil, because that&#x27;s all this is.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product.  </li>
            <li>However it does give you fabulous brows.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s just one more reason to feel good about paying the extra $ for this makeup.</li>
            <li>The good news is I returned the product to amazon with no trouble and prompt refund.  </li>
            <li>It is pricey, but it is worth it for me not to have disappearing eyebrows!</li>
            <li>It certainly isn&#x27;t worth the money to me!</li>
            <li>Great item- fills in where needed, also lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>I use the cleaner goop which comes with every wand  to clean my brows after I put on my foundation, to prepare the brow for the product.  </li>
            <li>LOVE SMART BROW.</li>
            <li>So I was super excited to try this product out.</li>
            <li>It needs practice to fully realize how amazing  and natural it can look.  </li>
            <li>This product works better than I expected, very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I have one brow with a good-size bald patch (scar), and one brow that is full but graying hair.  </li>
            <li>My full brows stay in place after 10 hours walking around theme parks, no</li>
            <li>The application is so easy and my brows look so much more natural than they did with the pencil.  </li>
            <li>Less is more and you can always add more if you prefer a more opaque</li>
            <li>Please just make more colors in cooler tones (ash blondes, ash browns, and hellooo, how about a gray for those of us most likely to lose our eyebrows!?)  </li>
            <li>I love this product, but am looking for a substitute because of the high price.</li>
            <li>Product works pretty well, but you have to use a light hand when applying this</li>
            <li>Definitely more &#x27;sweat proof&#x27; than a normal eyebrow pencil, but if you wipe your face with a towel...</li>
            <li>It also stays on all day without smearing - which is a first for me!  </li>
            <li>The only reason I give it 2 stars is the color is nice.</li>
            <li>nobody knows but boy have people taked about how fresh faced</li>
            <li>I am easily able to achieve the look of a professional.  </li>
            <li>I love the ease of use of this product and the results are quite natural looking.</li>
            <li>It did take a few applications before I got the hang of using both of the products before my brows looked the way natural brows do, but this is the best brow product I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I think it also may possibly depend on your own brows and hair texture/color.  </li>
            <li>I do not believe it is worth what it costs.</li>
            <li>It comes right off in the shower.  </li>
            <li>and she was right</li>
            <li>just the right amount of color to enhance  my sparse brows.</li>
            <li>Comes right off in water.</li>
            <li>In our Florida humidity, brow pencils and powders fade and wipe right off.</li>
            <li>Filling the right one in with eyebrow pencils just never looked right.</li>
            <li>It does take some practice and I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using this for the first time when getting ready for an important event or photos.</li>
            <li>I had refused to buy this product for a year because of so many reviews saying that it doesn&#x27;t stay put--and I&#x27;d been down that road so many times before that</li>
            <li>I have light blonde hair and really light eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>I was afraid it&#x27;s going to be too light, but it&#x27;s perfect..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using an eyebrow pencil for about the last 10 years, but as the eyebrow hair loss is more noticeable, my brows have that distinctly \\&quot;penciled in\\&quot; look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural brunette with a fair complexion and use the Blonde.</li>
            <li>I found one product that looked natural, BUT it comes right off if touched even lightly by anything.</li>
            <li>In the shower, I didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; around my eyebrows and very gently washed.</li>
            <li>Color ordered was too light, but can get a better result using lash or other brow pencils.</li>
            <li>Stays on the whole day!</li>
            <li>it for the reduced price first to see if it works for you.</li>
            <li>and I really like this duo!</li>
            <li>She first tried it, didn&#x27;t like it, but then she learned how to apply it, and NOW SHE LOVES IT.  </li>
            <li>I am so in love with the color if the blonde formuka...</li>
            <li>I love the idea of not having to do my eyebrows daily</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying the blonde color to see if that is a bit more forgiving</li>
            <li>It is definitely not an eyebrow filler but more like a liquid eyebrow pencil.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased the blond color (same as my pencil)</li>
            <li>Love this product and will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>the blond color is exactly right and matched my coloring very well.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, however the blonde shade is far too dark.</li>
            <li>Went from no eyebrows to natural looking (right color too) eyebrows!</li>
            <li>The SmartBrow filler comes off easily with regular makeup remover.</li>
            <li>but it goes on easy enough and stays on.  </li>
            <li>It comes off in hot water whenever I take a shower without even touching my face - even trying to avoid getting my eyebrows wet, in fact.  </li>
            <li>With the application of Smart Brow</li>
            <li>I was suspicious of how smart row would work.</li>
            <li>but I guess that is why they give you the smart brow remover...</li>
            <li>Great to cover up those white brow hairs that make me look faded and grabs onto the fine pale hairs at the outside of your brow.  </li>
            <li>I made huge mistakes when I was younger in removing too much of my brows and have been living with trying to compensate ever since.  </li>
            <li>The bald spot was very noticeable.  </li>
            <li>The end with the liner tip works very well however</li>
            <li>the brush end has way too much product on it.</li>
            <li>I have very sparse brows.</li>
            <li>I have eyebrows which are very sparse on the temple side of both brows.</li>
            <li>Very gloppy.</li>
            <li>now I really like the brow filler .</li>
            <li>I really like this product, but keep in mind that it&#x27;s darker then it appears.</li>
            <li>I tried to be neutral because this isn&#x27;t really about the product, which sounds sketchy at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t see the difference in this and the powder I use.</li>
            <li>This product looks like real hair on your brows, and is not comparable to any pencil.</li>
            <li>my whole life</li>
            <li>The whole reason I got this product was to be used as a filler.</li>
            <li>Cost too much for a one day wearing</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t look as old because your brows look more like those of a younger version of yourself!</li>
            <li>I tried both the blond and brunette colors of SmartBrow and felt the blonde looked more natural.  </li>
            <li>I actually like to darken them slightly more than their natural color and almost went with the brunette color.</li>
            <li>Wow I&#x27;m so glad I finally tried SmartBrow.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different brow liners and none have given me the coverage for the &amp;#34;bald spots&amp;#34; or looked as natural as this.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised; the BLONDE smartbrow looks just great on me, and unlike the other poster said, it takes two or three showers to wash off if I don&#x27;t explicitly remove them.  </li>
            <li>Not any better than any other eyebrow product.  </li>
            <li>I have very light brown to blond eyebrows and this is way too dark and did not apply the way it was portrayed.</li>
            <li>You know, it really bites getting older and</li>
            <li>but I chose the blonde version, which was exactly the right choice.</li>
            <li>Previously I had used pencils, but this product is much easier to use and fills in better.</li>
            <li>Excellent eyebrow color but went with blonde because brown was too dark even with dark brown hair.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and a real bargain because you get two products in one- the brush applicator to coat your hairs and then the other thin brush applicator to fill in the light spots.  </li>
            <li>think for those complaining about the product coming off too easily, one suggestion I&#x27;d make would be to make sure that they are VERY careful when applying face moisturizer, be VERY careful to avoid the brow area.  </li>
            <li>As long as my skin is clean and moisturizer free, I think this product adheres wonderfully!&lt;br /&gt;Finally, as I said before I have to be careful not to put on too much of the brunette color</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>product is a little more than I would spend for an eyebrow pencil, but I feel it lasted longer because I didn&#x27;t need to reapply.</li>
            <li>I bought the Blonde Wunderbrow2 to compare and found it too dark for my tastes and the applicator paint brush is too thick for a natural look, though the Wunderbrow comes with an excellent dry brow brush and contains lots more product.</li>
            <li>The principle is good, but I&#x27;m not using it due to the &amp;#34;blond&amp;#34; being dark brown.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LIVE this oridyct.  </li>
            <li>However, I can live with that and it hasn&#x27;t been an issue.</li>
            <li>my new fav beauty find</li>
            <li>It clung to the hair very well, but the skin was a whole different story.</li>
            <li>The thing is, if you don&#x27;t have much in the way of eyebrows, this product isn&#x27;t going to create brows that look like you suddenly sprouted real eyebrow hairs.  </li>
            <li>is light enough not to overwhelm my light complexion and dark enough</li>
            <li>and when I&#x27;ve been consistent with progesterone cream, my sleep and eyebrows have come back.  </li>
            <li>but you can purchase it through The Derm Store for 19.99;  the exact same product.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last any longer and is pretty well worn off by the time I go to bed.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s no more unnatural looking than the pencil and slightly better.</li>
            <li>it actually rubs off the first day.</li>
            <li>Fills in my eyebrows while still keeping them natural looking!  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t mean to get blonde, but I have very fine brows, so it works out!  </li>
            <li>Hi, I have dark natural blond which is hennaed and basically looks like a light auburn.  </li>
            <li>I think it makes me younger; I tend to go pretty natural.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little practice at first to get it to look just right, but take your time and play with it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the brunette and as long as I&#x27;m careful not to apply too much, it look fabulous and natural!  </li>
            <li>If you are very active and are hoping that this will last through sweating and showering, I don&#x27;t think you will be pleased.</li>
            <li>It takes a little practice to get the hang of using it but for people with really light eyebrows</li>
            <li>I love how this produce works however, the price is too high for such a small amount.</li>
            <li>I currently am using a new one for the liner part and an older one for the brush part because I don&#x27;t like a lot of the color from the brush.</li>
            <li>Not cheap but will make me happy for at least a year.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t completely gone and I just had to touch up</li>
            <li>Natural looking and lasts for hours.</li>
            <li>and looks natural.  </li>
            <li>I lost my eyebrows to chemo 10 years ago or at least most of them</li>
            <li>So as far as I&#x27;m concerned it&#x27;s water resistant.  </li>
            <li>and it does look natural.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product.  </li>
            <li>My brows are darker than my hair but have thinned considerably.  </li>
            <li>It does not stay on as well as described, nor does it produce a natural looking brow.  </li>
            <li>With the combination of the two, I get the best/most natural looking eyebrows...</li>
            <li>This product works well on the full brow, and it is long lasting (I slept in it - no problems).  </li>
            <li>Thick and goofy product.  </li>
            <li>As a young child, I had an accident that left a scar in the middle of my right eye brow</li>
            <li>It does take a little practice but it is totally worth it!  </li>
            <li>Keep practicing - clean the brush a little before apply it and will work easier on brows.</li>
            <li>There is a slight learning curve but if make up is your friend you will find it easy enough to apply.</li>
            <li>with the two-step process, though using both steps is essential for anything near a decent look.</li>
            <li>However the other end, was useful in applying the color to the hair itself.</li>
            <li>have light brownish hair and bought the Dark Blonde since that&#x27;s the color I use for the Maybelline pencil.  </li>
            <li>Will try other reviewer&#x27;s tip of blotting right after applying.  </li>
            <li>I am light blonde with slightly darker eyebrows.</li>
            <li>It is, as many have stated, not good for patchy brows.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a blonde and this color is a little too light.</li>
            <li>SmartBrow gives me a very natural look -- at last!</li>
            <li>I can create amazing looks, from thin to fuller brows, with no effort!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really find it as long lasting as they say.</li>
            <li>and I use regular face wash, no heavy make-up removal type stuff.</li>
            <li>I was surprised actually</li>
            <li>Looks natural enough and I would purchase again.</li>
            <li>I am 68 years old and thus my eyebrows are getting thinner and thinner and not in the same places.</li>
            <li>They actually look natural.</li>
            <li>Feels a little sticky at first</li>
            <li>I have minimal brows, but this fills in so naturally!!</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t take my previous eyebrows off with their cleaner or any other special cleaner.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>

            <li> great product.</li>
            <li> I put this on, people comment on how great I look.  </li>
            <li> You know, pencils are great, but this stuff lasts all day and night.</li>
            <li> Except for that, it&#x27;s the best eyebrow filler I&#x27;ve found for my very light eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Amazing!  </li>
            <li> And it will stay on perfectly for two days or more.  </li>
            <li> Nice to have red/blonde eyebrows again to frame my face!</li>
            <li> It is a good product, although you need to practice on how to use it.</li>
            <li> but if you do there are some really good YouTube vids on how to apply it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this from another store I saw on FB and loved it.  </li>
            <li> I am fair and after a life of hypothyroidism, have the daintiest blond eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It works good</li>
            <li> Good for the &amp;#34;big, drawn-on, crunchy&amp;#34</li>
            <li> takes getting used to - and with my tremors can be a challenge - but looks good and lasts until washed off.  </li>
            <li> I really LOVED this product.</li>
            <li> This is really good for in between tints.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> And she was so excited about the results she showed me, and her eyebrows LOOKED GOOD!!!</li>
            <li> When I saw the tutorial on how to use SmartBrow Filler, I thought it would for sure be a great product for me.</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> Love this product!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already ordered 2 more!  </li>
            <li> My eye brows have never looked better!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product and I don&#x27;t want to be without it.  </li>
            <li> It is otherwise a nice product.</li>
            <li> The color matches my blonde hair perfectly, and it does a great job of filling in and shaping.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if they sold the two items separately.</li>
            <li> But this product is spectacular.</li>
            <li> ; color is too warm and &amp;#34;gold&amp;#34; to blend.</li>
            <li> It dries nicely and truly does stay on until you take it off.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s included.</li>
            <li> I found it very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Although the color is great and I love the way it looks on, they are selling it to you as if it were a waterproof product that needs a special cleanser for removal.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, and I get better results every time I use it!</li>
            <li> It is the first product I have ever used that gives my scanty eyebrows even color and great shape.</li>
            <li> But I do have to say the color is great - exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Product is good but be lucky if it lasts a month.</li>
            <li> I use cheaper brow products that work better, so I&#x27;m returning the product.  </li>
            <li> I like it better than the brand I used before (Wonder Brow).</li>
            <li> Love the color and stay-on power.</li>
            <li> I am glad I didn&#x27;t b/c</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Blonde color is perfect for highlighted brown hair.  </li>
            <li> Might be great for someone who doesn&#x27;t have much to fill in I guess.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and I will stay with it.  </li>
            <li> I am so pleased with outcome after using this product.  </li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s tempting to want to  be in a hurry and just get those eyebrows filled in!</li>
            <li> I love this eyebrow product.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I do better with a pencil</li>
            <li> A Maybelline pencil and an eyebrow brush work way better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m comparing it to an eyebrow pencil that I&#x27;ve used for years and this is waaaayyy better.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to achieve these kinds of results with a pencil.</li>
            <li> I now love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in Blonde from Dermastore and it is perfect.</li>
            <li> I decided to order more before the price went up</li>
            <li> Seems to be more of a brow wax</li>
            <li> Anastasia Brow Powder is so much more flattering.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> my favorite) to fill in &#x27;hairless&#x27; areas.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the color &amp; filler doesn&#x27;t work, meaning the color went on ok if you can draw, but the filler fibers had nothing to cling to.  </li>
            <li> If some one out there knows of anything that would work on &amp;#34;no brows&amp;#34; I sure like to hear about it.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product because it&#x27;s the first time in many years that my eye brows look normal.</li>
            <li> If you have full brows, and need consistent color - it&#x27;s very nice.</li>
            <li> I am much better off using the fine line &amp;#34;tattoo&amp;#34; eyebrow filler pen.</li>
            <li> The blonde color works perfectly with my hair color and original brows.  </li>
            <li> The provided cleaner does a very good job with just a tiny dab.</li>
            <li> We are nearing our 50&#x27;s, so looking for something natural, and it did look great on her.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> The product is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Make sure brows are clean with no moisturizer on it.</li>
            <li> BEST EYEBROW MAKEUP HANDS DOWN</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the fine line filler bc</li>
            <li> The color is fine for my my blonde/light brown/grey eyebrows.</li>
            <li> : 1) more colors (in cool tones) and 2) being cruelty free.</li>
            <li> If you like super prominent brows though, you may prefer the darker color.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m a believer in coloring your eyebrows if they are super light!</li>
            <li> I am able to achieve great full brows which make me look younger.</li>
            <li> I love the applicator and the cleanser is fantastic for quick removal</li>
            <li> You might as well buy a cheap eye brow pencil, because that&#x27;s all this is.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product.  </li>
            <li> However it does give you fabulous brows.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just one more reason to feel good about paying the extra $ for this makeup.</li>
            <li> The good news is I returned the product to amazon with no trouble and prompt refund.  </li>
            <li> It is pricey, but it is worth it for me not to have disappearing eyebrows!</li>
            <li> It certainly isn&#x27;t worth the money to me!</li>
            <li> Great item- fills in where needed, also lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I use the cleaner goop which comes with every wand  to clean my brows after I put on my foundation, to prepare the brow for the product.  </li>
            <li> LOVE SMART BROW.</li>
            <li> So I was super excited to try this product out.</li>
            <li> It needs practice to fully realize how amazing  and natural it can look.  </li>
            <li> This product works better than I expected, very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I have one brow with a good-size bald patch (scar), and one brow that is full but graying hair.  </li>
            <li> My full brows stay in place after 10 hours walking around theme parks, no</li>
            <li> The application is so easy and my brows look so much more natural than they did with the pencil.  </li>
            <li> Less is more and you can always add more if you prefer a more opaque</li>
            <li> Please just make more colors in cooler tones (ash blondes, ash browns, and hellooo, how about a gray for those of us most likely to lose our eyebrows!?)  </li>
            <li> I love this product, but am looking for a substitute because of the high price.</li>
            <li> Product works pretty well, but you have to use a light hand when applying this</li>
            <li> Definitely more &#x27;sweat proof&#x27; than a normal eyebrow pencil, but if you wipe your face with a towel...</li>
            <li> It also stays on all day without smearing - which is a first for me!  </li>
            <li> The only reason I give it 2 stars is the color is nice.</li>
            <li> nobody knows but boy have people taked about how fresh faced</li>
            <li> I am easily able to achieve the look of a professional.  </li>
            <li> I love the ease of use of this product and the results are quite natural looking.</li>
            <li> It did take a few applications before I got the hang of using both of the products before my brows looked the way natural brows do, but this is the best brow product I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> I think it also may possibly depend on your own brows and hair texture/color.  </li>
            <li> I do not believe it is worth what it costs.</li>
            <li> It comes right off in the shower.  </li>
            <li> and she was right</li>
            <li> just the right amount of color to enhance  my sparse brows.</li>
            <li> Comes right off in water.</li>
            <li> In our Florida humidity, brow pencils and powders fade and wipe right off.</li>
            <li> Filling the right one in with eyebrow pencils just never looked right.</li>
            <li> It does take some practice and I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using this for the first time when getting ready for an important event or photos.</li>
            <li> I had refused to buy this product for a year because of so many reviews saying that it doesn&#x27;t stay put--and I&#x27;d been down that road so many times before that</li>
            <li> I have light blonde hair and really light eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid it&#x27;s going to be too light, but it&#x27;s perfect..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an eyebrow pencil for about the last 10 years, but as the eyebrow hair loss is more noticeable, my brows have that distinctly \\&quot;penciled in\\&quot; look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural brunette with a fair complexion and use the Blonde.</li>
            <li> I found one product that looked natural, BUT it comes right off if touched even lightly by anything.</li>
            <li> In the shower, I didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; around my eyebrows and very gently washed.</li>
            <li> Color ordered was too light, but can get a better result using lash or other brow pencils.</li>
            <li> Stays on the whole day!</li>
            <li> it for the reduced price first to see if it works for you.</li>
            <li> and I really like this duo!</li>
            <li> She first tried it, didn&#x27;t like it, but then she learned how to apply it, and NOW SHE LOVES IT.  </li>
            <li> I am so in love with the color if the blonde formuka...</li>
            <li> I love the idea of not having to do my eyebrows daily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying the blonde color to see if that is a bit more forgiving</li>
            <li> It is definitely not an eyebrow filler but more like a liquid eyebrow pencil.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased the blond color (same as my pencil)</li>
            <li> Love this product and will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> the blond color is exactly right and matched my coloring very well.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, however the blonde shade is far too dark.</li>
            <li> Went from no eyebrows to natural looking (right color too) eyebrows!</li>
            <li> The SmartBrow filler comes off easily with regular makeup remover.</li>
            <li> but it goes on easy enough and stays on.  </li>
            <li> It comes off in hot water whenever I take a shower without even touching my face - even trying to avoid getting my eyebrows wet, in fact.  </li>
            <li> With the application of Smart Brow</li>
            <li> I was suspicious of how smart row would work.</li>
            <li> but I guess that is why they give you the smart brow remover...</li>
            <li> Great to cover up those white brow hairs that make me look faded and grabs onto the fine pale hairs at the outside of your brow.  </li>
            <li> I made huge mistakes when I was younger in removing too much of my brows and have been living with trying to compensate ever since.  </li>
            <li> The bald spot was very noticeable.  </li>
            <li> The end with the liner tip works very well however</li>
            <li> the brush end has way too much product on it.</li>
            <li> I have very sparse brows.</li>
            <li> I have eyebrows which are very sparse on the temple side of both brows.</li>
            <li> Very gloppy.</li>
            <li> now I really like the brow filler .</li>
            <li> I really like this product, but keep in mind that it&#x27;s darker then it appears.</li>
            <li> I tried to be neutral because this isn&#x27;t really about the product, which sounds sketchy at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t see the difference in this and the powder I use.</li>
            <li> This product looks like real hair on your brows, and is not comparable to any pencil.</li>
            <li> my whole life</li>
            <li> The whole reason I got this product was to be used as a filler.</li>
            <li> Cost too much for a one day wearing</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t look as old because your brows look more like those of a younger version of yourself!</li>
            <li> I tried both the blond and brunette colors of SmartBrow and felt the blonde looked more natural.  </li>
            <li> I actually like to darken them slightly more than their natural color and almost went with the brunette color.</li>
            <li> Wow I&#x27;m so glad I finally tried SmartBrow.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different brow liners and none have given me the coverage for the &amp;#34;bald spots&amp;#34; or looked as natural as this.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised; the BLONDE smartbrow looks just great on me, and unlike the other poster said, it takes two or three showers to wash off if I don&#x27;t explicitly remove them.  </li>
            <li> Not any better than any other eyebrow product.  </li>
            <li> I have very light brown to blond eyebrows and this is way too dark and did not apply the way it was portrayed.</li>
            <li> You know, it really bites getting older and</li>
            <li> but I chose the blonde version, which was exactly the right choice.</li>
            <li> Previously I had used pencils, but this product is much easier to use and fills in better.</li>
            <li> Excellent eyebrow color but went with blonde because brown was too dark even with dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and a real bargain because you get two products in one- the brush applicator to coat your hairs and then the other thin brush applicator to fill in the light spots.  </li>
            <li> think for those complaining about the product coming off too easily, one suggestion I&#x27;d make would be to make sure that they are VERY careful when applying face moisturizer, be VERY careful to avoid the brow area.  </li>
            <li> As long as my skin is clean and moisturizer free, I think this product adheres wonderfully!&lt;br /&gt;Finally, as I said before I have to be careful not to put on too much of the brunette color</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> product is a little more than I would spend for an eyebrow pencil, but I feel it lasted longer because I didn&#x27;t need to reapply.</li>
            <li> I bought the Blonde Wunderbrow2 to compare and found it too dark for my tastes and the applicator paint brush is too thick for a natural look, though the Wunderbrow comes with an excellent dry brow brush and contains lots more product.</li>
            <li> The principle is good, but I&#x27;m not using it due to the &amp;#34;blond&amp;#34; being dark brown.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LIVE this oridyct.  </li>
            <li> However, I can live with that and it hasn&#x27;t been an issue.</li>
            <li> my new fav beauty find</li>
            <li> It clung to the hair very well, but the skin was a whole different story.</li>
            <li> The thing is, if you don&#x27;t have much in the way of eyebrows, this product isn&#x27;t going to create brows that look like you suddenly sprouted real eyebrow hairs.  </li>
            <li> is light enough not to overwhelm my light complexion and dark enough</li>
            <li> and when I&#x27;ve been consistent with progesterone cream, my sleep and eyebrows have come back.  </li>
            <li> but you can purchase it through The Derm Store for 19.99;  the exact same product.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last any longer and is pretty well worn off by the time I go to bed.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s no more unnatural looking than the pencil and slightly better.</li>
            <li> it actually rubs off the first day.</li>
            <li> Fills in my eyebrows while still keeping them natural looking!  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t mean to get blonde, but I have very fine brows, so it works out!  </li>
            <li> Hi, I have dark natural blond which is hennaed and basically looks like a light auburn.  </li>
            <li> I think it makes me younger; I tend to go pretty natural.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little practice at first to get it to look just right, but take your time and play with it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the brunette and as long as I&#x27;m careful not to apply too much, it look fabulous and natural!  </li>
            <li> If you are very active and are hoping that this will last through sweating and showering, I don&#x27;t think you will be pleased.</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice to get the hang of using it but for people with really light eyebrows</li>
            <li> I love how this produce works however, the price is too high for such a small amount.</li>
            <li> I currently am using a new one for the liner part and an older one for the brush part because I don&#x27;t like a lot of the color from the brush.</li>
            <li> Not cheap but will make me happy for at least a year.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t completely gone and I just had to touch up</li>
            <li> Natural looking and lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> and looks natural.  </li>
            <li> I lost my eyebrows to chemo 10 years ago or at least most of them</li>
            <li> So as far as I&#x27;m concerned it&#x27;s water resistant.  </li>
            <li> and it does look natural.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product.  </li>
            <li> My brows are darker than my hair but have thinned considerably.  </li>
            <li> It does not stay on as well as described, nor does it produce a natural looking brow.  </li>
            <li> With the combination of the two, I get the best/most natural looking eyebrows...</li>
            <li> This product works well on the full brow, and it is long lasting (I slept in it - no problems).  </li>
            <li> Thick and goofy product.  </li>
            <li> As a young child, I had an accident that left a scar in the middle of my right eye brow</li>
            <li> It does take a little practice but it is totally worth it!  </li>
            <li> Keep practicing - clean the brush a little before apply it and will work easier on brows.</li>
            <li> There is a slight learning curve but if make up is your friend you will find it easy enough to apply.</li>
            <li> with the two-step process, though using both steps is essential for anything near a decent look.</li>
            <li> However the other end, was useful in applying the color to the hair itself.</li>
            <li> have light brownish hair and bought the Dark Blonde since that&#x27;s the color I use for the Maybelline pencil.  </li>
            <li> Will try other reviewer&#x27;s tip of blotting right after applying.  </li>
            <li> I am light blonde with slightly darker eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It is, as many have stated, not good for patchy brows.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a blonde and this color is a little too light.</li>
            <li> SmartBrow gives me a very natural look -- at last!</li>
            <li> I can create amazing looks, from thin to fuller brows, with no effort!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really find it as long lasting as they say.</li>
            <li> and I use regular face wash, no heavy make-up removal type stuff.</li>
            <li> I was surprised actually</li>
            <li> Looks natural enough and I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I am 68 years old and thus my eyebrows are getting thinner and thinner and not in the same places.</li>
            <li> They actually look natural.</li>
            <li> Feels a little sticky at first</li>
            <li> I have minimal brows, but this fills in so naturally!!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t take my previous eyebrows off with their cleaner or any other special cleaner.</li>
            <li> Even blonde is pretty dark and might be too dark for a lighter-haired person, but it works for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an older brunette going half grey</li>
            <li> After a couple of tries (put it on too heavy at first)</li>
            <li> Three or four days later, I found I still had product that had not completely come off in the shower.</li>
            <li> but it just takes too long to apply and the bottle does not even last one month.  </li>
            <li> So I now use the SmartBrow Blonde with the dry brow brush from the Wunderbrow2.</li>
            <li> Then let dry, which it does in a short time.</li>
            <li> It is very messy and does not yield natural results, especially if you have smaller brows.</li>
            <li> I was hoping I could finally get a blonde color that wasn&#x27;t too dark.  </li>
            <li> The color is not natural looking</li>
            <li> I will keep useing it as long as I can get it.</li>
            <li> I cannot address how long it stays on.</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to apply.</li>
            <li> Not what i expected , sent back.</li>
            <li> I love it for the miraculous nature of the fix for scant blonde brows, but only half of the product is for brows with the other half as a useless light brown mascara that comes with a useless cleanser.</li>
            <li> low rating is due to this product not holding up as well as I would like.</li>
            <li> but this is the same as all the other eye brow color products:</li>
            <li> Wish there was a Taupe color which in other brand eyebrow pencils has been lighter than blonde.  </li>
            <li> Stays on a very long time.  </li>
            <li> This blonde shade is very dark, but it does last all day.</li>
            <li> It is heavy, dark and does nothing special, in fact it is hard to work with.</li>
            <li> However, Blonde is too dark.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather pay less and not get the cleaner or pay the same and not get a product I&#x27;ll never use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry it runs out so quick.</li>
            <li> there is a mess of fluid around the opening of the container.  </li>
            <li> If you have thin brows it might work, but I&#x27;m not so certain.</li>
            <li> You use the thin brush to coat the hairs and then using the large brush which builds up the product on the hairs.</li>
            <li> The blonde color is a little darker than you might think.  </li>
            <li> I have only used the cleanser a little because I use another cleanser for all of my eye makeup together.</li>
            <li> I apply this every other day, it&#x27;s gonna last forever because it takes such a small amount.</li>
            <li> I only wish the blond was a little lighter.</li>
            <li> but I did have a little itching (no red skin) just a scratchy feeling at the center portion of my brows.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t write the review, but was surprised by some negative reviews.</li>
            <li> A big waste of time.  </li>
            <li> A big waste of time.  </li>
            <li> If gel was just a bit thicker, and applicator brush a bit wider, application wouldn&#x27;t be as messy and this would definitely be a 5-star product</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> I use the thin liner end to mark the arc and ONLY use the spoolie for the bushier/thicker part near my nose....</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older, that area has thinned out a lot and what has remained has turned into those crazy, old man eye brows sticking out in all directions.</li>
            <li> Getting older makes your eyebrows thin out, this product makes them appear thicker</li>
            <li> One other time..</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not a pretty color on my skin at all.</li>
            <li> The application is a bit tricky as stated in other reviews</li>
            <li> One brow always ends up darker than the other.</li>
            <li> After I started to use this product, I will never buy any other product for my brows again.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are almost nonexistent due to fading out, and thinning out, with age.  </li>
            <li> After painting my brows, I use the dry brow brush from the Wunderbrow product to run over my brows to tone it down and remove any globs or mistakes and it works well in combination!</li>
            <li> I have had the opposite problem - it&#x27;s hard to get the product off.</li>
            <li> Also, the fluid dries to a hard crunchy finish...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dark and not a lighter hue for blinds or even lighter brunettes.</li>
            <li> The Brunette product would have been too dark.</li>
            <li> The lightest one is too dark for someone who doesn&#x27;t want really dark brows.</li>
            <li> Also, pencils always seem to go on too dark and</li>
            <li> I am 59 years old and my eyebrows had become thin and unshapely.  </li>
            <li> It took me a few tries</li>
            <li> (Sort of like Spock from Star Trek - they go up but don&#x27;t curve down.)</li>
            <li> Does not mat down the eyebrow hairs to make a smoothe finish.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown eyebrows but a little lighter hair.  </li>
            <li> and because I&#x27;m lightening my hair a bit and the brunette is a little too dark for the color.  </li>
            <li> I got the lightest one and it was a little too dark.  </li>
            <li> NOT TRUE.  </li>
            <li> or you will have a mess.  </li>
            <li> Pencils rub away during the day, not cool.  </li>
            <li> And, while it seems silly, my hubby loves my new look.</li>
            <li> You have to be a pro to use this product...or waste half the tube trying to become a pro.</li>
            <li> It will stay for days, wearing off a little at a time.</li>
            <li> but sometimes it&#x27;s a little clumpy and the eyebrows are sticky.</li>
            <li> It is as advertised - maybe hyped up a little bit.  </li>
            <li> - I can&#x27;t detect any little fibers.  </li>
            <li> It must be marked wrong.</li>
            <li> This product adds to the few eyebrow hairs I have.</li>
            <li> I have tried pencils  and powders and some creams and they always look WAY TOO HEAVY on me.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll end up having to try and spread out the glop that becomes stuck on a few hairs.</li>
            <li> but at 49, I noticed that they&#x27;ve become so thin and actually have some white/grey hairs in them!  </li>
            <li> This is the ONLY product I&#x27;ve found that will cover them as well as fill in thin and bald spots, deftly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I have to use a eyebrow pencil everyday since I can remember.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money...</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> (It makes the brows a little stiff.)</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and hoped this product would be the answer for pale patchy eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too pale (blond) and leaves my brows stiff.</li>
            <li> Just dab off the end of the small application brush until you get used to how thick and dark you want it.</li>
            <li> this was hard to use as the paintbrush tip did not fit inbetween</li>
            <li> I found this no better than any pencil for where you have brows.</li>
            <li> It only lasts a month (with some product unable to be removed from the bottom of the container)</li>
            <li> but I think they keep the quantity small</li>
            <li> The obvious fake penciled-in look is no more.</li>
            <li> Not pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine anyone wearing this goo more than once, it&#x27;s horrible!</li>
            <li> The unfortunate part was that the brush end was so overloaded with fluid that each time I pull the brush out...</li>
            <li> I wish it lasted longer because it was really expensive and only lasted me a couple of months.</li>
            <li> so I always had a small &#x27;bald spot&#x27; there.</li>
            <li> It was sticky and to me looked fake and not natural.</li>
            <li> Hard to do evenly yourself</li>
            <li> No it does not meet my expectations in the least.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not often I give a negative review on a product ..</li>
            <li> The application process requires a learning curve, and a delicate hand.  </li>
            <li> I have not had the experience that others complained of - product not staying on.</li>
            <li> It was thick and clumpy and it looked like you know what.  </li>
            <li> Also becomes thick and fade after drying.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is thick and globby.  </li>
            <li> The product consistency was too thick for my liking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not something that lasts a long time, so the price of almost $60 for the blonde color seems outrageous.</li>
            <li> I hate to shop outside of Amazon but the price difference is too significant.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the product, but my brows are too thin and with the thin brush, it just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It is too thin and watery and does not work.</li>
            <li> I have never had to return make-up because of poor product representation.</li>
            <li> I have tried over and over and am not happy with this.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m still unable to get my brows &amp;#34;slim enough&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Too expensive.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but then you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but had hope.</li>
            <li> I have had very thin, patchy eyebrows</li>
            <li> The color stays on all day through heat and cold.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not there yet, I&#x27;m afraid.</li>
            <li> Very expensive for a product that does not work.  </li>
            <li> I don\\&quot;t want cosmetics that is impossible to remove.</li>
            <li> Brush is splayed when it comes out of the tube, making controlled application impossible.</li>
            <li> Where it &amp;quot;tries&amp;quot; to fill in, it has a gummy texture, and looks bad and smears.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with the product as well.</li>
            <li> The Brunette color has a horrible orange look to it and looks very fake.  </li>
            <li> I tried this and hated it.  </li>
            <li> So disappointed!</li>
            <li> This product is awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I found this no better than any pencil for where you have brows. Where it &amp;quot;tries&amp;quot; to fill in, it has a gummy texture, and looks bad and smears. It DOESN&#x27;T last at all and I use regular face wash, no heavy make-up removal type stuff. The only reason I give it 2 stars is the color is nice. I am sticking with Anastasia products for my brows.</li>
            <li> No it does not meet my expectations in the least. It&#x27;s not often I give a negative review on a product .. One other time.. I ordered blond but it is anything but blond. Borders a bit on reddish brown and it&#x27;s not a pretty color on my skin at all. It&#x27;s dark and not a lighter hue for blinds or even lighter brunettes. It must be marked wrong. I&#x27;m hoping to return it.</li>
            <li> Wish Smartbrow would make a lighter color; otherwise, I like the product. It takes some practice to apply it evenly, but it&#x27;s the best eyebrow product I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Requires practice!  And I&#x27;m still unable to get my brows &amp;#34;slim enough&amp;#34; with the two-step process, though using both steps is essential for anything near a decent look.</li>
            <li> A big waste of time.  It was thick and clumpy and it looked like you know what.  I should have returned it.  A big waste of time.  Now I use to to cover scratch marks on furniture.</li>
            <li> I have graying eyebrows (and gray hair).  The blonde color is a little darker than you might think.  The application process requires a learning curve, and a delicate hand.  I have one brow with a good-size bald patch (scar), and one brow that is full but graying hair.  This product works well on the full brow, and it is long lasting (I slept in it - no problems).  BUT the product did not work on the bald spot.  There was a big difference in color when it&#x27;s on skin.  I could not get a satisfactory result.  The bald spot was very noticeable.  I use cheaper brow products that work better, so I&#x27;m returning the product.  If you have full brows, and need consistent color - it&#x27;s very nice.</li>
            <li> It is a good product, although you need to practice on how to use it.</li>
            <li> I love it for the miraculous nature of the fix for scant blonde brows, but only half of the product is for brows with the other half as a useless light brown mascara that comes with a useless cleanser. It only lasts a month (with some product unable to be removed from the bottom of the container) but I think they keep the quantity small so you will regularly re-order each month. I wish they would create an entire product of the liquid brow without the eyelash portion and without the cleanser. I bought the Blonde Wunderbrow2 to compare and found it too dark for my tastes and the applicator paint brush is too thick for a natural look, though the Wunderbrow comes with an excellent dry brow brush and contains lots more product. So I now use the SmartBrow Blonde with the dry brow brush from the Wunderbrow2. After painting my brows, I use the dry brow brush from the Wunderbrow product to run over my brows to tone it down and remove any globs or mistakes and it works well in combination!</li>
            <li> They tell you that you can shower and swim and the stuff stays on....NOT TRUE.  It comes right off in the shower.  You might as well buy a cheap eye brow pencil, because that&#x27;s all this is.</li>
            <li> I am a brunette, but I use blonde.  Even blonde is pretty dark and might be too dark for a lighter-haired person, but it works for me.  I like it better than the brand I used before (Wonder Brow).</li>
            <li> The end with the liner tip works very well however the brush end has way too much product on it. I would give it 5 starts if the brush end had no color and could be used just to brush and shape the brow</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too pale (blond) and leaves my brows stiff. Dont like it. Wish I could return it.</li>
            <li> As the title says, I am torn about this product. It stays on well. I have not had the experience that others complained of - product not staying on. I have had the opposite problem - it&#x27;s hard to get the product off. It will stay for days, wearing off a little at a time. Three or four days later, I found I still had product that had not completely come off in the shower. I had to use the accompanying remover. Lost a couple of hairs in the process.</li>
            <li> Amazing!  I have brows!</li>
            <li> this is a great brow product.  I love the applicator and the cleanser is fantastic for quick removal</li>
            <li> Getting older makes your eyebrows thin out, this product makes them appear thicker so you don&#x27;t look as old because your brows look more like those of a younger version of yourself!</li>
            <li> Love the color and stay-on power. If gel was just a bit thicker, and applicator brush a bit wider, application wouldn&#x27;t be as messy and this would definitely be a 5-star product</li>
            <li> The color is not natural looking</li>
            <li> I tried this and hated it.  it is not as they say.  It is heavy, dark and does nothing special, in fact it is hard to work with.</li>
            <li> I have light blonde hair and really light eyebrows.  I tried both the blond and brunette colors of SmartBrow and felt the blonde looked more natural.  If you like super prominent brows though, you may prefer the darker color.</li>
            <li> Color ordered was too light, but can get a better result using lash or other brow pencils.</li>
            <li> I bought this from the Derm Store website for only 25$. I hate to shop outside of Amazon but the price difference is too significant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is perfect. I am light blonde with slightly darker eyebrows. I actually like to darken them slightly more than their natural color and almost went with the brunette color. I am glad I didn&#x27;t b/c this color is great. The application is a bit tricky as stated in other reviews but it isn&#x27;t that bad. Just dab off the end of the small application brush until you get used to how thick and dark you want it. I treat the mascara wand end the same. I scrape off some of the product from the brush before I apply it and it looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The low rating is due to this product not holding up as well as I would like. I applied it and went for a work out. I did sweat a lot but avoided toweling my face aggressively. In the shower, I didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; around my eyebrows and very gently washed. I needed to reapply the product afterward. I wasn&#x27;t completely gone and I just had to touch up but enough was removed that I couldn&#x27;t just leave it. If you are very active and are hoping that this will last through sweating and showering, I don&#x27;t think you will be pleased. It is otherwise a nice product.</li>
            <li> I have very sparse brows. This product works great and stays put. There is a slight learning curve but if make up is your friend you will find it easy enough to apply. I never have to worry about my brow make up running, disappearing or rubbing off.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I didn&#x27;t give them a 5 star bc who needs an eyebrow cleaner? I&#x27;d rather pay less and not get the cleaner or pay the same and not get a product I&#x27;ll never use. The SmartBrow filler comes off easily with regular makeup remover. It takes a little practice to get the hang of using it but for people with really light eyebrows it&#x27;s wonderful. I don&#x27;t use the fine line filler bc I don&#x27;t need it but if you do there are some really good YouTube vids on how to apply it. My eyebrows look great all day and SmartBrow doesn&#x27;t smudge. The obvious fake penciled-in look is no more.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have eyebrows which are very sparse on the temple side of both brows. (Sort of like Spock from Star Trek - they go up but don&#x27;t curve down.) Previously I had used pencils, but this product is much easier to use and fills in better. The color is fine for my my blonde/light brown/grey eyebrows. I have used it for about six months. I currently am using a new one for the liner part and an older one for the brush part because I don&#x27;t like a lot of the color from the brush. (It makes the brows a little stiff.) I have only used the cleanser a little because I use another cleanser for all of my eye makeup together. I am very happy I found this product. It is pricey, but it is worth it for me not to have disappearing eyebrows!</li>
            <li> I love it!  I was afraid it&#x27;s going to be too light, but it&#x27;s perfect..Stays on the whole day!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LIVE this oridyct.  And it will stay on perfectly for two days or more.  It is perspiration proof!  I buy the blonde but it isn&#x27;t blonde ...but blends well with my medium blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Very gloppy. Not pleased with this purchase. I do like the brush.</li>
            <li> I was surprised actually but it goes on easy enough and stays on.  Looks natural enough and I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product is the best!  Blonde color is perfect for highlighted brown hair.  If you want it darker just add another coat!  Stays on for days unless you remove it too.  Great to cover up those white brow hairs that make me look faded and grabs onto the fine pale hairs at the outside of your brow.  I will be using this stuff until I die!  Please don&#x27;t change it!</li>
            <li> I like the product, but my brows are too thin and with the thin brush, it just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Best I have found!  Natural looking and lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> A great product and prompt shipping</li>
            <li> Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Wish the volume of product were higher.&lt;br /&gt;Try it for the reduced price first to see if it works for you.</li>
            <li> Works like advertised. Now I don&#x27;t look weird(er). </li>
            <li> I have minimal brows, but this fills in so naturally!!</li>
            <li> Although the color is great and I love the way it looks on, they are selling it to you as if it were a waterproof product that needs a special cleanser for removal.  My makeup wipes take it off!!  Buy the $20. alternatives at Sephora.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows seem to be thinning and disappearing, and this is just what I needed.  Easy to use (read the directions!) and looks natural.  A friend recommended getting a shade lighter than my actual brow and she was right - the darker shade would have looked &amp;#34;painted on.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order this product, because I always feel like Groucho Marks when I use brow pencils or powders. I decided to try it and I really like this duo! It&#x27;s easy to use, and I get better results every time I use it! Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Might be great for someone who doesn&#x27;t have much to fill in I guess.  But on each eyebrow, I have a spot that never grew back after over plucking.  When I use this it is very obvious.  I am much better off using the fine line &amp;#34;tattoo&amp;#34; eyebrow filler pen.</li>
            <li> Excellent eyebrow color but went with blonde because brown was too dark even with dark brown hair. Stays on all day unlike some eyebrow pencils and powders, even at the gym. I lost my eyebrows to chemo 10 years ago or at least most of them and they never grew back. This product adds to the few eyebrow hairs I have.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but am looking for a substitute because of the high price. It&#x27;s not something that lasts a long time, so the price of almost $60 for the blonde color seems outrageous. Except for that, it&#x27;s the best eyebrow filler I&#x27;ve found for my very light eyebrows. The color matches my blonde hair perfectly, and it does a great job of filling in and shaping.</li>
            <li> Hi, I have dark natural blond which is hennaed and basically looks like a light auburn.  I have thinning brows, too, and I have noticed that I look washed out without eyebrows.  I have tried pencils  and powders and some creams and they always look WAY TOO HEAVY on me.  I still have very fair skin with rosy cheeks and I look best with just a hint of eyebrows.  This was perfect.  I was surprised; the BLONDE smartbrow looks just great on me, and unlike the other poster said, it takes two or three showers to wash off if I don&#x27;t explicitly remove them.  So as far as I&#x27;m concerned it&#x27;s water resistant.  It somehow manages to take just a smide to flesh out my brows - I use the thin liner end to mark the arc and ONLY use the spoolie for the bushier/thicker part near my nose....nobody knows but boy have people taked about how fresh faced I look blah blah, just glowing.  I think it makes me younger; I tend to go pretty natural.  I apply this every other day, it&#x27;s gonna last forever because it takes such a small amount. I&#x27;m pleased.  Not cheap but will make me happy for at least a year.  Nice to have red/blonde eyebrows again to frame my face!</li>
            <li> I love this product and I will stay with it.  I am able to achieve great full brows which make me look younger. I am 59 years old and my eyebrows had become thin and unshapely.  With the application of Smart Brow I am easily able to achieve the look of a professional.  With one application in the morning it stays on all day until you wash it off.</li>
            <li> This stuff is Great .This blond is a perfect color for me. This is my second one. I will keep useing it as long as I can get it.GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I love the ease of use of this product and the results are quite natural looking. I recommend this product to anyone who would like to fill out the brows they have.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected. Too expensive.</li>
            <li> I tried it, I&#x27;m a red head. Went for the Blonde shade.  I personally tried it once, didn&#x27;t like it.  Gave it to a girlfriend who is a blonde. She first tried it, didn&#x27;t like it, but then she learned how to apply it, and NOW SHE LOVES IT.  And she was so excited about the results she showed me, and her eyebrows LOOKED GOOD!!! It&#x27;s a great product for her. We are nearing our 50&#x27;s, so looking for something natural, and it did look great on her.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with the color if the blonde formuka...just the right amount of color to enhance  my sparse brows. This stays on through the day and looks great</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  I am so pleased with outcome after using this product.  Would recommend to family &amp; friends.</li>
            <li> now I really like the brow filler . It needs practice to fully realize how amazing  and natural it can look.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I love the idea of not having to do my eyebrows daily and it does look natural.</li>
            <li> You know, it really bites getting older and one of the signs sent like a rocket is the fading/loss of/patchy eyebrows. I&#x27;ve been using an eyebrow pencil for about the last 10 years, but as the eyebrow hair loss is more noticeable, my brows have that distinctly \\&quot;penciled in\\&quot; look. I saw a commercial for this and figured I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I do like the product and how it clings to those microscopic facial hairs to fill in the blanks with color. It does take some practice and I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using this for the first time when getting ready for an important event or photos. Also, it&#x27;s tempting to want to  be in a hurry and just get those eyebrows filled in! Don&#x27;t. You&#x27;ll end up having to try and spread out the glop that becomes stuck on a few hairs. Less is more and you can always add more if you prefer a more opaque look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t appreciate from the manufacturers is the claim that SmartBrow is water proof. It isn&#x27;t. Comes right off in water. However, I can live with that and it hasn&#x27;t been an issue. I&#x27;m a natural brunette with a fair complexion and use the Blonde.</li>
            <li> I love this eyebrow product. It is the first product I have ever used that gives my scanty eyebrows even color and great shape. I am 68 years old and thus my eyebrows are getting thinner and thinner and not in the same places. SmartBrow makes me look like I have &amp;#34;young&amp;#34; eyebrows, and they don&#x27;t look like phony lines above my eyes.. It is expensive, but then you get what you pay for. I cannot address how long it stays on. I don&#x27;t pay any attention to this attribute. I put my eyebrows on whenever I am going to leave the house and I don&#x27;t take my previous eyebrows off with their cleaner or any other special cleaner. It seems they just come off when I wash my face. I don&#x27;t use the cleaner product that comes with the eyebrow product. It would be nice if they sold the two items separately. That might decrease the price.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!  I have dark brown eyebrows but a little lighter hair.  I&#x27;ve used the brunette and as long as I&#x27;m careful not to apply too much, it look fabulous and natural!  It does take a little practice but it is totally worth it!  I used to have bushy brows but at 49, I noticed that they&#x27;ve become so thin and actually have some white/grey hairs in them!  This is the ONLY product I&#x27;ve found that will cover them as well as fill in thin and bald spots, deftly.&lt;br /&gt;I think for those complaining about the product coming off too easily, one suggestion I&#x27;d make would be to make sure that they are VERY careful when applying face moisturizer, be VERY careful to avoid the brow area.  As long as my skin is clean and moisturizer free, I think this product adheres wonderfully!&lt;br /&gt;Finally, as I said before I have to be careful not to put on too much of the brunette color otherwise I get to looking like Groucho Marx or Uncle Leo from Seinfeld!  I&#x27;m trying the blonde color to see if that is a bit more forgiving and because I&#x27;m lightening my hair a bit and the brunette is a little too dark for the color.  I&#x27;ll keep you posted...</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product.  It is definitely not an eyebrow filler but more like a liquid eyebrow pencil.  The Brunette color has a horrible orange look to it and looks very fake.  It is too thin and watery and does not work.</li>
            <li> FINALLY!  Two things would make this product perfect: 1) more colors (in cool tones) and 2) being cruelty free. If this company adds these two features to the current product,  I&#x27;d be a devoted spokesperson for it.  I have no eyebrows and have been drawing mine on with various products for years, never finding one, until now, that was both natural-looking and reliable. I found one product that looked natural, BUT it comes right off if touched even lightly by anything. SmartBrow STAYS ON!  Even if I rub it or put a hat on over it..  Even if I put it on over my moisturizer!  Finally I can go out and not have to constantly be checking to see if my eyebrows are still there or trying to hide the rubbed off parts with my hair.  Hallelujah. I had refused to buy this product for a year because of so many reviews saying that it doesn&#x27;t stay put--and I&#x27;d been down that road so many times before that I saw no point in trying another.  Maybe it just depends on your skin chemistry? I don&#x27;t know. All I can say it is DOES STAY ON ME!  Wow I&#x27;m so glad I finally tried SmartBrow.  Please just make more colors in cooler tones (ash blondes, ash browns, and hellooo, how about a gray for those of us most likely to lose our eyebrows!?)  And SmartBrow:  CALL ME IF YOU NEED A SPOKESPERSON!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, some learning curve.  Recommended. Didn&#x27;t mean to get blonde, but I have very fine brows, so it works out!  Recommended!</li>
            <li> I really like this product, but keep in mind that it&#x27;s darker then it appears. I have brown hair and eyebrows and I use blonde. It lasts for two days, but needs touch-ups.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I&#x27;ve had my eyebrows tattooed three times, and it never lasts.  This stuff looks just as good as a tattoo and there is no pain!  I love it.  It takes a little practice at first to get it to look just right, but take your time and play with it.  You&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to apply. One brow always ends up darker than the other. I do better with a pencil</li>
            <li> Love this! As described,Quick ship,Thank you!</li>
            <li> Save your money.  A Maybelline pencil and an eyebrow brush work way better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a blonde and this color is a little too light. But this product is spectacular. The color stays on all day through heat and cold. I didn&#x27;t have to touch up at all. It looks the same after working all day from 7 to 7.</li>
            <li> I tried to be neutral because this isn&#x27;t really about the product, which sounds sketchy at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my mid 40s and when I&#x27;ve been consistent with progesterone cream, my sleep and eyebrows have come back.  Just a thought.</li>
            <li> Shipped promptly, no issues with product/seller.  Product itself is truly amazing, you will have eyebrows when you&#x27;re done!!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product and I don&#x27;t want to be without it.  However, I am giving it 4 stars because of the price.  It is 29.99 plus shipping with this company but you can purchase it through The Derm Store for 19.99;  the exact same product.  If you are reading this to do research on the product, try it.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t see the difference in this and the powder I use. It doesn&#x27;t last any longer and is pretty well worn off by the time I go to bed. I have never had to use the remover. It certainly isn&#x27;t worth the money to me!</li>
            <li> Product works pretty well, but you have to use a light hand when applying this or you will have a mess.  I would suggest a trial run with this before you actually need to use this so you can get a feel for the product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but had hope. This product works better than I expected, very pleased with the results. I&#x27;m comparing it to an eyebrow pencil that I&#x27;ve used for years and this is waaaayyy better. I have never been able to achieve these kinds of results with a pencil. When I step outside in the daylight it&#x27;s no more unnatural looking than the pencil and slightly better. I&#x27;m glad I purchased the blond color (same as my pencil) even though I have med/dark brown hair the blond color is exactly right and matched my coloring very well. The Brunette product would have been too dark. This will be a permanent addition to my make-up routine! .... great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with the product as well. Did not work out. The blonde color looks gray. Also becomes thick and fade after drying.  I found it very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I was suspicious of how smart row would work. After a couple of tries (put it on too heavy at first) I now love it. Had to experiment with the order of application which I&#x27;m doing a bit different than the directions. Stays on until you take it off with remover.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t write the review, but was surprised by some negative reviews. This product looks like real hair on your brows, and is not comparable to any pencil. I have four pencils from Lancome, YSL, Dior and Chanel. After I started to use this product, I will never buy any other product for my brows again. Unless a permanent solution will be found. I bought this product in Blonde from Dermastore and it is perfect.When I wash my face the product stays on, but my make up remover from Lancome removes it. I don\\&quot;t want cosmetics that is impossible to remove. So, this one is perfect for me. It doesn&#x27;t smash, but also is removable when you want to. I was researching here to buy the second one. It is a great product!</li>
            <li> The lightest one is too dark for someone who doesn&#x27;t want really dark brows. The principle is good, but I&#x27;m not using it due to the &amp;#34;blond&amp;#34; being dark brown.</li>
            <li> Save your money.  Thick and goofy product.  Brush is splayed when it comes out of the tube, making controlled application impossible.</li>
            <li> When I saw the tutorial on how to use SmartBrow Filler, I thought it would for sure be a great product for me. I have had very thin, patchy eyebrows my whole life and I have to use a eyebrow pencil everyday since I can remember. So I was super excited to try this product out. But when I got it and tried to use it, it was not anything like how it worked in the tutorial. If you have any area on your eyebrow area that doesn&#x27;t have hair, (patchy areas) this product will not work. It clung to the hair very well, but the skin was a whole different story. The whole reason I got this product was to be used as a filler. But it just didn&#x27;t work for me like I hoped it would.</li>
            <li> The product is so easy to use.  I have gray hair and the blond is light enough not to overwhelm my light complexion and dark enough so you know I have eye brows.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just like buying an eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Some loss when wearing sleep mask at night, otherwise will stay on several days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used eyebrow pencils for years.  Then I saw this and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.  I love it!  The application is so easy and my brows look so much more natural than they did with the pencil.  Love this product and will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> BEST EYEBROW MAKEUP HANDS DOWN</li>
            <li> I ordered this from another store I saw on FB and loved it.  I decided to order more before the price went up and it had tripled! I found it here and ordered several.  I&#x27;ve tried so many different brow liners and none have given me the coverage for the &amp;#34;bald spots&amp;#34; or looked as natural as this.  It did take a few applications before I got the hang of using both of the products before my brows looked the way natural brows do, but this is the best brow product I&#x27;ve ever used.  I think it also may possibly depend on your own brows and hair texture/color.  I&#x27;m an older brunette going half grey so I&#x27;m now a highlighted blonde.  My brows are darker than my hair but have thinned considerably.  The blonde color works perfectly with my hair color and original brows.  It also stays on all day without smearing - which is a first for me!  That, and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t look like you have drawn on brows makes this the best product for me.</li>
            <li> Great item- fills in where needed, also lasts a long time! I will reorder</li>
            <li> My husband saw an ad for SmartBrow and suggested I try it. I am fair and after a life of hypothyroidism, have the daintiest blond eyebrows. Without makeup on my brows, you cannot see them. In our Florida humidity, brow pencils and powders fade and wipe right off. Also, pencils always seem to go on too dark and heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE SMART BROW. It took me a few tries but now I am an expert. I can create amazing looks, from thin to fuller brows, with no effort! And, contrary to some reviews, my eyebrows stay on until I wash them off. Sunblock will take them off, but at the beach, I am not so concerned. My full brows stay in place after 10 hours walking around theme parks, no problem!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is a little more than I would spend for an eyebrow pencil, but I feel it lasted longer because I didn&#x27;t need to reapply. And, while it seems silly, my hubby loves my new look. That&#x27;s just one more reason to feel good about paying the extra $ for this makeup. This time, I am buying on Amazon (not dermstore) for the Prime shipping.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money...</li>
            <li> it actually rubs off the first day. Cost too much for a one day wearing</li>
            <li> Hard to do evenly yourself</li>
            <li> It works good but sometimes it&#x27;s a little clumpy and the eyebrows are sticky.</li>
            <li> You have to be a pro to use this product...or waste half the tube trying to become a pro.</li>
            <li> I was hoping I could finally get a blonde color that wasn&#x27;t too dark.  This was not it.  If they could get a color that truly goes with blonde eyebrows, I would use the product.  They&#x27;re not there yet, I&#x27;m afraid.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.  This stuff is thick and globby.  I can&#x27;t imagine anyone wearing this goo more than once, it&#x27;s horrible!</li>
            <li> quite the product - I like</li>
            <li> It is as advertised - maybe hyped up a little bit.  Seems to be more of a brow wax - I can&#x27;t detect any little fibers.  It comes off in hot water whenever I take a shower without even touching my face - even trying to avoid getting my eyebrows wet, in fact.  It doesn&#x27;t come off with sweat or swimming - which is why I&#x27;m feeling it&#x27;s a wax.  My eyebrows look smudged after applying and brushing the brows.  But I do have to say the color is great - exactly as advertised.  Everytime I put this on, people comment on how great I look.  So I&#x27;m a believer in coloring your eyebrows if they are super light!</li>
            <li> So disappointed! I have never had to return make-up because of poor product representation. It is very messy and does not yield natural results, especially if you have smaller brows. The wands are too big and the product itself smears. Good for the &amp;#34;big, drawn-on, crunchy&amp;#34; look... Anastasia Brow Powder is so much more flattering. &amp;#34;Blonde&amp;#34; color is too warm and &amp;#34;gold&amp;#34; to blend.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Went from no eyebrows to natural looking (right color too) eyebrows!</li>
            <li> Not what i expected , sent back.</li>
            <li> takes getting used to - and with my tremors can be a challenge - but looks good and lasts until washed off.  Keep practicing - clean the brush a little before apply it and will work easier on brows.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, however the blonde shade is far too dark. It is not the taupe tone as shown.</li>
            <li> I guess I did not have thinning eye brows after all...this was hard to use as the paintbrush tip did not fit inbetween my eye brow hairs to reach the skin...I ended up with eye brow hair painted (which is not what the directions say to do with the paint brush).  However the other end, was useful in applying the color to the hair itself. The unfortunate part was that the brush end was so overloaded with fluid that each time I pull the brush out...there is a mess of fluid around the opening of the container.  I was expecting a different result - but this is the same as all the other eye brow color products: bottom line: l like the brush (mascara type brush) style best.  Also, the fluid dries to a hard crunchy finish...but I guess that is why they give you the smart brow remover...mine just wore off...but I did have a little itching (no red skin) just a scratchy feeling at the center portion of my brows.</li>
            <li> I really LOVED this product. I&#x27;m blonde and dye my eyebrows so this is all I need in the morning for my getting dressed routine. I wish it lasted longer because it was really expensive and only lasted me a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Fills in my eyebrows while still keeping them natural looking!  Sometimes I just use the brush end and sometimes I use both ends - either way, I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I have no eyebrows ( in the genes). With SmartBrow I can draw them on and they stay on for days. They actually look natural. I will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> I have very light brown to blond eyebrows and this is way too dark and did not apply the way it was portrayed. I have tried over and over and am not happy with this.</li>
            <li> This is really good for in between tints.</li>
            <li> Did not like it at all. Made my eye brows look like i threw a bucket of paint on them!!</li>
            <li> Not any better than any other eyebrow product.  It does not stay on as well as described, nor does it produce a natural looking brow.  The thing is, if you don&#x27;t have much in the way of eyebrows, this product isn&#x27;t going to create brows that look like you suddenly sprouted real eyebrow hairs.  I got the lightest one and it was a little too dark.  I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;m sorry it runs out so quick. I don&#x27;t really find it as long lasting as they say. You don&#x27;t need the remover....</li>
            <li> This product is awful. I used it once then threw it out. Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> Waterproof - sort of.  Definitely more &#x27;sweat proof&#x27; than a normal eyebrow pencil, but if you wipe your face with a towel...yes it will come off a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike pencils where you can draw your brow on where there&#x27;s no hair, Smartbrow clings to the hair in your brows and just &#x27;smudges&#x27; on skin.  Which means (a) you will have to continue to wax your brows of excess hairs (if you have them) and (b) you may still need to use a pencil (like Maybelline&#x27;s Define a brow...my favorite) to fill in &#x27;hairless&#x27; areas.&lt;br /&gt;I have light brownish hair and bought the Dark Blonde since that&#x27;s the color I use for the Maybelline pencil.  It&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  My eyebrows are almost nonexistent due to fading out, and thinning out, with age.  With the combination of the two, I get the best/most natural looking eyebrows...which makes me look 10 years younger.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product.  I&#x27;ve already ordered 2 more!  Best my brows have every looked.  I made huge mistakes when I was younger in removing too much of my brows and have been living with trying to compensate ever since.  SmartBrow gives me a very natural look -- at last!</li>
            <li> I did not like it! It made my eye brows look like they were glued on. It was sticky and to me looked fake and not natural.</li>
            <li> my new fav beauty find</li>
            <li> This does not work for &amp;#34;no eyebrows&amp;#34;  I have literally no eyebrows consequently the color &amp; filler doesn&#x27;t work, meaning the color went on ok if you can draw, but the filler fibers had nothing to cling to.  The wand/brush is designed like an eye lash brush which give no control what so ever for &amp;#34;painting&amp;#34; on the fibers.  Don&#x27;t bother with the cleanser, this stuff comes off with soap and water.  If you have thin brows it might work, but I&#x27;m not so certain. The good news is I returned the product to amazon with no trouble and prompt refund.  If some one out there knows of anything that would work on &amp;#34;no brows&amp;#34; I sure like to hear about it.</li>
            <li> You know, pencils are great, but this stuff lasts all day and night. Pencils rub away during the day, not cool.  I use the cleaner goop which comes with every wand  to clean my brows after I put on my foundation, to prepare the brow for the product.  You have to take it off with the goop which before  bedtime.  It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and a real bargain because you get two products in one- the brush applicator to coat your hairs and then the other thin brush applicator to fill in the light spots.  I like it and would buy it again.  I only wish the blond was a little lighter.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and hoped this product would be the answer for pale patchy eyebrows.  It is, as many have stated, not good for patchy brows.  If there are no hairs, it has nothing to cling to.  Very expensive for a product that does not work.  Powder products with a brush that will fill in are the only solution for patchy brows.</li>
            <li> Stays on a very long time.  However, Blonde is too dark.  Will try other reviewer&#x27;s tip of blotting right after applying.  Wish there was a Taupe color which in other brand eyebrow pencils has been lighter than blonde.  --  There is a Taupe color.  Company&#x27;s guarantee is great!</li>
            <li> Does not mat down the eyebrow hairs to make a smoothe finish.</li>
            <li> The product consistency was too thick for my liking. I felt like I had astroturf on my face. Threw it in the garbage after about 5 attempts at wearing it. Just didn&#x27;t like the way it felt on my face.</li>
            <li> Product is good but be lucky if it lasts a month.</li>
            <li> WOW! This is one product that actually delivered what it says it does. As a young child, I had an accident that left a scar in the middle of my right eye brow so I always had a small &#x27;bald spot&#x27; there. As I&#x27;ve gotten older, that area has thinned out a lot and what has remained has turned into those crazy, old man eye brows sticking out in all directions. The left eye brow behaves itself.  Filling the right one in with eyebrow pencils just never looked right. Then recently, I discovered this product. My eye brows have never looked better! I&#x27;m a brunette but I chose the blonde version, which was exactly the right choice. Perfect color. Easy to use. Make sure brows are clean with no moisturizer on it. You use the thin brush to coat the hairs and then using the large brush which builds up the product on the hairs. The brush also smooths the hairs into place. Then let dry, which it does in a short time. Feels a little sticky at first but this stuff LASTS. A remover/cleaner comes with the package to remove the product. Believe me, you need it to remove this stuff. As an experiment, after wearing it all day, I tried to used my moisturizer to remove it. The moisturizer didn&#x27;t remove a bit of it. The provided cleaner does a very good job with just a tiny dab. I am very happy with this product because it&#x27;s the first time in many years that my eye brows look normal. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like it but it just takes too long to apply and the bottle does not even last one month.  However it does give you fabulous brows.</li>
            <li> I love how this produce works however, the price is too high for such a small amount. never again!</li>
            <li> The tiny brush gives you a lot of control in the application. It dries nicely and truly does stay on until you take it off. I haven&#x27;t found the need for the remover that comes with it but it&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s included.</li>
            <li> This blonde shade is very dark, but it does last all day. I do not believe it is worth what it costs.</li>
