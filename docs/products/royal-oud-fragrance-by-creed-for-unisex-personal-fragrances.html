            <li>I have a privilege to own!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is amazing, it makes me feel relaxed, and happy.</li>
            <li>N0 9,it isn&#x27;t as good as this royal Oud,wall street is crab,d</li>
            <li>It smell&#x27;s so good</li>
            <li>Very pleased ordering from here.</li>
            <li>And, importantly at much more attractive</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this for my daughter who is a bit of a fashionista connoisseur and she couldn&#x27;t be more delighted.  </li>
            <li>I own some real nice colognes from Creed to Altelier and at first smell</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s O.K. because Amazon is on the scene giving you the opportunity to have this wonderful unique line delivered right to your door...</li>
            <li>is class,confidence,i am an interesting man ,i know i am sexy kind of swag.</li>
            <li>If you buy direct from amazon, like i did, you do not have to worry, it is authentic and what a great price, who would want to pay retail when theres great prices available from amazon.</li>
            <li>This review I am doing is more about the authenticity.</li>
            <li>I love Creed and when I can get it for the price I paid here versus going to Nieman Marcus or buying it at Creed Boutique, I take advantage of it.</li>
            <li>this is one of my favorite creed cologne,my top two creed cologne are silver mountain water and now the Royal Oud.</li>
            <li>,i wear it mostly to the gym and will not dare wear it any place else.</li>
            <li>I love the YSL Lanuit and that&#x27;ss in my top 5.The Royal Oud</li>
            <li>is my favorite Creed colognes from the ones</li>
            <li>It is the most foul smelling cologne I have ever tried, I cant wear it.</li>
            <li>Creed&#x27;s Royal Oud is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>Gives you more of a. &amp;#34;Presence&amp;#34; than a smell.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t pretend to be qualified to review a primarily female fragrance), but I will say she has mentioned the quality shows as it lasts and lasts never failing to elicit compliments and questions as to what the wonderful perfume is she&#x27;s wearing.  </li>
            <li>I think this is why it is discounted because it was imported from the Saudi Market, so they are able to get a lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bottom line is I&#x27;m confident that this is genuine creed.</li>
            <li>a nut shell: royal oud smells amazing, is very unique and does smell exactly like the sample obtained from an \\&quot;authorized\\&quot; source.</li>
            <li>so I knew what to look for to see if it was genuine.</li>
            <li>If you have any questions please feel free to contact meP strength</li>
            <li>If you have any questions please feel free to contact me</li>
            <li>But here&#x27;s the reason why this stuff sells for cheap.</li>
            <li>I would have a fantastic cologne.</li>
            <li>only thing good about it is the name and nothing more</li>
            <li>Just as I was about to shell out the full price at Barney&#x27;s for what I think is Creed&#x27;s most interesting new scent, my favorite along with Vetiver, I checked Amazon.  </li>
            <li>so I was already familiar with the longevity, sillage and notes as it progressed on my skin.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a unique scent where you will know that you won&#x27;t smell like everyone else Creed will not disappoint</li>
            <li>The one I received came with the arabic pamphlet because it was originally made for the Saudi Market, after asking amazon about it.</li>
            <li>Royal oud is amazing and is in my creed top 2 second to aventus.</li>
            <li>&quot; I&#x27;ve always payed full price from Neiman&#x27;s or from the creed boutique in NYC where I am from.</li>
            <li>In regards to the authenticity, I&#x27;m confident that this is real deal</li>
            <li>I have had multiple comments on how good it smells.  </li>
            <li>That being said, most of these are from 2010, 2011,2012 and most people know that fragrances last between 3-5 years.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s now my new favorite cologne!&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>First off I&#x27;m an avid creed fan</li>
            <li>and this was my first purchase from an online vendor let alone from a \\&quot;discounted source\\</li>
            <li>The serial number as a matter a fact only 1 letter off from the sample batch I had from Neiman&#x27;s which I found to be Interesting</li>
            <li>Fact EDP is stronger and more concentrated then EDT (a simple google will tell you this)</li>
            <li>This is the Real Deal from Beauty Encounter!  </li>
            <li>Interested?  </li>
            <li>For some reason the Middle East is able to sell them back for much cheaper and still make a profit which kind of makes me wonder how much it really costs to make</li>
            <li>Very nice long lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li>When you spray this, you immediately smell rich, suave, mature gentleman.</li>
            <li>if you use their classic men&#x27;s scents, I would say this is worth trying.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and the cologne is completely authentic, just not initially intended for the US market.  </li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m in need of a new bottle I most likely will buy it at full price to compare that very issue but you may or may not even care about this as much as i</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m in need of a new bottle I most likely will buy it at full price to compare that very issue but you may or may not even care about this as much as i</li>
            <li>This is the real deal, not a fake.  </li>
            <li>Bottom line is Creed is one of the few very top purveyors of world-class scents.</li>
            <li>Distribution isn&#x27;t exactly wide-spread as it is commonly only available at the super-premium department stores and boutiques.  </li>
            <li>It is a strong cologne and i will definitely recommend it over anything out there.</li>
            <li>there are certain rules as to the strength and volume allowed.</li>
            <li>then what is sold at neimans or from creed itself because of the certain laws.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t hesitate as Amazon is actually doing a favor to the customer making it available at a real world cost.  </li>
            <li>Even Obtain creed at all because of its very strict distribution regulations and 2.</li>
            <li>then there&#x27;s a real possibility that that fragrance may turn soon.</li>
            <li>But it IS the real stuff.</li>
            <li>I really like the leather/tobacco scent.</li>
            <li>I would get the real thing and</li>
            <li>The price was just too much for me.  </li>
            <li>but this was the real deal.</li>
            <li>This one was only in Arabic which would kind make sense because this bottle came from the Middle East.</li>
            <li>The only things that were different from the other creeds I own was that the creed paper with the history that comes in all boxes that normally has 3or 4  languages( cant remember exactly how many).</li>
            <li>If you would like to know more about the notes and smell please read the other reviews or go to creedboutique.com.</li>
            <li>Their is alot of good colognes out there now and unlike before when green irish tweed stood out.</li>
            <li>The other difference and one that I&#x27;m still kind of puzzled about is the fact that on the back of the bottle itched in what looks like a lazer it says</li>
            <li>More than I expected, really does its thing when applied and then going outside.</li>
            <li>Royal Oud is a fantastic smell that really doesn&#x27;t compare to what you would typically smell at the cologne counter at the mall.</li>
            <li>I have new harlem by bond</li>
            <li>The Creed Royal oud is a revelation and my new go to cologne.</li>
            <li>I already have 3 other scents, Tabarome, Silver mountain water and Original Santal.</li>
            <li>I have alot of cologne,i have the green irish tweed as well,the green irish tweed use to be one of the best to me</li>
            <li>The problem is as far as I know</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is not for some young boy trying to impress his date.</li>
            <li>This is for the young man that is asking his woman for her hand in marriage.</li>
            <li>The fact a little goes a long way and the amazing appeal simply justifies the price.  </li>
            <li>I have a sample from the last time I was at Neiman Marcus and it smells and wears exactly the same.</li>
            <li>but I do have some doubts about the whole toilet water PGS thing because all creeds are EDP strength therefore the Middle Eastern version bottles that say toilet water PGS may be of a lesser strength for legal reasons but not noticeably so much when you smell it.</li>
            <li>therefore the Middle Eastern version bottles that say toilet water PGS may be of a lesser strength for legal reasons but not noticeably so much when you smell it.</li>
            <li>but it is akin to driving a Royce Rolls to do grocery shopping rather than driving it to a black tie event or a powerful date night at the opera.</li>
            <li>I am not sure this is the original stuff.</li>
            <li>Just a little spray will put a smile on your face and stay there throughout the day or evening.  </li>
            <li>so this may or may not be a less concentrated version ie less potent</li>
            <li>It sells for low prices at these places because they are old batches.</li>
            <li>that has toilet water marked anywhere on the box or bottle</li>
            <li>You almost never see Creed at a discount in a major store, so I briefly worried that it was a knockoff.  </li>

            <li> Upon  doing some research i learned about the \\&quot;grey market\\&quot; and this is where 99% if not 100% of these creeds are comming from on sites like amazon or the 3rd party sellers such as fragrance net (this is we&#x27;re</li>

            <li> Very subtle and clean...</li>
            <li> Limited distribution and pricing above the mass-market makes Creed somewhat under the radar for mass consumption.  </li>

            <li> Royal oud is amazing and is in my creed top 2 second to aventus. This review I am doing is more about the authenticity. If you would like to know more about the notes and smell please read the other reviews or go to creedboutique.com. First off I&#x27;m an avid creed fan and this was my first purchase from an online vendor let alone from a \\&quot;discounted source\\&quot; I&#x27;ve always payed full price from Neiman&#x27;s or from the creed boutique in NYC where I am from. That being said I&#x27;ve always been curious about how amazon and other discount sites can 1. Even Obtain creed at all because of its very strict distribution regulations and 2. Sell it at such deep discounts. Upon  doing some research i learned about the \\&quot;grey market\\&quot; and this is where 99% if not 100% of these creeds are comming from on sites like amazon or the 3rd party sellers such as fragrance net (this is we&#x27;re I ordered mine from via amazon) and beauty encounter to name a few. The way these creeds are obtained are imports from the Middle East that then sell there stock back to US distributors who then sell to people like us at a discount. For some reason the Middle East is able to sell them back for much cheaper and still make a profit which kind of makes me wonder how much it really costs to make but that&#x27;s another story.  When I received the royal oud I Immediately compared the packaging and bottle to all my other bottles and packaging so I knew what to look for to see if it was genuine. I also had samples of royal oud obtained from Neiman&#x27;s to compare the smell so I was already familiar with the longevity, sillage and notes as it progressed on my skin. The serial number as a matter a fact only 1 letter off from the sample batch I had from Neiman&#x27;s which I found to be Interesting considering it was a Middle East version. The bottom line is I&#x27;m confident that this is genuine creed. The only things that were different from the other creeds I own was that the creed paper with the history that comes in all boxes that normally has 3or 4  languages( cant remember exactly how many). This one was only in Arabic which would kind make sense because this bottle came from the Middle East. The other difference and one that I&#x27;m still kind of puzzled about is the fact that on the back of the bottle itched in what looks like a lazer it says \\&quot;toilet water PGS\\&quot; then the batch number of the bottle along with a small arabic sticker that i have no clue what it says. The problem is as far as I know creed is only made in milliseme strength which is Equivalent to EDP strength. I do know that parfume volume/ concentration is regulated by the government there for in different countries there are certain rules as to the strength and volume allowed. Fact EDP is stronger and more concentrated then EDT (a simple google will tell you this) so this may or may not be a less concentrated version ie less potent then what is sold at neimans or from creed itself because of the certain laws. I can&#x27;t confirm this but I&#x27;m leaning toward believing this which would account toward why the price is also be lower. I was told by creed itself that they only make ONE strength and this is the only bottle that ive owned or seen anywhere that has toilet water marked anywhere on the box or bottle, you will not see those words or any variation of them if you buy from an \\&quot;authorized source\\&quot; I was also told that  creed DOES NOT sell to these discount sites either but obviously somewhere someone from creed has to be doing so along the way rite?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nut shell: royal oud smells amazing, is very unique and does smell exactly like the sample obtained from an \\&quot;authorized\\&quot; source. Projection and longevity like all creeds are iffy and can vary from person to person depending on body chemistry and You don&#x27;t need to worry about batch variation with this scent like the others. In regards to the authenticity, I&#x27;m confident that this is real deal but I do have some doubts about the whole toilet water PGS thing because all creeds are EDP strength therefore the Middle Eastern version bottles that say toilet water PGS may be of a lesser strength for legal reasons but not noticeably so much when you smell it. When I&#x27;m in need of a new bottle I most likely will buy it at full price to compare that very issue but you may or may not even care about this as much as i do.&lt;br /&gt;Please keep in mind all of this is only my opinion based on research i have done and what I have found and I can&#x27;t speak for any other creed products or scents because this is the only one I bought from a  \\&quot;discounted source\\&quot;.

            <li> I love Creed and when I can get it for the price I paid here versus going to Nieman Marcus or buying it at Creed Boutique, I take advantage of it. Great price for a great product.</li>
            <li> I got this as a present and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. But here&#x27;s the reason why this stuff sells for cheap. It sells for low prices at these places because they are old batches. Take a look at the production date on the lot number. 5th and 6th digit on lower back of bottle and on the box. That being said, most of these are from 2010, 2011,2012 and most people know that fragrances last between 3-5 years. So if you buy one and its from 2010 and its 2014 then there&#x27;s a real possibility that that fragrance may turn soon. There&#x27;s the reason for low prices. I doubt Creed would sell anything that wasn&#x27;t produced the within a few months of sale, considering the price. That being said $125 for 1-2 years of heaven isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> Royal oud is a wonderful scent. Would buy again! More than I expected, really does its thing when applied and then going outside. Something about when the air mixes with it, heavenly! IMO</li>
            <li> I am not sure this is the original stuff. i have been using for over a month now, I get no complements at all. no even a single one. Instead i get more complements from the $16 Iceberg Twice cologne i bought together with the expensive Creed Oud. I am totally disappointed.  I will not recommend it at all. Fake, Fake Fake.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an oud based fragrance, this isn&#x27;t for you. In fact, I detect very little, if any, in this. What it &amp;#34;lacks&amp;#34; in oud, it makes up for in Royalty, sophistication. When you spray this, you immediately smell rich, suave, mature gentleman. Not man, gentleman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not for some young boy trying to impress his date. This is for the young man that is asking his woman for her hand in marriage. This is for your anniversary dinner at a niche restaurant in your sportcoat or suit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is money, fellas.</li>
            <li> Awesome scent!!! This is the Real Deal from Beauty Encounter!  Shipping was fast and the cologne is completely authentic, just not initially intended for the US market.  But it IS the real stuff.</li>
            <li> I bought Royal Oud after reading the reviews on Amazon and does it ever smell cheap and bad. In fact, the bottle I received smells like a cheap version of CK Obsession, but even worse than that.&lt;br /&gt;I would never consider buying a creed product through Amazon again...</li>
            <li> This is my standard.  I really like the leather/tobacco scent.</li>
            <li> this is one of my favorite creed cologne,my top two creed cologne are silver mountain water and now the Royal Oud.I have alot of cologne,i have the green irish tweed as well,the green irish tweed use to be one of the best to me but it is just among the pack now.Their is alot of good colognes out there now and unlike before when green irish tweed stood out.I have new harlem by bond N0 9,it isn&#x27;t as good as this royal Oud,wall street is crab,d only thing good about it is the name and nothing more,i wear it mostly to the gym and will not dare wear it any place else.I love the YSL Lanuit and that&#x27;ss in my top 5.The Royal Oud is class,confidence,i am an interesting man ,i know i am sexy kind of swag.It is a strong cologne and i will definitely recommend it over anything out there.Pls the Creed Aventus is all hype,the projection sucks and it probably last 2-3hrs max and i am even being generous.The Creed Royal oud is a revelation and my new go to cologne.Trust me u will definitely standout in a black tie event.You can wear it anywhere but it is akin to driving a Royce Rolls to do grocery shopping rather than driving it to a black tie event or a powerful date night at the opera.</li>
            <li> I own some real nice colognes from Creed to Altelier and at first smell Aka the &amp;#34;Top note&amp;#34; I didn&#x27;t like this cologne. Then a a few seconds later the smell of Heaven reviled itself! It smell&#x27;s so good it&#x27;s now my new favorite cologne!&lt;br /&gt;Here is my favorite Creed colognes from the ones I have a privilege to own! 1.Royal Oud 2.Silver Mountain Water 3.Virgin island water 4.Green Irish Tweed 5.Aventus</li>
            <li> I bought this from Amazon thinking I would get the real thing and it being Creed I would have a fantastic cologne. It is the most foul smelling cologne I have ever tried, I cant wear it. I cant imagine Creed making something that smells this bad. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> So I saw this in a local store and could not stop smelling it! It was like nothing I had smelled before.. If you are looking for something mysterious this is what you want! You will be the only one of your friends wearing this!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because Creed and the department stores swear that anything nothing from Neimans, Bergdorf or their website is a knock off.  I would only buy from the seller Amazon, LLC.  I gambled and won.  This is it.  I will never buy a bottle from Neimans again.  Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have silver mountain water and green Irish tweed already. This scent works best on me. Smells like smoke and cash with a dash of class. Very pleased ordering from here.</li>
            <li> Excellent scent.. Definitely a winner!!</li>
            <li> While I sometimes Creed fragrances are overpowering, this one hits the mark.  If you prefer a scent that challenges the nose, this is the one.  Scents of spice, vanilla and tobacco stand out.  I have had multiple comments on how good it smells.  Price is great as well.</li>
            <li> Creed fragrances are my favorites, but too expensive for my budget.  A Creed perfumer was at my local Saks store and shared the Royal Oud.  The price was just too much for me.  I purchased Bois du Portugal instead.  The sales rep gave me a generous sample of Royal Oud with my next Creed purchase.  I was leery of buying fragrance online, but trusted &amp;#34;sold by Amazon,&amp;#34; and gave  this a chance.  This is the real deal, not a fake.  It&#x27;s the same as my sample.  You must use this sparingly as it can be overbearing.  Just a little spray will put a smile on your face and stay there throughout the day or evening.  Only people who get close to you will smell it.  The Amazon price was manageable, especially if you use the fragrance sparingly as I suggested.</li>
            <li> Creed&#x27;s Royal Oud is outstanding.  A manly long lasting scent that can carry on into the evening when it needs to without being over-powering.  Recomended.</li>
            <li> Very nice long lasting fragrance. Very subtle and clean... Gives you more of a. &amp;#34;Presence&amp;#34; than a smell. The only drawback is it is a little pricey.</li>
            <li> Just as I was about to shell out the full price at Barney&#x27;s for what I think is Creed&#x27;s most interesting new scent, my favorite along with Vetiver, I checked Amazon.  You almost never see Creed at a discount in a major store, so I briefly worried that it was a knockoff.  Nope.  Same product.  Whether you like it is a personal choice, but if you use their classic men&#x27;s scents, I would say this is worth trying.  Typical Creed: smells like you are wearing a distilled product of nature, not some chemical.</li>
            <li> Creed is somewhat of an &amp;#34;insiders&amp;#34; fragrance in the U.S.  Distribution isn&#x27;t exactly wide-spread as it is commonly only available at the super-premium department stores and boutiques.  Limited distribution and pricing above the mass-market makes Creed somewhat under the radar for mass consumption.  That&#x27;s O.K. because Amazon is on the scene giving you the opportunity to have this wonderful unique line delivered right to your door...And, importantly at much more attractive pricing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this for my daughter who is a bit of a fashionista connoisseur and she couldn&#x27;t be more delighted.  I&#x27;ll refer you to other reviewers for the details on the aura (I don&#x27;t pretend to be qualified to review a primarily female fragrance), but I will say she has mentioned the quality shows as it lasts and lasts never failing to elicit compliments and questions as to what the wonderful perfume is she&#x27;s wearing.  The fact a little goes a long way and the amazing appeal simply justifies the price.  Interested?  Don&#x27;t hesitate as Amazon is actually doing a favor to the customer making it available at a real world cost.  BTW, I wear several of the unisex Creed selections myself and have received my share of compliments too!  Bottom line is Creed is one of the few very top purveyors of world-class scents.</li>
            <li> Royal Oud is a fantastic smell that really doesn&#x27;t compare to what you would typically smell at the cologne counter at the mall. The scent will last when you spray it on your body or clothes and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little apprehensive to buy Creed cologne on Amazon but this was the real deal. I have a sample from the last time I was at Neiman Marcus and it smells and wears exactly the same. It costs about half on the internet as is does at the store. I already have 3 other scents, Tabarome, Silver mountain water and Original Santal. If you are looking for a unique scent where you will know that you won&#x27;t smell like everyone else Creed will not disappoint you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying to describe a scent over the internet is a little silly just know this stuff smells and wears great.</li>
            <li> If you buy direct from amazon, like i did, you do not have to worry, it is authentic and what a great price, who would want to pay retail when theres great prices available from amazon. The one I received came with the arabic pamphlet because it was originally made for the Saudi Market, after asking amazon about it. So do not freak out if you get one with arabic, also mine does say &amp;#34;toilet water pgs&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Eau De Parfum&amp;#34; on the lable on the bottom of the box, with a sticker on the bottom of a bottle with arabic writing. I think this is why it is discounted because it was imported from the Saudi Market, so they are able to get a lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is amazing, it makes me feel relaxed, and happy.</li>
