            <li>They could be a bit larger, but overall a good product</li>
            <li>If you want large dense cotton balls to soak up a lot of product or to break apart and use as needed.</li>

            <li>I dont know how much you&#x27;d expect from cotton balls</li>
            <li>They are about 1/2 the size; thus the price is too high for the value.  </li>
            <li>These are your standard cotton balls, exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Pretty simple review...its cotton balls...</li>
            <li>They are Jumbo, soft, white, clean, absorbent, did I say soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, did I use enough words for this review?</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t go wrong with a great big bag o&#x27; cotton balls.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin and have never had a reaction to any beauty product before, but SOMETHING on or in these cotton balls caused me to have a hives-like reaction when using them.  </li>
            <li>They are okay but not quite as thick as I like them to be.  </li>

            <li> If you want large dense cotton balls to soak up a lot of product or to break apart and use as needed. these are perfect. however they are not JUMBO in size, just large but they are dense so it makes up for it.</li>
            <li> These are NOT JUMBO SIZE cotton balls.  They are about 1/2 the size; thus the price is too high for the value.  I returned them.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about this product, I was lazy to go to the store and purchased it online and it was good.</li>

            <li> These are good cotton balls at a very good price. Good for cleaning your skin and can also be used for school projects if you have kids.</li>
            <li> These are NOT jumbo at all. They are standard size, if not smaller.Not what I expected when I was ordering. Probably won&#x27;t buy this again and just go to the market.</li>
            <li> Great for putting on toner or using makeup remover or nail polish remover.  Very soft and delicate on my skin..</li>
            <li> This work great when doing my nails or cleaning my pets ears and eyes.  The size and quality are great to work with.</li>
            <li> Pretty simple review...its cotton balls...lol. I use them mostly for removing nail polish. They could be a bit larger, but overall a good product</li>

            <li> product as described. good quality- no complains. satisfied customer and will repeat order in the future. Would also refer to friends</li>
            <li> Very happy with these cotton balls. Great price. It only takes one to remove my nail polish. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed when I found out I paid too much.. I got 400 cotton balls for less the price I paid for just 100 from Walmart.. Nothing wrong with the item</li>
            <li> Jumbo cotton balls that were good quality. I was pleased with this purchase and would buy them again. Being able to order as an add-on was a plus.</li>
            <li> It would take about 10 of these tiny cotton balls to equal jumbo size.&lt;br /&gt;They are practically useless with nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cotton balls. They work just like all other cotton balls. They&#x27;re cotton in ball form. They work. They&#x27;re large.</li>
            <li> They are Jumbo, soft, white, clean, absorbent, did I say soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, did I use enough words for this review?</li>
            <li> Nice size for larger areas.</li>
            <li> Despite the description, these cotton balls are actually small.  If you want large ones, don&#x27;t get these.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> They are okay but not quite as thick as I like them to be.  They do the job but not what I was expecting</li>
            <li> They are cotton balls.  Not much to say.  Cheaper than in the groceries at least at the time when I bought it.</li>
            <li> Softest cotton balls I ever ordered. Arrived promptly as well. I add a drop of the peppermint oil I ordered and leave it all over the house.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Size I needed was JUMBO...and thats what they are.</li>
            <li> GREAT VALUE AND JUST AS EXPECTED PERFECT</li>
            <li> Well, they&#x27;re cotton balls. They work fine, I guess, but they might break apart more easily than others. Do all cotton balls break apart like this?</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin and have never had a reaction to any beauty product before, but SOMETHING on or in these cotton balls caused me to have a hives-like reaction when using them.  I had red bumps all over my face for several days before they disappeared.  I do not recommend this brand.</li>
            <li> Nothing special...just basic cotton balls for a good value.  Product is as described and arrived with no damages to the package.</li>
            <li> I one that compares Dollar Stire Brand to other brands. Why buy 3 packs to do the jobof one pack of quality ones. You only get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;Prove was evident when my wife cleaned her nails with one cotton ball,when it normally to three of the dollar store brand.</li>
            <li> I occasionally find myself in need of cottons balls for random things.&lt;br /&gt;Decided to just order a pack to keep on hand.&lt;br /&gt;These seem pretty normal...I dont know how much you&#x27;d expect from cotton balls but they&#x27;re good enough for me.</li>
            <li> Yep it&#x27;s cotton balls.</li>
            <li> Good cotton balls took my nail polish off fine. The price was the only thing that bothered me because I used to get the same amount of cotton balls for around $2 at my local store, but these work just as well.</li>
            <li> These Balls are thick and robust and work great!</li>
            <li> cheap lookng deivce and broke within a week</li>
            <li> i bought this and these are great but unfortunately i spotted a full size bag in Walmart for only $1.88 and hands down it beats this price.</li>
