            <li>I&#x27;ll have to continue my search for a great Shampoo &amp; Conditioner</li>
            <li>Great product at a great price</li>
            <li>This works great and doesn&#x27;t strip the color out of my hair.</li>
            <li>This is truly a great product accomplishing what it should.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo.</li>
            <li>And even better, it&#x27;s conditioner too- all in one!!</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful smell and my feels refreshing after you wash it and get out the shower.</li>
            <li>Ive tried this, and while it smells good, lathers great, and save time</li>
            <li>Seems like most reviews you see on Amazon are all 5 star, perfectly written reviews, almost like they were written by the company themselves....</li>
            <li>This is a good option for sulfate-free shampoo.</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells good too.</li>
            <li>Just a dab creates a good amount to lather.  </li>
            <li>but not as good as I was hoping</li>
            <li>I encourage everyone to look up the ingredients of this abomination, then go to acure organics, john masters for really good shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Good shampoo I like it.</li>
            <li>Good shampoo + conditioner</li>
            <li>it just doesn&#x27;t do a good job for me.</li>
            <li>good smell/fragrance as well....</li>
            <li>Good product,</li>
            <li>Very good and easy on your hair</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need anything fancy - and the fact that this is a time saver on top of everything else is great.</li>
            <li>Ok I&#x27;m baffled by all the great reviews.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is the right combo of perfect.  </li>
            <li>Awesome product &amp; fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>I was searching for a sulfate free shampoo and this turned out to be an easy 2-in-1 that works great, cleans, conditions, and refreshes!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simply amazing.</li>
            <li>This sulfate free 2-in-1 is great for curly hair.</li>
            <li>I recieved a bunch of PM products from a hair stylist and when I tried this shampoo I couldn&#x27;t believe how much I liked it.  </li>
            <li>Nice fragrance that&#x27;s not over powering.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell too it also.</li>
            <li>Here is an honest review of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is awesome shampoo, it helped so much with the dandruff I was dealing with.  </li>
            <li>My husband loves how nice his hair feels afterwards, and it has a nice, not overpowering manly scent to it.</li>
            <li>Thrilled and am a lady.</li>
            <li>After reading the tons of five star reviews about how good this product is, I was extremely confident in this product, and it turns out my confidence was well placed.</li>
            <li>Am I impressed though, and does it live up to its cost?</li>
            <li>This is by far the BEST Shampoo i have ever bought.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair very clean and ideal for styling, or leaving it exactly the way it is.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-&lt;br /&gt;Works great, smells nice, and is a real keeper.  </li>
            <li>Ifyou don&#x27;t have major dandruff problems, or are the Organic bandwagon, this shampoo is perfect for a guy.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my son and he states that it does exactly what it is supposed to do and smells great.</li>
            <li>I am pleased as it does not contain skin damaging, corrosive, sodium lauryl sulfate.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite shampoo.  </li>
            <li>We love this at home.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>This is one of the better men&#x27;s shampoos.  </li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>Great product HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend, and he seems to love it.</li>
            <li>It is sulfate free, and has a nice man-ly smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;He likes it because it does have the conditioner so its non dying.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have dandruff, and an itchy scalp like most guys.</li>
            <li>Love the way it holds my hair without needing additional products.  </li>
            <li>Looks fuller and doesn&#x27;t have the greasy feeling like most shampoos with conditioners.</li>
            <li>No sulfates shampoo&#x27;s usually don&#x27;t later well, this one is the best!</li>
            <li>okay if I use a lot of it).  </li>
            <li>This product has no grit and appears to be more watery?</li>
            <li>I love the built-in conditioner, no need to buy conditioner.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband and son and they love it.  </li>
            <li>I also use Paul Mitchell products and my hair has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t get any better than that</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I just got this two weeks ago and I already love it.</li>
            <li>I used about 2x more than I&#x27;ve ever used of any shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re a guy who&#x27;s looking for a great shampoo, I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Also, it is very concentrated so you don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot of it each time... great for the price!</li>
            <li>While it has no moisturizing, or volumizing, or any kind of specific purpoe for the shampoo, this was the first SLS-free shampoo that made my hair freakin awesome looking.</li>
            <li>Usually I am not a fan of 2-in-1 products, but this is great and works well.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is sulfate free, much better for your hair.</li>
            <li>She remarked that it is not heavily perfumed, but has a very clean and pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>Scalp doesn&#x27;t itch and feels clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling clean without it being dry or oily - a perfect balance for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall a good shampoo despite the rather high price, recommended.</li>
            <li>Smell is pleasant but fairly neutral and not powerful so it doesn&#x27;t clash with whatever else you&#x27;re putting in your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this product is fine by itself to wash and condition</li>
            <li>Easy to take on the road, works well, smells light.</li>
            <li>I am super picky and think most products suck.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it produce great suds/foam, but cleans and conditions hair so well that my wife complimented me on the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s sulfate free, I feel it strips the hair</li>
            <li>SLS free makes the difference.  </li>
            <li>Like the sulfate free formula.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want your hair to fall out or lose your hair color, buy sulfate free products.  </li>
            <li>do enjoy the fact that it lathers up so well</li>
            <li>and I got free shipping ....</li>
            <li>Keeps my head free of flakes.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Being Sulfate free is a bonus.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo but keep in mind a little goes a long way, for being sulfate free, this stuff lathers great!</li>
            <li>Thanks Paul Mitchell!!!</li>
            <li>The shampoo has a very nice scent that is reminiscent of cologne but doesn&#x27;t come off too</li>
            <li>It leaves my oil-prone yet frizzy hair smooth, bouncy, and squeaky clean without being too drying.</li>
            <li>This product leaves your hair feeling clean light and not weighed</li>
            <li>Great product for my teenage son, and quick seller.  </li>
            <li>I originally received a sample after a 10k charity run and ended up buying this to carry around in my Tri bag.</li>
            <li>I had to use a huge hand full of this stuff to get it through my hair and to lather.  </li>
            <li>Most of the sulfate free product lists I could find contained a lot of shampoos geared towards females which would be an absolute no-go with my traditionalist sons.  </li>
            <li>As a gal with s&#x27;wavy hair, I have difficulty finding sulfate-free products that effectively clean my hair without leaving it greasy or weighed-down.</li>
            <li>I was happy with this, since it meant my hair wasn&#x27;t dry throughout the day</li>
            <li>and I made it to the end of the day looking clean.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair clean and manageable.</li>
            <li>Clean feeling after wash.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Leave my hair clean and manageble for two days.</li>
            <li>so you really have no clue how good it really is.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say there is anything special about it.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo/conditioner is perfect for using after a lap pool swim or hard gym workout.  </li>
            <li>Worked great the first wash then the 2nd wash my hair</li>
            <li>Good product especially when one is on the go.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m loving it so far.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m sure everyone wanted to see a real review that wasn&#x27;t written by a company.</li>
            <li>I purchased this after reading several reviews talking about how good of a job it does for your hair, cleaning and conditioning it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a guy and you want a good shampoo, then I DEFINITELY recommend this one, you will not regret your purchase if you buy one.</li>
            <li>First sulfate free shampoo that I have used that truly lathers and does not leave hair oily.</li>
            <li>My scalp felt normally cleaned, not dried out, but not oily, perfect and my hair feels noticeably softer and definitely shinier, but I guess we can attribute this to the fact that it does have silicones in the ingredients.</li>
            <li>A little dime size is all you need for great lather.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair shiny, smooth and very manageable.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth a try--once in a while we can splurge---would purchase again?--</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean and has a nice shine to it without feeling two dry or oily.  </li>
            <li>though, it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>This shampoo is a nice change, especially for the warmer months, because we are in the pool every day, and my hair looks like hay.  </li>
            <li>stuff is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Being a combination product it works quite nicely for my eldest who has relatively long hair that actually needs a bit of quality product to keep nice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit to knowing next to nothing when it comes to hair care products and would normally just buy whatever looks good at the store.  </li>
            <li>The higher price from the salon is well worth it.</li>
            <li>It actually means it is more economical than cheaper inferior brands.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair and best part is I don&#x27;t really need any product in my hair after I dry it off, it stays in place.  </li>
            <li>It is very cost effective, since one tube can last for a year or longer.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Sulfate free doesnt mean good.</li>
            <li>Works better than other sulfate free shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>He really likes this stuff!</li>
            <li>A nice shampoo/conditioner combo, but not what I expected.  </li>
            <li>I used Paul Mitchell products years ago but hadn&#x27;t been able to find them locally.</li>
            <li>Being a female, I love the product.</li>
            <li>I am just some amazed guy writing a review to somehow help the interested ones.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately with every SLS-Free shampoo in sight, there are a million 5 star perfect reviews for each one</li>
            <li>I have always been interested in all-in-one shampoo/conditioners but have never tried them before.</li>
            <li>This is the first sulfate-free shampoo I ever used, and I like to say that this product converted me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different shampoo and conditioners and was looking for something that didn&#x27;t make my hair frizz.</li>
            <li>(Most likely separate from one another.)</li>
            <li>I got my first sample of this from the girl who cuts my hair as a Christmas gift.  </li>
            <li>It does not dry out my hair, like many others, and it is gentle.  </li>
            <li>(a large part of it&#x27;s higher quality in my opinion) and is acceptable to the offspring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You better believe I thought a long while before I was going to pay 17 bucks for a shampoo.</li>
            <li>I had tried many dandruff shampoos and was still dealing with dry scalp.  </li>
            <li>Easy to style your hair following wash.&lt;br</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s sulfate free, but be aware that it does contain several silicones and parabens.  </li>
            <li>I know this is not a therapy shampoo, but it certainly does the trick for me.</li>
            <li>After a few weeks of using this most of my dandruff was gone!</li>
            <li>, even though it&#x27;s a shampoo and conditioner, it doesn&#x27;t condition much at all.</li>
            <li>Double Hitter Sulfate Free 2-in-1 Shampoo and...</li>
            <li>Hair looks much shinier.  </li>
            <li>this shampoo makes it so much easier.</li>
            <li>You really have to try this to appreciate its greatness.</li>
            <li>Double Hitter is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I really can see and feel a difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li>We only buy products that are sulfate free</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Also, my hair are much straighter and feel nicer...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Get rid of the silicones and parabens, and you&#x27;ll have a real winner.</li>
            <li>price is definitely higher than what most shampoos would be at a grocery store but only a little bit is required to create a nice lather so it should last quite a while as well.  </li>
            <li>I tried Mitch due to the natural ingredients and was thrilled to find that I don&#x27;t have to use gel products after washing my hair to subdue my hair that frizzes after shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>--it&#x27;s a sad day when you realize your 14 year old son has hair much better than your own, and he is completely oblivious to just how lucky he is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff works extremely well for my hair in comparison to many others.  </li>
            <li>I use and love Avalon Shampoo and Avalon Conditioner after being unsatisfied with all other brands.  </li>
            <li>all that did was severely dry out of my scalp, which i loved at first because it was extremely oily, but now its very dry and looking for something that gently cleans, sort of like baby shampoo, but that was sulfate free.</li>
            <li>This one is obviously &#x27;for men&#x27; so after a quick glance they started using it without comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this fact and now only use gel for a night out, not daily as I used to have to use gel.</li>
            <li>I color my hair, because I&#x27;m older than I look.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I was a little concerned about it being sulfate free at first ..</li>
            <li>Being a daily shampoo user, this product will last me a along time as all you need is literally the size of large pea to work up a huge lather.  </li>
            <li>Tried this from a salon (worked fine) and a bottle from Amazon (texture seemed really liquidy compared to the previous stuff, but it seems to work</li>
            <li>Worth the extra price.</li>
            <li>My barber (who is one of the most well-known in Chicago) told me my hair was drying out, so I shouldn&#x27;t wash it everyday</li>
            <li>Normally, this is removed by sulfates, which this shampoo doesn&#x27;t have.  </li>
            <li>any case, this is much nicer than the typical over the counter shampoo/conditioner type product, has the advantage of being sulfate free</li>
            <li>Having a 9 year old and a 14 year old I needed something clearly &#x27;manly&#x27; and wanted a sulfate free shampoo they would actually use.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that it&#x27;s sulfate free but other than that</li>
            <li>combs through after shower, while still wet, pretty well but not as smooth as a regular conditioner.</li>
            <li>:  Pretty minor, however I&#x27;m annoyed with how quickly the top of the cap will fill up with water.  </li>
            <li>I first tried this product at my local hair cut place.</li>
            <li>I of course said no because it is always ridiculously marked up!</li>
            <li>If it isn&#x27;t enough on a particular day, I just add a little bit more.</li>
            <li>with some it tends to dry hair too much---for me, a male, it works fine---</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if sulfate free shampoos have this benefit or not, but I have been seeing much much less hair in my hands after lathering up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>you only need a small amount to get a lot of lather and it leaves your hair (and beard) clean and super soft.  </li>
            <li>All other 2 in 1 shampoo/conditioners cause my scalp to mildly breakout.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair manageable and not dried out.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really help out my itchy scalp at all, which is the only point i wanted to go SLS-free, and the ingredients aren&#x27;t....</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have a masculine scent either</li>
            <li>It seems to clean my hair but the conditioning portion is nearly non-existent, my hair is left feeling extremely dry and</li>
            <li>My hair is now soft and flows like the wings upon a cherubim.  </li>
            <li>This is really the only one I&#x27;ve found on here.  </li>
            <li>I tend to have thick hair, and I&#x27;m growing it longer now, going to order one more bottle and see.</li>
            <li>Good shampoo and conditioner because you only have to use a little bit which makes it last a long time.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s pretty neutral and when my hair is dry</li>
            <li>A little amount of the shampoo creates a robust amount of lather, and leaves the scalp feeling clean after use.</li>
            <li>I love what it does to my hair, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about serious reactions or damaging my scalp or hair with sulfate-free.</li>
            <li>, the very smallest dab is all that is needed to get a head full of lather, I have been using the same tube for a year and wash my hair everyday, its still not empty.  </li>
            <li>The first time i used it you can immediately tell the difference from the other shampoos.</li>
            <li>It will change your hair like no other product.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way - I have hair down to my mid to lower back and only need to use a dime-sized amount, so this bottle lasts forever, making it a great value.</li>
            <li>I think if I keep using this product, then I will regain my natural hair color, which is dirty blonde, because my hair has been damaged over the years and has turned brown from shampoos with sulfates, and since this shampoo is sulfate free, it will clean my hair, and allow it to heal from all the damage I&#x27;ve caused it by using shampoo with sulfates.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use this for a very long time, but it seems like a decent shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Needed a sulfate free shampoo/conditioner combo on those days I am running late and don&#x27;t have time to fully condition my hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say my hair feels any better or worse than before I started using it.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair clean, and requires only a small amount.</li>
            <li>impressing at all for a shampoo that is supposed to be gentle due to no sulfates, but, I have to admit.</li>
            <li>expensive for a shampoo---a tiny bit goes a long way, as described---cleans well and only one time is good</li>
            <li>Gentle enough to be used every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We live in Colorado and it&#x27;s very dry here.</li>
            <li>Plus, it is sulfate free which is a big plus, since sodium lauryl/laureth sulfate can cause acne, and is not good for your skin.</li>
            <li>The bottle may seem small but it lasts quite a while, you really do not need much to lather up really well.</li>
            <li>It also lathers up very well, a little</li>
            <li>I read SLS was bad and embarked on a journey of a good SLS-Free shampoo.</li>

            <li> This is truly a great product accomplishing what it should.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo.</li>
            <li> And even better, it&#x27;s conditioner too- all in one!!</li>
            <li> It has a wonderful smell and my feels refreshing after you wash it and get out the shower.</li>
            <li> Ive tried this, and while it smells good, lathers great, and save time</li>
            <li> Seems like most reviews you see on Amazon are all 5 star, perfectly written reviews, almost like they were written by the company themselves....</li>
            <li> This is a good option for sulfate-free shampoo.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells good too.</li>
            <li> Just a dab creates a good amount to lather.  </li>
            <li> but not as good as I was hoping</li>
            <li> I encourage everyone to look up the ingredients of this abomination, then go to acure organics, john masters for really good shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Good shampoo I like it.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo + conditioner</li>
            <li> it just doesn&#x27;t do a good job for me.</li>
            <li> good smell/fragrance as well....</li>
            <li> Good product,</li>
            <li> Very good and easy on your hair</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need anything fancy - and the fact that this is a time saver on top of everything else is great.</li>
            <li> Ok I&#x27;m baffled by all the great reviews.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is the right combo of perfect.  </li>
            <li> Awesome product &amp; fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> I was searching for a sulfate free shampoo and this turned out to be an easy 2-in-1 that works great, cleans, conditions, and refreshes!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply amazing.</li>
            <li> This sulfate free 2-in-1 is great for curly hair.</li>
            <li> I recieved a bunch of PM products from a hair stylist and when I tried this shampoo I couldn&#x27;t believe how much I liked it.  </li>
            <li> Nice fragrance that&#x27;s not over powering.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell too it also.</li>
            <li> Here is an honest review of this shampoo.</li>

            <li> My husband loves how nice his hair feels afterwards, and it has a nice, not overpowering manly scent to it.</li>
            <li> Thrilled and am a lady.</li>
            <li> After reading the tons of five star reviews about how good this product is, I was extremely confident in this product, and it turns out my confidence was well placed.</li>
            <li> Am I impressed though, and does it live up to its cost?</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST Shampoo i have ever bought.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair very clean and ideal for styling, or leaving it exactly the way it is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-&lt;br /&gt;Works great, smells nice, and is a real keeper.  </li>
            <li> Ifyou don&#x27;t have major dandruff problems, or are the Organic bandwagon, this shampoo is perfect for a guy.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my son and he states that it does exactly what it is supposed to do and smells great.</li>
            <li> I am pleased as it does not contain skin damaging, corrosive, sodium lauryl sulfate.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo.  </li>
            <li> We love this at home.</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better men&#x27;s shampoos.  </li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> Great product HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend, and he seems to love it.</li>
            <li> It is sulfate free, and has a nice man-ly smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;He likes it because it does have the conditioner so its non dying.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have dandruff, and an itchy scalp like most guys.</li>
            <li> Love the way it holds my hair without needing additional products.  </li>
            <li> Looks fuller and doesn&#x27;t have the greasy feeling like most shampoos with conditioners.</li>
            <li> No sulfates shampoo&#x27;s usually don&#x27;t later well, this one is the best!</li>
            <li> okay if I use a lot of it).  </li>
            <li> This product has no grit and appears to be more watery?</li>
            <li> I love the built-in conditioner, no need to buy conditioner.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and son and they love it.  </li>
            <li> I also use Paul Mitchell products and my hair has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t get any better than that</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I just got this two weeks ago and I already love it.</li>
            <li> I used about 2x more than I&#x27;ve ever used of any shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re a guy who&#x27;s looking for a great shampoo, I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Also, it is very concentrated so you don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot of it each time... great for the price!</li>
            <li> While it has no moisturizing, or volumizing, or any kind of specific purpoe for the shampoo, this was the first SLS-free shampoo that made my hair freakin awesome looking.</li>
            <li> Usually I am not a fan of 2-in-1 products, but this is great and works well.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is sulfate free, much better for your hair.</li>
            <li> She remarked that it is not heavily perfumed, but has a very clean and pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> Scalp doesn&#x27;t itch and feels clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling clean without it being dry or oily - a perfect balance for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall a good shampoo despite the rather high price, recommended.</li>
            <li> Smell is pleasant but fairly neutral and not powerful so it doesn&#x27;t clash with whatever else you&#x27;re putting in your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this product is fine by itself to wash and condition</li>
            <li> Easy to take on the road, works well, smells light.</li>
            <li> I am super picky and think most products suck.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it produce great suds/foam, but cleans and conditions hair so well that my wife complimented me on the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s sulfate free, I feel it strips the hair</li>
            <li> SLS free makes the difference.  </li>
            <li> Like the sulfate free formula.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want your hair to fall out or lose your hair color, buy sulfate free products.  </li>
            <li> do enjoy the fact that it lathers up so well</li>
            <li> and I got free shipping ....</li>
            <li> Keeps my head free of flakes.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Being Sulfate free is a bonus.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo but keep in mind a little goes a long way, for being sulfate free, this stuff lathers great!</li>
            <li> Thanks Paul Mitchell!!!</li>
            <li> The shampoo has a very nice scent that is reminiscent of cologne but doesn&#x27;t come off too</li>
            <li> It leaves my oil-prone yet frizzy hair smooth, bouncy, and squeaky clean without being too drying.</li>
            <li> This product leaves your hair feeling clean light and not weighed</li>
            <li> Great product for my teenage son, and quick seller.  </li>
            <li> I originally received a sample after a 10k charity run and ended up buying this to carry around in my Tri bag.</li>
            <li> I had to use a huge hand full of this stuff to get it through my hair and to lather.  </li>
            <li> Most of the sulfate free product lists I could find contained a lot of shampoos geared towards females which would be an absolute no-go with my traditionalist sons.  </li>
            <li> As a gal with s&#x27;wavy hair, I have difficulty finding sulfate-free products that effectively clean my hair without leaving it greasy or weighed-down.</li>
            <li> I was happy with this, since it meant my hair wasn&#x27;t dry throughout the day</li>
            <li> and I made it to the end of the day looking clean.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair clean and manageable.</li>
            <li> Clean feeling after wash.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Leave my hair clean and manageble for two days.</li>
            <li> so you really have no clue how good it really is.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say there is anything special about it.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo/conditioner is perfect for using after a lap pool swim or hard gym workout.  </li>
            <li> Worked great the first wash then the 2nd wash my hair</li>
            <li> Good product especially when one is on the go.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m loving it so far.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m sure everyone wanted to see a real review that wasn&#x27;t written by a company.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading several reviews talking about how good of a job it does for your hair, cleaning and conditioning it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a guy and you want a good shampoo, then I DEFINITELY recommend this one, you will not regret your purchase if you buy one.</li>
            <li> First sulfate free shampoo that I have used that truly lathers and does not leave hair oily.</li>
            <li> My scalp felt normally cleaned, not dried out, but not oily, perfect and my hair feels noticeably softer and definitely shinier, but I guess we can attribute this to the fact that it does have silicones in the ingredients.</li>
            <li> A little dime size is all you need for great lather.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair shiny, smooth and very manageable.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth a try--once in a while we can splurge---would purchase again?--</li>
            <li> My hair feels clean and has a nice shine to it without feeling two dry or oily.  </li>
            <li> though, it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a nice change, especially for the warmer months, because we are in the pool every day, and my hair looks like hay.  </li>
            <li> stuff is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being a combination product it works quite nicely for my eldest who has relatively long hair that actually needs a bit of quality product to keep nice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit to knowing next to nothing when it comes to hair care products and would normally just buy whatever looks good at the store.  </li>
            <li> The higher price from the salon is well worth it.</li>
            <li> It actually means it is more economical than cheaper inferior brands.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair and best part is I don&#x27;t really need any product in my hair after I dry it off, it stays in place.  </li>
            <li> It is very cost effective, since one tube can last for a year or longer.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Sulfate free doesnt mean good.</li>
            <li> Works better than other sulfate free shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> He really likes this stuff!</li>
            <li> A nice shampoo/conditioner combo, but not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I used Paul Mitchell products years ago but hadn&#x27;t been able to find them locally.</li>
            <li> Being a female, I love the product.</li>
            <li> I am just some amazed guy writing a review to somehow help the interested ones.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately with every SLS-Free shampoo in sight, there are a million 5 star perfect reviews for each one</li>
            <li> I have always been interested in all-in-one shampoo/conditioners but have never tried them before.</li>
            <li> This is the first sulfate-free shampoo I ever used, and I like to say that this product converted me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different shampoo and conditioners and was looking for something that didn&#x27;t make my hair frizz.</li>
            <li> (Most likely separate from one another.)</li>
            <li> I got my first sample of this from the girl who cuts my hair as a Christmas gift.  </li>
            <li> It does not dry out my hair, like many others, and it is gentle.  </li>
            <li> (a large part of it&#x27;s higher quality in my opinion) and is acceptable to the offspring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You better believe I thought a long while before I was going to pay 17 bucks for a shampoo.</li>
            <li> I had tried many dandruff shampoos and was still dealing with dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> Easy to style your hair following wash.&lt;br</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s sulfate free, but be aware that it does contain several silicones and parabens.  </li>
            <li> I know this is not a therapy shampoo, but it certainly does the trick for me.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using this most of my dandruff was gone!</li>
            <li> , even though it&#x27;s a shampoo and conditioner, it doesn&#x27;t condition much at all.</li>
            <li> Double Hitter Sulfate Free 2-in-1 Shampoo and...</li>
            <li> Hair looks much shinier.  </li>
            <li> this shampoo makes it so much easier.</li>
            <li> You really have to try this to appreciate its greatness.</li>
            <li> Double Hitter is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I really can see and feel a difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li> We only buy products that are sulfate free</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Also, my hair are much straighter and feel nicer...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Get rid of the silicones and parabens, and you&#x27;ll have a real winner.</li>
            <li> price is definitely higher than what most shampoos would be at a grocery store but only a little bit is required to create a nice lather so it should last quite a while as well.  </li>
            <li> I tried Mitch due to the natural ingredients and was thrilled to find that I don&#x27;t have to use gel products after washing my hair to subdue my hair that frizzes after shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> --it&#x27;s a sad day when you realize your 14 year old son has hair much better than your own, and he is completely oblivious to just how lucky he is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff works extremely well for my hair in comparison to many others.  </li>
            <li> I use and love Avalon Shampoo and Avalon Conditioner after being unsatisfied with all other brands.  </li>
            <li> all that did was severely dry out of my scalp, which i loved at first because it was extremely oily, but now its very dry and looking for something that gently cleans, sort of like baby shampoo, but that was sulfate free.</li>
            <li> This one is obviously &#x27;for men&#x27; so after a quick glance they started using it without comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this fact and now only use gel for a night out, not daily as I used to have to use gel.</li>
            <li> I color my hair, because I&#x27;m older than I look.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about it being sulfate free at first ..</li>
            <li> Being a daily shampoo user, this product will last me a along time as all you need is literally the size of large pea to work up a huge lather.  </li>
            <li> Tried this from a salon (worked fine) and a bottle from Amazon (texture seemed really liquidy compared to the previous stuff, but it seems to work</li>
            <li> Worth the extra price.</li>
            <li> My barber (who is one of the most well-known in Chicago) told me my hair was drying out, so I shouldn&#x27;t wash it everyday</li>
            <li> Normally, this is removed by sulfates, which this shampoo doesn&#x27;t have.  </li>
            <li> any case, this is much nicer than the typical over the counter shampoo/conditioner type product, has the advantage of being sulfate free</li>
            <li> Having a 9 year old and a 14 year old I needed something clearly &#x27;manly&#x27; and wanted a sulfate free shampoo they would actually use.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s sulfate free but other than that</li>
            <li> combs through after shower, while still wet, pretty well but not as smooth as a regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> :  Pretty minor, however I&#x27;m annoyed with how quickly the top of the cap will fill up with water.  </li>
            <li> I first tried this product at my local hair cut place.</li>
            <li> I of course said no because it is always ridiculously marked up!</li>
            <li> If it isn&#x27;t enough on a particular day, I just add a little bit more.</li>
            <li> with some it tends to dry hair too much---for me, a male, it works fine---</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if sulfate free shampoos have this benefit or not, but I have been seeing much much less hair in my hands after lathering up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> you only need a small amount to get a lot of lather and it leaves your hair (and beard) clean and super soft.  </li>
            <li> All other 2 in 1 shampoo/conditioners cause my scalp to mildly breakout.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair manageable and not dried out.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really help out my itchy scalp at all, which is the only point i wanted to go SLS-free, and the ingredients aren&#x27;t....</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have a masculine scent either</li>
            <li> It seems to clean my hair but the conditioning portion is nearly non-existent, my hair is left feeling extremely dry and</li>
            <li> My hair is now soft and flows like the wings upon a cherubim.  </li>
            <li> This is really the only one I&#x27;ve found on here.  </li>
            <li> I tend to have thick hair, and I&#x27;m growing it longer now, going to order one more bottle and see.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo and conditioner because you only have to use a little bit which makes it last a long time.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s pretty neutral and when my hair is dry</li>
            <li> A little amount of the shampoo creates a robust amount of lather, and leaves the scalp feeling clean after use.</li>
            <li> I love what it does to my hair, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about serious reactions or damaging my scalp or hair with sulfate-free.</li>
            <li> , the very smallest dab is all that is needed to get a head full of lather, I have been using the same tube for a year and wash my hair everyday, its still not empty.  </li>
            <li> The first time i used it you can immediately tell the difference from the other shampoos.</li>
            <li> It will change your hair like no other product.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way - I have hair down to my mid to lower back and only need to use a dime-sized amount, so this bottle lasts forever, making it a great value.</li>
            <li> I think if I keep using this product, then I will regain my natural hair color, which is dirty blonde, because my hair has been damaged over the years and has turned brown from shampoos with sulfates, and since this shampoo is sulfate free, it will clean my hair, and allow it to heal from all the damage I&#x27;ve caused it by using shampoo with sulfates.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use this for a very long time, but it seems like a decent shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Needed a sulfate free shampoo/conditioner combo on those days I am running late and don&#x27;t have time to fully condition my hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say my hair feels any better or worse than before I started using it.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair clean, and requires only a small amount.</li>
            <li> impressing at all for a shampoo that is supposed to be gentle due to no sulfates, but, I have to admit.</li>
            <li> expensive for a shampoo---a tiny bit goes a long way, as described---cleans well and only one time is good</li>
            <li> Gentle enough to be used every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We live in Colorado and it&#x27;s very dry here.</li>
            <li> Plus, it is sulfate free which is a big plus, since sodium lauryl/laureth sulfate can cause acne, and is not good for your skin.</li>
            <li> The bottle may seem small but it lasts quite a while, you really do not need much to lather up really well.</li>
            <li> It also lathers up very well, a little</li>
            <li> I read SLS was bad and embarked on a journey of a good SLS-Free shampoo.</li>
            <li> It lathers pretty well and a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You will be amazed on how it lathers up and that you really need very little each washing.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive scalp (never used to), but recently the tea tree and other types of shampoos can give me dry skin around the hairline.</li>
            <li> Much like everyone says, use a small amount.</li>
            <li> I would recommend for all hair types ESPECIALLY if you have dry or frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> As all hair is different, at least for me I get that conditioner finish but without feeling over-conditioned allowing me to apply other styling products right away to my hair.  </li>
            <li> but of this stuff goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Good product, I hate having to do the shampoo and conditioning process as it is a laborious pain in the neck.</li>
            <li> With my dry scalp she thought it would help...</li>
            <li> I have been experimenting with sulfate-free shampoos for my dry hair for some time now, and this one has made me stop my experimentation.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday and my hair actually stays cleaner with this shampoo than regular sulphate products.  </li>
            <li> This is quite a poor product.&lt;br /&gt;The product is very drying and not good.&lt;br /&gt;There appears to be No DOUBLE</li>
            <li> I have straight, thin hair of partially Asian orientation.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh down or dry out hair with repeated daily use; rinses out well.</li>
            <li> I rock a solid dark brown all the time.  </li>
            <li> This product makes my coarse hair managable once again and its a 2 in 1 which means less clutter in the shower.</li>
            <li> but I think they&#x27;re only half way there.  </li>
            <li> Using it everyday with conditioner, I noticed my hair was never dry after use and at the end of the day it would be oily again.</li>
            <li> Then take another nickel sized drop to actually condition and rid your scalp of dead skin, loose follicles, and oils.  </li>
            <li> This product lasts extremely long time as a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have tried sulphate free shampoos before and always felt my hair was dirty.  </li>
            <li> It has a subtle masculine smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> I mean, that&#x27;s usually how much I pay for shampoo and conditioner in 3-4 years</li>
            <li> You only need very little compared to other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I had tried replacing my PM products with other brands I could find locally but everything left my hair dried out and hard to manage.</li>
            <li> the buy!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve even used this with additional conditioner I have leftover in other bottles, and that just makes it easier to comb through</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous other products over the past two years, but I always return to this one.</li>
            <li> The problem is, when I use product, go to the gym or do other forms of exercise, my hair begins to look greasy if I just rinse thoroughly with water after.</li>
            <li> I almost want to give this 4 stars just because of the price, but because it only requires a small amount, you get a lot of bang for your buck.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just a small amount is enough for my head.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve been having big trouble finding a color-safe MEN&#x27;S shampoo!  </li>
            <li> my hair will be a little dry.  </li>
            <li> I would have never dreamed of throwing down 17 bucks on a shampoo, but I saw this at a salon, and I&#x27;m curious about testing all SLS-free shampoos</li>
            <li> I have short hair, and typically use other premium \\&quot;mens\\&quot; shampoos and have found that other shampoos leave my hair feeling heavy and unable to really style the way I want.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo deserves justice for the way it makes your hair shine, cleans the scalp, and i&#x27;m not kidding, 1 tiny dab produces MASSIVE lather, it feels thick to work into your hair, but you have to use very, very little.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool because it&#x27;s a salon quality hair product that is specifically advertised at least towards men, so you don&#x27;t feel weird buying it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, who could care less what he washes his hair with.  </li>
            <li> You need only a few drops for your head - seriously like the size of your pinky nail and BOOM - TONS of foam.  </li>
            <li> Never experienced that with previous shampoos that sat cap down in the same spot.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair that ends up really dry after showers.</li>
            <li> The product from the salon had a little grit to it.</li>
            <li> Also I have used two in one shampoos and always felt my hair was heavy.  </li>
            <li> so I decided to give this shampoo a try after a few recommendations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely going to get it again and recommend for people with thin hair.</li>
            <li> and my hair is thin and to teh middle of my back.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> I can wash my hair everyday which can strip the oils, not with this product.  </li>
            <li> I have a feeling that dimethicone (a heavy, non-water soluble silicone) could build up over time.  </li>
            <li> It takes a VERY small amount to create quite a bit of lather, so it&#x27;s lasted a lot longer than I expected.  </li>
            <li> but when you take into account that you only need about a dime size for this stuff to lather up, its not that bad, plus its probably better for your hair than all the other crap out there.</li>
            <li> I do find that I have to use just a small amount of conditioner after I shampoo with this or</li>
            <li> No more flakes and itching</li>
            <li> Lathers up with small amount.</li>
            <li> not very good  </li>
            <li> You think it is expensive, but you have not seen how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> Its hard to believe anybody buys products in salons anymore</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and had to use gels to subdue my frizz.</li>
            <li> I mean...</li>
            <li> this product is much less expensive than buying it in a salon.  </li>
            <li> , this is no good for you .</li>
            <li> I have thin hair (bald on crown).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is a poor product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in a rush or just tired.</li>
            <li> I tried not washing it everyday, and it wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> It looks like its expensive</li>
            <li> Im&#x27; wondering if I could have gotten a fake.  </li>
            <li> What do you think if you&#x27;re using this, do you think I got a fake?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care if I&#x27;m not fooling anyone, I just hate gray hairs.  </li>
            <li> Insane.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s insane the amount of foam/</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s insane.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am female.  I train for triathlons.  This shampoo/conditioner is perfect for using after a lap pool swim or hard gym workout.  I originally received a sample after a 10k charity run and ended up buying this to carry around in my Tri bag.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product. Not only does it produce great suds/foam, but cleans and conditions hair so well that my wife complimented me on the texture of my hair. She remarked that it is not heavily perfumed, but has a very clean and pleasant smell.  I am pleased as it does not contain skin damaging, corrosive, sodium lauryl sulfate.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo.  I have been using it for about two years now.  You only need very little compared to other shampoos.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Great service.</li>
            <li> This is a good option for sulfate-free shampoo. The bottle may seem small but it lasts quite a while, you really do not need much to lather up really well. Smell is pleasant but fairly neutral and not powerful so it doesn&#x27;t clash with whatever else you&#x27;re putting in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good shampoo despite the rather high price, recommended.</li>
            <li> We love this at home. Leaves hair manageable and not dried out. We live in Colorado and it&#x27;s very dry here. This shampoo smells good too.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, who could care less what he washes his hair with.  He really likes this stuff!</li>
            <li> A nice shampoo/conditioner combo, but not what I expected.  Stick with a tea tree shampoo and your hair will be shinier and smoother</li>
            <li> I am actually a woman and didn&#x27;t realize this was a mans product.  I recieved a bunch of PM products from a hair stylist and when I tried this shampoo I couldn&#x27;t believe how much I liked it.  I have tried sulphate free shampoos before and always felt my hair was dirty.  Also I have used two in one shampoos and always felt my hair was heavy.  This shampoo is the right combo of perfect.  I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday and my hair actually stays cleaner with this shampoo than regular sulphate products.  I am super picky and think most products suck.  Usually each line has one stellar product and this is it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on the advice of my barber.  With my dry scalp she thought it would help...and it did.  Just a dab creates a good amount to lather.  Love the product.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo but keep in mind a little goes a long way, for being sulfate free, this stuff lathers great!</li>
            <li> My husband likes this shampoo and uses it all the time.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better men&#x27;s shampoos.  It does not dry out my hair, like many others, and it is gentle.  I do find that I have to use just a small amount of conditioner after I shampoo with this or my hair will be a little dry.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s sulfate free, I feel it strips the hair a tad.&lt;br /&gt;Suds up great so you don&#x27;t have to use too much.&lt;br /&gt;Also, even though it&#x27;s a shampoo and conditioner, it doesn&#x27;t condition much at all. I still use conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Good but not as good as I was hoping</li>
            <li> Good product especially when one is on the go.  Doesn&#x27;t leave any residue. Scalp doesn&#x27;t itch and feels clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> I used Paul Mitchell products years ago but hadn&#x27;t been able to find them locally. I had tried replacing my PM products with other brands I could find locally but everything left my hair dried out and hard to manage. This product makes my coarse hair managable once again and its a 2 in 1 which means less clutter in the shower.</li>
            <li> very good i love it i will recommend&lt;br /&gt;to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul Mitchell Men Mitch Double Hitter Sulfate Free 2-in-1 Shampoo and...</li>
            <li> I first tried this product at my local hair cut place. This is what they used and then they tried to sell it to me. I of course said no because it is always ridiculously marked up! However when I got home I immediately got on Amazon and purchased this product. It really is great. My hair smells good and feels awesome. It&#x27;s cool because it&#x27;s a salon quality hair product that is specifically advertised at least towards men, so you don&#x27;t feel weird buying it. Great product HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the best I have ever used, it leaves your hair feeling great, but it greatest value is how concentrated it is, the very smallest dab is all that is needed to get a head full of lather, I have been using the same tube for a year and wash my hair everyday, its still not empty.  It actually means it is more economical than cheaper inferior brands.</li>
            <li> expensive for a shampoo---a tiny bit goes a long way, as described---cleans well and only one time is good---everyone is different, so different outcomes---with some it tends to dry hair too much---for me, a male, it works fine---would like to see a lower price but it&#x27;s worth a try--once in a while we can splurge---would purchase again?-- i don&#x27;t know</li>
            <li> Good product, I hate having to do the shampoo and conditioning process as it is a laborious pain in the neck. Now I can take care of everything in one shot, &#x27;nuff said.</li>
            <li> Having a 9 year old and a 14 year old I needed something clearly &#x27;manly&#x27; and wanted a sulfate free shampoo they would actually use.  Most of the sulfate free product lists I could find contained a lot of shampoos geared towards females which would be an absolute no-go with my traditionalist sons.  This one is obviously &#x27;for men&#x27; so after a quick glance they started using it without comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a combination product it works quite nicely for my eldest who has relatively long hair that actually needs a bit of quality product to keep nice--it&#x27;s a sad day when you realize your 14 year old son has hair much better than your own, and he is completely oblivious to just how lucky he is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, this is much nicer than the typical over the counter shampoo/conditioner type product, has the advantage of being sulfate free (a large part of it&#x27;s higher quality in my opinion) and is acceptable to the offspring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JTG</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair clean, and requires only a small amount.</li>
            <li> Pros:  Hair looks much shinier.  Hair feels softer.  No more flakes and itching like I had experience with my last two 2-in-1 shampoos.  I don&#x27;t know if sulfate free shampoos have this benefit or not, but I have been seeing much much less hair in my hands after lathering up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Pretty minor, however I&#x27;m annoyed with how quickly the top of the cap will fill up with water.  Never experienced that with previous shampoos that sat cap down in the same spot.</li>
            <li> Personally I did not like it. It was too drying on my hair. I thought the conditioner in it would help, but it didn&#x27;t. The transaction and delivery were perfect though.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend, and he seems to love it. It is sulfate free, and has a nice man-ly smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;He likes it because it does have the conditioner so its non dying.</li>
            <li> Awesome product &amp; fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the shampoo at an event. A generous sized sample I will admit. I started looking for it in local beauty supplies and stores and no one had it.  Finally went to trusted Amazon. My  big surprise came when it said it was for MEN.  Being a female, I love the product. Being a daily shampoo user, this product will last me a along time as all you need is literally the size of large pea to work up a huge lather.  Thank you Paul Mitchell!&lt;br /&gt;Karen Farley</li>
            <li> I have been using the Double Hitter for about 6 months now and this purchase through amazon was my second bottle.  This product lasts extremely long time as a little goes a long way.  As all hair is different, at least for me I get that conditioner finish but without feeling over-conditioned allowing me to apply other styling products right away to my hair.  I would recommend this product to others wanting a salon product.</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST Shampoo i have ever bought. The first time i used it you can immediately tell the difference from the other shampoos.It has a wonderful smell and my feels refreshing after you wash it and get out the shower.I would recommend for all hair types ESPECIALLY if you have dry or frizzy hair. If you are a guy who likes to style hair this shampoo makes it so much easier.It as well repairs your hair. A definitely would buy product if you are thinking about buying it....you won&#x27;t regret it</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the only product I use.  I have thin hair (bald on crown).  Doesn&#x27;t weigh down or dry out hair with repeated daily use; rinses out well. A little dime size is all you need for great lather.  Nice fragrance that&#x27;s not over powering.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo and conditioner because you only have to use a little bit which makes it last a long time. It has a nice smell too it also.</li>
            <li> I have been experimenting with sulfate-free shampoos for my dry hair for some time now, and this one has made me stop my experimentation. It&#x27;s simply amazing. My hair remains moist throughout the day. Yep, no gel, this shampoo eliminates the need to use any gel, which is awesome for me. I am just some amazed guy writing a review to somehow help the interested ones. You really have to try this to appreciate its greatness.</li>
            <li> Excellent balance of cleaning and conditioning.  SLS free makes the difference.  No buildup -- have been using for 6 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit to knowing next to nothing when it comes to hair care products and would normally just buy whatever looks good at the store.  Every shampoo that I buy always either dries my hair out and gives me dandruff or just makes my hair feel oily so I decided to give this shampoo a try after a few recommendations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for a couple of months now and I&#x27;m loving it so far.  My hair feels clean and has a nice shine to it without feeling two dry or oily.  The shampoo has a very nice scent that is reminiscent of cologne but doesn&#x27;t come off too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is definitely higher than what most shampoos would be at a grocery store but only a little bit is required to create a nice lather so it should last quite a while as well.  I have been completely happy with this purchase and will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Been using it about a week.  I like the fact that it&#x27;s sulfate free but other than that I can&#x27;t say there is anything special about it.  I can&#x27;t say my hair feels any better or worse than before I started using it.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of the scent  To me it smells like I&#x27;m washing my hair with a bar of Ivory soap or something similar.</li>
            <li> My hair looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a girl and this is supposedlt a men&#x27;s shampoo but it works great for me!</li>
            <li> If you want to put lots of chemicals into your brain this shampoo is for you. Sulfate free doesnt mean good. Does anyone read labels?  Ive tried this, and while it smells good, lathers great, and save time, this is no good for you . I encourage everyone to look up the ingredients of this abomination, then go to acure organics, john masters for really good shampoo.  Beware the ingredient list!!</li>
            <li> Been using this shampoo for over a year now. A little amount of the shampoo creates a robust amount of lather, and leaves the scalp feeling clean after use. I suffer from Eczema on my scalp, and I must say this shampoo tends to prolong flare-ups of itchy scalp and flaking. Have no idea why, but this is my personal experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I&#x27;ve found is that over time, the conditioner seems to separate out of the shampoo if the the shampoo isn&#x27;t used up (found this to be the case after 3 months).</li>
            <li> Got this for my boyfriend who loves it...and couldn&#x27;t find it locally.</li>
            <li> The best men&#x27;s shampoo/conditioner</li>
            <li> This is quite a poor product.&lt;br /&gt;The product is very drying and not good.&lt;br /&gt;There appears to be No DOUBLE Hitter.&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a poor product.</li>
            <li> I have straight, thin hair of partially Asian orientation.  This stuff works extremely well for my hair in comparison to many others.  I especially like that it doesn&#x27;t have sulfates but still lathers well.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair and best part is I don&#x27;t really need any product in my hair after I dry it off, it stays in place.  Definitely going to get it again and recommend for people with thin hair.</li>
            <li> Best Shampoo! Makes my hair feel and smell great!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It did wonders for my hair!</li>
            <li> Seems like most reviews you see on Amazon are all 5 star, perfectly written reviews, almost like they were written by the company themselves.... Here is an honest review of this shampoo. I have dandruff, and an itchy scalp like most guys. I read SLS was bad and embarked on a journey of a good SLS-Free shampoo. Unfortunately with every SLS-Free shampoo in sight, there are a million 5 star perfect reviews for each one so you really have no clue how good it really is. Anyways, I started out on a L&#x27;Oreal Everstrong line. Worked great the first wash then the 2nd wash my hair kinda got... gooey and gunky looking. Then went on to giovanni,(I guess their formula changed) all that did was severely dry out of my scalp, which i loved at first because it was extremely oily, but now its very dry and looking for something that gently cleans, sort of like baby shampoo, but that was sulfate free. I would have never dreamed of throwing down 17 bucks on a shampoo, but I saw this at a salon, and I&#x27;m curious about testing all SLS-free shampoos so the girl there actually washed my hair with this. While it has no moisturizing, or volumizing, or any kind of specific purpoe for the shampoo, this was the first SLS-free shampoo that made my hair freakin awesome looking. My scalp felt normally cleaned, not dried out, but not oily, perfect and my hair feels noticeably softer and definitely shinier, but I guess we can attribute this to the fact that it does have silicones in the ingredients. It didn&#x27;t really help out my itchy scalp at all, which is the only point i wanted to go SLS-free, and the ingredients aren&#x27;t.... impressing at all for a shampoo that is supposed to be gentle due to no sulfates, but, I have to admit. This shampoo deserves justice for the way it makes your hair shine, cleans the scalp, and i&#x27;m not kidding, 1 tiny dab produces MASSIVE lather, it feels thick to work into your hair, but you have to use very, very little. The smell is incredible. Smells like exquisite cologne. Ifyou don&#x27;t have major dandruff problems, or are the Organic bandwagon, this shampoo is perfect for a guy. You don&#x27;t need to use a conditioner, since its built in and I mean... I love what it does to my hair, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about serious reactions or damaging my scalp or hair with sulfate-free. The only thing that worrys me is all the silicones... I wonder if I will see buildup in a week or two... who knows, I&#x27;ll let you know. But I&#x27;m sure everyone wanted to see a real review that wasn&#x27;t written by a company. Would I pay 17$ for a shampoo? Heck no. Am I impressed though, and does it live up to its cost? Yes</li>
            <li> This stuff may be expensive, but literally a pea sized amount will lather more than a handful of head and shoulders. Plus, it is sulfate free which is a big plus, since sodium lauryl/laureth sulfate can cause acne, and is not good for your skin. This stuff smells great in the shower, but when you get out there is no lingering smell so there is no need to worry about scent clashing with cologne or anything. Leaves your hair very clean and ideal for styling, or leaving it exactly the way it is.</li>
            <li> Love the way it holds my hair without needing additional products.  I used this product for 3 days in a row with no scalp irritation.  All other 2 in 1 shampoo/conditioners cause my scalp to mildly breakout.  Paul Mitchell &amp;#34;Sulfate Free&amp;#34; Double Hitter is fantastic. Will continue to use this as my go to shampoo/conditioner when I am short on time in the morning.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Great cleaning and conditioning, use just a tsp and get great lather. Worth the extra price.</li>
            <li> I really can see and feel a difference in my hair.  Looks fuller and doesn&#x27;t have the greasy feeling like most shampoos with conditioners.</li>
            <li> This sulfate free 2-in-1 is great for curly hair.</li>
            <li> This is awesome shampoo, it helped so much with the dandruff I was dealing with.  I had tried many dandruff shampoos and was still dealing with dry scalp.  I started using this off a recommendation and it is great.  After a few weeks of using this most of my dandruff was gone!</li>
            <li> Good shampoo I like it.</li>
            <li> Works better than other sulfate free shampoos I&#x27;ve tried. And even better, it&#x27;s conditioner too- all in one!! Great for the days I&#x27;m in a rush or just tired. It lathers pretty well and a small amount goes a long way. I only ise about a quarter size and my hair is thin and to teh middle of my back.&lt;br /&gt;Hair combs through after shower, while still wet, pretty well but not as smooth as a regular conditioner. Not a deal breaker though, it&#x27;s worth the buy!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve even used this with additional conditioner I have leftover in other bottles, and that just makes it easier to comb through but this product is fine by itself to wash and condition hair!&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have a masculine scent either, it&#x27;s pretty neutral and when my hair is dry I don&#x27;t smell anything but my no frizz spray.</li>
            <li> Great product for my teenage son, and quick seller.  I like the fact that it is sulfate free, much better for your hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent--better than more expensive brands which I have used.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo! No sulfates shampoo&#x27;s usually don&#x27;t later well, this one is the best! It says for men but I use it all the time and I&#x27;m scent allergic and have no issue&#x27;s with this...I&#x27;m a customer for life!</li>
            <li> Tried this from a salon (worked fine) and a bottle from Amazon (texture seemed really liquidy compared to the previous stuff, but it seems to work okay if I use a lot of it).  I tend to have thick hair, and I&#x27;m growing it longer now, going to order one more bottle and see.</li>
            <li> I have always been interested in all-in-one shampoo/conditioners but have never tried them before. I have a sensitive scalp (never used to), but recently the tea tree and other types of shampoos can give me dry skin around the hairline. I have used this for about a week now and the dryness is gone from the last shampoo and my head feels healthier than ever. I know this is not a therapy shampoo, but it certainly does the trick for me. I don&#x27;t need anything fancy - and the fact that this is a time saver on top of everything else is great. It leaves my hair feeling clean without it being dry or oily - a perfect balance for me. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Product was different than the product I purchased in a salon. The product from the salon had a little grit to it. This product has no grit and appears to be more watery? I will go back and purchase from the salon. The higher price from the salon is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I have used Paul Mitchell shampoo for years, and have preferred Awapuhi.  This shampoo is a nice change, especially for the warmer months, because we are in the pool every day, and my hair looks like hay.  The conditioner this shampoo feels great on my hair; smells great too (according to my wife).  I won&#x27;t be using it every day, though, as it makes my thinning hair lay close to my scalp, and I like don&#x27;t care for that look.  I will use it, and probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo + conditioner I use it daily. It also lathers up very well, a little but of this stuff goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is the first sulfate-free shampoo I ever used, and I like to say that this product converted me. As a gal with s&#x27;wavy hair, I have difficulty finding sulfate-free products that effectively clean my hair without leaving it greasy or weighed-down. This product is PERFECT. It leaves my oil-prone yet frizzy hair smooth, bouncy, and squeaky clean without being too drying. I have tried numerous other products over the past two years, but I always return to this one. A little goes a long way - I have hair down to my mid to lower back and only need to use a dime-sized amount, so this bottle lasts forever, making it a great value.</li>
            <li> My barber (who is one of the most well-known in Chicago) told me my hair was drying out, so I shouldn&#x27;t wash it everyday or I would damage it. I tried not washing it everyday, and it wasn&#x27;t bad. The problem is, when I use product, go to the gym or do other forms of exercise, my hair begins to look greasy if I just rinse thoroughly with water after. He had mentioned it was the sulfates in shampoos that caused drying, so I went another route and decided to try this sulfate-free shampoo. You better believe I thought a long while before I was going to pay 17 bucks for a shampoo. I mean, that&#x27;s usually how much I pay for shampoo and conditioner in 3-4 years (I was using the big Pantene Pro-V bottles).&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is worth every penny. Using it everyday with conditioner, I noticed my hair was never dry after use and at the end of the day it would be oily again. I was happy with this, since it meant my hair wasn&#x27;t dry throughout the day and I made it to the end of the day looking clean. Much like everyone says, use a small amount. I use a pea size dab and lather it in my hands before applying it. If it isn&#x27;t enough on a particular day, I just add a little bit more. The way it smells is also great. It has a subtle masculine smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering at all. I almost want to give this 4 stars just because of the price, but because it only requires a small amount, you get a lot of bang for your buck.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a guy who&#x27;s looking for a great shampoo, I highly recommend this. For a woman, if scent matters to you, you may not like it.</li>
            <li> I love the built-in conditioner, no need to buy conditioner. Like the sulfate free formula. Leaves hair shiny, smooth and very manageable.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and son and they love it.  We only buy products that are sulfate free and I think Paul Mitchell&#x27;s are the best.  I also use Paul Mitchell products and my hair has never looked better.  If you don&#x27;t want your hair to fall out or lose your hair color, buy sulfate free products.  Highly recommend.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> A great product. I can wash my hair everyday which can strip the oils, not with this product.  Usually I am not a fan of 2-in-1 products, but this is great and works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different shampoo and conditioners and was looking for something that didn&#x27;t make my hair frizz. I have thick hair and had to use gels to subdue my frizz. I use and love Avalon Shampoo and Avalon Conditioner after being unsatisfied with all other brands.  I tried Mitch due to the natural ingredients and was thrilled to find that I don&#x27;t have to use gel products after washing my hair to subdue my hair that frizzes after shampoo and conditioner. Absolutely love this fact and now only use gel for a night out, not daily as I used to have to use gel. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair that ends up really dry after showers. I purchased this after reading several reviews talking about how good of a job it does for your hair, cleaning and conditioning it. It seems to clean my hair but the conditioning portion is nearly non-existent, my hair is left feeling extremely dry and my head flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do enjoy the fact that it lathers up so well and it doesn&#x27;t have the sodium laurel sulfate in it, but it just doesn&#x27;t do a good job for me. I&#x27;ll have to continue my search for a great Shampoo &amp; Conditioner (Most likely separate from one another.)</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price and I got free shipping ....can&#x27;t get any better than that</li>
            <li> Not just for men. Needed a sulfate free shampoo/conditioner combo on those days I am running late and don&#x27;t have time to fully condition my hair. This works great and doesn&#x27;t strip the color out of my hair. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Just a small amount is enough for my head.  I use about the volume of one gummy bear.&lt;br /&gt;- It is very cost effective, since one tube can last for a year or longer.&lt;br /&gt;- Keeps my head free of flakes.&lt;br /&gt;- Smells good.&lt;br /&gt;- Can be used as body wash, but what do I know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- You think it is expensive, but you have not seen how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo for my husband, but I use it as well.  It takes a VERY small amount to create quite a bit of lather, so it&#x27;s lasted a lot longer than I expected.  My husband loves how nice his hair feels afterwards, and it has a nice, not overpowering manly scent to it.</li>
            <li> not very good  conditioner does not work</li>
            <li> Excellent Shampoo and Conditioner all in one. Being Sulfate free is a bonus.</li>
            <li> First sulfate free shampoo that I have used that truly lathers and does not leave hair oily. Thrilled and am a lady.</li>
            <li> This is truly a great product accomplishing what it should. It leaves my hair clean and manageable. You will be amazed on how it lathers up and that you really need very little each washing.</li>
            <li> Easy to take on the road, works well, smells light. Solid product</li>
            <li> this product is much less expensive than buying it in a salon.  Its hard to believe anybody buys products in salons anymore</li>
            <li> Love this product. I will definitely be buying it again when I run out. Although last time I bought it, it lasted almost a year!</li>
            <li> Awesome Shampoo! It looks like its expensive but when you take into account that you only need about a dime size for this stuff to lather up, its not that bad, plus its probably better for your hair than all the other crap out there.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo. Lathers up with small amount.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a sulfate free shampoo and this turned out to be an easy 2-in-1 that works great, cleans, conditions, and refreshes!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I just got this two weeks ago and I already love it. I was a little concerned about it being sulfate free at first ..but it still does foam up quite a lot. Also, my hair are much straighter and feel nicer...good smell/fragrance as well.... Also, it is very concentrated so you don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot of it each time... great for the price!</li>
            <li> You take a nickel sized drop to cleanse your hair and rinse.  Then take another nickel sized drop to actually condition and rid your scalp of dead skin, loose follicles, and oils.  It will change your hair like no other product.  My hair is now soft and flows like the wings upon a cherubim.  Jesus cleanses his hair with this in heaven.</li>
            <li> I have short hair, and typically use other premium \\&quot;mens\\&quot; shampoos and have found that other shampoos leave my hair feeling heavy and unable to really style the way I want.  This product leaves your hair feeling clean light and not weighed down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Clean feeling after wash.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to style your hair following wash.&lt;br /&gt;- Hair/ head doesn&#x27;t feel dry.&lt;br /&gt;- Gentle enough to be used every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- None</li>
            <li> I got my first sample of this from the girl who cuts my hair as a Christmas gift.  you only need a small amount to get a lot of lather and it leaves your hair (and beard) clean and super soft.  My hair is about 5&amp;#34; give or take and I squeeze out about 3/4&amp;#34; of this into my hand in the shower and that is plenty for the hair and beard.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> After reading the tons of five star reviews about how good this product is, I was extremely confident in this product, and it turns out my confidence was well placed. After my hair had dried, it had felt so smooth, silky, and fluffy, and I think if I keep using this product, then I will regain my natural hair color, which is dirty blonde, because my hair has been damaged over the years and has turned brown from shampoos with sulfates, and since this shampoo is sulfate free, it will clean my hair, and allow it to heal from all the damage I&#x27;ve caused it by using shampoo with sulfates. If you&#x27;re a guy and you want a good shampoo, then I DEFINITELY recommend this one, you will not regret your purchase if you buy one.</li>
            <li> Very good and easy on your hair</li>
            <li> Insane.  It&#x27;s insane the amount of foam/bubbles you get from this stuff.  I&#x27;m a guy, and I have short hair.  I color my hair, because I&#x27;m older than I look.  I don&#x27;t care if I&#x27;m not fooling anyone, I just hate gray hairs.  I rock a solid dark brown all the time.  And I&#x27;ve been having big trouble finding a color-safe MEN&#x27;S shampoo!  This is really the only one I&#x27;ve found on here.  And it&#x27;s AWESOME.  You need only a few drops for your head - seriously like the size of your pinky nail and BOOM - TONS of foam.  It&#x27;s insane.  It&#x27;s like some kinda prank where the shampoo explodes on your head into tons and tons of foam.&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;br /&gt;Works great, smells nice, and is a real keeper.  Thanks Paul Mitchell!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use this for a very long time, but it seems like a decent shampoo.  I like that it&#x27;s sulfate free, but be aware that it does contain several silicones and parabens.  I have a feeling that dimethicone (a heavy, non-water soluble silicone) could build up over time.  Normally, this is removed by sulfates, which this shampoo doesn&#x27;t have.  Good product, but I think they&#x27;re only half way there.  Paul Mitchell: Get rid of the silicones and parabens, and you&#x27;ll have a real winner.</li>
            <li> Ok I&#x27;m baffled by all the great reviews.  Nothing like everyone here is saying.  I had to use a huge hand full of this stuff to get it through my hair and to lather.  I used about 2x more than I&#x27;ve ever used of any shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When done shampooing my hair felt so stripped of any moisture that my hands would stick to my hair. My hair didn&#x27;t feel conditioned at all.  My hair felt as it would if I were to wash it using a bar of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did buy mine on eBay and not on AMZ, so Im&#x27; wondering if I could have gotten a fake.  What do you think if you&#x27;re using this, do you think I got a fake?</li>
            <li> My  son loves it.  Won&#x27;t use anything else now that he uses this.</li>
            <li> What can I say? I bought it for my son and he states that it does exactly what it is supposed to do and smells great.</li>
            <li> Leave my hair clean and manageble for two days.</li>
    </ol>
