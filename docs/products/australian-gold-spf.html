            <li>Nothing too shiny, just nice touch of shimmer.</li>
            <li>Very easy to absorb and not greasy on skin.</li>
            <li>It also has a light and good smell...</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have never in my life been able to tan without burning.  </li>
            <li>I paid $8 at Wal Mart for this, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>My favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Better than most tannning oils because it has SPF 30 protection.</li>
            <li>We enjoyed the color it gave us and didn&#x27;t burn our skin.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>what more can a gal ask for??</li>
            <li>Used it all summer and found out some interesting tidbits.</li>
            <li>- I already love the product</li>
            <li>Great products and reasonable prices.</li>
            <li>Great SPF protection and natural looking bronzing.</li>
            <li>I am very fair and burn easily, under 15 minutes in moderate sun.  </li>
            <li>Easy spray bottle to apply.</li>
            <li>These smell fantastic and go on easily -</li>
            <li>Great for my lilly white legs</li>
            <li>So, it is a bit like light makeup and the consistency (a tan colored cream) reminds me of tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>got this on sale cost me $9.00 really cheap.</li>
            <li>Red in 4 lol</li>
            <li>I have an extremly fair skin, you can see my veins, anyway I got this Australian Gold just because I really love this brand and the smell of coconut and pineaple...</li>
            <li>I applied a skin patch test twice a day for 3 days when I first bought it, just to make sure.  </li>
            <li>Very good sun protection And nice very subtle tan effect when you put it on.</li>
            <li>This is part of my routine shopping cart for cruises or vacations of any kind that comes anywhere near the beach.  </li>
            <li>Surprised by the nice tan I got without burning while in Mexico.  </li>
            <li>As well I&#x27;m very alergic and is totally safe.</li>
            <li>Spray is nice, but you have to pray it in hands and still get help for the back to get full coverage.</li>
            <li>My skin is very fare, and it burns easily before it gets any tan.</li>
            <li>We go to warm climate vacations several times a year</li>
            <li>The back label on this product claims to keep you from tanning or burning, but I was able to get a decently golden tan in the Bahamas, by using this every day according to the instructions.  </li>
            <li>I went to the Caribbean for 2 weeks and used this product consistently at the beach.  </li>
            <li>so I am more likely to use it.  </li>
            <li>Another key note is that for the best results, you should follow the instructions on the back label regarding how long before exposure you should apply, and when you should reapply, etc.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>and that didn&#x27;t really happen.  </li>
            <li>Has a tiny bronzer color to it and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t feel nearly as gross as the white stuff.</li>
            <li>very glittery for a spray with bronzer, keep in mind if you have sensitive skin, or if your husband plans to use it  ;-)</li>
            <li>This sunscreen worked better than the SPF50 I had been using (the yellow tube white cream).</li>
            <li>I burn unprotected in the sun in 30 minutes during high sunlight times during the afternoon.  </li>
            <li>Although, if you sweat profusely or you are in the water for a long time, it is obvious that you need to apply some more.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it has never bothered me.</li>
            <li>I have used it for about 3 summers so far</li>
            <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t seen it stain my clothes.</li>
            <li>They really do have a bronzer added to them, as well; I notice instant color as soon as I put it on.</li>
            <li>I am a 25 year old, Caucasian, fair-skinned blonde.  </li>
            <li>First used this in Cancun a few years ago and got the darkest tan I have ever had and in just one week.</li>

            <li> First used this in Cancun a few years ago and got the darkest tan I have ever had and in just one week.</li>
            <li> Believe me it was HOT in the sun at the beach everyday - at least 5 hours</li>
            <li> Day 1 in Hawaii I burned slightly with the yellow tube stuff, after that I had no issues because I was using this (non bronzing version).</li>
            <li> Too bad Amazon doesn&#x27;t carry it. :)</li>
            <li> I bought the bronzing version when i got back home in the hopes of giving my pale skin a touch of color</li>
            <li> Unlike other sunscreens, this does not give you a ghostly cast and the added bonus is the smell.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this product causes breakouts as I&#x27;ve only used it on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even though it may not bronze you, you will notice dark stains coming out when you shower.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have that typical sunscreen odor/spray tan odor (yuck) but a tropical island smoothie smell.</li>
            <li> so you get a little color while your getting a little sun.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried a sunscreen with built in bronzer before, let alone one with at least SPF 30  (the recommended amount by dermatologists).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I mis-read the description and thought this was also a self tanner.  </li>
            <li> The aerosol SPF 30 bronzer also has a cooling effect, but I cannot find it on amazon, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Very bad quality product.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m an aussie gold fan and haven&#x27;t been disappointed yet!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love it. I have been using this product for years. Very easy to absorb and not greasy on skin. This is probably the best product on the market.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am a 25 year old, Caucasian, fair-skinned blonde.  I burn unprotected in the sun in 30 minutes during high sunlight times during the afternoon.  I have never in my life been able to tan without burning.  The back label on this product claims to keep you from tanning or burning, but I was able to get a decently golden tan in the Bahamas, by using this every day according to the instructions.  The front label also reads that it has instant bronzer.  If I&#x27;d seen that before I purchased it, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have.  Turns out, there is nothing bronzing or self-tanning in this product.  I applied a skin patch test twice a day for 3 days when I first bought it, just to make sure.  (Self tanners always make my skin look orangey.)&lt;br /&gt;I also wore this on my skin while wearing a white bathing suit cover up, and there was no bronze-colored rub-off.  The lotion appears shimmery and bronze-ish in the container, but it does not apply to your skin in a way that fulfills any hopes of actual bronzing.  I also have fairly oily skin, and this did not make my face break out.  I paid $8 at Wal Mart for this, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  I&#x27;ve recommended this to multiple friends.  Another key note is that for the best results, you should follow the instructions on the back label regarding how long before exposure you should apply, and when you should reapply, etc.</li>
            <li> Very bad quality product. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> went to Jamaica and this came in very handy.</li>
            <li> My favorite sunscreen. I have sensitive skin and it has never bothered me. Doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy or greasy. Spray is nice, but you have to pray it in hands and still get help for the back to get full coverage.</li>
            <li> This is part of my routine shopping cart for cruises or vacations of any kind that comes anywhere near the beach.  I love this lotion!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I mis-read the description and thought this was also a self tanner.  However, being a redhead I do wear sunscreen everywhere every day and this is a nice smelling, nice texture product-which I continue to use!</li>
            <li> Surprised by the nice tan I got without burning while in Mexico.  Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Great product. My wife and I loved this tanning lotion. Better than most tannning oils because it has SPF 30 protection. We enjoyed the color it gave us and didn&#x27;t burn our skin. Recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have used it for about 3 summers so far and I love it. The smell is wonderful and the consistency is great for keeping you moisturized. The color I get after sunbathing is a beautiful brown and it lasts for quite a bit on your skin. Although, if you sweat profusely or you are in the water for a long time, it is obvious that you need to apply some more. Excellent purchase.</li>
            <li> i love it , protects and it gives you a nice tan , i recommend using it together with a bronze accelerator !  I&#x60;m really white and I&#x27;ve never been so tan in all my life!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get enough of Australian Gold.  Great to have the spray gel with bronzer so you get a little color while your getting a little sun.  Great for my lilly white legs</li>
            <li> I like the smell but it is not a bronzer.</li>
            <li> Great product. Very good sun protection And nice very subtle tan effect when you put it on. Nice tropical smell!</li>
            <li> I went to the Caribbean for 2 weeks and used this product consistently at the beach.  I did not burn I tanned and believe it or not I did not peel.  I would recommend this product anytime.  Believe me it was HOT in the sun at the beach everyday - at least 5 hours each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonnie Benitez</li>
            <li> Terrific smelling tan lotion...Gave as Wedding Shower Gift and Bride to be Loved it!!  Had great reviews to begin with.</li>
            <li> sunscreen AND a bronzer!! love this stuff!! keeps you from burning but you still get some color. what more can a gal ask for?? i&#x27;m an aussie gold fan and haven&#x27;t been disappointed yet!!</li>
            <li> Works well and smells so nice!</li>
            <li> sprayer doesn&#x27;t spray after couple use.</li>
            <li> I use the SPF 8 version of this and with only 30 minutes in the sun, I look tan.  This will not let you get any sun tan.</li>
            <li> Tans nice and protects, You need to reapply as recommended.</li>
            <li> First used this in Cancun a few years ago and got the darkest tan I have ever had and in just one week. It is now the only brand I use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried a sunscreen with built in bronzer before, let alone one with at least SPF 30  (the recommended amount by dermatologists). Unlike other sunscreens, this does not give you a ghostly cast and the added bonus is the smell. It doesn&#x27;t have that typical sunscreen odor/spray tan odor (yuck) but a tropical island smoothie smell. So far, I haven&#x27;t seen it stain my clothes. I am not sure if this product causes breakouts as I&#x27;ve only used it on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update- Used it all summer and found out some interesting tidbits. Even though it may not bronze you, you will notice dark stains coming out when you shower. So, it is a bit like light makeup and the consistency (a tan colored cream) reminds me of tinted moisturizer. The \\&quot;bronze\\&quot; is the shimmer you get from the sunscreen which for me (an olive toned person) brings out my tan. On a brighter note, this sunscreen doesn&#x27;t make you feel goopy and greasy. You may feel heaviness on your skin if you put a lot on but that goes away in minutes. My next step is trying the spray version of this. Too bad Amazon doesn&#x27;t carry it. :)</li>
            <li> My skin is very fare, and it burns easily before it gets any tan. I bought this product for my trip to Hawaii and used it every morning before going to the beach, and then reapplied it as needed and I did not get sunburns! I can never find it in stores in California, but in Hawaii it is sold everywhere. I like the one with the bronzer because it adds beautiful shimmer to the skin. Nothing too shiny, just nice touch of shimmer. The aerosol SPF 30 bronzer also has a cooling effect, but I cannot find it on amazon, unfortunately. Walmart in Hawaii have it, but they are always sold out! I&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen for over 8 years now, and recommend it to anyone who is looking for great sun protection. By the way, it smells great - makes you want to reapply it all the time!</li>
            <li> - I already love the product&lt;br /&gt;- it came in time (the promised period) of getting out from usa with it</li>
            <li> This product expired before receiving</li>
            <li> I have an extremly fair skin, you can see my veins, anyway I got this Australian Gold just because I really love this brand and the smell of coconut and pineaple... Make me fell in summer even in the middle of winter ( I use the aftersun after shower everyday)&lt;br /&gt;I got this on sale cost me $9.00 really cheap. This product gives you some color and a very good protection. As well I&#x27;m very alergic and is totally safe. You should see my after and before this Australian Gold...</li>
            <li> One of the best product I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Perferct protection grade even for very senible skins, good waterproof grade as well.</li>
            <li> Seems to work good protecting the skin and tans you a good color. I like the way you can just spray it on and rub it in. It also has a light and good smell...</li>
            <li> I am so grateful a friend shared on our cruise!  It is so easy to apply, works &amp; feels good!</li>
            <li> A friend introduced me to this brand when we visited her in Hawaii.  I am very fair and burn easily, under 15 minutes in moderate sun.  This sunscreen worked better than the SPF50 I had been using (the yellow tube white cream). Of course that may be because its easier to use and smells great so I am more likely to use it.  Day 1 in Hawaii I burned slightly with the yellow tube stuff, after that I had no issues because I was using this (non bronzing version). I bought the bronzing version when i got back home in the hopes of giving my pale skin a touch of color and that didn&#x27;t really happen.  Have had no issues with staining of clothing or towels. Did I mention it smells good?  Very easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t feel nearly as gross as the white stuff. Try it!</li>
            <li> Works like majic kid! Went to cancun and got brown in 2 hours. Red in 4 lol&lt;br /&gt;i had to switch to spf50 after that.&lt;br /&gt;Hey! It was february</li>
            <li> Great SPF protection and natural looking bronzing.</li>
            <li> I have been buying Australian Gold off the web for several years. Great products and reasonable prices. We go to warm climate vacations several times a year and I always take it with us. The price for this product in hotel gift shops is 2 1/2 times the price that I purchase it for on Amazon.</li>
            <li> These smell fantastic and go on easily - and they&#x27;re not sticky at all. They really do have a bronzer added to them, as well; I notice instant color as soon as I put it on. If you prefer the same product in a spray (easier to apply) try this: [[ASIN:B002S42568 Australian Gold SPF 15 Continuous Spray Bronzer, 6 Ounce]] It&#x27;s also a really great product.</li>
            <li> very glittery for a spray with bronzer, keep in mind if you have sensitive skin, or if your husband plans to use it  ;-)</li>
            <li> Awesome product great for keeping mosquitoes and Greenhead flies away the land on you but won&#x27;t bite</li>
            <li> Works great kayaking in florida</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff as well as the rest of their line. Has a great smell. Easy spray bottle to apply. Has a tiny bronzer color to it and goes on smooth. Delish!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best but be sure to shower before getting into bed as the bronzer will get on the sheets and pillowcases.</li>
