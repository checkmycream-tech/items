    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>My hair feels wonderful!  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best l&#x27;Oreal conditioners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The product&#x27;s two greatest attributes would be 1.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great!</li>
            <li>Oh well, the search for the perfect miracle product continues...</li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t buy a fiat either lol!</li>
            <li>However, I have to admit that this conditioner can stand up there with the best of the best and still hold it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is great for any PTSHE</li>
            <li>It is great for restoring moisture levels for immediate gratification after any hair process/treatment.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping I eventually look as good as J Lo in the product ads.</li>
            <li>Plus, the ingredients are rather good.</li>
            <li>Another good thing to help restore the ph balance of your hair is organic apple cider vinegar once a week..</li>
            <li>Her hair always looks SO good.  </li>
            <li>Smell so good</li>
            <li>For the price, L&#x27;Oreal EverSleek is a good value.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the lack of reviews/attention towards this product overlook this good bargain Gem !  : )</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, makes my hair shiny and full, and I love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and smells good too.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I recommend this to fellow frizz heads :)  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li>but I have had better L&#x27;Oreal products.</li>
            <li>I get better results from Aussie, specifically Cleanse and Mend, but</li>
            <li>really, most of the Aussie line, and it&#x27;s cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Love love love.</li>
            <li>Someone recommended this to me and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Ok I gave this another chance</li>
            <li>and I really love it.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it :)</li>
            <li>Perfect relief especially for your hair&#x27;s tips.</li>
            <li>It surely promises no frizz</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>love it...</li>
            <li>But for the price and quality of this product, I&#x27;m okay with that.  </li>
            <li>And still somewhat frizzy on top.</li>
            <li>I thought I would love it, since I LOVE EverSleek hair serum.</li>
            <li>Smells good and really helps with frizzy hair!</li>
            <li>Would be a huge plus if Paraben Free could also be added to the label!</li>
            <li>but I decided to try something sulfur free and a bit more earth friendly thinking it may make a difference.  </li>
            <li>until now  the product is very good, nice scent, this is my third washing and my hair looks soft, brrilllliant, manegeable</li>
            <li>It is smooth and silky and tangle free.  </li>
            <li>It is sulfate free (which means way easier/gentle on your hair) 2.</li>
            <li>and you have to leave it on like a mask for it to make your hair buttery smooth.</li>
            <li>It also makes my hair light weight</li>
            <li>but so far so good</li>
            <li>Jennifer Lopez got me ALL excited about EverSleek.  </li>
            <li>If your hair is fine, and gets greasy easily, this product might provide too much moisture for you.  </li>
            <li>I felt like the bottle went too quickly.</li>
            <li>It smells great and doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy when you put it on, and washes out easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does a nice job on daily washing without stripping the hair or drying it out.&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised and pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>The product smells great (kind of like honey) and a little goes a long way, but the fragrance doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li>I was excited about the prospect of having sleeker, softer, shinier hair and that commercial featuring Jennifer Lopez is pretty convincing.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything from Suave&#x27;s new reformulated line to the top guns like Fekkai, Mitchell&#x27;s new Awpuhi Ginger line, Nexxus, CHI, Bedhead etc., and in my opinion this conditioner trumps them all.</li>
            <li>I have tried many brands and only had this problem once before.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a shame because my hair did feel nice and soft</li>
            <li>Other than the cost for the size and not having a larger size option I think this product is definitely the best drugstore shampoo and conditioner I have ever used for my hair type.</li>
            <li>I love the strange scent!  </li>
            <li>The conditioner makes it easy to comb through without snags or breaks, especially on the hair at the nape of my neck.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad and my hair is less frizzy, I just think the smell is really too strong.  </li>
            <li>using for over a year and reasonable price for sulfate-free.</li>
            <li>I buy it very often...</li>
            <li>It does not have much of a scent which is what I always am looking for.</li>
            <li>Would have returned it if it didn&#x27;t cost too much to return.  </li>
            <li>and I really do like the product.  </li>
            <li>If you have dry, chemically treated hair, or ethnic hair which may be a bit coarse, you will probably be moderately to very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>FYI Sulfates found in most other products</li>
            <li>always go for the most extremely hydrated formula I can find and they have worked well</li>
            <li>It conditions my hair much better than other brands I have tried (</li>
            <li>I have color damaged, dry, frizzy hair with out of control split ends, and I feel like this conditioner really helps the condition of my hair and leaves it soft, healthier looking, and more manageable.  </li>
            <li>I noticed one of the main ingredients is a form of alcohol.</li>
            <li>I have very fine Asian hair with an oily scalp and dry ends</li>
            <li>so this shampoo and conditioner are the first sulfate free products I have tried on my EXTREMELY thick and frizzy hair and its a huge improvement to Pantene or Garnier Fructis which I used for years prior.</li>
            <li>but I have learned to live with it because of the results I achieve with it.</li>
            <li>I live in a humid environment, so I also have to deal with frizzies.</li>
            <li>The shampoo, used in conjunction with the conditioner provides adequate moisture and texture to otherwise dry hair.</li>
            <li>However, after a month of washing my hair every other day with these products I see significant improvement in the look and feel of my hair.  </li>
            <li>ie, no tangles, static, dull ends, heaviness).</li>
            <li>It comes out of the tube a very thick, bright white emollient cream.</li>
            <li>I also love to slightly curl my hair with a flat iron after blow drying</li>
            <li>It is great for getting rid of those extremely depressing crunchy ends (temporarily).</li>
            <li>After having gone through almost a whole tube each of the shampoo and conditioner, I am here to tell you that the commercial lied.</li>
            <li>It may be &amp;#34;sulfate&amp;#34; free but has lots of harsh toxins and chemicals, some that are drying.  </li>
            <li>My wife has coarse, unmanageable hair, and this product line really helps her manage it.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>, I hope in next few days my hair shows a dramatic change and the best thing that this product at the time dont have</li>
            <li>little surely goes a long ways.</li>
            <li>This has been the only product successful at camouflaging the extreme damage of my dead formerly blonde ends.  </li>
            <li>which is what my hair is prone to do with such high humidity indexes here in Louisiana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Considering how much money I have spent so far on finding a COMPLETE hair line that gives my hair what it needs, this one has worked for me.</li>
            <li>I have used it for probably almost two years now, and every time I buy something new I still revert back to this one.</li>
            <li>actually cause frizz because they strip your hair of there natural oils</li>
            <li>but I felt like I had to use so much of the product to get any results that it was empty before I knew it.</li>
            <li>I noticed a slight improvement after the first use.  </li>
            <li>I had been dyeing my naturally deep brunette head blonde ever since I was a young teenager</li>
            <li>( I am now 24) and last year decided to revert back to my natural color.</li>
            <li>I am actually able to wear my hair down now without straightening it along with the help of the Eversleek leave in conditioner and after 48 hours if I&#x27;m not able to wash my hair</li>

            <li> so, needless to say, I am kind of rough on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair and tried this because most anti-frizz products are heavy.</li>
            <li> I had to shampoo it with a different shampoo after it was all dry because my husband and I could not stand the perfume odor.</li>
            <li> I need both hydrating shampoo and conditioner regularly since my hair can get very dry.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t switch as long as they keep making this product.</li>
            <li> Granted, I have long hair-</li>
            <li> I think this works just as well as much more expensive conditioners for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, as other reviewers have noted, the bottle does not last me too long.  </li>
            <li> I used this product after putting Jane Carter&#x27;s Nourish &amp; Shine in my VERY wet hair, then putting this only on my ends since I wasn&#x27;t going to rinse this out.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry it out</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner made my hair dry and oddly crunchy, especially on the ends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be going back to my previous choices.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t wash my hair every day, but when I use these products I have to because things get a little greasy near the scalp and, oddly enough, drier on the ends.</li>
            <li> I can immediately feel a difference as I comb through my wet hair.  </li>
            <li> drying my hair is extremely soft and absolutely no dryness which means no static cling!  </li>
            <li> I made that up) but what I mean is any event like highlighting your hair, using a protein reconstructor, or even a clear shine gloss.</li>
            <li> It restored my vitamin D deficient hair to normal again.  </li>
            <li> and I blow dry my hair everyday it is not looked damaged anymore.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> until now  the product is very good, nice scent, this is my third washing and my hair looks soft, brrilllliant, manegeable, I hope in next few days my hair shows a dramatic change and the best thing that this product at the time dont have sodium sulfate is not so chemical  and restores the hair</li>
            <li> I finally found a product that detangles my hair after washing. I have very thick, coarse hair that is very difficult to brush after washing. It&#x27;s easy to apply and smells good too. I&#x27;m hoping I eventually look as good as J Lo in the product ads.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair and tried this because most anti-frizz products are heavy. This is no exception. I started to blow dry my hair and instead of my shiny, bouncy (if not huge!) hair, I was left with slightly dull, stiff hair. I can say one thing: I didn&#x27;t have any frizz. I didn&#x27;t have any anything after using this. Ick, never again.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a solution to my damaged hair for quite some time.  My over 50 hair is color treated and has been looking and feeling frazzled of late.  The worst part has been that it feels stiff and brittle.  I started using this product along with its matching shampoo about a month ago.  I noticed a slight improvement after the first use.  However, after a month of washing my hair every other day with these products I see significant improvement in the look and feel of my hair.  My hair feels wonderful!  It is smooth and silky and tangle free.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> I need both hydrating shampoo and conditioner regularly since my hair can get very dry. This is one of the best l&#x27;Oreal conditioners I&#x27;ve used. No more frizzy hair or dry scalp. Plus, the ingredients are rather good.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I can be a bit of a product snob when it comes to judging a product ( I find something to critique about almost everything) However, I have to admit that this conditioner can stand up there with the best of the best and still hold it&#x27;s own. I have tried everything from Suave&#x27;s new reformulated line to the top guns like Fekkai, Mitchell&#x27;s new Awpuhi Ginger line, Nexxus, CHI, Bedhead etc., and in my opinion this conditioner trumps them all. I have used it for probably almost two years now, and every time I buy something new I still revert back to this one. It comes out of the tube a very thick, bright white emollient cream. However, it does not weigh hair down at all. I had been dyeing my naturally deep brunette head blonde ever since I was a young teenager ( I am now 24) and last year decided to revert back to my natural color. This has been the only product successful at camouflaging the extreme damage of my dead formerly blonde ends.  It is great for getting rid of those extremely depressing crunchy ends (temporarily). The only thing about this product I dislike is the smell, it is hard to pinpoint what it smells like, (it could be the argan oil) but I have learned to live with it because of the results I achieve with it. The product&#x27;s two greatest attributes would be 1. It is sulfate free (which means way easier/gentle on your hair) 2. the argan oil is used instead of heavy silicones and artificial smoothing chemicals (which over time damage your hair and make it look worse in the long run. This conditioner is great for any PTSHE (Post Traumatic Stress Hair Event ... okay I made that up) but what I mean is any event like highlighting your hair, using a protein reconstructor, or even a clear shine gloss. It is great for restoring moisture levels for immediate gratification after any hair process/treatment.  Don&#x27;t let the lack of reviews/attention towards this product overlook this good bargain Gem !  : )</li>
            <li> This has a terrible strong perfume. I had to shampoo it with a different shampoo after it was all dry because my husband and I could not stand the perfume odor. The shampoo and conditioner both have this same fragrance. It&#x27;s such a shame because my hair did feel nice and soft but I don&#x27;t want perfume in my hair. I have tried many brands and only had this problem once before.</li>
            <li> so this shampoo and conditioner are the first sulfate free products I have tried on my EXTREMELY thick and frizzy hair and its a huge improvement to Pantene or Garnier Fructis which I used for years prior. I am actually able to wear my hair down now without straightening it along with the help of the Eversleek leave in conditioner and after 48 hours if I&#x27;m not able to wash my hair yet I use Infusium 23 Leave in and Frizzes Dream Curls spray. My only complaints with these Eversleek products are that I wish they came in big bottles instead of 8oz tubes. With my long thick hair I have to buy a tube of each every two weeks and that&#x27;s only with washing my hair 2 times a week!(stay at home mom)Its definitely not cheap but its a dollar cheaper on Amazon. I dont think the shampoo cleans as well as stripping sulfate packed products do but those same sulfates leave your hair unmanageable so a rinse and repeat every now and then wont hurt. Other than the cost for the size and not having a larger size option I think this product is definitely the best drugstore shampoo and conditioner I have ever used for my hair type. I recommend this to fellow frizz heads :)  FYI Sulfates found in most other products actually cause frizz because they strip your hair of there natural oils and they also seep into your skin and are not good for you. This product doesn&#x27;t list parabens in there ingredients but I doubt they disclose all ingredients. Would be a huge plus if Paraben Free could also be added to the label!</li>
            <li> Does a nice job on daily washing without stripping the hair or drying it out.&lt;br /&gt;Been using for over a year and reasonable price for sulfate-free.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! Smells good and really helps with frizzy hair! I buy it very often... (pro tip: Another good thing to help restore the ph balance of your hair is organic apple cider vinegar once a week.. also works as a bit of a conditioner!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK but I have had better L&#x27;Oreal products. It does not have much of a scent which is what I always am looking for.</li>
            <li> I feel like this product dries out my hair. I noticed one of the main ingredients is a form of alcohol.</li>
            <li> Jennifer Lopez got me ALL excited about EverSleek.  Her hair always looks SO good.  This shampoo (and conditioner) were nothing to write home about.  I get better results from Aussie, specifically Cleanse and Mend, but really, most of the Aussie line, and it&#x27;s cheaper.  And, I&#x27;ve tried Biolage Matrix Smoothing, too.  Pricey and bleh.  Pretty disappointing.  Won&#x27;t be buying again</li>
            <li> I swear by this stuff for my wavy to curly hair. It&#x27;s great, makes my hair shiny and full, and I love it!</li>
            <li> Tried it because it&#x27;s on the Subscribe &amp; Save program.  Using both the shampoo and conditioner.  The shampoo is low suds and it doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s even doing anything for my hair and my hair is still frizzy after use. I&#x27;ll be going back to my previous choices.</li>
            <li> I have fairly thick, wavy hair that tends to get very dry on the ends. I live in a humid environment, so I also have to deal with frizzies. I was excited about the prospect of having sleeker, softer, shinier hair and that commercial featuring Jennifer Lopez is pretty convincing. After having gone through almost a whole tube each of the shampoo and conditioner, I am here to tell you that the commercial lied. The product smells great (kind of like honey) and a little goes a long way, but the fragrance doesn&#x27;t linger. I usually don&#x27;t wash my hair every day, but when I use these products I have to because things get a little greasy near the scalp and, oddly enough, drier on the ends. I have also tried the anti-frizz serum in this line and it makes my hair feel sticky and doesn&#x27;t tame my flyaways. Oh well, the search for the perfect miracle product continues...</li>
            <li> Would have returned it if it didn&#x27;t cost too much to return.  It may be &amp;#34;sulfate&amp;#34; free but has lots of harsh toxins and chemicals, some that are drying.  I&#x27;m learning to look up everything before ordering.</li>
            <li> My wife has coarse, unmanageable hair, and this product line really helps her manage it.</li>
            <li> Love love love. My hair was dull and dry, according to my coworkers. Someone recommended this to me and I love it. My hair is soft and shiny. Less frizz, never drys my scalp. Love it.</li>
            <li> Ok I gave this another chance and I really love it. It does what it says it will do and I would recommend it :)&lt;br /&gt;And just for the record I didn&#x27;t buy it because jlo is in the commercial and I wouldn&#x27;t buy a fiat either lol!</li>
            <li> Works well for my color treated hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect relief especially for your hair&#x27;s tips. Smell so good and I blow dry my hair everyday it is not looked damaged anymore.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from another store, but this was before going crazy with Amazon.  I used this product after putting Jane Carter&#x27;s Nourish &amp; Shine in my VERY wet hair, then putting this only on my ends since I wasn&#x27;t going to rinse this out.  It&#x27;s not bad and my hair is less frizzy, I just think the smell is really too strong.  I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d buy this again since I use conditioners as leave-ins, but I have to say it&#x27;s still shiny (that&#x27;s the Nourish &amp; Shine talking) and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I read about L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s EverSleek line on a hair blog. 4a is my hair type. Considering how much money I have spent so far on finding a COMPLETE hair line that gives my hair what it needs, this one has worked for me. I only purchased the shampoo, conditioner and leave-in cream. It surely promises no frizz which is what my hair is prone to do with such high humidity indexes here in Louisiana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little surely goes a long ways. I&#x27;m here to tell ya it&#x27;s affordable and it works!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  I love the strange scent!  It&#x27;s not perfumed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a white girl with black-girl-hair.  I use this in conjunction with keratin treatments.  It restored my vitamin D deficient hair to normal again.  Have been using it over a year...love it...won&#x27;t switch as long as they keep making this product.</li>
            <li> I have color damaged, dry, frizzy hair with out of control split ends, and I feel like this conditioner really helps the condition of my hair and leaves it soft, healthier looking, and more manageable.  It smells great and doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy when you put it on, and washes out easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as other reviewers have noted, the bottle does not last me too long.  But for the price and quality of this product, I&#x27;m okay with that.  I think this works just as well as much more expensive conditioners for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> I went through this tube after using it for approximately 5 times. I feel like it takes a lot of product to saturate the hair and you have to leave it on like a mask for it to make your hair buttery smooth. If you use it like a regular conditioner, it seems like such a waste because the effect on your hair is not nearly as good. It gets expensive to keep buying so I will find an alternative that will last me longer.</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner as well as the L&#x27;Oreal Sulfate-Free shampoo for my graying hair.  It doesn&#x27;t dry it out and I really do like the product.  I&#x27;ve using it now for about 3 months and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it. Didn&#x27;t do my thick, coarse, wavy hair any favors.</li>
            <li> There are many reviews praising this product and several others saying it&#x27;s horrible. What&#x27;s the truth? Well, it all depends on the type of hair you have. If you have dry, chemically treated hair, or ethnic hair which may be a bit coarse, you will probably be moderately to very pleased with this product. If your hair is fine, and gets greasy easily, this product might provide too much moisture for you.  The shampoo, used in conjunction with the conditioner provides adequate moisture and texture to otherwise dry hair. In applying the conditioner, I immediately noticed a difference in the softness of my hair. I have been struggling with dryness in my hair. No matter what the product, my hair would still feel thirsty. I now realize that the sulfates in my prior shampoos and condtioners were drying out my hair. I am pleasantly surprised and pleased with this product. And plan to continue to use as a shampoo and conditioner. For extra moisture, I use a another product as a deep conditioner once a week.</li>
            <li> I felt like the bottle went too quickly. Granted, I have long hair- but I felt like I had to use so much of the product to get any results that it was empty before I knew it.</li>
            <li> I have very fine Asian hair with an oily scalp and dry ends so I need to purchase a separate shampoo and conditioner.  I also love to slightly curl my hair with a flat iron after blow drying so, needless to say, I am kind of rough on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always go for the most extremely hydrated formula I can find and they have worked well but I decided to try something sulfur free and a bit more earth friendly thinking it may make a difference.  For the price, L&#x27;Oreal EverSleek is a good value.  I was skeptical of the size of the bottle but so far so good and my hair feels great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use this on my ends (about a quarter size every day) and I can immediately feel a difference as I comb through my wet hair.  The conditioner makes it easy to comb through without snags or breaks, especially on the hair at the nape of my neck.  As soon I am finished blow drying my hair is extremely soft and absolutely no dryness which means no static cling!  It also makes my hair light weight and I have a lot of movement on the bottom - it does not look weighed down or heavy.  It conditions my hair much better than other brands I have tried (ie, no tangles, static, dull ends, heaviness).</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner made my hair dry and oddly crunchy, especially on the ends. And still somewhat frizzy on top. I thought I would love it, since I LOVE EverSleek hair serum. But alas, no.</li>
