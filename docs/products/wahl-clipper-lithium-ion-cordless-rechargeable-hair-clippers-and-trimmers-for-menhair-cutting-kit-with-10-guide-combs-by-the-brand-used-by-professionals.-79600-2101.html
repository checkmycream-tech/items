            <li>These clippers are great.</li>
            <li>Great clipper.</li>
            <li>It has a great contoured grip and its great not having a cord wobbling around when you try to make a precision line cut.</li>
            <li>This ciipper works great and has plenty of battery life, but it doesn&#x27;t trim as close as I would like.</li>
            <li>Great kit.  </li>
            <li>I am happy for the price paid.</li>

            <li>Does a great job, plenty of trimming sizers too.  </li>
            <li>The cordless is great.</li>
            <li>Still a great buy.</li>
            <li>Seperate neck trimmer works great for being powered by a AA volt battery.</li>
            <li>This is a great bang for your buck.  </li>
            <li>Great set,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>this, like all electronics, benefits greatly from the lack of wires.</li>
            <li>These are great clippers.</li>
            <li>But all in all a great package deal.</li>
            <li>Purchased this here on Amazon to replace my corded Wahl 79300-400 Color Pro 20 Piece, and thought that $45 would give me a great cordless solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>The cordless clipper set is great for guys.</li>

            <li>easy to handle and cuts perfectly.</li>
            <li>one of the best for the money and easy to use</li>
            <li>At the end of the day it cuts hear just fine and Lithium Ion is a perfect battery for clippers.</li>
            <li>Is very good, i love it.</li>
            <li>Amazing set of clippers, and a great price too.</li>
            <li>good bye barber&lt;br /&gt;easy</li>
            <li>Nice product, happy with it.</li>
            <li>Seems to be of good quality.</li>
            <li>clipper can be good if you need wireless</li>
            <li>/&gt;Looks to be good quality.</li>
            <li>$40 is good price for clipper and combs.&lt;br /&gt;Do not by it because of trimmer, you will neither use it nor want to keep.</li>
            <li>Good product works well</li>
            <li>Like good arts and crafts scissors, not what I would expect from a $50 dollar Wahl set though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a corded model by wahl and it was good except the cord would always get in the way.</li>
            <li>Battery life is good, and does a good job.</li>
            <li>Trimming capability is just as good as before.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be in good shape.</li>
            <li>The good news -</li>
            <li>good job done wahl.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- seems fairly waterproof.</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure you knew that the power of both units is incredible.  </li>
            <li>Good value here.  </li>
            <li>Good machine.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>Life is SOOO good.</li>
            <li>Plus mine came with the mini-clippers which is perfect for trimming your hairline precisely</li>
            <li>All accessories are good.</li>
            <li>The battery holds a good charge.  </li>
            <li>And I get about 3-4 good sessions before the battery dies..</li>
            <li>Fair shipping time .</li>
            <li>Blades are made of steel and looks like good steel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worked good for 2-3 uses, and then started leaving cornrows in my head as I shaved-my head looked like a crop field.  </li>
            <li>Underpowered and not of good quality.</li>
            <li>As good as corded versions</li>
            <li>They have always been a good value for the dollar.</li>
            <li>This is a good clipper.</li>
            <li>admit I did not use the trimmer, but one good look at them and you can figure out for yourself that they are nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good Starter Package though.</li>
            <li>Plenty of power and feel is good.</li>
            <li>None were as good as these.</li>
            <li>Good to get rid of cords though.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work as good as I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>They got really good reviews</li>
            <li>You can use them indoor or outdoor and they do just as good as the corded clippers.  </li>
            <li>You can use them indoor or outdoor and they do just as good as the corded clippers.  </li>
            <li>ARE GOOD QUALITY AND HOLD</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked around for a good hair clipper that was cordless and couldn&#x27;t find anything that was durable.</li>
            <li>Had a Norelco which use to cut good until the attachments broke twice (not durable at all).</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>The unit cuts well and is has all of the pieces needed to give myself a good haircut.  </li>
            <li>is what the pros use, and there is a good reason why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>Battery life is good.</li>
            <li>If you travel a lot, this is a good buy.</li>
            <li>The blades were nice and gave a great cut</li>
            <li>trimmer and scissors are good</li>
            <li>Wahl has a good name</li>
            <li>All of the attachments are good and allows a lot of choices.</li>
            <li>Good product good service.</li>
            <li>A bit of reading would have been a good start for me.</li>
            <li>Battery life seems to be doing good.  </li>
            <li>I loved the performance, the case and all the clip on guides.</li>
            <li>The battery seems to hold on for a good amount of time.  </li>
            <li>EXCELLENT AND FAST DELIVERY !!!</li>
            <li>Nice clipper for the money seems to cut very nice and the trimmer works well too.</li>
            <li>The attachments are excellent also with additional ones for special application.</li>
            <li>so you can leave it plugged in all the time for a full charge ( a surge protected outlet may be best ) .</li>
            <li>This clipper is very light and will work great on kids because there won&#x27;t be any cords for them to grab! :)</li>
            <li>But regardless this combo still get 5 stars from my point of view, as it&#x27;s wireless, very powerful, top notch blades, cuts great, and all for a great price!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery capacity is exceptional.</li>
            <li>The battery life is great since it&#x27;s lithium ion, nice accessories and a really nice fabric zip pouch to put it all in.</li>
            <li>a great shape, it is very comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>It goes so quickly that my son does not mind getting his hair cut!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the purchase for sure.</li>
            <li>so he wanted one that was battery operated and is very pleased with the performance.</li>
            <li>But anyway i&#x27;m happy with it :)</li>
            <li>Holds a great charge and the more you use it</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this unit, it even self sharpens.</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Worked great, and I love that its cordless.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>But I took a chance and am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>great buy for sure.</li>
            <li>Just remember to charge them right before you use them for the best performance.</li>
            <li>Everything was perfect right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>, cordless is very nice, holds a charge through three or more hair cuts.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect, I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Love the clippers!</li>

            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, a friend of mine was so impressed that she asked me to get one for her.</li>
            <li>My $20.00 Wahl works better!</li>
            <li>I would say more like a 3 1/2 to 4 star, but still rather ticked that they would not include trimmer attachments!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>First off, cordless anything is awesome, and these clippers are no exception.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased with this li-ion unit!  </li>
            <li>I really love this Wahl clipper!</li>
            <li>The first pair didn&#x27;t charge amazon replaced them and they are awesome clippers.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this coreless product I have used the corded Wahl for years and this is the first cordless to even come close.</li>
            <li>cordless feature is outstanding!</li>

            <li>Clippers work fine, and the battery life is great</li>
            <li>and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>Free trimmer is a welcome addition to kit.</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair and no cord getting in my way is amazing.</li>
            <li>This is really an amazing product from Wahl&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The quality is great,its light weight, its cordless thats also great.</li>
            <li>The battery life is amazing.</li>
            <li>It is amazing ..</li>
            <li>It is really an amazing thing.</li>
            <li>The lifetime of the battery for these clippers is amazing</li>
            <li>Having no cord is also a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you have a good grip on it.</li>
            <li>Nice to have cordless with no cord getting in yhe way.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I was very impressed and would definitely recommend getting them if you want a great cut for not a ton of money.</li>
            <li>I have been shaving my own head since I was 19.</li>
            <li>Great clippers, do a great job, easy to clean with lots of guides.  </li>
            <li>kind of defeats the purpose of \\&quot;wireless.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;*Update*&lt;br /&gt;Wahl</li>
            <li>We liked the clipper.  </li>
            <li>Nice that it is cordless, but didn&#x27;t shave as close as my corded version.  </li>
            <li>My Husband was Thrilled when My cordless clippers came within 2 days.</li>
            <li>i cut my own hair in the shower and it seems to be unaffected&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice clippers but my battery is not holding a charge.</li>
            <li>Nice carrying case for portability.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with itthank you so much for your product</li>
            <li>These were nice clippers</li>
            <li>This went to my husband who cuts his own hair and all 3 of our sons.</li>
            <li>She says they are as good or better than some salon clippers she has used.</li>
            <li>I was looking to replace the plug-in version of the Wahl I currently own with a rechargeable version.</li>
            <li>The attachments are well made and snap on nicely.</li>
            <li>Was going to return it, but he decided to give it a try and really liked it.</li>
            <li>These are a nice set, defiantly get the job done.</li>
            <li>They seem to strike a nice balance between power and price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also works nicely for beards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>your own clipper protects you from disease transmission and save your money&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The bag and bib are a nice touch.  </li>
            <li>If you cut your own hair and don&#x27;t want to get tangled in the cord and yank on it and accidentally make a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Not allowing them to correct the problem for you when they offer means it is your OWN FAULT that you are now out the money and don&#x27;t have a functioning set.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s done very well for me and continues giving excellent haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to have a cordless clipper.</li>
            <li>I really liked it.</li>
            <li>Used these for about a month now, all works well, nice cut.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice if they emailed me a paid shipping label to print out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m considering somehow attaching some sort of weighted material to the bottom of the clippers to make it more balanced, but haven&#x27;t thought of a good plan yet.  </li>
            <li>Kind of noisy but works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommend these for all of you searching for a nice pair of clippers.</li>
            <li>Works nicely.  </li>
            <li>They come with all the sizes and tools / goodies all in one nice bag.</li>
            <li>Some reviewers said that they could cut their own hair with these clippers, but I haven&#x27;t tried that.</li>
            <li>someone else, this may be an awesome kit; for me it really didn&#x27;t meet my expectations or needs.</li>
            <li>life is spectacularly long.&lt;br /&gt;over</li>
            <li>So, the solution, cut my own hair.</li>
            <li>I hold it close when shaving my own head.</li>
            <li>It is nice to not have to plug it in to the wall to cut your hair.</li>
            <li>I can cut my own hair out side</li>
            <li>These are just as good as those but the cordless aspect makes them that much better by lessening the time it takes to cut my hair.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still learning how to use them to cut my own hair in front of the mirror .  </li>
            <li>I do appreciate good customer service, and I&#x27;m upgrading this review to three stars, more for the company than for the product per se.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s a self-sufficient college grad and has been doing his own hair for years.  </li>
            <li>Nice clippers.</li>
            <li>Works well and delivers a nice haircut.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall nice product...</li>
            <li>I use the product to cut my own hair in the shower (weekly).  </li>
            <li>and I really liked the fact that it has a lithium battery rather than a ni-cad.  </li>
            <li>this is defenetely the purchase you should do, the clippler cuts really nicely</li>
            <li>My brother who has used a Wahl for years buzzing his own head often suggested me getting my own Wahl clipper which I shunned.</li>
            <li>If your hesitate like I was for years to buzz your own cut....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to not have the cord when i&#x27;m in the shower to shave my head.</li>
            <li>Nice grip.</li>
            <li>I was impressed with this set of clippers out of the box, I was able to cut my hair right away.  </li>
            <li>This can be very useful and it would be great if these clippers had a rubber loop too.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li>Decided to spend some money on some decent clippers, and these work perfectly.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product and am glad to recommend it.</li>
            <li>Perfect for me because I just moved out of my parents and need somewhere to start as I was new to the world of clippers.</li>
            <li>It does cut quick, even and does a great job.  </li>
            <li>4/3/16 update- replacement clippers are still going strong, so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, perfect knife for thick hear</li>
            <li>havent timed it yet- very strong just like any corded clipper.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use, my wife now cuts my hair.</li>
            <li>it does all the job plus more, really love it !</li>
            <li>Very light weight and effective.</li>
            <li>It seems to cut nicely but does not charge well the connection is very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I am able to cut my hair on my own now.</li>
            <li>The battery life is good but the on and off button feels flimsy and the accessory is cheap looking.</li>
            <li>So far they have been great!</li>
            <li>Wahl is by far the best consumer products out there.</li>
            <li>Fantastic quality and good battery life retention...</li>
            <li>When they worked, they were great, but for the price, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re worth.</li>
            <li>It seems just as powerful, works great, have had no problems with battery life or recharge rate.  </li>
            <li>Amazing, love the style, and its efficiency</li>
            <li>The best ever, this device have really saved me time and money and it really works great.</li>
            <li>Best professional clipper.</li>
            <li>So far these are great!</li>
            <li>By far the best with usage after a charge and have not had any snags.</li>
            <li>It is good clipper and cuts hair pretty good.</li>
            <li>Turn on his favorite show on the tablet, and I get a pretty easy experience with a great tool!  </li>
            <li>Great product - light and easy to use</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with how easy it was to cut my hair.</li>
            <li>I love love love this clipper!</li>
            <li>It cuts great, many attachments and DOES NOT GET HOT!</li>
            <li>These both are very good products and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>And while the detail trimmer isn&#x27;t as good as the clippers themselves, it&#x27;s still a much better deal than anything else currently available.  </li>
            <li>And while the detail trimmer isn&#x27;t as good as the clippers themselves, it&#x27;s still a much better deal than anything else currently available.  </li>
            <li>the trimmers and the clippers are weighted very well and fit perfectly in your hand while cutting.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li>Loved the clipper, it was loud but worked great.  </li>
            <li>I admit I did not use the trimmer, but one good look at them and you can figure out for yourself that they are nothing special.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been pretty happy with them.  </li>
            <li>is the first set of clippers I have ever purchased, and I am quite happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Very cheap construction.  </li>
            <li>Plastic like and very light..</li>
            <li>very important item</li>
            <li>do not use the beard trimmer, but the beard trimmer does feel very cheap.</li>
            <li>The cordless feature is amazing and so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Not the best I have ever seen but for the price these are the first Wahl clippers under $100 that are worth it.  </li>
            <li>Nice strong and mobile.</li>
            <li>Very nice cut the case it comes in could be better but overall very nice clippers</li>
            <li>very nice first clipper set</li>
            <li>The large clipper works great...</li>
            <li>Came fast, great product.</li>
            <li>I am very please and happy with this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>they apparently love it, which is why I keep on getting more and more orders through words of mouth...</li>
            <li>The clippers are really quite and are great quality blades.</li>
            <li>He has used a corded one for many years.  </li>
            <li>Many complements.</li>
            <li>I love it because it is cordless.</li>
            <li>But once I saw these and realized they didn&#x27;t have a pesky cord attached to them (that has so many times attempted to strangle me while knocking off everything on my bathroom sink), I thought I&#x27;d give em a try.</li>
            <li>I was glad I got them; they worked like a champ.  </li>
            <li>They cut even, which sped up the cut and made it look better, no chafing either.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use these in cosmetology school and love them.</li>
            <li>but I have yet to find one I am in love with anyway.</li>
            <li>Love this set.  </li>
            <li>$ more)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to buy a better one soon.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shears are also kind of cheap feeling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it a couple of months and already it&#x27;s more than paid for itself.</li>
            <li>Quite simply the best cordless clipper I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>I love this clipper.</li>
            <li>I have owned many razors (Conair, Norelco, etc...).</li>
            <li>one thing i did like thought is it it had a 1/2,1 1/2, 5,7, attachements which most clippers dont come with.</li>
            <li>(so I&#x27;m 99% sure it&#x27;s not the battery itself).  </li>
            <li>I am amending my review rating to reflect my experience with both the replacement product and the prompt, respectful customer service.</li>
            <li>5 haircuts and havent had to charge it yet :)</li>
            <li>love it would buy it again works well</li>
            <li>I was able to revive battery.</li>
            <li>Then wahl charger was able to finish charge.</li>
            <li>Otherwise have used maybe six times and it has more than  paid for itself.</li>
            <li>Noisier than most clippers I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>comes with many size attachments</li>
            <li>Sure, I could get a replacement for this one</li>
            <li>and I am completely satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>Great price and fast delivery</li>
            <li>but you get more than a half-dozen for the clipper-Packaging:</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best home-use clipper and trimmer on the market especially at this price.</li>
            <li>But it means the edges and sideburns are never shaved to the skin and need to be touched up more often.</li>
            <li>Also, being wireless, they make clipping my hair much more convenient.</li>
            <li>Wahl resharpened the blade for free!</li>
            <li>Love that they are cordless.</li>
            <li>I have been able to cut in all sort of places in which i would never be able to because of a cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are OK the trimer pulls ur hair.</li>
            <li>the better you get.</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>They fit really nice in your hand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(Tip: Divide the head into regions, use ascending numbers from bottom to top, blend with a rocking motion.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and yet I&#x27;m already getting many complements on my cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the barber&#x27;s scissors are not top-of-the-line.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best clippers I&#x27;ve used in ten years.</li>
            <li>Love them 10/10</li>
            <li>my grand sons.  </li>
            <li>I love my clippers and trimmers and don&#x27;t have to worry abt cords</li>
            <li>products are my wife&#x27;s favorite for the quality of the cut; but not the quality of the battery life.</li>
            <li>he love&#x27;s it</li>
            <li>Grandson says he&#x27;ll ask for haircuts more often now since this is so painless.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the hair clippers, don&#x27;t care for the beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li>The beard trimmer is ok, but I use an even cheaper one that also takes batteries.</li>
            <li>Love the cordless design.</li>
            <li>so I put an Andy Jackson in the safe each time.</li>
            <li>I DO recommend that you buy some more oil for the blades,</li>
            <li>Works Great and Fast shipping</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m not even sure how it happened</li>
            <li>That is more a bag design thing than unit design.  </li>
            <li>It needs a better carrying</li>
            <li>I just wish they put more effort into the case.</li>
            <li>I ended up going out and buying a rechargeable detail trimmer, which also ended up having a lot more</li>
            <li>Love the cordless</li>
            <li>I used a voltage converter, but it still made a sound like a machine gun!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Wahl clippers for over 15 years and have always been satisfied</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>and i have to say i love them .</li>
            <li>If it does I&#x27;ll be sure to update this review.</li>
            <li>listing needs to be more forthcoming.</li>
            <li>Cordless is nice - battery powered trimmer seems cheap.</li>
            <li>Without cord more comfy.</li>
            <li>To all women out there, buy this for your partner they would love you for it.</li>
            <li>the wahl product is great but good condition 100% better than thought it is really good proffesional use it everyday</li>
            <li>Be sure to put the oil that they provide</li>
            <li>love the fact that this model is wireless.</li>
            <li>Three stars mostly for the price.</li>
            <li>works great, so much easier than messing with a cord.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this relatively inexpensive product.</li>
            <li>It definitely takes an adjustment but it is perfect.</li>
            <li>He travels a lot and he is definitely enjoying it.  </li>
            <li>My hair cut looked better then before and clippers did not scratch me at all.  </li>
            <li>ok I guess, but sounded like a lawnmower.  </li>
            <li>Wahl could have really made this a great clipper set if they would have put forth a bit more effort.  </li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>Overall very happy with it</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>; clipper works OK to do the detailing.  </li>
            <li>Will probably get a better ROI on a better corded model and roll my $10 elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>The scenery is amazing and birds always enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Love the color coded guards for my aging eyes.</li>
            <li>I love these clippers.</li>
            <li>The clipper is everything advertised and more.</li>
            <li>For the price, I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better set of clippers.  </li>
            <li>so I bought those to see if more money meant better clippers.  </li>
            <li>and it also has properly fitting attachment combs.  </li>
            <li>Plus, companies can always improve a product more.  </li>
            <li>and it also has properly fitting attachment combs.  </li>
            <li>Plus, companies can always improve a product more.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love mine.</li>
            <li>finally a lithium Ion version of this cordless trimmers, I hope to get great use out of these!</li>
            <li>We have been using this for over a year and we are well satisfied.</li>
            <li>My husband decided to keep them which was ok with me.</li>
            <li>and I love them.  </li>
            <li>So I returned it with amazon and had to buy another one at walmart which was about $15 more.</li>
            <li>Firefighters who like to go shaved will love this .&lt;br</li>
            <li>I cut my hair much more often with this set up .</li>
            <li>Some people are able to style just like a barber with practice .</li>
            <li>I cut my hair much more often with this set up .</li>
            <li>Some people are able to style just like a barber with practice .</li>
            <li>I will try another brand (Philips) to see if those are any better.</li>
            <li>Conair clippers I had, were better.  </li>
            <li>Kind of cheap.</li>
            <li>directions for the clippers specifically state that it cannot be overcharged, so you can charge it after every haircut and know it will be safe from damage.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li>Made sure it was plugged and tried to recharge.  </li>
            <li>This was rather unexpected, but brilliant customer service.  </li>
            <li>Wahl makes a great product and Amazon shipped it fast.</li>
            <li>Yeah Wahl ! :-)</li>
            <li>It is more a matter of understanding how it works, and then making sure you pay attention to it.</li>
            <li>What I like the most about  </li>
            <li>I love this 27-piece kit:</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>Until you use this cordless clipper you won&#x27;t be able to appreciate the convenience of not being tethered to a wall outlet.</li>
            <li>Cheap quality!</li>
            <li>array of attachments, most of which I will never use&lt;br /&gt;Extra</li>
            <li>is a bit lacking - does not provide protection for devices or a way to organize the many attachments</li>
            <li>Also, once it dies I will still be able to cut my hair while it&#x27;s plugged in.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Wahl 4oz clipper oil with it and am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Been using this clippers set on my boys haircuts for the last 4 months; works great!!!</li>
            <li>So the things I mention are just to make it better</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am able to keep myself trimmed and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned a corded Wahl clipper set for over 10 years, and wanted to get something more portable.</li>
            <li>WARNING: If you charge the clippers with the wall charger, make sure you unplug the clipper from the cable when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic and have sharp blades give perfect result and sizes very suitable for palm and contain the bag on many options and wonderful&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>So far so good - he says the cut quick and perfectly and loves the easy cord free</li>
            <li>This thing works great, and other than a goofy on/off switch, it is a great unit.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, they buzzed right through, no problem at all.  </li>
            <li>Nice and sharp, wireless, awesome.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve probably had this trimmer about 2 months and still on first charge!!!</li>
            <li>I have older Triton lipo charger because I fly rc planes and helicopters.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it great value for the price</li>
            <li>They did not give an even cut or finish and the attachment combs were very cheaply made and easy to break.  </li>
            <li>THE GOOD&lt;br /&gt;The clipper and trimmer are pretty good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems to hold a pretty good charge throughout the haircutting process, which takes me about 15-30 minutes of intermittent on/off use.  </li>
            <li>These cut smoothly and very quickly!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still on the original charge!</li>
            <li>It was worth spending the money to buy it!!</li>
            <li>These new cordless clippers are really great.</li>
            <li>This new Wahl works great in the battery department.</li>
            <li>Lithium Ion batteries hold a charge for a very long time so are an excellent choice for this device.&lt;br /&gt;-Adjustable head: with no attachments clipped on the head, theis lever permits adjusting how close the clipper will cut.  </li>
            <li>pro set because it seemed to be a better concept that would work more accurately with the number/color setup.  </li>
            <li>as strong as the corded version I had before; cordless feature allows much more flexibility</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;d prefer if the head were removeable so it can more easily be cleaned.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We love them and found them easy to use.  </li>
            <li>If it still works fine in 3 years, I&#x27;ll upgrade to 5 stars :-)</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget to clean and oil (with included brush and oil) after each use!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re light, sleek, and cut better than my Oster and Andis clippers.</li>
            <li>Arrived before I expected and worked perfectly .</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s performed great so far.</li>
            <li>I have bought many clippers over the years (primarily from Wahl), and have witnessed the evolution of this product to what it is today.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;The free case that holds everything could have more pouches to keep things organized.</li>
            <li>Most importantly without the cord, I can do it all by myself.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to replace my simpler Wahl razor which I use primarily for &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; (more like maintaining a round-the-clock 5-o&#x27;clock shadow).</li>
            <li>This replaced my old plug-in clippers and it works great.</li>
            <li>All is great so far.  </li>
            <li>I use them professionally for work and they are a great product.</li>
            <li>The detail trimmers works well, I also use it for trimming my beard every 3 days and it feels great for my soft skin.</li>
            <li>Happy to say I was able to fix this problem by running the tip of the blades back and forth across a piece of sandpaper on a counter top.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d rather have something that feels more secure or not as slippery.  </li>
            <li>so they are more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Good battery life, and it cuts through my hair really well.  </li>
            <li>this year he loved it so much.  </li>
            <li>The multiple size heads are very good and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that they&#x27;re cordless and very powerful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lowering my rating to 3 stars from my original rating of 4 stars, because though the customer service was good, I still had to go through the hassle of replacing the clippers, plus I had to pay for my own shipping, and also I realize now how loud the clippers are.</li>
            <li>Nice clean cut, easy clean up, and plenty of power.</li>
            <li>I have used other brands of clippers but Wahl is the best.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, pretty pleased!</li>
            <li>is that the head was removeable so could easily be cleaned and thoroughly lubricated after each use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Good basic trimmer which does everything you would expect it to and the battery life is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I take these with me on business trips and it&#x27;s easy to cut my hair with them.  </li>
            <li>and this clipper is by far the best I&#x27;ve used to date that is for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I was paying $15 for at my barber.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a ton of accessories and easy instructions.</li>
            <li>And, you can easily hold it in one hand.</li>
            <li>Compared to most clippers they feel light and cheap.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>so easy to use  </li>
            <li>Easy charging and battery time is sufficient.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and there are even videos online showing you how to use them.</li>
            <li>Easy to cut the hair.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and having</li>
            <li>Cleans well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to handle without the cord.  </li>
            <li>So so easy.</li>
            <li>Strong , cut mine , son , dad.</li>
            <li>Been going strong since purchased in 2013.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a starter pack - but the main product is good.</li>
            <li>Lightweight but strong.</li>
            <li>Strong.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still running strong.</li>
            <li>The hair clippers hold a charge great, I mean really great..  </li>
            <li>We do lots of hair cuts and these clippers are as easy to use as any, no pulling, switches work fine</li>
            <li>Those were pretty good and much higher quality than anything Conair has to be sure.  </li>
            <li>average at best.  </li>
            <li>This is hands down the best cordless clipper I have owned.</li>
            <li>Having no chord made the process so much more easy, quick, and enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then, I charge them and they are good as new.</li>
            <li>Light weight  easy  to maintain  cordless  </li>
            <li>We found it light and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;d recommend you charge it fully after every two or three haircuts and should be fine on battery</li>
            <li>but that is cheap and easy to buy.</li>
            <li>Kept them oiled as instructed &amp; always chalked it up to my grandsons baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>and you should be fine for years.  </li>
            <li>Clippers worked fine until I had them 20 months.</li>
            <li>They hold the charge fine for me, but don&#x27;t cut my hair.  </li>
            <li>It cuts smooth and even and allows for easy self-cutting.</li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to achieve the advertised 15 minute quick charge.</li>
            <li>It will be the best money you spent on your head EVER.....!!!</li>
            <li>Saw this product originally at BB&amp;B, bought it online, and now 1 year later - still happy and going strong with it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am amazed by the huge difference in performance.</li>
            <li>huge kit</li>
            <li>they cut great but sound like you&#x27;re holding a lawn mower next to your ear.</li>
            <li>Better than expected, great battery life.</li>
            <li>Better than expected, great battery life.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made a huge mistake buying this clipper.  </li>
            <li>It sounds like they’ve designed it to send WAY too much power to the motor – like the whole thing could fly apart at any moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the material feels like cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>the hair clips are also cheap plastic rather than metal.</li>
            <li>The item works very well and the battery life is quite amazing...</li>
            <li>The clipper is sleek and light weight.</li>
            <li>Overall great buy.</li>
            <li>It worked OK but was not cutting evenly.</li>
            <li>Seem to still be working great after several months.  </li>
            <li>Also, the smaller razor is used for precision trimming and it works great as well.</li>
            <li>Once i got this it was light and of course no wire</li>
            <li>I took it apart, and it&#x27;s got a commonly available cell inside.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet, gives a great cut and holds a charge.</li>
            <li>The clipper is awsome, powerful, ergonomic and stylish.</li>
            <li>but it does work well and is dirt cheap.</li>
            <li>Units sound and act as though they&#x27;re plugged into power.  </li>
            <li>This is handy for trimming around the ears.&lt;br /&gt;-Modern design: sleeker and more comfortable in the hand than the old design</li>
            <li>We put it on the charger between cuts after the 2nd haircut (5-10 minutes) and it works great.  </li>
            <li>So i have to buy another omvolter  from 220 to 110 V , and another think to fit in to  US to EU sockets ...</li>
            <li>They cut smooth and are light weight.</li>
            <li>If you cut hair outdoors (I have a project where I give free haircuts on the sidewalk or at events I&#x27;m invited to)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>The silver decorative part moves around as if it&#x27;s a cheap add on.</li>
            <li>Great gift for my son and he uses it daily.  </li>
            <li>Man this feels cheap..</li>
            <li>It is so cheap that the plastic body feels like its going to crack every time you turn it on/off.</li>
            <li>But overall it&#x27;s a great product for this price.  </li>
            <li>(the charging indicator light wouldn&#x27;t turn on when plugged in and it wouldn&#x27;t charge or turn on --</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and maintain.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>With cord it is more powerful.</li>
            <li>You know that sound a lawnmower makes when when it gets into tall grass?</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I had a cheap set of clippers before that I used for years.  </li>
            <li>It feels comfortable and balanced to hold.</li>
            <li>Awesome clippers, the Lithium batteries last much longer and the motor is more powerful.</li>
            <li>Smooth as silk.</li>
            <li>and I tensed up waiting for them to &#x27;catch&#x27; or tangle in my hair like my cheap clippers</li>
            <li>Have used several times now and each time was a great experience.</li>
            <li>such a great deal.</li>
            <li>Big trimmers are louder than what I was expecting from reading the reviews, but they work great.</li>
            <li>The battery life is really great and lasts through multiple hair cuts with out a recharge.</li>
            <li>They are light in weight.</li>
            <li>I see complaints about how they feel cheap.</li>
            <li>They work great and the Lithium battery is well-worth the extra expense.  </li>
            <li>Light weight plastic exterior.  </li>
            <li>The adjustment screw is cheap and doesn&#x27;t always work</li>
            <li>Would not charge, charge light would not come on.</li>
            <li>It could easily fit in a glove box .</li>
            <li>Holds in the hand comfortably.</li>
            <li>The cut is always even and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The smaller clipper that comes with this kit isn&#x27;t that great</li>
            <li>Light won&#x27;t even come on.  </li>
            <li>Light weight handle effortlessly.</li>
            <li>Great kit, pouch, has all the add ons for different hair length.</li>
            <li>The smaller razor is a great bonus, cuts all the ear hair, etc....</li>
            <li>For personal use i think this is a great product.</li>
            <li>Much sound and fury, signifying nothing.</li>
            <li>Comes with an extensive range of depth control clip ons, including a great eyebrow attachment.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They are light, ridiculously light, plastic, just junk.</li>
            <li>Great clipper, have been using since March 2012 and have only charged it 3 times.</li>
            <li>These “feel” cheap in every way compared to both the Conair and Remington items they replaced.</li>
            <li>Light weight also.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately it cuts and trims well also.</li>
            <li>Great battery life and a solid performer.</li>
            <li>and i would have to go over one area multiple times to make sure the cut was good.</li>
            <li>We use the clippers weekly, so far so good.</li>
            <li>Now in the warm weather it is so nice to sit outside and get a haircut</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far so good.</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>Great item much better than expected for the price...</li>
            <li>But generally it&#x27;s good so far.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see - maybe I&#x27;ll update this again when I&#x27;ve had some good trouble-free service with my fixed clippers.</li>
            <li>and it works good without any problems so far.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very satisfied with it, and charging is very quick.</li>
            <li>The large main one works great.</li>
            <li>and it is very useful for speed jobs.</li>
            <li>VERY FAST VERY SMOOTH</li>
            <li>This cordless Wahl is very powerful and with the lithium battery there&#x27;s no need to worry about finishing the job you start.  </li>
            <li>really, if all you got was the main clipper set, this would still be a great value.</li>
            <li>Batteries/charge lasted all day everyday Love these!!!</li>
            <li>With many handy features such as the quick charge, and the many adjustable settings this cordless Wahl delivers a 1-2 knockout punch.</li>
            <li>Great value for the price, and cutting my husband&#x27;s hair is now SO easy!!! :)</li>
            <li>Trimmer is a nice addition, nice for travel pack, cuz it uses AA batteries which are easy to replace.&lt;br /&gt;Overall feeling is not bad, worth money that you spend, 4 stars for cheap extra stuff in package.</li>
            <li>I love love love this hair cutting set, best I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>Please hear me Wahl Corp., and market this product in a manner deserving of a low-cost, high quality product that bears your name.</li>
            <li>We previously had a corded version - this cordless one is still great Wahl quality, but more flexible and therefore can be used</li>
            <li>Excellent tool to carry around in a small pouch.</li>
            <li>My wife has been providing me with haircuts for most of the 50-years that we have been married.</li>
            <li>well worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>has great customer service and after immense research they really put a lot of love into their product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>I was excited to get a cordless clipper, but it does not hold a charge.  </li>
            <li>(Original review)  </li>
            <li>was excited when it arrived because it was cordless and adustable, without using guards.</li>
            <li>Plus they sent me a return label so I can return the original one at no cost to me.</li>
            <li>The first was louder and vibrated more than a sherman tank.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this clipper so far.</li>
            <li>ok, but be aware the trimmer is not rechargeable, you have to use AA batteries.</li>
            <li>and I was excited for her to buy these for home use.</li>
            <li>Works great, hold a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>Top cover needs more ribs for rigidity and give the unit a more solid feel.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve charged it over night, then waited 2 weeks, shaved my head, waited another two weeks, and shaved my head again all on the original charge.</li>
            <li>I have owned  several shavers but this is by far the best quality.</li>
            <li>It is powerful easy to handle  </li>
            <li>I just clean what I can and keep it oiled after every use.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I did not spend hundreds on a more professional clipper because this is the bomb</li>
            <li>Now after it is charged the bright blue charging light stays on permanently, even when unplugged.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know for sure, but it felt like they cut better than my old plug-in clippers (also Wahl).</li>
            <li>The blade teeth broke clean off.</li>
            <li>He loves all of the accessories and said that this makes quick and accurate work of his trimming and head shaving.  </li>
            <li>Clean cut every time.</li>
            <li>I cut both of my sons hair , and my own with this product ,and still have enough juice to do more hair cuts .</li>
            <li>Over the years I have used many clippers and these are by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Nothing to clean up ....</li>
            <li>Cuts clean.</li>
            <li>Being cordless is really awesome and makes me move freely during hair cutting.&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts long time and even I don&#x27;t remember how frequently I charge it</li>
            <li>Works Perfect, holds a decently long charge, and comes with more than enough accessories.</li>
            <li>Works great and always can find the right tool between the two clippers and multiple attachments.</li>
            <li>The previous best was the first set of Wahl clippers that I had.</li>
            <li>While the performance was fine (cut smoothly, reasonably powerful though not like their corded models), the battery situation is a problem on these.  </li>
            <li>the way if you want more mineral oil go to the anti-constipation section of walmart/target and get their mineral oil in large bottle.</li>
            <li>It seems well made and solid and does a good job of shearing my hair to the 1/2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Battery is good enough!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it is good clipper and I would recommend to who don&#x27;t mind big and bulky clippers.</li>
            <li>My husband loves this so much that he bought two more to give as gifts for his friends.</li>
            <li>After a full charge, I can&#x27;t tell any difference in clipping between it and the corded version.  </li>
            <li>Good thing is that you can plug it in for just 15 (if needs be) and won&#x27;t affect the overall capacity (no memory) of the battery.  </li>
            <li>Good purchase overall.</li>
            <li>Its a good product, however, the faceplate on the big cutter came off so now it rattles away.</li>
            <li>The product is good and it does it job properly.</li>
            <li>Seem okay, just not what I really needed.  </li>
            <li>Many thanks</li>
            <li>&amp; I was through in about 10 minutes complete with trimming around the ears and neck, made nice by the included trimmer clippers.</li>
            <li>Did not want to spend as much for clippers, but glad I did.  </li>
            <li>All my peachfuzz and sparsely scattered remnants of what was once a head full of hair.  </li>
            <li>The Good:  - clipper made in the usa  - lithium ion (will update this 2 years from now see if it has the same juice</li>
            <li>is a bit of a chore, but otherwise the customer service was good and the replacement process was relatively painless.</li>
            <li>Worked really well, glad I got it....</li>
            <li>Smooth as butter and just as powerful as my corded clippers.</li>
            <li>I know what tugging is and this WAHL has good power for a personal clipper .</li>
            <li>So I figured I&#x27;d give this a try since it got such good</li>
            <li>I recommend this clipper to anyone who needs a good quality clipper for personal grooming.</li>
            <li>My whiskers grow fast and in every direction and many are curly, but after 3 full days without a trim, no strays have popped up and it still looks like</li>
            <li>Not bad at all considering these are battery powered devices.  </li>
            <li>The smaller one is very good, a little louder than my older corded one but is so nice not to be fighting with the cord, cuts very precise and is easily stored in the case.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m a professional and they hold a charge all day, trimmers aren&#x27;t as great though I put new energizer batteries in them</li>
            <li>And super fast delivery:)</li>
            <li>Good strong mooter which works on even wet hair.</li>
            <li>, my older Wahl was great but the cord is a major annoyance.</li>
            <li>These fit the bill and go right along with my beard trimmer that is a Wahl lithium Ion as well.</li>
            <li>The spring inside is pretty strong and it&#x27;ll pop out immediately once you loosen the screen.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This may be obvious for most users, but be sure to clean and oil the clipper after every use.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is much more lightweight than the professional version I had, and it does require a battery, but works just fine for me.  </li>
            <li>Overall the large clipper is really great.  </li>
            <li>Have used other Wahl Lithium Ion clippers and they were great.</li>
            <li>This is my first wahl trimmer and I am more than satisfied with the performance thus far.</li>
            <li>I had an older version of this clipper with the cord, and I have to say the new one is not as good.  </li>
            <li>affords me a fresh, clean looking cut every Monday at work.</li>
            <li>This model cuts as well as the classic corded version but is much more convenient to use.</li>
            <li>The only con I have is the blade cut by itself is not as close as others but everything else is exceptional.</li>
            <li>They replaced my old  cheap clippers and these are a thousand times better in performance and quality.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and am contemplating buying more as back-ups in the future.</li>
            <li>I was trying to replace the older one, but I find myself using that more than this one.  </li>
            <li>It feels light and somewhat cheap, but it&#x27;s holding up very well and no issues.  </li>
            <li>Of course, the clippers&#x27; main function is to cut hair, and like my previous corded Wahl clippers, these do it perfectly.  </li>
            <li>this big with such impressive build quality, but</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Finally, I&#x27;m trying to buy Made in America as much as I can, so I was happy to see they</li>
            <li>The battery life is decent, although for a Lithium Ion battery you&#x27;d expect more.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I like this set and believe they are the best home clipper set on the market.00 at the time] and the shipping that made the overall total $100.  </li>
            <li>The battery life is decent, although for a Lithium Ion battery you&#x27;d expect more.  </li>
            <li>It will quick charge in 15 minutes</li>
            <li>It will quick charge in 15 minutes</li>
            <li>The 15 minute quick charge means that we don&#x27;t have to plan tonight to cut my hair tomorrow night.</li>
            <li>Quick charge, cuts well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The big clippers actually do a great job of cleaning up my neck without nicking it (as much), so I just use those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>machine is very plastic-y and feels borderline cheap in build quality materials, but is very powerful.</li>
            <li>The clippers give an even level cut that does better than the high dollar clippers like Oster and the price</li>
            <li>The clippers give an even level cut that does better than the high dollar clippers like Oster and the price</li>
            <li>As it is the trimmer and most of the attachments will be gathering dust on a high shelf in my bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li>but with caution with the charging battery failure and it not being able to use a cord with it when the battery doesn&#x27;t work!!!  </li>
            <li>: scissors are fine, colorful heads are quite too cheap, but not broken yet.</li>
            <li>Excellent battery life, clear sharp cuts.</li>
            <li>When I first picked them up I told her they seemed really cheap</li>
            <li>I have only used it a couple of times but have been very pleased.</li>
            <li>Time will tell how the batteries hold up, but for now I have to say I&#x27;m very pleased and would definitely buy these again.</li>
            <li>Not near as good as the wahl with cord.</li>
            <li>charge lasts a good long time</li>
            <li>Build quality feels good, battery lasts plenty long for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Trimmer is more powerful than the older Wahl I had</li>
            <li>The trimmer is a great adition, as we have only had the main clippers up until</li>
            <li>also  work great for keeping my beard trimmed, and will take neck stubble down almost as close as my razor.</li>
            <li>I take duct tape and go from ear to ear and shave my neck below making a nice clean line in the back of my head .</li>
            <li>I take duct tape and go from ear to ear and shave my neck below making a nice clean line in the back of my head .</li>
            <li>Able to cut my husband&#x27;s hair at home and make it look pretty decent!</li>
            <li>I give it 4 instead of 5 because after a year or two it has been getting louder and it vibrates more than when it was new.  </li>
            <li>Love my new clippers and trimmers.</li>
            <li>They worked great but the battery died in less than a year</li>
            <li>&gt; the clippers are both fantastic and hold a nice long</li>
            <li>The small trimmer works great on the back head side to give good shapes.</li>
            <li>more size selections than previous kits -- probably more than you&#x27;ll ever need since a 3-4 size would have been fine</li>
            <li>the constant apologies and the &amp;#34;1-800&amp;#34; number and fix the issue that so many of us are complaining about !</li>
            <li>It also comes in a wonderful soft carry bag that would fit easily in a small carry bag for traveling .</li>
            <li>Good use on a single battery charge.lots of accessories provided and useful too.can be used while traveling without the chager</li>
            <li>its a great beginning for a single father on a budget who wants to keep there boys neat a trim.</li>
            <li>It works very well and has a wide range of tips that make it easy to give a good haircut.</li>
            <li>Generally speaking the process was very easy</li>
            <li>/&gt;the little trimmer is great for the ears and my neck</li>
            <li>/&gt;They haven&#x27;t pulled my hair, and they cut pretty cleanly and powerfully, but for some reason they don&#x27;t seem to cut all my hairs.</li>
            <li>The small clipper looks like a plastic toy but the main clipper is awesome.</li>
            <li>Cut fast and clean and stay cool doing it.</li>
            <li>This is a good product but the large hair clipper has a short battery life compared to the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used for a long period of time so can&#x27;t comment, but sure with a full charge it would be fine.</li>
            <li>They feel really lightweight and cheap</li>
            <li>Worked great for over a year, but then became unchargeable (and hence unusable) after sitting in storage for a few months.  </li>
            <li>Cuts very well and smooth.</li>
            <li>It is light weight, but Dies too fast.</li>
            <li>Far better precision that allows me to get shorter hair lengths without looking shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using an old Wahl for many years, I was reluctant to try anything else.  </li>
            <li>All the extra clip pieces are nice to have.</li>
            <li>it seems to be powerful.  </li>
            <li>I have no training and am able to cut 3 adult men&#x27;s hair and 2 children.</li>
            <li>first, a full charge lasted a month if not used.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>The unit worked very well, the only thing that I did not like was the size of the hair clippers, but I will get use to it; the smaller unit ,the trimmer, is great!</li>
            <li>and they aren&#x27;t that powerful...</li>
            <li>I take extremely good care of all my things and carefully cleaned it and oiled between uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Detailer is powerful too if you put Nicads in it.</li>
            <li>Clippers are really powerful and the trimmer runs on batteries which is no biggie for me.</li>
            <li>It is powerful, fast and precise.</li>
            <li>have now had the chance to evaluate the replacement clippers for 6-months worth of haircuts.  </li>
            <li>Totaly worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>I will say that these were powerful and the unit is well made.</li>
            <li>So far after a month (about 2 uses) it is working much better.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to save some money and cut your own hair or family&#x27;s hair at home.</li>
            <li>but it is well worth</li>
            <li>It was far more to-the-point and useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t worry about the money, your pet is worth it.</li>
            <li>as powerful as corded clipper</li>
            <li>Quiet and nice cut.</li>
            <li>I always cut my own hair since I keep it so short.</li>
            <li>Why wait a month&#x27;s worth of time?</li>
            <li>Kind of a short cut.</li>
            <li>Most of friends my have soft hair like mine</li>
            <li>dont know if my $10 shipping and waiting is worth it.  </li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I have always been one to cut my own hair for several years.</li>
            <li>6 haircuts(i cut my own hair and my son) and only had to charge it one time.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Depending on what you use this item for it may be one of the most versatile shavers not in the regular advertising cycle light.</li>
            <li>this one is far better.  </li>
            <li>Nice powerful motor on the larger unit.  </li>
            <li>Slips out of hand, and not as powerful as corded Wahl.</li>
            <li>These clippers are awesome they don&#x27;t bind up with thick hair or when making fast passes.</li>
            <li>Liked the product because it is cordless, quiet, and cuts well.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months now and the battery charge seems to last nicely as well.  </li>
            <li>Just as powerful as the corded Oster clipper that i have been using for years.  </li>
            <li>I rarely have to charge it.</li>
            <li>Powerful, long-lasting.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s versatile, lightweight, and powerful.</li>
            <li>combined price of these two units was just a wee bit more than the price of replacement blades for the professional model.  </li>
            <li>The clippers work great and come with more attachments that what I have traditionally seen in other units.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try the ear trimmer as I have never been able to do white walls over the ears .</li>
            <li>Overall I highly recommend this product but when you receive it, be sure to check and make sure that everything is there.</li>
            <li>but I prefer to have another professional set to make my lineup very clean</li>
            <li>Comes in a nice zip case to store all the guide combs, with a small trimmer great for over ears and back of neck trimming, and have had them for going on five years now.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>Notmany companies take the initiative to make things right for their customers these days.  </li>
            <li>Again, I want to thank Wahl for taking the time to proactively make this right for me.  </li>
            <li>They have tried to make it right, so it&#x27;s on you for not letting them.</li>
            <li>Shoulder covering thing was thrown right the way.</li>
            <li>, cuts right through.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried alot of brands since then to try and find the right clipper.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s zipping right through it,</li>
            <li>So, based on their claim, right there on the box, that it will hold a charge for up to a year, I figured I could charge them after I use them, then unplug and store.</li>
            <li>This is the right mix of quality (cut) and convenience (cordless).  </li>
            <li>Everything you need and usable right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>Replacement was sent right out.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased and highly recommend this kit!</li>
            <li>First let me start by saying I used this clippers to cut my own shortly cropped hair</li>
            <li>However, for the Fast Feeds to be efficient you have to take them apart to clean them thoroughly and then reassemble them.  </li>
            <li>am a Man with very soft, big-curls but strong type of hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for a quick trim around the mustache/neckline areas, but didn&#x27;t have enough attachments, and didn&#x27;t fit other &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34; attachments I also had from Wahl.  </li>
            <li>I shaved my beard off in about 90 seconds (i tried to bog it down by going too fast, but it did a great job of keeping up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>I have used other products and they were no near as nice or good of quality as Wahl.</li>
            <li>Very smart choice.</li>
            <li>Strong durable but pulls hear and is kind of heavy.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully, this one wont exhibit the limited battery life I experienced with the old design.  </li>
            <li>Works Great, but the small clippers use batteries.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small trimmer with AA battery works great too.  </li>
            <li>every use (only takes a minute or two) and after 15 years of regular family haircuts it worked as flawlessly as it did on day-1 (except for the old NiCad batteries)  </li>
            <li>It works great, no clipper attachments to small unit.</li>
            <li>I like the soft-sided bag it comes with (as opposed to the cheap plastic box you normally get).</li>
            <li>These probably make my fourth set of clippers and they are definitely the best so far.</li>
            <li>It works really well: cuts hair smoothly without any problems, no cord, holds the charge well, doesn&#x27;t sound loud (depends on your preference</li>
            <li>In the summer, I cut hair outside and with the clippers being cordless, it really makes it more convenient!</li>
            <li>The casting on my blades was absolutely not rough but very clean and the clipper is chrome and black very nice in appearance as well as full normal size .&lt;br</li>
            <li>The clipper comes with a complete set of tools needed for home hair cut and the smaller trimmer is very powerful and gives a nice trim of the beard.</li>
            <li>However I thought it would be a little bit more sophisticated, but that is just the looks.</li>
            <li>Very sharp blades, cuts just as good as the corded one I had before.  </li>
            <li>But the new models seem to be cheap junk</li>
            <li>After an email than a phone call i purchased a new set of trimmer blades for $6.95 -free</li>
            <li>Easy to use and very convenient since the main clipper can be charged and used on the go</li>
            <li>I dished out a few more bucks and picked up the Wahl Chromado and that thing is much better.</li>
            <li>So far still going strong.</li>
            <li>Not a deal-breaker for me, but if you&#x27;re sensitive to that kind of thing, or if you are giving a haircut to a young child who might get scared, it could be an issue.</li>
            <li>guide combs fall off when in use far to easily.  </li>
            <li>The cordless feature is great for cutting one&#x27;s own hair.</li>
            <li>THE SMALL ONE IS OK BUT USES BATTERIES!!</li>
            <li>The Small precision trimmer is a very nice addition.  </li>
            <li>They both cut very well and came with many clipper guards that fit the large clipper only.</li>
            <li>All that I expected from Wahl, and more!</li>
            <li>First one went dead after one charge, but the second one works great!</li>
            <li>Right now the only thing I found that I think could have been better is the carrying case.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was able to send it right to his home several states away.  </li>
            <li>I used them for the first time today and was pleasantly surprised with how strong they were.</li>
            <li>The extra smaller shaver is very handy.</li>
            <li>Great clippers, plenty of power to get the job done, quiet, minimal vibration, and a nice storage case to put them away until next time.</li>
            <li>battery however holds the charge very very well.  </li>
            <li>translation very MUCH pain.  </li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve pretty accepted my tonsure&#x27;s fate as being bald, this Wahl 79600 is pretty much not much of use to me, but hey, it looks good.</li>
            <li>I put it away, 2 weeks later got it back out and gave another hair cut, battery still full charge and just as good as the first time.</li>
            <li>I have barbed and shaved more the four times on a single full charge.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts for 15 haircuts or more and but to be fair once again I would like to stress my entire head can be cut in 2 minutes or less.</li>
            <li>The clipper is little bigger than i had anticipated but it looks stylish and good clean, contemporary design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty decently quiet, and cut very smoothly.</li>
            <li>- The price is good, you get a lot of stuff for little money.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>The little trimmer good for going around the ear and hairs under the nose/upper mustache, but</li>
            <li>So far it appears to be a very high quality product, complete with a lot of nice accessories.</li>
            <li>Does not cut clean, may need new blades already.</li>
            <li>You might find it kind of hard to take on and off upon initial use but once you start using them, they snap on nicely and secure and can be interchanged very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have an Oster clipper and an Oster trimmer, but the trimmer was quite old and the clipper is huge.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>all my first impression 4/5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My first one had misaligned blades which I tried to adjust</li>
            <li>I bought Wahl because my old one was fantastic and used hundreds of times.</li>
            <li>The ties tore off the cape the first time I tied them.</li>
            <li>I was able to shave my entire head in under 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>I love that as soon as summer comes he can cut his hair outside</li>
            <li>Just stick your thumb on the blade and hold it in place and screw away ;)</li>
            <li>Many accessories come into the box for different lengths and styles of hair cuts.</li>
            <li>look pretty well and brings every thing you could need to get started</li>
            <li>Next time i&#x27;ll just buy one with a cord, cheaper and seem more durable</li>
            <li>I first bought one of these Wahl Lithium Ion clippers a couple of years ago and it worked for about a year until it died and would not charge.</li>
            <li>this is the first cordless clipper i&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>Cut like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li>and I am still on the first charge.  </li>
            <li>My lesson, pay a bit more a get a proper one.</li>
            <li>Product was exactly as describe.</li>
            <li>It works as smooth as the professional clippers of hairdressers.</li>
            <li>do recommend even if you&#x27;ll have regular hair cut with a barber as you&#x27;ll be able to trim your hair in between hair cuts and during your travel.</li>
            <li>They work pretty well and the battery lasts a while.</li>
            <li>After buying several sets of wahl clippers, I was glad to see that they made a cordless version.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the clippers so far (have only used twice).</li>
            <li>Overall, I am satisfied with by this unit convenient and not expensive for the family will I like it</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>These are the first clippers I have every owned.</li>
            <li>I called Wahl and they said it has a 5 year warranty and that I could ship it to them and that they would send me a free fixed or replacement clippers within 2 to 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>and I am charging it for the first time as we speak.  </li>
            <li>THE MACHINE!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The machine went through my hair like a hot knife goes thru butter.</li>
            <li>would recommend this product if WAHL redesigns this line for easier cleaning and maintenance at some point in the future.ade with a hex key to be able to get inside the clipper.</li>
            <li>Heck, I would have even paid a bit more if the cons I listed were addressed properly.</li>
            <li>It looks great and we have already saved money since she has given me at least 10 haircuts.</li>
            <li>Works very well!</li>
            <li>Clippers cut well, and I love the fact that it doesnt have a cord to constantly get in the way.</li>
            <li>Unless you are willing to pay $70-$80.00 at a department store including Walmart, forget it.</li>
            <li>I next bought the Wahl corded clippers @ Wal-Mart and found them surprizingly better quality all around.  </li>
            <li>Oil the clippers first.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Cuts very well !</li>
            <li>I love these clippers, This is the second time I bought them because a friend dropped the first ones I had.</li>
            <li>Love it but lite too short</li>
            <li>charge is enough for more than 40 mins of operation.&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
            <li>, it produces the noise similar to most of the hair</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time today, and it work just as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find the battery lasts pretty well.  </li>
            <li>This is my first set of electric clippers</li>
            <li>When I first got them I charged them over night</li>
            <li>This machine was made to last more than seven years.</li>
            <li>I looked around and all the different brands, types, styles.........etc., and this one just seemed to keep coming to the top of what I was looking at.</li>
            <li>I wanted my wife to try and cut my hair, but I wanted to be able to do it outside if we wanted, without having to haul a cord around all the time.</li>
            <li>Would prefer the small trimmer to be better for alignments, but it does the job ok.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is better than anything I owned before.</li>
            <li>If the big clipper had a close shave as the small shaver, it would be perfect.</li>
            <li>First, the backstory.</li>
            <li>I never oiled the old set and it is important that you do as directed.</li>
            <li>I bought the balding clipper a few months ago and this works just as good</li>
            <li>Thought the trimmer would be a little better, but it&#x27;s AA powered, so not as strong, but still works</li>
            <li>It was not very expensive but definatly worth the price.</li>
            <li>it is super powerful like my old corded,</li>
            <li>In order to clean out all the gunk and build up you will accumulate overtime you have to completely remove the blade with a hex key to be able to get inside the clipper.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a couple months now and have used it a handful of times cutting my own hair, and as expected it works great and is much more convenient being cordless.  </li>
            <li>As long as you either leave them plugged into the wall all the time, or unplug the clippers when they&#x27;re full, you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>As long as you either leave them plugged into the wall all the time, or unplug the clippers when they&#x27;re full, you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>But they aren&#x27;t as light and cheap as I expected them to be.</li>
            <li>THE CLIPPERS ARE GREAT ON CUTTING MY GRAND- CHILDRENS HAIR .THEY</li>
            <li>I think we will be able to cut our boys hair now without having to worry about shattering their eardrums from the loud noise of my old clippers.</li>
            <li>so I believed they would be higher quality and more durable in the long run</li>
            <li>In the beginning, they did seem better to me as far as more precise cutting and more motor power.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a corded model of this clipper for a little over 10 years and have been very pleased.  </li>
            <li>The small trimmer that comes with this set does not come with any attachments and the overall build quality is not as nice as the plug-in versions (they feel light and cheap).</li>
            <li>well worth the money, highly recommend if you don&#x27;t want to spoil yourself with a matching set of Pearl 76&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>feel compelled to update this to reflect a positive customer support experience.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Another item on the positive side of the ledger.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was also pretty fast</li>
            <li>The clipper holds a charge for a long time and cuts even better than the corded Wahl it replaced.  </li>
            <li>Love the cordless feature and unit stays charged for a long time without having to recharge.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t want it in the first place</li>
            <li>Two more minor things... -</li>
            <li>They charged fast and I used them for the first time today.</li>
            <li>These cordless clippers are exactly what I wanted and they really do the job.</li>
            <li>It is more powerful and lasts longer than other battery powered units.</li>
            <li>Seems to hold a charge for a long time, before having to re-charge, and I love not having to deal with the cord anymore.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The small single-AA trimmer (for mustache and neck-line etc) works surprisingly well ...</li>
            <li>I had another Wahl clipper which served me very well for many years (and still works perfectly actually), but I really wanted cordless clippers, so I got the Lithium Ion.  </li>
            <li>The machine was not cutting smoothly and blocked continuously at certain parts of my head (for no apparent reason, I have no head implants and no head scars...</li>
            <li>The little trimmer is a pretty handy accessory too</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to cut both of my boy&#x27;s hair, one right after the other, without having to charge it between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>By simply following the instructions that come with it I was able to give myself a great haircut in only a matter of a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>The smaller clipper is also amazingly powerful and cuts great, my only wish is that it was rechargeable, rather than 2 double A&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the most usable design, but this is very minor.</li>
            <li>cordless feature is WONDERFUL - really makes cutting everyone&#x27;s hair that much easier!&lt;br /&gt;Price was right for what we purchased.</li>
            <li>It is easy enough to do myself.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great - keeps the charge well and doesn&#x27;t take long to charge it from empty.</li>
            <li>(my hair grows back very quickly, so I need these on a weekly basis).</li>
            <li>I had doubts about durability, but it survived several drops without damage (take care when unzipping the travel case, the clipper falls out easily).  </li>
            <li>long lasting battery,, and,, good quality,,</li>
            <li>45$ and comes with everything you&#x27;ve every needed to cut hair, trimmer seems strong, wahl is a solid company.</li>
            <li>the smaller trimmer - frankly the space between the teeth is too large, making it too easy to grab skin and draw blood.  </li>
            <li>In a perfect world they would offer the clippers by themselves, not bundled with the trimmer, and charge a little less.</li>
            <li>Bought it for the large clipper.</li>
            <li>I have had a large Wahl plug-in clipper for years.</li>
            <li>After about 20 charges the large units just stop working.</li>
            <li>It certainly doesn&#x27;t compare to my ancient Oster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought it, charged it, used it and the first haircut was great, did not pull hair, was smooth cutting, battery did not flinch.</li>
            <li>Not as great as I expected material seams cheap and small clipper requires AA batteries plus it dose not one with attachments, it also doesnt cut as close as my 15yo wired wahl</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool one only it has alittle loud sound.</li>
            <li>As Supercuts increased their buzz cut pricing to nearly the same price as a person with a full head of hair I began to see the light.</li>
            <li>as good or better than my corded unit, but eliminating the cord makes cutting SO much easier!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The case needs more pockets for all the loose pieces.</li>
            <li>typically buzz my hair in the bathtub to make clean up easy.  </li>
            <li>The color pro set lasted much longer than the first Wahl set did, which was about 2 1/2 years before I finally decided to stop being cheap and invest in the Oster Fast Feed set.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 5 stars because it works perfectly fine but had I known that I could have purchased the same set of clippers at Target/Walmart...</li>
            <li>The larger hair flipper is fine.</li>
            <li>She uses the smaller included clippers around my ears and to fine tune by my neck.</li>
            <li>As far as the oil provided not being adequate Amazon has a bottle that will last years for $3 that also qualifies for free shipping if combined with the order .</li>
            <li>They are pretty decent for the price point.</li>
            <li>Higher speed than my older plug-in clippers.</li>
            <li>Been using both of these for two years and recommend very highly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The little trimmer is handy too for sideburns.</li>
            <li>Looks great except a little short.</li>
            <li>still on the original AA battery after several uses and seems just as strong as firstuse, so my guess is the battery will last quite some time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan and would definitely recommend</li>
            <li>The big pair of clippers is light, charges fast, and is the LOUDEST pair of clippers i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This Li-ion powered clipper is simply lightweight and having hoisted heavy corded Wahl clippers over my head for years, I welcome both the lightness and battery power.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the whole set just feels set</li>
            <li>It´s work very well.</li>
            <li>I really like the cape though.</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>Charges fast</li>
            <li>This makes it so much easier.</li>
            <li>and it was ready to go</li>
            <li>They come with all types of sizes that you really need to care hair.</li>
            <li>I  really like these clippers</li>
            <li>I charged the Clippe&#x27;s  Lithium battery and it worked very well..</li>
            <li>, I just won&#x27;t use it again; don&#x27;t really need them anyway</li>
            <li>These cut very well.</li>
            <li>really well made clippers and trimmers...</li>
            <li>I also should have read more carefully</li>
            <li>I primarily needed these to cut my kids hair and occasionally mine.  </li>
            <li>, the oil and brush on this thing are tiny and cheap like toys.</li>
            <li>These and the cape made the whole set feel</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall expected more for my money.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is powered by two AA batteries, so not so much.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the return Amazon.</li>
            <li>I just got a transformer for a couple of dollars and ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my wife can now buzz through the job like a pro and make me look like I&#x27;m always ready for the Gandy Dancers Ball.</li>
            <li>Very satisfy.</li>
            <li>it seems to give me a much smoother cut and no cord to wrap around your neck.</li>
            <li>even though kept oiled looks  like it is slightly starting to corrode,  cheap metal, no metal coating or whatever.</li>
            <li>Never use the extra cheap trimmer that comes with it.  </li>
            <li>He couldn&#x27;t believe how fast I got done &amp; that there was no fussing with a cord.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s cheap with 2 short ties to close.</li>
            <li>He loves it and says it shaves very close,  which is what he prefers.  </li>
            <li>The cape was cheap but protected from a majority of the hair, I bought a replacement to actually keep hair off the clothes.</li>
            <li>Just as powerful as my old Wahl clippers</li>
            <li>Very well made and sturdy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is everything I expected and more.</li>
            <li>I cut a lot of hair and they stay charged really well.</li>
            <li>and it works very well.</li>
            <li>but it is really infrequent</li>
            <li>Is fast to charge the battery.</li>
            <li>really like this clipper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s just what he needed and wahl is the brand he really likes.</li>
            <li>All I can say is it will make haircut so much easier.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>My husbands been using this since christmas and it works really well.  </li>
            <li>I really like the clipper.</li>
            <li>I have a beard and this would have been very helpful.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, no problems.</li>
            <li>hahaha..</li>
            <li>really wish Wahl had put a battery level on the unit so you could tell that it needs a charge before you start.</li>
            <li>He really likes the quality of this clipper.</li>
            <li>It does a very close clip and he likes the convenience of the the cordless.</li>
            <li>it cause the blade starts to tug on the hair if you go fast.</li>
            <li>It makes it so much easier for me to give him a hair cut, because we can go out on our porch and don&#x27;t have to worry about the hair getting all over inside the house.  </li>
            <li>It was shipped so fast</li>
            <li>Seems very well-made.  </li>
            <li>so the problem could have happened as much as two months ago</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say much about battery life and charging, except that in my usage I&#x27;ve had no problems.  </li>
            <li>And I always leave the clippers plugged in and charging when I&#x27;m not using it (according to the manual, it can&#x27;t overcharge, which is a very convenient feature).  </li>
            <li>Reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Very manual.  </li>
            <li>Charges fast and runs for plenty of time on a charge.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They work very well</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t think I was going to get something</li>
            <li>Still wasn&#x27;t ready to drop the bucks.  </li>
            <li>the blade adjustment on the side feels very flimsy, something I wouldn&#x27;t expect from Wahl, and it can get caught on the case seam making you think you&#x27;ve adjusted it all the way forward when in fact it is not.  </li>
            <li>A case to organize the clipper guides would be very helpful as well....</li>
            <li>Five star for quality and function.&lt;br /&gt;blade seems very durable.&lt;br /&gt;battery</li>
            <li>Bought this to use on finer haired clients at work and it really hasnt made my job any easier.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not so much.  </li>
            <li>And it is very convenient being cordless as well.</li>
            <li>Love Wahl but were some drawbacks to switching from corded clippers as expected.  </li>
            <li>I tried another cheaper brand because I like their cordless shavers, but their cordless clipper did&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>Works really well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d gladly pay another $10-20 for something constructed more solidly, with the feel of the mains powered clippers, especially if it means they&#x27;ll last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have not used that much.</li>
            <li>Everything did not fit back as precisely as it did before and that effectively ruined a $60 clipper.  </li>
            <li>If they stop working tomorrow I would absolutely by another pair.</li>
            <li>Works better than expected.  </li>
            <li>This of course is very annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thankfully buzz cuts are in style not that I ever cared that much about being in style .</li>
            <li>I find cutting the hair then jumping in the shower the best way to go .</li>
            <li>Thankfully buzz cuts are in style not that I ever cared that much about being in style .</li>
            <li>I find cutting the hair then jumping in the shower the best way to go .</li>
            <li>devices feel very sturdy and well built.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So much for product development.</li>
            <li>I chose not to return it bacause it is too much of a hassle.</li>
            <li>Has to be plugged in the whole hair cut or it  </li>
            <li>My family said me thanks  for your purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Every</li>
            <li>This really works well.  </li>
            <li>The smaller clipper from the set didn&#x27;t come with attachments but a call to Wahl, and I was sent a set free of charge.</li>
            <li>Clipper seems to be very sturdy, not an el cheapo..</li>
            <li>, cordless is very convenient</li>
            <li>Free from the cord at last!</li>
            <li>Should have purchased this much sooner</li>
            <li>I really wanted to go cordless, but had some reservations about battery life and power.  </li>
            <li>The Li-Ion battery performs very well.  </li>
            <li>Fast.</li>
            <li>Very well and generously equipped.  </li>
            <li>It is very convenient for traveling.</li>
            <li>Absolute garbage.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t bother me that much</li>
            <li>That close a cut requires a stylist to have care and finesse on any gentle skin on the scalp.  </li>
            <li>Well made and very convienant!Wish</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I really like the cordless feature</li>
            <li>clipper is very loud…</li>
            <li>Again, the cordless touch makes it so much easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use that one as much, but have had no issues and no complaints with performance on either.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The mini clipper works REALLY well.</li>
            <li>While this is battery powered, it has come in quite handy for trimming not only kids hair but also facial hair.  </li>
            <li>Third clipper I&#x27;ve  owned and by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I am nearly bald with nothing on top and some hair on sides and back of my head.  </li>
            <li>I contacted Wahl and I sent it back at my cost of shipping for repair and it was supposedly fixed but still does not hold a charge more then 90 seconds.</li>
            <li>So far I have used it once to trim my thick goatee, using the adjustable guide and it did a great job.</li>
            <li>some corded trimmer works better than this (in similar price range) but the convinience of cordless is far outweighted.</li>
            <li>comes in a nice zippered bag with a complete set of clipper heads from size 1/2 (1,5 mm) to size 8 (24,5 mm &#x3D; 1 inch), sharp scissors, ear-guide, and even a synthetic-fiber covering for the body to waer while clipping beard.</li>
            <li>This is definitely an amateur barber&#x27;s kit — it&#x27;s got everything you&#x27;ll need to give kids awesome bowl cuts, but sadly really is a little too much for my needs.</li>
            <li>The two sizes are nice for general cutting a more detailed work around the neckline and ears.</li>
            <li>Every other lithium ion powered device I have (phone, camera, etc) would still be charged after 2 weeks of not being used but this thing can&#x27;t hold a charge for more than a day or two.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a clipper before, but this one with the multiple heads and small daily trimmer works perfectly for my needs.</li>
            <li>Like the smaller charger and cool blue light indicator.</li>
            <li>Better than expected !</li>
            <li>, I have plugged it in for a full charge and cut my own hair once a week, and another person&#x27;s hair twice in two months before needing to plug them back in for a charge, and even then they weren&#x27;t completely dead.  </li>
            <li>I had let my hair go a little longer than I normally would have liked</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll have the charging problems other&#x27;s have commented on, but I charged them for a day when I got them 6 months ago, cut his hair 3 times since then &amp; they&#x27;re going as strong now as they did the first use.</li>
            <li>It charges very quickly and holds the charge for a very long time.</li>
            <li>We keep the clipper charged and we clean and oil it regularly.  </li>
            <li>have to admit, I was skeptical at first, but these clippers are great.</li>
            <li>This one cuts clean everytime and hair cuts only take minutes.</li>
            <li>The clipper stays charged so long, that I can do his hair, beard, mustache and still has enough charge to trim my own hair.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is horribly loud, but doesn&#x27;t cut close enough, or cleanly enough, to be more useful than the trimmer built into my Norelco razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Later a full charge would last 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>It came with a very basic cutting guide that was nice and holds a good charge.</li>
            <li>because in the end the clipper is only as good if it actually charges,holds that charge and actually works so spare the customers</li>
            <li>Though it has enough juice to get the job done, I can tell the power difference from a full charge.</li>
            <li>Wahl seems to make great quality clippers that last for a long long time.  </li>
            <li>The small trimmers kind of suck though.</li>
            <li>The extra set to line up is cool and works</li>
            <li>So far it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, my first cut turned out decent, but it will require some adaptive technique to do justice to old faithful.</li>
            <li>The taper lever on this one is much more stiff (a pleasant surprise), but the ridiculous power button they put on it is a bit of a hassle.</li>
            <li>Longer charges, new tech!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m now in the market for new clippers, thanks Wahl.</li>
            <li>Cutting my own hair was quick and painless unlike my old cheap set.</li>
            <li>They feel like they could be more substantial and be less pointed.</li>
            <li>Not only does this work better, it also comes with a larger selection of guides.</li>
            <li>Up until now i was  using an older wahl clipper.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Wahls, though, with decent quality.</li>
            <li>I have owned these for a few months now and after many uses they are working out very well.</li>
            <li>79600-2101 CLIPPER to replace an older WAHL corded model.  </li>
            <li>Decently priced and power clippers.</li>
            <li>but they missed the boat on these particular set of clippers.</li>
            <li>so after I&#x27;ve cut my hair it steadily discharges.  </li>
            <li>I bought this primarily for the Lithium Ion battery given that my prior Wahl harit clippers were NiCad and 15+ years old</li>
            <li>I have several thinning spots on back of my head and it seemed to make these areas more pronounced since it cut some</li>
            <li>Large wall works right after a short charge.</li>
            <li>Like I said it cuts and has the power of my older pro clippers, but those are 3-4 times the cost.</li>
            <li>a side note, I would rather they have been absolutely bold type up front about the smaller clipper not being Lithium Ion and they should have a nose hair trimmer attachment for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The blades don&#x27;t cut as close to the skin as my older Wahl clippers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the main cutter a number of times.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my husband&#x27;s older set - he loves this set and swears by it.</li>
            <li>The blade is replaceable but it is an extraordinary pain to put back on.</li>
            <li>The blade is replaceable but it is an extraordinary pain to put back on.</li>
            <li>I wear my hair short and always ask to use clippers on the back and sides but cut the top with scissors.</li>
            <li>The reason I gave the Wahl Ion cordless clippers a 4-star rating was because of mainly the battery issue.  </li>
            <li>The reason I gave the Wahl Ion cordless clippers a 4-star rating was because of mainly the battery issue.  </li>
            <li>Decent for the price.</li>
            <li>Have only used it twice so far, but seems maintenance free.</li>
            <li>However, the main clippers are a stronger plastic and feel sturdy in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend them.</li>
            <li>The cordless feature was the main draw.</li>
            <li>Would have given this 5 star only if the smaller shaver was better.</li>
            <li>Also it is very powerful compared to my last non professional corded version.</li>
            <li>Clipper is light and portable, but it also has a loose and cheap plastic feel to it, the front cover is loose and vibrating, thats why i gave it a 3 star rating.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts for many times of use (in fact I&#x27;ve never seen my battery run down because so far I&#x27;ve always recharged it after using 5 or 6 times, but I suspect it lasts much longer).&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s appears to be high quality compared to the otehr brands and models I researched.</li>
            <li>, high quality proffessional feel that the corded Wahls provide, and I wasn&#x27;t dissappointed.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>We highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I think they cut corners on the materials to counter the high cost of the batteries.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Recently I moved and got rid of my old clippers and picked up a cheap one in my new town.  </li>
            <li>This unit stays cooler, vibrates far less, and is easy to use!  </li>
            <li>My hair is originally just soft and sort of curly, but as it gets longer the curls get naturally bigger and my hair somehow gets even softer.</li>
            <li>This is our second cordless, but is far superior to the previous one we had.</li>
            <li>So far the battery on the large clipper seems to hold up well.</li>
            <li>You have to consciously move the lever a certain way so that it doesn&#x27;t catch on the body.  </li>
            <li>Came earlier than promised and exactly as described!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad my little guy will sit still for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems louder than my other wahl (110v).&lt;br /&gt;The blades arent easily removable for cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lots of clip on&#x27;s make fades easy and sharp.  </li>
            <li>It is easy removing the blade, but it is not putting the blade back on because both blade pieces must be put on back at the exact same time in the exact  same angle so that you can then HOVER THEM AT THE EXACT SAME TIME AND ANGLE TO BE ABLE TO SCREW THE BLADE PIECES BACK ON.</li>

            <li>It is a bit large and heavy - we are used to the smaller clippers, but these are built great and the battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>They also sent me a new different looking charger in addition to my old original charger.</li>
            <li>I threw them away and used my guides from the early 90&#x27;s instead which were a much thicker</li>
            <li>Most of the weight is in the head/clipper area, not the handle, so it ends up feeling top heavy and not entirely secure in the hand.  </li>
            <li>It is MUCH lighter than my old model.</li>
            <li>So much easier to use than my old corded Wahl clipper.</li>
            <li>Works very well so far.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- comes with small mineral oil bottle, this does need to be oiled regularly to prevent rusting and good function</li>
            <li>kit comes with everything you need, including cleaning oil and normal hair scissors (in addition to the two pictured cordless clippers).</li>
            <li>Would have been good to have some different sized plastic guides for the small clipper.</li>
            <li>The 2nd small clipper makes a good mustache clipper.</li>
            <li>but it has a lasting and powerful battery.  </li>
            <li>This Wahl is powerful and dynamic.</li>
            <li>After raising and lowering the blade height a few more times, I got it to settle right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With this not only do I save money I can have a fresh cut as often as I take the time .</li>
            <li>With this not only do I save money I can have a fresh cut as often as I take the time .</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend Wahl to improve this clipper by using a much better very long lasting charging battery in it and for a cord to be allowed to be used with it when the  battery doesn&#x27;t work!!!</li>
            <li>and I doubt there are for guys who are lucky enough not to be as far as I am on the way to Baldsville.</li>
            <li>I can get several haircuts and many beard trimmings out of a single charge.  </li>
            <li>After spending hours trying to figure out the right clipper on Amazon, I finally made the jump and got this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just used it for the first time for my sons (with a thick hair)&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s very comfortable, easy to handle, a lot of clips, and long lasting Battery.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Holds a charge for a long time , and charges quickly.</li>
            <li>The machine feels smooth when cutting and is as powerful as a corded machine, my son also commented how much he likes the way it cuts and that it felt comfortable.</li>
            <li>The clipper looks solid and works fine with 220V not only 110V&lt;</li>
            <li>About every three months I kneel down over dry  bathtub and use #2 size adaptor and go to town, nice and short, then ear trimming adaptors and pretty much all done</li>
            <li>Knives with sharp shear machine smoothly without jerking.</li>
            <li>the clipper is the best clipper i ever owned.. out of the box the battery lasted long as i needed.. sadly the trimmer is complete trash.. uses one AA battery...</li>
            <li>I returned it for a new one.</li>
            <li>Wahl has re-gained my confidence as I received in the mail a new set of clippers to replace the ones I threw out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This new design does not permit removing the head.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, as you can see I&#x27;m sort of new to the &#x27;Amazonia&#x27; rage.</li>
            <li>I bought these clippers 2 years ago and they still work like new.</li>
            <li>Wahl apologized for the inconvenience, said I was covered under the 5 year warranty, and rush sent me a new clipper set.</li>
            <li>Bought this a year ago and still works like new.  </li>
            <li>I shave my head 2 or 3 times a week and after 2 years they cut like they are brand new.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying a new cordless Wahl trimmer set and don&#x27;t even use the one that came with this set.</li>
            <li>Used it for a couple of months and it works like brand new, no pulling at all.</li>
            <li>I would have attempted to exchange them for the new ones I had ordered, but knowing the expense of postage today</li>
            <li>/&gt;The trimmers were surprisingly powerful for only using 1 AA battery, they were loud but who cares, I can live with the noise.  </li>
            <li>The replacement battery costs almost as much as the device (note that these new ones use a 3.7V battery and not the more common 2.4V of predecessors).  </li>
            <li>I also have no use so far for the mini-me trimmer and wish I wasn&#x27;t compelled to pay for it to get the main unit.</li>
            <li>Instead of the traditional seesaw lever switch, they went with a cheap piece of rubber with a button deep underneath it somewhere</li>
            <li>When I plug the charger in, I hear the motor click and the blue light turn on for a second, but no charging appears to happen and it hasn&#x27;t turned on since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since the supplied oil will only last a dozen uses or so, you&#x27;ll want to pick some up.&lt;br /&gt;-Scissors: the scissors they supply with the kit are, understandable, cheap ...</li>
            <li>One earlier review said you couldn&#x27;t remove the blades for cleaning, but again this is is similar to my old corded one, and the blades are easily removed.</li>
            <li>They came with lots of extra attachments for adjusting the length of cut, but that wasn&#x27;t really important to me since I only use these to shave my head.  </li>
            <li>Now, in real life, it is not difficult to avoid this as long as you know it ahead of time, and I can tell you that it has not happened to me yet while my wife has been using it.</li>
            <li>but you&#x27;ll be more than satisfied with this when cutting hair unless your hair is like a bocage.</li>
            <li>These clippers are very powerful and sharp.</li>
            <li>I like the soft-sided bag it comes with (as opposed to the cheap plastic box you normally get).view down the road as to whether they hold up.  </li>
            <li>It worked fine for a while before it broke down.</li>
            <li>it is very loud when going around the ear  </li>
            <li>Totally user error but other Wahl clippers I&#x27;ve had before have not broken so easily.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m a pretty big guy</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m still using it from it&#x27;s first charge from two months ago only (using once a week for abouot 14 minutes) couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
            <li>Cordless option is so much better, no more getting strangled with cords.</li>
            <li>They work and it is a nice set, but no good for me</li>
            <li>So, I put in a higher capacity cell with the same output, and it worked again.  </li>
            <li>I charge lipo&#x27;s in a old crockpot !  </li>
            <li>They have given us a stellar level of customer support and I will again buy any product made by Wahl and I suggest the same to anyone reading this post!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>I would have thought this product was better, but if you are looking for an extremely close shave, then I would stick to the regular wahl or remington trimmer...</li>
            <li>and I use them on my 3 year old son too!</li>
            <li>this is my second set, first one the interior charging plug broke inside so could recharge the unit, checked the website to see if I could find a replacement part.......NL.</li>
            <li>No more unwelcomed strangling attempts by the dang cord when getting creative shaving the bank of your head.</li>
            <li>I would go back to a corded trimmer that is made of higher quality.</li>
            <li>The big razor is perfect, nothing has gone wrong at all!</li>
            <li>I enjoyed having the small machine because it helps to make the details when you&#x27;re almost finished.</li>
            <li>This is the second pair if these I have owned and the first pair lasted 3 yrs.  </li>
            <li>but one friend is exactly the opposite.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and pretty quiet.</li>
            <li>I cut my hair for the first time and got the very same haircut a barber could give !</li>
            <li>The first time I adjusted the blades short, the length I buzz my hair too</li>
            <li>Powerful clipper that are convenient and have a long battery life.</li>
            <li>EXACT same issues.</li>
            <li>Professional results from this clipper!  </li>
            <li>and I use it no more than 2 times a week for shaping mostly.</li>
            <li>But far from it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to purchase the Wireless clippers for that same reason, but these things have been stellar.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this clipper once a week for over six months for about 10 minute at a stretch on the initial charge I put on it when I first took it out of the box</li>
            <li>will cut skin if not careful, but shaves very close</li>
            <li>Wow !</li>
            <li>My corded Wahl never needed the second pass because it got all the hairs the first time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These clippers amazed me, they went through his thick fine hair like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li>They hold a nice long charge and we&#x27;ve been getting 2, 15 min haircuts out of them every single time with plenty of charge left over.</li>
            <li>This is an annoyance, especially since Walh tells you this is special oil and don&#x27;t use a different oil.  </li>
            <li>I got these the other day, because my old ones finally crapped out on me, and I&#x27;m glad I got these.</li>
            <li>The clipper is not excellent, but good enough to keep around, though I&#x27;m starting to have second thoughts because without good guide combs the machine becomes limited in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ditch the old corded clippers and join the new age of cordless.</li>
            <li>the only think i didnt like is the fact that the item looked as if it was used for very long period, everything else is fine</li>
            <li>They do an excellent job cutting my hair and the batteries hold their charge for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is easy to handle and cuts the hair without missing any places.</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair (there I said it) and do a hell of a job if I say so myself, and for the past 8 yrs I used the same trusty set of Wahl clippers to do it without incident.</li>
            <li>Ok for use, but the small one sounds too loud.</li>
            <li>I already had a small lithium ion Wahl trimmer and really liked it, so I decided to purchase the larger cordless clipper via Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Used the smaller clipper for a travel head full head buzz, but not nearly as smooth and easy as the big guy.</li>
            <li>On a full charge it can last for weeks and multiple usage sessions!</li>
            <li>Was skeptical at first based on the negative reviews, but out of the box the trimmer was superb.</li>
            <li>The package itself is good with the second smaller machine, the bag and the rest of the things, but I am not pleased.</li>
            <li>When you open the case, all the&lt;br /&gt;pieces can fall out easily if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li>I would expect it to last more than a year and a half if the parts are not replaceable.</li>
            <li>The power button on the main large clipper is very difficult to activate, one must literally push the button into the body of the clipper to turn it on or off which is odd as the smaller clipper has a very nice, easy to use slide on/off switch.</li>
            <li>This product is so lightweight compared to other clippers that the first time I used it my hand slipped and cut too much off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d generally recommend this brand, but not this particular model.</li>
            <li>It is a bit loud but that&#x27;s not bad compared to other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>Single passes took his hair to the right length</li>
            <li>You certainly get every possible accessory with this set guides galore, scissors, hair clips, apron.</li>
            <li>trimmer (that runs on one AA-cell) ... and about as many clip-ons for the little trimmer as for the clipper (way mre than you&#x27;ll likely ever need.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to leave my clippers charging all the time, but in my current living situation it has become a little more of a nuisance to do so.</li>
            <li>wish it were a little bit more quite, but that would probably put it in a different price bracket.</li>
            <li>and as it cut hair decent enough while it worked, I bought a new one from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I bought this cordless clipper as an early Christmas present for my husband and he absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>This clipper is clearly intended for hair like mine.</li>
            <li>That $18 plus dollars I spent at Supercuts every 2-3 weeks now can be better spent elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>recommend it for the budget conscious buyer.</li>
            <li>This clipper pales in comparison to my 5 year old panasonic.  </li>
            <li>(old ones are in a plastic grocery bag)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s one I use frequently.</li>
            <li>Did not work as well as my old one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel professional at all using these.</li>
            <li>I guess it could work but don&#x27;t buy this if your a professional hairstylist or barber.</li>
            <li>so I cannot comment on exactly how long it lasts.  </li>
            <li>Nearly everytime</li>
            <li>I had this marked as 5 stars because it was everything I had hoped for,</li>
            <li>I was happily surprised with this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Clippers are a bit loud</li>
            <li>definatley not recommended for any stylist professional.</li>
            <li>He has been using it to trim his hair, thus saving the monthly barber cost, moreover he is also using it to trim his 3 year old sons hair.</li>
            <li>I finally have the freedom to position it as needed without worrying about the cord, and this has just as much power.  </li>
            <li>Put it on the charger overnight after cut so ready to go for cut next week</li>
            <li>So far I have had the kit for nearly 3 months</li>
            <li>That said, on th eold clipper I used a professional serwing machine service oil and never had any problem.  </li>
            <li>I bought these for my wife who is a professional cosmetologist.  </li>
            <li>These clippers really get the job done, and the lithium ion battery means she can cut all our hair and still have plenty of charge left in the battery.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;bad:&lt;br /&gt;they are loud</li>
            <li>Two young boys hair to cut.</li>
            <li>OLD REVIEW:</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Charging cord does not fit securely into the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>they cut my hair like butter not to loud</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I replaced my old machine with this newer battery operated one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cuts smoother and faster than my old clipper.</li>
            <li>I got these clippers to replace an old pair of corded ones.</li>
            <li>So far, it is doing its job well and have not had any issues with functionality, so I am upping it to 3 stars.  </li>
            <li>(so far).</li>
            <li>The corded clippers sound like a faint electric whir, while the wireless clippers sound like a loud mechanical buzz.</li>
            <li>Everything seems to be working well so far, but I&#x27;m waiting to see if the clipper stands the test of time like the one it</li>
            <li>It is loud</li>
            <li>Used once so far.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a bit loud..</li>
            <li>It also came with a 1st class zippered carrying case with slots of scissors (and a pair of scissors) and accessories, which is a classy feature.</li>
            <li>We like this kit so much that we actually bought another one as a gift.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product at a local Walmart for a very affordable price.</li>
            <li>I have to say WOW.  </li>
            <li>i charged it up completely once when i received it and haven&#x27;t had to charge it since (about 6 20 minute sessions).</li>
            <li>Both are loud, but cut well.</li>
            <li>I have used the old barber-style plug-in Wahl that was designed and built in the USA and it has never had any of these problems.</li>
            <li>The larger set of Clippers comes with a whole attachment kit with all the need neccesities when motivating yourself to some trimming and beard up keep....</li>
            <li>So far they have worked well.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t cut as well as my old one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still working a 10+ year old Wahl beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>No issues so far.</li>
            <li>but so far I haven&#x27;t used it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s also really loud.  </li>
            <li>no need to have the teeth so far apart.  </li>
            <li>If you wanted to shave your head bald these would not be close enough but they would get you ready for a Bic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He has been shaving his head for years with the old Wahl.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was very pleasantly surprised to get the response from a Wahl representative which can be seen in the comments section of my review.  </li>
            <li>My 22 year old son asked for these specifically.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it for myself, but however the user did inform me that it is a bit loud.  </li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>clipper is much the same.</li>
            <li>--so far I&#x27;ve had yet to need to recharge them;</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have to set near an outlet anymore.</li>
            <li>I have no complain so far and charges</li>
            <li>charge doesn&#x27;t last more than few days after 4 months of use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll rinse my hair with water, then I have to go back over it a few more times with the clippers to get all the hairs.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately could not charge in the good old USA.</li>
            <li>When the package arrived on time I was not surprised that it contains the clipper unit I ordered, but it was nice to also find the small clipper unit.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Blades cut through thick hair like it&#x27;s butter - much better than the Philips Norelco</li>
            <li>the trimmer isn&#x27;t very sharp but the price is right for a cordless clipper!</li>
            <li>This comes with a strong motor that lasts long enough to clip the hair of your entire head.</li>
            <li>A quick 15 min charge lasts long enough for me to cut my hair as far as a buzz cut.</li>
            <li>I decided to go short on my hair so rather than spend $25 to get a buzz cut every few weeks decided to try this - very nicely built, lots of clipping attachments, and I can touch my hair up every two weeks or so in just a few minutes with no problems.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d have to go through a hassle of getting a replacement and wouldn&#x27;t be able to cut my hair in the mean time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They did nothing to resolve the issue as other companies would do so with that being said I most likely will not be a Wahl customer in the future.</li>
            <li>It comes with a wide assortment of attachments that aid in getting the right length and look.  </li>
            <li>Some other clippers are a bit cheaper, but so far these are worth the money.</li>
            <li>The charge also lasts better than expected (as noted by other reviewers as well).  </li>
            <li>The power is strong for my usual number 1 cut.  </li>
            <li>clipper is very sensitive where if you are not careful it will pull you skin in and cut you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mini</li>
            <li>which was fine because I was usually done or nearly so.</li>
            <li>They also did chafe a little bit but compared to using my old full size clippers for touch ups</li>
            <li>I always had problems trying to work around the cord while cutting my own hair with the previous clipper, and having to stop &amp; unplug to untangle a knot in the cord...but didn&#x27;t know any better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had this a short time and it&#x27;s my first</li>
            <li>This is my second Wahl Cordless and the first one last (5) years with weekly use.</li>
            <li>The clipper is powerful and has a long lasting battery.</li>
            <li>The battery I used is exactly the same (brand and size) as one I use daily in a high-power flashlight; the flashlight gets recharged about once every three days and has lasted for over 2 years with virtually no decline in performance</li>
            <li>I sent my first one back several months ago and they were replaced no questions asked.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Chances are I&#x27;ll just throw this one in the garbage too as even if I went through the hassle of getting a replacement, I don&#x27;t have faith that a 3rd will last any longer than the first 2.</li>
            <li>I had to face to the facts, I&#x27;m getting older and the 60&#x27;s are not coming back.</li>
            <li>This is my second pair of these (I left the first in a hotel).  </li>
            <li>So if you are worried about having to make sacrifices for the cordless convenience, the only sacrifice may be a higher purchase price relative to a corded unit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been looking for about a year for a decent cordless clipper and finally settled on this one.  </li>
            <li>Being spoiled by our society I could certainly look for some downsides of this product, but I have not had a single problem with this tool so far</li>
            <li>Not saying any other brand is either just that now days for quality you just have to spend too much money for a decent par of clippers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;would definitely recommend highly and buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;After charging, and unplugging, the blue charging indicator light remains lit, a constant solid blue glow.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Being cordless allows me to go into my yard and do a quick buzz cut or trim and leave the mess on the grass.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The rechargeable is much sturdier, but I&#x27;ve noticed I have to be a little more careful with this trimmer than my first one as I&#x27;ve had a few cuts when running it without the guard.  </li>
            <li>lithium lasts long and holds charge very well</li>
            <li>/&gt;- small trimmer i haven&#x27;t used yet as my norelco still works fantastic</li>
            <li>Charges fast and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>; which is the primary reason to go li-ion over nicad/nimh  - small charger  </li>
            <li>The other nice part is the small trimmer that comes with it.  </li>
            <li>The four stars is only because there is no real easy way to put the various pieces in order to make them easy to find.  </li>
            <li>The only gripe I have was that the chrome handle of the large clipper was all scratched up making it look second hand</li>
            <li>It was not easy to make a call based on others&#x27; reviews, and more so given that during the process, I became all paranoid about some of the reviewers vested interests in placing either a bad review or a good review...</li>
            <li>If all else fails read the directions.&lt;br /&gt;It is a quick charge, the charge lasts for a couple of long haircuts (I have not had the occasion to do more than two cuts).  </li>
            <li>I was contacted by manufacturer and they sent me a brand new unit and a return label to ship the defective one back.</li>
            <li>so when I saw a commercial for their new Lithium Ion cordless clipper.</li>
            <li>after several weeks of use are still working like new.</li>
            <li>the blue light does not light either.  </li>
            <li>Battery is strong on my thick hair.</li>
            <li>(major design flaw) on this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now 8 months later and my second one has now died with the same exact problem and will not charge.</li>
            <li>Other than that they do cut pretty well.</li>
            <li>This is the second time buying these clippers and the only reason I&#x27;m buying a second one is because I dropped the first one and broke the tines.</li>
            <li>no other reviews mentioned is the charger will not over charge the battery</li>
            <li>I replaced a cordless clipper that just wouldnt keep a charge, or actually seemed to be low charge and always forced me to plug it in to get full RPMs, which made me wonder why it was even cordless in the first place.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to clean up a messy hairy sink!</li>
            <li>Most other brands round the edges</li>
            <li>(we have purchased the two clipper kit three times since 2009 and the small clippers are all still working fine); however, the large clipper has had to be replaced every 28 months on average.  </li>
            <li>A tough decision for me since I know I cut my hair better than any barber out there</li>
            <li>Accessories are good just a little hard to swap out the different attachments.  </li>
            <li>Wahl went above and beyond to fix this for me, and I truly appreciate the high standard of their customer service.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The battery last for months and the overall build is high quality.</li>
            <li>The big (re-chargeable) clippers are pretty good but the little AA powered clippers failed within a week of purchase.</li>
            <li>The cordless feature is the best, no longer trapped in the same place cutting my hair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect that I would use the smaller clippers, but have found myself using them nearly every day to trim my beard.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it a hole lot yet (about 3 hair cuts), so only time will tell how durable it is, but so far there is no flaw.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lithium battery made plenty of power for a solid 20 min. cut, but they don&#x27;t seem to cut as close as my old ones.</li>
            <li>so i dont have to raise the blade with a #1 guard and worry about i moving back to the shorter cut like my old ones.  </li>
            <li>and that was only minute compared to the old clippers</li>
            <li>They barely trim the hair around the neck...</li>
            <li>do volunteer services for the old folks (who are actually quite demanding.</li>
            <li>I used to have a heavy duty corded, then switched to the light norelco trimmer for cutting my own hair.</li>
            <li>Used only once so far.</li>
            <li>After giving it about 5 minutes I went back to my old trusty corded Wahl clippers.</li>
            <li>I bought these clippers to replace an old set of Wahl clippers that finally bit the dust.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that some of the higher numbered gaurds are harder to fit on there.</li>
            <li>Once I saw this item posted on amazon for $46.00 I had to have it and with no regrets at all.</li>
            <li>The attachment combs for the Fast Feeds were very expensive and they didn&#x27;t fit exactly as the Wahl combs do for their trimmers.  </li>
            <li>The attachment combs for the Fast Feeds were very expensive and they didn&#x27;t fit exactly as the Wahl combs do for their trimmers.  </li>
            <li>but NO REGRETS.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m barely stressing the battery using it for 8 minutes once a week.</li>
            <li>This clpper provides the same power and quality that my 10 year old corded Wahl clipper does.</li>
            <li>The trimmer that comes with it uses regular batteries and is loud.</li>
            <li>This thing has power equal to my old corded  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for a couple of weeks and have no issues so far, I only charged it once</li>
            <li>only issue is how loud they are.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Wahl corded clippers for years, my last set being a professional set I purchased through a beauty supply.  </li>
            <li>Though it was a roughly the same price, the Andis quality is much higher.</li>
            <li>a full charge only lasts for few days, maybe 4-5 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Skip the expensive salon and cut your own hair.</li>
            <li>I did notice that there&#x27;s a little circuit board right on the battery in the clippers...</li>
            <li>Only drawback to Li Ion is that onc eit runs out of charge it happens quickly ...with little warning.  </li>
            <li>Used this for my beard, thought i&#x27;d be able to trim it down within 2 or 3 passes but it took a few tried.  </li>
            <li>I really love the cordless not cord tangling feature of this item and doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as the classic Wahl hair electric corded clipper that I have used in the past and which I still have this classic clipper-this cordless clipper has plenty of power for me to cut my bushy thick hair into a short military style #2 cut; nevertheless, I have had to send this cordless clipper back to Wahl for lithium battery replacement (lithium battery repair 5 year guarantee at no charge including parts and labor) in May 2013 because it stopped charging.  </li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re traveling on the road / to a new country for several months and don&#x27;t want to fuss with adapter/transformers (it will last you</li>
            <li>The only downside would be the actual bag these live in</li>
            <li>Very convenient to use and the battery last a very long time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet, powerful, and allows me to give myself a haircut in less than 5 minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only used a few times but charge seems to hold adequately as well.</li>
            <li>Also, the plastic handle area did not fit together right.</li>
            <li>…I never had problems with my other clippers blades rusting before,  especially after just the first use…and, I used the clipper on &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; hair.  </li>
            <li>no use for the smaller unit as not very heavy duty but didn&#x27;t buy it for that.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the product I was a little skeptical seeing its cordless</li>
            <li>He has tried other cordless models over the years, and been very dissatisfied...</li>
            <li>I chose this product based on positive reviews and I was not let down.  </li>
            <li>Ion makes the cordless worth it and the quality of the clipper set will last you a few years.</li>
            <li>Blades not sharp enough.</li>
            <li>The big clippers didn&#x27;t get a very close cut and the little on pulled the hairs from the soft part of my neck below the jaw bone.</li>
            <li>I had Wahl wired clippers for years and needed a new set due to the old one having not enough power and would sometimes snag thicker</li>
            <li>One long charge in the clippers, even through the squirming and sliding around in the chair, I have less of a problem, because, I have a powerful set of clippers with no cords to get tangled up in with all the movement</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally got a chance to use it the other day, and gave myself a high and tight on the first try.</li>
            <li>just feels cheap and not good quality</li>
            <li>Hardware is good to great, packaging is poor to terrible</li>
            <li>Great explicit instructions for cutting hair included!</li>
            <li>very well made and hi quality thing , but unfortunately didn&#x27;t work on 220V and didn&#x27;t fit to any European sockets .</li>
            <li>I think the old trimmer head lasted so long</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it will hold up long term, but so far, it meets my needs and expectations.</li>
            <li>The basic square shape of my old clippers was a lot easier to handle in several different grips.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just bought this clipper a few days ago and  used it for the first time this morning to shave my head bald.</li>
            <li>on and off, but that blue light now remains lit forever and always until it slowly drains the entire battery to a zero charge state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have pretty thick hair and most other clippers have to go over a line of hair a few times.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it would do more than that as I haven&#x27;t tested it, but it didn&#x27;t seem like it was slowing down at all after the second shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, both the clippers have not broken down and its been years.</li>
            <li>Being cordless is a major improvement over any of the above mentioned hair clippers simply put.  </li>
            <li>Being cordless is a major improvement over any of the above mentioned hair clippers simply put.  </li>
            <li>Other than that I do like the wireless ability it possesses and the cut is of decent quality when the unit is working as it should.</li>
            <li>I would have given it 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for this battery charging failure and that a much better very long lasting charging battery was used instead of this failed one and and if it weren&#x27;t for that it not being able to use a cord with it when the battery doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much lighter than my previous clipper.</li>
            <li>Previous cordless hair clippers (Phillips in Europe) much easer to adjust by dialing in blade extension instead of manually switching between all those plastic clip sizes.  </li>
            <li>Further, even if I plug it in will not cut for any period of time as apparently charger does not deliver enough juice.</li>
            <li>At first my hubby thought this was too big and heavy to use as a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Supplied oil: a very small amount of special, non-gumming, head lubricating oil is provided.  </li>
            <li>Not only did the Fast Feeds become less powerful after taking them apart to clean, but it was damn near impossible to reassemble them back properly.  </li>
            <li>I bared a spot on the wires, neg and pos, away from each other so they can&#x27;t short, then connected to older triton lipo charger  with alligator clips for about 15 minutes or so.  </li>
            <li>Also, there are many clip attachments (even one for the eyebrows!), hair cutting instructions and an apron.  </li>
            <li>My old corded Wahl would vibrate my hands too much and got too hot, it was uncomfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>I sometimes cut his hard and I much prefer these to the corded clippers!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Combined with the *slightly* less power of the corded model,  the non-removeable head (really gets messy under the hood fast) and the proclivity to malfunction,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I just use a number one and go over my whole head , trim with the little one around the ears and shave the back of my neck because I have no talent</li>
            <li>I just use a number one and go over my whole head , trim with the little one around the ears and shave the back of my neck because I have no talent</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and go online and buy a good pair of barbers scissors if you plan to do any serious scissors cutting, then the ones from the kit can be used in teh workshop of for your kids class projects ;-)  </li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is since these clippers are so sharp they will cut you easily.</li>
            <li>I will list some good and bad things</li>
            <li>ear attachment not great, eyebrow attachment didn&#x27;t cut anything (could be a good thing, maybe my eyebrows aren&#x27;t bushy enought \\&quot;yet\\&quot; as my wife commented), difficult to fit all the attachments in the bag (not a big deal, just inconvenient), cape wasn&#x27;t huge</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is a great product.  </li>
            <li> I tried to give Wahl a chance to make me happy but it just didn&#x27;t happen.</li>

            <li> These clippers are great.</li>
            <li> Great clipper.</li>
            <li> It has a great contoured grip and its great not having a cord wobbling around when you try to make a precision line cut.</li>
            <li> This ciipper works great and has plenty of battery life, but it doesn&#x27;t trim as close as I would like.</li>
            <li> Great kit.  </li>
            <li> I am happy for the price paid.</li>
            <li> It still runs great though even after two years.  </li>
            <li> The clippers do well on shaving my head and being cordless works great.</li>
            <li> It works great, and would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I heard great things about this product and can&#x27;t wait to try while hunting and while being in the woods.</li>
            <li> --it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> I was happy with this trimmer until it died about a month ago.</li>

            <li> Does a great job, plenty of trimming sizers too.  </li>
            <li> The cordless is great.</li>
            <li> Still a great buy.</li>
            <li> Seperate neck trimmer works great for being powered by a AA volt battery.</li>
            <li> This is a great bang for your buck.  </li>
            <li> Great set,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> this, like all electronics, benefits greatly from the lack of wires.</li>
            <li> These are great clippers.</li>
            <li> But all in all a great package deal.</li>
            <li> Purchased this here on Amazon to replace my corded Wahl 79300-400 Color Pro 20 Piece, and thought that $45 would give me a great cordless solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> and they both work great.  </li>

            <li> Seems to be of good quality.</li>
            <li> clipper can be good if you need wireless</li>
            <li> /&gt;Looks to be good quality.</li>
            <li> $40 is good price for clipper and combs.&lt;br /&gt;Do not by it because of trimmer, you will neither use it nor want to keep.</li>
            <li> Good product works well</li>
            <li> Like good arts and crafts scissors, not what I would expect from a $50 dollar Wahl set though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a corded model by wahl and it was good except the cord would always get in the way.</li>
            <li> Battery life is good, and does a good job.</li>
            <li> Trimming capability is just as good as before.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be in good shape.</li>
            <li> The good news -</li>
            <li> good job done wahl.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- seems fairly waterproof.</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure you knew that the power of both units is incredible.  </li>
            <li> Good value here.  </li>
            <li> Good machine.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> Life is SOOO good.</li>
            <li> Plus mine came with the mini-clippers which is perfect for trimming your hairline precisely</li>
            <li> All accessories are good.</li>
            <li> The battery holds a good charge.  </li>
            <li> And I get about 3-4 good sessions before the battery dies..</li>
            <li> Fair shipping time .</li>
            <li> Blades are made of steel and looks like good steel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worked good for 2-3 uses, and then started leaving cornrows in my head as I shaved-my head looked like a crop field.  </li>
            <li> Underpowered and not of good quality.</li>
            <li> As good as corded versions</li>
            <li> They have always been a good value for the dollar.</li>
            <li> This is a good clipper.</li>
            <li> admit I did not use the trimmer, but one good look at them and you can figure out for yourself that they are nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good Starter Package though.</li>
            <li> Plenty of power and feel is good.</li>
            <li> None were as good as these.</li>
            <li> Good to get rid of cords though.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as good as I thought it would.  </li>
            <li> They got really good reviews</li>
            <li> You can use them indoor or outdoor and they do just as good as the corded clippers.  </li>
            <li> You can use them indoor or outdoor and they do just as good as the corded clippers.  </li>
            <li> ARE GOOD QUALITY AND HOLD</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked around for a good hair clipper that was cordless and couldn&#x27;t find anything that was durable.</li>
            <li> Had a Norelco which use to cut good until the attachments broke twice (not durable at all).</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> The unit cuts well and is has all of the pieces needed to give myself a good haircut.  </li>
            <li> is what the pros use, and there is a good reason why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Battery life is good.</li>
            <li> If you travel a lot, this is a good buy.</li>
            <li> The blades were nice and gave a great cut</li>
            <li> trimmer and scissors are good</li>
            <li> Wahl has a good name</li>
            <li> All of the attachments are good and allows a lot of choices.</li>
            <li> Good product good service.</li>
            <li> A bit of reading would have been a good start for me.</li>
            <li> Battery life seems to be doing good.  </li>
            <li> I loved the performance, the case and all the clip on guides.</li>
            <li> The battery seems to hold on for a good amount of time.  </li>
            <li> EXCELLENT AND FAST DELIVERY !!!</li>
            <li> Nice clipper for the money seems to cut very nice and the trimmer works well too.</li>
            <li> The attachments are excellent also with additional ones for special application.</li>
            <li> so you can leave it plugged in all the time for a full charge ( a surge protected outlet may be best ) .</li>
            <li> This clipper is very light and will work great on kids because there won&#x27;t be any cords for them to grab! :)</li>
            <li> But regardless this combo still get 5 stars from my point of view, as it&#x27;s wireless, very powerful, top notch blades, cuts great, and all for a great price!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery capacity is exceptional.</li>
            <li> The battery life is great since it&#x27;s lithium ion, nice accessories and a really nice fabric zip pouch to put it all in.</li>
            <li> a great shape, it is very comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> It goes so quickly that my son does not mind getting his hair cut!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the purchase for sure.</li>
            <li> so he wanted one that was battery operated and is very pleased with the performance.</li>
            <li> But anyway i&#x27;m happy with it :)</li>
            <li> Holds a great charge and the more you use it</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this unit, it even self sharpens.</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Worked great, and I love that its cordless.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> But I took a chance and am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> great buy for sure.</li>
            <li> Just remember to charge them right before you use them for the best performance.</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> , cordless is very nice, holds a charge through three or more hair cuts.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect, I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Love the clippers!</li>

            <li> I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, a friend of mine was so impressed that she asked me to get one for her.</li>
            <li> My $20.00 Wahl works better!</li>
            <li> I would say more like a 3 1/2 to 4 star, but still rather ticked that they would not include trimmer attachments!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> First off, cordless anything is awesome, and these clippers are no exception.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with this li-ion unit!  </li>

            <li> and it is amazing.</li>
            <li> Free trimmer is a welcome addition to kit.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair and no cord getting in my way is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is really an amazing product from Wahl&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The quality is great,its light weight, its cordless thats also great.</li>
            <li> The battery life is amazing.</li>

            <li> It is really an amazing thing.</li>

            <li> Just make sure you have a good grip on it.</li>
            <li> Nice to have cordless with no cord getting in yhe way.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I was very impressed and would definitely recommend getting them if you want a great cut for not a ton of money.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving my own head since I was 19.</li>
            <li> Great clippers, do a great job, easy to clean with lots of guides.  </li>
            <li> kind of defeats the purpose of \\&quot;wireless.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;*Update*&lt;br /&gt;Wahl</li>
            <li> We liked the clipper.  </li>
            <li> Nice that it is cordless, but didn&#x27;t shave as close as my corded version.  </li>
            <li> My Husband was Thrilled when My cordless clippers came within 2 days.</li>
            <li> i cut my own hair in the shower and it seems to be unaffected&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice clippers but my battery is not holding a charge.</li>
            <li> Nice carrying case for portability.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with itthank you so much for your product</li>
            <li> These were nice clippers</li>
            <li> This went to my husband who cuts his own hair and all 3 of our sons.</li>
            <li> She says they are as good or better than some salon clippers she has used.</li>
            <li> I was looking to replace the plug-in version of the Wahl I currently own with a rechargeable version.</li>
            <li> The attachments are well made and snap on nicely.</li>
            <li> Was going to return it, but he decided to give it a try and really liked it.</li>
            <li> These are a nice set, defiantly get the job done.</li>
            <li> They seem to strike a nice balance between power and price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also works nicely for beards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> your own clipper protects you from disease transmission and save your money&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The bag and bib are a nice touch.  </li>
            <li> If you cut your own hair and don&#x27;t want to get tangled in the cord and yank on it and accidentally make a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Not allowing them to correct the problem for you when they offer means it is your OWN FAULT that you are now out the money and don&#x27;t have a functioning set.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s done very well for me and continues giving excellent haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice to have a cordless clipper.</li>
            <li> I really liked it.</li>
            <li> Used these for about a month now, all works well, nice cut.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice if they emailed me a paid shipping label to print out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m considering somehow attaching some sort of weighted material to the bottom of the clippers to make it more balanced, but haven&#x27;t thought of a good plan yet.  </li>
            <li> Kind of noisy but works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recommend these for all of you searching for a nice pair of clippers.</li>
            <li> Works nicely.  </li>
            <li> They come with all the sizes and tools / goodies all in one nice bag.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers said that they could cut their own hair with these clippers, but I haven&#x27;t tried that.</li>
            <li> someone else, this may be an awesome kit; for me it really didn&#x27;t meet my expectations or needs.</li>
            <li> life is spectacularly long.&lt;br /&gt;over</li>
            <li> So, the solution, cut my own hair.</li>
            <li> I hold it close when shaving my own head.</li>
            <li> It is nice to not have to plug it in to the wall to cut your hair.</li>
            <li> I can cut my own hair out side</li>
            <li> These are just as good as those but the cordless aspect makes them that much better by lessening the time it takes to cut my hair.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still learning how to use them to cut my own hair in front of the mirror .  </li>
            <li> I do appreciate good customer service, and I&#x27;m upgrading this review to three stars, more for the company than for the product per se.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s a self-sufficient college grad and has been doing his own hair for years.  </li>
            <li> Nice clippers.</li>
            <li> Works well and delivers a nice haircut.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall nice product...</li>
            <li> I use the product to cut my own hair in the shower (weekly).  </li>
            <li> and I really liked the fact that it has a lithium battery rather than a ni-cad.  </li>
            <li> this is defenetely the purchase you should do, the clippler cuts really nicely</li>
            <li> My brother who has used a Wahl for years buzzing his own head often suggested me getting my own Wahl clipper which I shunned.</li>
            <li> If your hesitate like I was for years to buzz your own cut....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to not have the cord when i&#x27;m in the shower to shave my head.</li>
            <li> Nice grip.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with this set of clippers out of the box, I was able to cut my hair right away.  </li>
            <li> This can be very useful and it would be great if these clippers had a rubber loop too.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> Decided to spend some money on some decent clippers, and these work perfectly.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product and am glad to recommend it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for me because I just moved out of my parents and need somewhere to start as I was new to the world of clippers.</li>
            <li> It does cut quick, even and does a great job.  </li>
            <li> 4/3/16 update- replacement clippers are still going strong, so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, perfect knife for thick hear</li>
            <li> havent timed it yet- very strong just like any corded clipper.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use, my wife now cuts my hair.</li>
            <li> it does all the job plus more, really love it !</li>
            <li> Very light weight and effective.</li>
            <li> It seems to cut nicely but does not charge well the connection is very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I am able to cut my hair on my own now.</li>
            <li> The battery life is good but the on and off button feels flimsy and the accessory is cheap looking.</li>
            <li> So far they have been great!</li>
            <li> Wahl is by far the best consumer products out there.</li>
            <li> Fantastic quality and good battery life retention...</li>
            <li> When they worked, they were great, but for the price, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re worth.</li>
            <li> It seems just as powerful, works great, have had no problems with battery life or recharge rate.  </li>
            <li> Amazing, love the style, and its efficiency</li>
            <li> The best ever, this device have really saved me time and money and it really works great.</li>
            <li> Best professional clipper.</li>
            <li> So far these are great!</li>
            <li> By far the best with usage after a charge and have not had any snags.</li>
            <li> It is good clipper and cuts hair pretty good.</li>
            <li> Turn on his favorite show on the tablet, and I get a pretty easy experience with a great tool!  </li>
            <li> Great product - light and easy to use</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with how easy it was to cut my hair.</li>
            <li> I love love love this clipper!</li>
            <li> It cuts great, many attachments and DOES NOT GET HOT!</li>
            <li> These both are very good products and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> And while the detail trimmer isn&#x27;t as good as the clippers themselves, it&#x27;s still a much better deal than anything else currently available.  </li>
            <li> And while the detail trimmer isn&#x27;t as good as the clippers themselves, it&#x27;s still a much better deal than anything else currently available.  </li>
            <li> the trimmers and the clippers are weighted very well and fit perfectly in your hand while cutting.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li> Loved the clipper, it was loud but worked great.  </li>
            <li> I admit I did not use the trimmer, but one good look at them and you can figure out for yourself that they are nothing special.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been pretty happy with them.  </li>
            <li> is the first set of clippers I have ever purchased, and I am quite happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Very cheap construction.  </li>
            <li> Plastic like and very light..</li>
            <li> very important item</li>
            <li> do not use the beard trimmer, but the beard trimmer does feel very cheap.</li>
            <li> The cordless feature is amazing and so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Not the best I have ever seen but for the price these are the first Wahl clippers under $100 that are worth it.  </li>
            <li> Nice strong and mobile.</li>
            <li> Very nice cut the case it comes in could be better but overall very nice clippers</li>
            <li> very nice first clipper set</li>
            <li> The large clipper works great...</li>
            <li> Came fast, great product.</li>
            <li> I am very please and happy with this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> they apparently love it, which is why I keep on getting more and more orders through words of mouth...</li>
            <li> The clippers are really quite and are great quality blades.</li>
            <li> He has used a corded one for many years.  </li>
            <li> Many complements.</li>
            <li> I love it because it is cordless.</li>
            <li> But once I saw these and realized they didn&#x27;t have a pesky cord attached to them (that has so many times attempted to strangle me while knocking off everything on my bathroom sink), I thought I&#x27;d give em a try.</li>
            <li> I was glad I got them; they worked like a champ.  </li>
            <li> They cut even, which sped up the cut and made it look better, no chafing either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use these in cosmetology school and love them.</li>
            <li> but I have yet to find one I am in love with anyway.</li>
            <li> Love this set.  </li>
            <li> $ more)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to buy a better one soon.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shears are also kind of cheap feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it a couple of months and already it&#x27;s more than paid for itself.</li>
            <li> Quite simply the best cordless clipper I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> I love this clipper.</li>
            <li> I have owned many razors (Conair, Norelco, etc...).</li>
            <li> one thing i did like thought is it it had a 1/2,1 1/2, 5,7, attachements which most clippers dont come with.</li>
            <li> (so I&#x27;m 99% sure it&#x27;s not the battery itself).  </li>
            <li> I am amending my review rating to reflect my experience with both the replacement product and the prompt, respectful customer service.</li>
            <li> 5 haircuts and havent had to charge it yet :)</li>
            <li> love it would buy it again works well</li>
            <li> I was able to revive battery.</li>
            <li> Then wahl charger was able to finish charge.</li>
            <li> Otherwise have used maybe six times and it has more than  paid for itself.</li>
            <li> Noisier than most clippers I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> comes with many size attachments</li>
            <li> Sure, I could get a replacement for this one</li>
            <li> and I am completely satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> Great price and fast delivery</li>
            <li> but you get more than a half-dozen for the clipper-Packaging:</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the best home-use clipper and trimmer on the market especially at this price.</li>
            <li> But it means the edges and sideburns are never shaved to the skin and need to be touched up more often.</li>
            <li> Also, being wireless, they make clipping my hair much more convenient.</li>
            <li> Wahl resharpened the blade for free!</li>
            <li> Love that they are cordless.</li>
            <li> I have been able to cut in all sort of places in which i would never be able to because of a cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are OK the trimer pulls ur hair.</li>
            <li> the better you get.</li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>
            <li> They fit really nice in your hand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(Tip: Divide the head into regions, use ascending numbers from bottom to top, blend with a rocking motion.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and yet I&#x27;m already getting many complements on my cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the barber&#x27;s scissors are not top-of-the-line.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Best clippers I&#x27;ve used in ten years.</li>
            <li> Love them 10/10</li>
            <li> my grand sons.  </li>
            <li> I love my clippers and trimmers and don&#x27;t have to worry abt cords</li>
            <li> products are my wife&#x27;s favorite for the quality of the cut; but not the quality of the battery life.</li>
            <li> he love&#x27;s it</li>
            <li> Grandson says he&#x27;ll ask for haircuts more often now since this is so painless.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the hair clippers, don&#x27;t care for the beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The beard trimmer is ok, but I use an even cheaper one that also takes batteries.</li>
            <li> Love the cordless design.</li>
            <li> so I put an Andy Jackson in the safe each time.</li>
            <li> I DO recommend that you buy some more oil for the blades,</li>
            <li> Works Great and Fast shipping</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m not even sure how it happened</li>
            <li> That is more a bag design thing than unit design.  </li>
            <li> It needs a better carrying</li>
            <li> I just wish they put more effort into the case.</li>
            <li> I ended up going out and buying a rechargeable detail trimmer, which also ended up having a lot more</li>
            <li> Love the cordless</li>
            <li> I used a voltage converter, but it still made a sound like a machine gun!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Wahl clippers for over 15 years and have always been satisfied</li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> and i have to say i love them .</li>
            <li> If it does I&#x27;ll be sure to update this review.</li>
            <li> listing needs to be more forthcoming.</li>
            <li> Cordless is nice - battery powered trimmer seems cheap.</li>
            <li> Without cord more comfy.</li>
            <li> To all women out there, buy this for your partner they would love you for it.</li>
            <li> the wahl product is great but good condition 100% better than thought it is really good proffesional use it everyday</li>
            <li> Be sure to put the oil that they provide</li>
            <li> love the fact that this model is wireless.</li>
            <li> Three stars mostly for the price.</li>
            <li> works great, so much easier than messing with a cord.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this relatively inexpensive product.</li>
            <li> It definitely takes an adjustment but it is perfect.</li>
            <li> He travels a lot and he is definitely enjoying it.  </li>
            <li> My hair cut looked better then before and clippers did not scratch me at all.  </li>
            <li> ok I guess, but sounded like a lawnmower.  </li>
            <li> Wahl could have really made this a great clipper set if they would have put forth a bit more effort.  </li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> Overall very happy with it</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> ; clipper works OK to do the detailing.  </li>
            <li> Will probably get a better ROI on a better corded model and roll my $10 elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> The scenery is amazing and birds always enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Love the color coded guards for my aging eyes.</li>
            <li> I love these clippers.</li>
            <li> The clipper is everything advertised and more.</li>
            <li> For the price, I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better set of clippers.  </li>
            <li> so I bought those to see if more money meant better clippers.  </li>
            <li> and it also has properly fitting attachment combs.  </li>
            <li> Plus, companies can always improve a product more.  </li>

            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love mine.</li>
            <li> finally a lithium Ion version of this cordless trimmers, I hope to get great use out of these!</li>
            <li> We have been using this for over a year and we are well satisfied.</li>
            <li> My husband decided to keep them which was ok with me.</li>
            <li> and I love them.  </li>
            <li> So I returned it with amazon and had to buy another one at walmart which was about $15 more.</li>
            <li> Firefighters who like to go shaved will love this .&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cut my hair much more often with this set up .</li>
            <li> Some people are able to style just like a barber with practice .</li>
            <li> I cut my hair much more often with this set up .</li>
            <li> Some people are able to style just like a barber with practice .</li>
            <li> I will try another brand (Philips) to see if those are any better.</li>
            <li> Conair clippers I had, were better.  </li>
            <li> Kind of cheap.</li>
            <li> directions for the clippers specifically state that it cannot be overcharged, so you can charge it after every haircut and know it will be safe from damage.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li> Made sure it was plugged and tried to recharge.  </li>
            <li> This was rather unexpected, but brilliant customer service.  </li>
            <li> Wahl makes a great product and Amazon shipped it fast.</li>
            <li> Yeah Wahl ! :-)</li>
            <li> It is more a matter of understanding how it works, and then making sure you pay attention to it.</li>
            <li> What I like the most about  </li>
            <li> I love this 27-piece kit:</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> Until you use this cordless clipper you won&#x27;t be able to appreciate the convenience of not being tethered to a wall outlet.</li>
            <li> Cheap quality!</li>
            <li> array of attachments, most of which I will never use&lt;br /&gt;Extra</li>
            <li> is a bit lacking - does not provide protection for devices or a way to organize the many attachments</li>
            <li> Also, once it dies I will still be able to cut my hair while it&#x27;s plugged in.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Wahl 4oz clipper oil with it and am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Been using this clippers set on my boys haircuts for the last 4 months; works great!!!</li>
            <li> So the things I mention are just to make it better</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am able to keep myself trimmed and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a corded Wahl clipper set for over 10 years, and wanted to get something more portable.</li>
            <li> WARNING: If you charge the clippers with the wall charger, make sure you unplug the clipper from the cable when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic and have sharp blades give perfect result and sizes very suitable for palm and contain the bag on many options and wonderful&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> So far so good - he says the cut quick and perfectly and loves the easy cord free</li>
            <li> This thing works great, and other than a goofy on/off switch, it is a great unit.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, they buzzed right through, no problem at all.  </li>
            <li> Nice and sharp, wireless, awesome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve probably had this trimmer about 2 months and still on first charge!!!</li>
            <li> I have older Triton lipo charger because I fly rc planes and helicopters.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it great value for the price</li>
            <li> They did not give an even cut or finish and the attachment combs were very cheaply made and easy to break.  </li>
            <li> THE GOOD&lt;br /&gt;The clipper and trimmer are pretty good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems to hold a pretty good charge throughout the haircutting process, which takes me about 15-30 minutes of intermittent on/off use.  </li>
            <li> These cut smoothly and very quickly!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still on the original charge!</li>
            <li> It was worth spending the money to buy it!!</li>
            <li> These new cordless clippers are really great.</li>
            <li> This new Wahl works great in the battery department.</li>
            <li> Lithium Ion batteries hold a charge for a very long time so are an excellent choice for this device.&lt;br /&gt;-Adjustable head: with no attachments clipped on the head, theis lever permits adjusting how close the clipper will cut.  </li>
            <li> pro set because it seemed to be a better concept that would work more accurately with the number/color setup.  </li>
            <li> as strong as the corded version I had before; cordless feature allows much more flexibility</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;d prefer if the head were removeable so it can more easily be cleaned.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We love them and found them easy to use.  </li>
            <li> If it still works fine in 3 years, I&#x27;ll upgrade to 5 stars :-)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to clean and oil (with included brush and oil) after each use!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re light, sleek, and cut better than my Oster and Andis clippers.</li>
            <li> Arrived before I expected and worked perfectly .</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s performed great so far.</li>
            <li> I have bought many clippers over the years (primarily from Wahl), and have witnessed the evolution of this product to what it is today.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;The free case that holds everything could have more pouches to keep things organized.</li>
            <li> Most importantly without the cord, I can do it all by myself.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to replace my simpler Wahl razor which I use primarily for &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; (more like maintaining a round-the-clock 5-o&#x27;clock shadow).</li>
            <li> This replaced my old plug-in clippers and it works great.</li>
            <li> All is great so far.  </li>
            <li> I use them professionally for work and they are a great product.</li>
            <li> The detail trimmers works well, I also use it for trimming my beard every 3 days and it feels great for my soft skin.</li>
            <li> Happy to say I was able to fix this problem by running the tip of the blades back and forth across a piece of sandpaper on a counter top.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d rather have something that feels more secure or not as slippery.  </li>
            <li> so they are more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Good battery life, and it cuts through my hair really well.  </li>
            <li> this year he loved it so much.  </li>
            <li> The multiple size heads are very good and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that they&#x27;re cordless and very powerful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lowering my rating to 3 stars from my original rating of 4 stars, because though the customer service was good, I still had to go through the hassle of replacing the clippers, plus I had to pay for my own shipping, and also I realize now how loud the clippers are.</li>
            <li> Nice clean cut, easy clean up, and plenty of power.</li>
            <li> I have used other brands of clippers but Wahl is the best.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, pretty pleased!</li>
            <li> is that the head was removeable so could easily be cleaned and thoroughly lubricated after each use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Good basic trimmer which does everything you would expect it to and the battery life is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I take these with me on business trips and it&#x27;s easy to cut my hair with them.  </li>
            <li> and this clipper is by far the best I&#x27;ve used to date that is for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I was paying $15 for at my barber.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a ton of accessories and easy instructions.</li>
            <li> And, you can easily hold it in one hand.</li>
            <li> Compared to most clippers they feel light and cheap.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> so easy to use  </li>
            <li> Easy charging and battery time is sufficient.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and there are even videos online showing you how to use them.</li>
            <li> Easy to cut the hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and having</li>
            <li> Cleans well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to handle without the cord.  </li>
            <li> So so easy.</li>
            <li> Strong , cut mine , son , dad.</li>
            <li> Been going strong since purchased in 2013.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a starter pack - but the main product is good.</li>
            <li> Lightweight but strong.</li>
            <li> Strong.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still running strong.</li>
            <li> The hair clippers hold a charge great, I mean really great..  </li>
            <li> We do lots of hair cuts and these clippers are as easy to use as any, no pulling, switches work fine</li>
            <li> Those were pretty good and much higher quality than anything Conair has to be sure.  </li>
            <li> average at best.  </li>
            <li> This is hands down the best cordless clipper I have owned.</li>
            <li> Having no chord made the process so much more easy, quick, and enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then, I charge them and they are good as new.</li>
            <li> Light weight  easy  to maintain  cordless  </li>
            <li> We found it light and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;d recommend you charge it fully after every two or three haircuts and should be fine on battery</li>
            <li> but that is cheap and easy to buy.</li>
            <li> Kept them oiled as instructed &amp; always chalked it up to my grandsons baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> and you should be fine for years.  </li>
            <li> Clippers worked fine until I had them 20 months.</li>
            <li> They hold the charge fine for me, but don&#x27;t cut my hair.  </li>
            <li> It cuts smooth and even and allows for easy self-cutting.</li>
            <li> It works fine.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to achieve the advertised 15 minute quick charge.</li>
            <li> It will be the best money you spent on your head EVER.....!!!</li>
            <li> Saw this product originally at BB&amp;B, bought it online, and now 1 year later - still happy and going strong with it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am amazed by the huge difference in performance.</li>
            <li> huge kit</li>
            <li> they cut great but sound like you&#x27;re holding a lawn mower next to your ear.</li>
            <li> Better than expected, great battery life.</li>
            <li> Better than expected, great battery life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made a huge mistake buying this clipper.  </li>
            <li> It sounds like they’ve designed it to send WAY too much power to the motor – like the whole thing could fly apart at any moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the material feels like cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> the hair clips are also cheap plastic rather than metal.</li>
            <li> The item works very well and the battery life is quite amazing...</li>
            <li> The clipper is sleek and light weight.</li>
            <li> Overall great buy.</li>
            <li> It worked OK but was not cutting evenly.</li>
            <li> Seem to still be working great after several months.  </li>
            <li> Also, the smaller razor is used for precision trimming and it works great as well.</li>
            <li> Once i got this it was light and of course no wire</li>
            <li> I took it apart, and it&#x27;s got a commonly available cell inside.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, gives a great cut and holds a charge.</li>
            <li> The clipper is awsome, powerful, ergonomic and stylish.</li>
            <li> but it does work well and is dirt cheap.</li>
            <li> Units sound and act as though they&#x27;re plugged into power.  </li>
            <li> This is handy for trimming around the ears.&lt;br /&gt;-Modern design: sleeker and more comfortable in the hand than the old design</li>
            <li> We put it on the charger between cuts after the 2nd haircut (5-10 minutes) and it works great.  </li>
            <li> So i have to buy another omvolter  from 220 to 110 V , and another think to fit in to  US to EU sockets ...</li>
            <li> They cut smooth and are light weight.</li>
            <li> If you cut hair outdoors (I have a project where I give free haircuts on the sidewalk or at events I&#x27;m invited to)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The silver decorative part moves around as if it&#x27;s a cheap add on.</li>
            <li> Great gift for my son and he uses it daily.  </li>
            <li> Man this feels cheap..</li>
            <li> It is so cheap that the plastic body feels like its going to crack every time you turn it on/off.</li>
            <li> But overall it&#x27;s a great product for this price.  </li>
            <li> (the charging indicator light wouldn&#x27;t turn on when plugged in and it wouldn&#x27;t charge or turn on --</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and maintain.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> With cord it is more powerful.</li>
            <li> You know that sound a lawnmower makes when when it gets into tall grass?</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I had a cheap set of clippers before that I used for years.  </li>
            <li> It feels comfortable and balanced to hold.</li>
            <li> Awesome clippers, the Lithium batteries last much longer and the motor is more powerful.</li>
            <li> Smooth as silk.</li>
            <li> and I tensed up waiting for them to &#x27;catch&#x27; or tangle in my hair like my cheap clippers</li>
            <li> Have used several times now and each time was a great experience.</li>
            <li> such a great deal.</li>
            <li> Big trimmers are louder than what I was expecting from reading the reviews, but they work great.</li>
            <li> The battery life is really great and lasts through multiple hair cuts with out a recharge.</li>
            <li> They are light in weight.</li>
            <li> I see complaints about how they feel cheap.</li>
            <li> They work great and the Lithium battery is well-worth the extra expense.  </li>
            <li> Light weight plastic exterior.  </li>
            <li> The adjustment screw is cheap and doesn&#x27;t always work</li>
            <li> Would not charge, charge light would not come on.</li>
            <li> It could easily fit in a glove box .</li>
            <li> Holds in the hand comfortably.</li>
            <li> The cut is always even and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The smaller clipper that comes with this kit isn&#x27;t that great</li>
            <li> Light won&#x27;t even come on.  </li>
            <li> Light weight handle effortlessly.</li>
            <li> Great kit, pouch, has all the add ons for different hair length.</li>
            <li> The smaller razor is a great bonus, cuts all the ear hair, etc....</li>
            <li> For personal use i think this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Much sound and fury, signifying nothing.</li>
            <li> Comes with an extensive range of depth control clip ons, including a great eyebrow attachment.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They are light, ridiculously light, plastic, just junk.</li>
            <li> Great clipper, have been using since March 2012 and have only charged it 3 times.</li>
            <li> These “feel” cheap in every way compared to both the Conair and Remington items they replaced.</li>
            <li> Light weight also.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately it cuts and trims well also.</li>
            <li> Great battery life and a solid performer.</li>
            <li> and i would have to go over one area multiple times to make sure the cut was good.</li>
            <li> We use the clippers weekly, so far so good.</li>
            <li> Now in the warm weather it is so nice to sit outside and get a haircut</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far so good.</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> Great item much better than expected for the price...</li>
            <li> But generally it&#x27;s good so far.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see - maybe I&#x27;ll update this again when I&#x27;ve had some good trouble-free service with my fixed clippers.</li>
            <li> and it works good without any problems so far.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very satisfied with it, and charging is very quick.</li>
            <li> The large main one works great.</li>
            <li> and it is very useful for speed jobs.</li>
            <li> VERY FAST VERY SMOOTH</li>
            <li> This cordless Wahl is very powerful and with the lithium battery there&#x27;s no need to worry about finishing the job you start.  </li>
            <li> really, if all you got was the main clipper set, this would still be a great value.</li>
            <li> Batteries/charge lasted all day everyday Love these!!!</li>
            <li> With many handy features such as the quick charge, and the many adjustable settings this cordless Wahl delivers a 1-2 knockout punch.</li>
            <li> Great value for the price, and cutting my husband&#x27;s hair is now SO easy!!! :)</li>
            <li> Trimmer is a nice addition, nice for travel pack, cuz it uses AA batteries which are easy to replace.&lt;br /&gt;Overall feeling is not bad, worth money that you spend, 4 stars for cheap extra stuff in package.</li>
            <li> I love love love this hair cutting set, best I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Please hear me Wahl Corp., and market this product in a manner deserving of a low-cost, high quality product that bears your name.</li>
            <li> We previously had a corded version - this cordless one is still great Wahl quality, but more flexible and therefore can be used</li>
            <li> Excellent tool to carry around in a small pouch.</li>
            <li> My wife has been providing me with haircuts for most of the 50-years that we have been married.</li>
            <li> well worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> has great customer service and after immense research they really put a lot of love into their product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I was excited to get a cordless clipper, but it does not hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> (Original review)  </li>
            <li> was excited when it arrived because it was cordless and adustable, without using guards.</li>
            <li> Plus they sent me a return label so I can return the original one at no cost to me.</li>
            <li> The first was louder and vibrated more than a sherman tank.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this clipper so far.</li>
            <li> ok, but be aware the trimmer is not rechargeable, you have to use AA batteries.</li>
            <li> and I was excited for her to buy these for home use.</li>
            <li> Works great, hold a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Top cover needs more ribs for rigidity and give the unit a more solid feel.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve charged it over night, then waited 2 weeks, shaved my head, waited another two weeks, and shaved my head again all on the original charge.</li>
            <li> I have owned  several shavers but this is by far the best quality.</li>
            <li> It is powerful easy to handle  </li>
            <li> I just clean what I can and keep it oiled after every use.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I did not spend hundreds on a more professional clipper because this is the bomb</li>
            <li> Now after it is charged the bright blue charging light stays on permanently, even when unplugged.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know for sure, but it felt like they cut better than my old plug-in clippers (also Wahl).</li>
            <li> The blade teeth broke clean off.</li>
            <li> He loves all of the accessories and said that this makes quick and accurate work of his trimming and head shaving.  </li>
            <li> Clean cut every time.</li>
            <li> I cut both of my sons hair , and my own with this product ,and still have enough juice to do more hair cuts .</li>
            <li> Over the years I have used many clippers and these are by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Nothing to clean up ....</li>
            <li> Cuts clean.</li>
            <li> Being cordless is really awesome and makes me move freely during hair cutting.&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts long time and even I don&#x27;t remember how frequently I charge it</li>
            <li> Works Perfect, holds a decently long charge, and comes with more than enough accessories.</li>
            <li> Works great and always can find the right tool between the two clippers and multiple attachments.</li>
            <li> The previous best was the first set of Wahl clippers that I had.</li>
            <li> While the performance was fine (cut smoothly, reasonably powerful though not like their corded models), the battery situation is a problem on these.  </li>
            <li> the way if you want more mineral oil go to the anti-constipation section of walmart/target and get their mineral oil in large bottle.</li>
            <li> It seems well made and solid and does a good job of shearing my hair to the 1/2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Battery is good enough!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it is good clipper and I would recommend to who don&#x27;t mind big and bulky clippers.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this so much that he bought two more to give as gifts for his friends.</li>
            <li> After a full charge, I can&#x27;t tell any difference in clipping between it and the corded version.  </li>
            <li> Good thing is that you can plug it in for just 15 (if needs be) and won&#x27;t affect the overall capacity (no memory) of the battery.  </li>
            <li> Good purchase overall.</li>
            <li> Its a good product, however, the faceplate on the big cutter came off so now it rattles away.</li>
            <li> The product is good and it does it job properly.</li>
            <li> Seem okay, just not what I really needed.  </li>
            <li> Many thanks</li>
            <li> &amp; I was through in about 10 minutes complete with trimming around the ears and neck, made nice by the included trimmer clippers.</li>
            <li> Did not want to spend as much for clippers, but glad I did.  </li>
            <li> All my peachfuzz and sparsely scattered remnants of what was once a head full of hair.  </li>
            <li> The Good:  - clipper made in the usa  - lithium ion (will update this 2 years from now see if it has the same juice</li>
            <li> is a bit of a chore, but otherwise the customer service was good and the replacement process was relatively painless.</li>
            <li> Worked really well, glad I got it....</li>
            <li> Smooth as butter and just as powerful as my corded clippers.</li>
            <li> I know what tugging is and this WAHL has good power for a personal clipper .</li>
            <li> So I figured I&#x27;d give this a try since it got such good</li>
            <li> I recommend this clipper to anyone who needs a good quality clipper for personal grooming.</li>
            <li> My whiskers grow fast and in every direction and many are curly, but after 3 full days without a trim, no strays have popped up and it still looks like</li>
            <li> Not bad at all considering these are battery powered devices.  </li>
            <li> The smaller one is very good, a little louder than my older corded one but is so nice not to be fighting with the cord, cuts very precise and is easily stored in the case.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m a professional and they hold a charge all day, trimmers aren&#x27;t as great though I put new energizer batteries in them</li>
            <li> And super fast delivery:)</li>
            <li> Good strong mooter which works on even wet hair.</li>
            <li> , my older Wahl was great but the cord is a major annoyance.</li>
            <li> These fit the bill and go right along with my beard trimmer that is a Wahl lithium Ion as well.</li>
            <li> The spring inside is pretty strong and it&#x27;ll pop out immediately once you loosen the screen.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This may be obvious for most users, but be sure to clean and oil the clipper after every use.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is much more lightweight than the professional version I had, and it does require a battery, but works just fine for me.  </li>
            <li> Overall the large clipper is really great.  </li>
            <li> Have used other Wahl Lithium Ion clippers and they were great.</li>
            <li> This is my first wahl trimmer and I am more than satisfied with the performance thus far.</li>
            <li> I had an older version of this clipper with the cord, and I have to say the new one is not as good.  </li>
            <li> affords me a fresh, clean looking cut every Monday at work.</li>
            <li> This model cuts as well as the classic corded version but is much more convenient to use.</li>
            <li> The only con I have is the blade cut by itself is not as close as others but everything else is exceptional.</li>
            <li> They replaced my old  cheap clippers and these are a thousand times better in performance and quality.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and am contemplating buying more as back-ups in the future.</li>
            <li> I was trying to replace the older one, but I find myself using that more than this one.  </li>
            <li> It feels light and somewhat cheap, but it&#x27;s holding up very well and no issues.  </li>
            <li> Of course, the clippers&#x27; main function is to cut hair, and like my previous corded Wahl clippers, these do it perfectly.  </li>
            <li> this big with such impressive build quality, but</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Finally, I&#x27;m trying to buy Made in America as much as I can, so I was happy to see they</li>
            <li> The battery life is decent, although for a Lithium Ion battery you&#x27;d expect more.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I like this set and believe they are the best home clipper set on the market.00 at the time] and the shipping that made the overall total $100.  </li>
            <li> The battery life is decent, although for a Lithium Ion battery you&#x27;d expect more.  </li>
            <li> It will quick charge in 15 minutes</li>
            <li> It will quick charge in 15 minutes</li>
            <li> The 15 minute quick charge means that we don&#x27;t have to plan tonight to cut my hair tomorrow night.</li>
            <li> Quick charge, cuts well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The big clippers actually do a great job of cleaning up my neck without nicking it (as much), so I just use those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> machine is very plastic-y and feels borderline cheap in build quality materials, but is very powerful.</li>
            <li> The clippers give an even level cut that does better than the high dollar clippers like Oster and the price</li>
            <li> The clippers give an even level cut that does better than the high dollar clippers like Oster and the price</li>
            <li> As it is the trimmer and most of the attachments will be gathering dust on a high shelf in my bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li> but with caution with the charging battery failure and it not being able to use a cord with it when the battery doesn&#x27;t work!!!  </li>
            <li> : scissors are fine, colorful heads are quite too cheap, but not broken yet.</li>
            <li> Excellent battery life, clear sharp cuts.</li>
            <li> When I first picked them up I told her they seemed really cheap</li>
            <li> I have only used it a couple of times but have been very pleased.</li>
            <li> Time will tell how the batteries hold up, but for now I have to say I&#x27;m very pleased and would definitely buy these again.</li>
            <li> Not near as good as the wahl with cord.</li>
            <li> charge lasts a good long time</li>
            <li> Build quality feels good, battery lasts plenty long for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Trimmer is more powerful than the older Wahl I had</li>
            <li> The trimmer is a great adition, as we have only had the main clippers up until</li>
            <li> also  work great for keeping my beard trimmed, and will take neck stubble down almost as close as my razor.</li>
            <li> I take duct tape and go from ear to ear and shave my neck below making a nice clean line in the back of my head .</li>
            <li> I take duct tape and go from ear to ear and shave my neck below making a nice clean line in the back of my head .</li>
            <li> Able to cut my husband&#x27;s hair at home and make it look pretty decent!</li>
            <li> I give it 4 instead of 5 because after a year or two it has been getting louder and it vibrates more than when it was new.  </li>
            <li> Love my new clippers and trimmers.</li>
            <li> They worked great but the battery died in less than a year</li>
            <li> &gt; the clippers are both fantastic and hold a nice long</li>
            <li> The small trimmer works great on the back head side to give good shapes.</li>
            <li> more size selections than previous kits -- probably more than you&#x27;ll ever need since a 3-4 size would have been fine</li>
            <li> the constant apologies and the &amp;#34;1-800&amp;#34; number and fix the issue that so many of us are complaining about !</li>
            <li> It also comes in a wonderful soft carry bag that would fit easily in a small carry bag for traveling .</li>
            <li> Good use on a single battery charge.lots of accessories provided and useful too.can be used while traveling without the chager</li>
            <li> its a great beginning for a single father on a budget who wants to keep there boys neat a trim.</li>
            <li> It works very well and has a wide range of tips that make it easy to give a good haircut.</li>
            <li> Generally speaking the process was very easy</li>
            <li> /&gt;the little trimmer is great for the ears and my neck</li>
            <li> /&gt;They haven&#x27;t pulled my hair, and they cut pretty cleanly and powerfully, but for some reason they don&#x27;t seem to cut all my hairs.</li>
            <li> The small clipper looks like a plastic toy but the main clipper is awesome.</li>
            <li> Cut fast and clean and stay cool doing it.</li>
            <li> This is a good product but the large hair clipper has a short battery life compared to the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used for a long period of time so can&#x27;t comment, but sure with a full charge it would be fine.</li>
            <li> They feel really lightweight and cheap</li>
            <li> Worked great for over a year, but then became unchargeable (and hence unusable) after sitting in storage for a few months.  </li>
            <li> Cuts very well and smooth.</li>
            <li> It is light weight, but Dies too fast.</li>
            <li> Far better precision that allows me to get shorter hair lengths without looking shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using an old Wahl for many years, I was reluctant to try anything else.  </li>
            <li> All the extra clip pieces are nice to have.</li>
            <li> it seems to be powerful.  </li>
            <li> I have no training and am able to cut 3 adult men&#x27;s hair and 2 children.</li>
            <li> first, a full charge lasted a month if not used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The unit worked very well, the only thing that I did not like was the size of the hair clippers, but I will get use to it; the smaller unit ,the trimmer, is great!</li>
            <li> and they aren&#x27;t that powerful...</li>
            <li> I take extremely good care of all my things and carefully cleaned it and oiled between uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Detailer is powerful too if you put Nicads in it.</li>
            <li> Clippers are really powerful and the trimmer runs on batteries which is no biggie for me.</li>
            <li> It is powerful, fast and precise.</li>
            <li> have now had the chance to evaluate the replacement clippers for 6-months worth of haircuts.  </li>
            <li> Totaly worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I will say that these were powerful and the unit is well made.</li>
            <li> So far after a month (about 2 uses) it is working much better.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to save some money and cut your own hair or family&#x27;s hair at home.</li>
            <li> but it is well worth</li>
            <li> It was far more to-the-point and useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry about the money, your pet is worth it.</li>
            <li> as powerful as corded clipper</li>
            <li> Quiet and nice cut.</li>
            <li> I always cut my own hair since I keep it so short.</li>
            <li> Why wait a month&#x27;s worth of time?</li>
            <li> Kind of a short cut.</li>
            <li> Most of friends my have soft hair like mine</li>
            <li> dont know if my $10 shipping and waiting is worth it.  </li>
            <li> It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have always been one to cut my own hair for several years.</li>
            <li> 6 haircuts(i cut my own hair and my son) and only had to charge it one time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Depending on what you use this item for it may be one of the most versatile shavers not in the regular advertising cycle light.</li>
            <li> this one is far better.  </li>
            <li> Nice powerful motor on the larger unit.  </li>
            <li> Slips out of hand, and not as powerful as corded Wahl.</li>
            <li> These clippers are awesome they don&#x27;t bind up with thick hair or when making fast passes.</li>
            <li> Liked the product because it is cordless, quiet, and cuts well.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months now and the battery charge seems to last nicely as well.  </li>
            <li> Just as powerful as the corded Oster clipper that i have been using for years.  </li>
            <li> I rarely have to charge it.</li>
            <li> Powerful, long-lasting.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s versatile, lightweight, and powerful.</li>
            <li> combined price of these two units was just a wee bit more than the price of replacement blades for the professional model.  </li>
            <li> The clippers work great and come with more attachments that what I have traditionally seen in other units.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to try the ear trimmer as I have never been able to do white walls over the ears .</li>
            <li> Overall I highly recommend this product but when you receive it, be sure to check and make sure that everything is there.</li>
            <li> but I prefer to have another professional set to make my lineup very clean</li>
            <li> Comes in a nice zip case to store all the guide combs, with a small trimmer great for over ears and back of neck trimming, and have had them for going on five years now.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> Notmany companies take the initiative to make things right for their customers these days.  </li>
            <li> Again, I want to thank Wahl for taking the time to proactively make this right for me.  </li>
            <li> They have tried to make it right, so it&#x27;s on you for not letting them.</li>
            <li> Shoulder covering thing was thrown right the way.</li>
            <li> , cuts right through.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried alot of brands since then to try and find the right clipper.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s zipping right through it,</li>
            <li> So, based on their claim, right there on the box, that it will hold a charge for up to a year, I figured I could charge them after I use them, then unplug and store.</li>
            <li> This is the right mix of quality (cut) and convenience (cordless).  </li>
            <li> Everything you need and usable right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> Replacement was sent right out.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased and highly recommend this kit!</li>
            <li> First let me start by saying I used this clippers to cut my own shortly cropped hair</li>
            <li> However, for the Fast Feeds to be efficient you have to take them apart to clean them thoroughly and then reassemble them.  </li>
            <li> am a Man with very soft, big-curls but strong type of hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for a quick trim around the mustache/neckline areas, but didn&#x27;t have enough attachments, and didn&#x27;t fit other &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34; attachments I also had from Wahl.  </li>
            <li> I shaved my beard off in about 90 seconds (i tried to bog it down by going too fast, but it did a great job of keeping up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I have used other products and they were no near as nice or good of quality as Wahl.</li>
            <li> Very smart choice.</li>
            <li> Strong durable but pulls hear and is kind of heavy.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully, this one wont exhibit the limited battery life I experienced with the old design.  </li>
            <li> Works Great, but the small clippers use batteries.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small trimmer with AA battery works great too.  </li>
            <li> every use (only takes a minute or two) and after 15 years of regular family haircuts it worked as flawlessly as it did on day-1 (except for the old NiCad batteries)  </li>
            <li> It works great, no clipper attachments to small unit.</li>
            <li> I like the soft-sided bag it comes with (as opposed to the cheap plastic box you normally get).</li>
            <li> These probably make my fourth set of clippers and they are definitely the best so far.</li>
            <li> It works really well: cuts hair smoothly without any problems, no cord, holds the charge well, doesn&#x27;t sound loud (depends on your preference</li>
            <li> In the summer, I cut hair outside and with the clippers being cordless, it really makes it more convenient!</li>
            <li> The casting on my blades was absolutely not rough but very clean and the clipper is chrome and black very nice in appearance as well as full normal size .&lt;br</li>
            <li> The clipper comes with a complete set of tools needed for home hair cut and the smaller trimmer is very powerful and gives a nice trim of the beard.</li>
            <li> However I thought it would be a little bit more sophisticated, but that is just the looks.</li>
            <li> Very sharp blades, cuts just as good as the corded one I had before.  </li>
            <li> But the new models seem to be cheap junk</li>
            <li> After an email than a phone call i purchased a new set of trimmer blades for $6.95 -free</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very convenient since the main clipper can be charged and used on the go</li>
            <li> I dished out a few more bucks and picked up the Wahl Chromado and that thing is much better.</li>
            <li> So far still going strong.</li>
            <li> Not a deal-breaker for me, but if you&#x27;re sensitive to that kind of thing, or if you are giving a haircut to a young child who might get scared, it could be an issue.</li>
            <li> guide combs fall off when in use far to easily.  </li>
            <li> The cordless feature is great for cutting one&#x27;s own hair.</li>
            <li> THE SMALL ONE IS OK BUT USES BATTERIES!!</li>
            <li> The Small precision trimmer is a very nice addition.  </li>
            <li> They both cut very well and came with many clipper guards that fit the large clipper only.</li>
            <li> All that I expected from Wahl, and more!</li>
            <li> First one went dead after one charge, but the second one works great!</li>
            <li> Right now the only thing I found that I think could have been better is the carrying case.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was able to send it right to his home several states away.  </li>
            <li> I used them for the first time today and was pleasantly surprised with how strong they were.</li>
            <li> The extra smaller shaver is very handy.</li>
            <li> Great clippers, plenty of power to get the job done, quiet, minimal vibration, and a nice storage case to put them away until next time.</li>
            <li> battery however holds the charge very very well.  </li>
            <li> translation very MUCH pain.  </li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve pretty accepted my tonsure&#x27;s fate as being bald, this Wahl 79600 is pretty much not much of use to me, but hey, it looks good.</li>
            <li> I put it away, 2 weeks later got it back out and gave another hair cut, battery still full charge and just as good as the first time.</li>
            <li> I have barbed and shaved more the four times on a single full charge.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts for 15 haircuts or more and but to be fair once again I would like to stress my entire head can be cut in 2 minutes or less.</li>
            <li> The clipper is little bigger than i had anticipated but it looks stylish and good clean, contemporary design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pretty decently quiet, and cut very smoothly.</li>
            <li> - The price is good, you get a lot of stuff for little money.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The little trimmer good for going around the ear and hairs under the nose/upper mustache, but</li>
            <li> So far it appears to be a very high quality product, complete with a lot of nice accessories.</li>
            <li> Does not cut clean, may need new blades already.</li>
            <li> You might find it kind of hard to take on and off upon initial use but once you start using them, they snap on nicely and secure and can be interchanged very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have an Oster clipper and an Oster trimmer, but the trimmer was quite old and the clipper is huge.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> all my first impression 4/5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My first one had misaligned blades which I tried to adjust</li>
            <li> I bought Wahl because my old one was fantastic and used hundreds of times.</li>
            <li> The ties tore off the cape the first time I tied them.</li>
            <li> I was able to shave my entire head in under 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I love that as soon as summer comes he can cut his hair outside</li>
            <li> Just stick your thumb on the blade and hold it in place and screw away ;)</li>
            <li> Many accessories come into the box for different lengths and styles of hair cuts.</li>
            <li> look pretty well and brings every thing you could need to get started</li>
            <li> Next time i&#x27;ll just buy one with a cord, cheaper and seem more durable</li>
            <li> I first bought one of these Wahl Lithium Ion clippers a couple of years ago and it worked for about a year until it died and would not charge.</li>
            <li> this is the first cordless clipper i&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> Cut like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li> and I am still on the first charge.  </li>
            <li> My lesson, pay a bit more a get a proper one.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as describe.</li>
            <li> It works as smooth as the professional clippers of hairdressers.</li>
            <li> do recommend even if you&#x27;ll have regular hair cut with a barber as you&#x27;ll be able to trim your hair in between hair cuts and during your travel.</li>
            <li> They work pretty well and the battery lasts a while.</li>
            <li> After buying several sets of wahl clippers, I was glad to see that they made a cordless version.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the clippers so far (have only used twice).</li>
            <li> Overall, I am satisfied with by this unit convenient and not expensive for the family will I like it</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> These are the first clippers I have every owned.</li>
            <li> I called Wahl and they said it has a 5 year warranty and that I could ship it to them and that they would send me a free fixed or replacement clippers within 2 to 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> and I am charging it for the first time as we speak.  </li>
            <li> THE MACHINE!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The machine went through my hair like a hot knife goes thru butter.</li>
            <li> would recommend this product if WAHL redesigns this line for easier cleaning and maintenance at some point in the future.ade with a hex key to be able to get inside the clipper.</li>
            <li> Heck, I would have even paid a bit more if the cons I listed were addressed properly.</li>
            <li> It looks great and we have already saved money since she has given me at least 10 haircuts.</li>
            <li> Works very well!</li>
            <li> Clippers cut well, and I love the fact that it doesnt have a cord to constantly get in the way.</li>
            <li> Unless you are willing to pay $70-$80.00 at a department store including Walmart, forget it.</li>
            <li> I next bought the Wahl corded clippers @ Wal-Mart and found them surprizingly better quality all around.  </li>
            <li> Oil the clippers first.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Cuts very well !</li>
            <li> I love these clippers, This is the second time I bought them because a friend dropped the first ones I had.</li>
            <li> Love it but lite too short</li>
            <li> charge is enough for more than 40 mins of operation.&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
            <li> , it produces the noise similar to most of the hair</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time today, and it work just as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find the battery lasts pretty well.  </li>
            <li> This is my first set of electric clippers</li>
            <li> When I first got them I charged them over night</li>
            <li> This machine was made to last more than seven years.</li>
            <li> I looked around and all the different brands, types, styles.........etc., and this one just seemed to keep coming to the top of what I was looking at.</li>
            <li> I wanted my wife to try and cut my hair, but I wanted to be able to do it outside if we wanted, without having to haul a cord around all the time.</li>
            <li> Would prefer the small trimmer to be better for alignments, but it does the job ok.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is better than anything I owned before.</li>
            <li> If the big clipper had a close shave as the small shaver, it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> First, the backstory.</li>
            <li> I never oiled the old set and it is important that you do as directed.</li>
            <li> I bought the balding clipper a few months ago and this works just as good</li>
            <li> Thought the trimmer would be a little better, but it&#x27;s AA powered, so not as strong, but still works</li>
            <li> It was not very expensive but definatly worth the price.</li>
            <li> it is super powerful like my old corded,</li>
            <li> In order to clean out all the gunk and build up you will accumulate overtime you have to completely remove the blade with a hex key to be able to get inside the clipper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a couple months now and have used it a handful of times cutting my own hair, and as expected it works great and is much more convenient being cordless.  </li>
            <li> As long as you either leave them plugged into the wall all the time, or unplug the clippers when they&#x27;re full, you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> As long as you either leave them plugged into the wall all the time, or unplug the clippers when they&#x27;re full, you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> But they aren&#x27;t as light and cheap as I expected them to be.</li>
            <li> THE CLIPPERS ARE GREAT ON CUTTING MY GRAND- CHILDRENS HAIR .THEY</li>
            <li> I think we will be able to cut our boys hair now without having to worry about shattering their eardrums from the loud noise of my old clippers.</li>
            <li> so I believed they would be higher quality and more durable in the long run</li>
            <li> In the beginning, they did seem better to me as far as more precise cutting and more motor power.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a corded model of this clipper for a little over 10 years and have been very pleased.  </li>
            <li> The small trimmer that comes with this set does not come with any attachments and the overall build quality is not as nice as the plug-in versions (they feel light and cheap).</li>
            <li> well worth the money, highly recommend if you don&#x27;t want to spoil yourself with a matching set of Pearl 76&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> feel compelled to update this to reflect a positive customer support experience.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Another item on the positive side of the ledger.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was also pretty fast</li>
            <li> The clipper holds a charge for a long time and cuts even better than the corded Wahl it replaced.  </li>
            <li> Love the cordless feature and unit stays charged for a long time without having to recharge.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t want it in the first place</li>
            <li> Two more minor things... -</li>
            <li> They charged fast and I used them for the first time today.</li>
            <li> These cordless clippers are exactly what I wanted and they really do the job.</li>
            <li> It is more powerful and lasts longer than other battery powered units.</li>
            <li> Seems to hold a charge for a long time, before having to re-charge, and I love not having to deal with the cord anymore.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The small single-AA trimmer (for mustache and neck-line etc) works surprisingly well ...</li>
            <li> I had another Wahl clipper which served me very well for many years (and still works perfectly actually), but I really wanted cordless clippers, so I got the Lithium Ion.  </li>
            <li> The machine was not cutting smoothly and blocked continuously at certain parts of my head (for no apparent reason, I have no head implants and no head scars...</li>
            <li> The little trimmer is a pretty handy accessory too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to cut both of my boy&#x27;s hair, one right after the other, without having to charge it between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> By simply following the instructions that come with it I was able to give myself a great haircut in only a matter of a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> The smaller clipper is also amazingly powerful and cuts great, my only wish is that it was rechargeable, rather than 2 double A&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the most usable design, but this is very minor.</li>
            <li> cordless feature is WONDERFUL - really makes cutting everyone&#x27;s hair that much easier!&lt;br /&gt;Price was right for what we purchased.</li>
            <li> It is easy enough to do myself.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great - keeps the charge well and doesn&#x27;t take long to charge it from empty.</li>
            <li> (my hair grows back very quickly, so I need these on a weekly basis).</li>
            <li> I had doubts about durability, but it survived several drops without damage (take care when unzipping the travel case, the clipper falls out easily).  </li>
            <li> long lasting battery,, and,, good quality,,</li>
            <li> 45$ and comes with everything you&#x27;ve every needed to cut hair, trimmer seems strong, wahl is a solid company.</li>
            <li> the smaller trimmer - frankly the space between the teeth is too large, making it too easy to grab skin and draw blood.  </li>
            <li> In a perfect world they would offer the clippers by themselves, not bundled with the trimmer, and charge a little less.</li>
            <li> Bought it for the large clipper.</li>
            <li> I have had a large Wahl plug-in clipper for years.</li>
            <li> After about 20 charges the large units just stop working.</li>
            <li> It certainly doesn&#x27;t compare to my ancient Oster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought it, charged it, used it and the first haircut was great, did not pull hair, was smooth cutting, battery did not flinch.</li>
            <li> Not as great as I expected material seams cheap and small clipper requires AA batteries plus it dose not one with attachments, it also doesnt cut as close as my 15yo wired wahl</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool one only it has alittle loud sound.</li>
            <li> As Supercuts increased their buzz cut pricing to nearly the same price as a person with a full head of hair I began to see the light.</li>
            <li> as good or better than my corded unit, but eliminating the cord makes cutting SO much easier!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The case needs more pockets for all the loose pieces.</li>
            <li> typically buzz my hair in the bathtub to make clean up easy.  </li>
            <li> The color pro set lasted much longer than the first Wahl set did, which was about 2 1/2 years before I finally decided to stop being cheap and invest in the Oster Fast Feed set.  </li>
            <li> I gave it 5 stars because it works perfectly fine but had I known that I could have purchased the same set of clippers at Target/Walmart...</li>
            <li> The larger hair flipper is fine.</li>
            <li> She uses the smaller included clippers around my ears and to fine tune by my neck.</li>
            <li> As far as the oil provided not being adequate Amazon has a bottle that will last years for $3 that also qualifies for free shipping if combined with the order .</li>
            <li> They are pretty decent for the price point.</li>
            <li> Higher speed than my older plug-in clippers.</li>
            <li> Been using both of these for two years and recommend very highly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The little trimmer is handy too for sideburns.</li>
            <li> Looks great except a little short.</li>
            <li> still on the original AA battery after several uses and seems just as strong as firstuse, so my guess is the battery will last quite some time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan and would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> The big pair of clippers is light, charges fast, and is the LOUDEST pair of clippers i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This Li-ion powered clipper is simply lightweight and having hoisted heavy corded Wahl clippers over my head for years, I welcome both the lightness and battery power.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the whole set just feels set</li>
            <li> It´s work very well.</li>
            <li> I really like the cape though.</li>
            <li> Very well made.</li>
            <li> Charges fast</li>
            <li> This makes it so much easier.</li>
            <li> and it was ready to go</li>
            <li> They come with all types of sizes that you really need to care hair.</li>
            <li> I  really like these clippers</li>
            <li> I charged the Clippe&#x27;s  Lithium battery and it worked very well..</li>
            <li> , I just won&#x27;t use it again; don&#x27;t really need them anyway</li>
            <li> These cut very well.</li>
            <li> really well made clippers and trimmers...</li>
            <li> I also should have read more carefully</li>
            <li> I primarily needed these to cut my kids hair and occasionally mine.  </li>
            <li> , the oil and brush on this thing are tiny and cheap like toys.</li>
            <li> These and the cape made the whole set feel</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall expected more for my money.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is powered by two AA batteries, so not so much.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the return Amazon.</li>
            <li> I just got a transformer for a couple of dollars and ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my wife can now buzz through the job like a pro and make me look like I&#x27;m always ready for the Gandy Dancers Ball.</li>
            <li> Very satisfy.</li>
            <li> it seems to give me a much smoother cut and no cord to wrap around your neck.</li>
            <li> even though kept oiled looks  like it is slightly starting to corrode,  cheap metal, no metal coating or whatever.</li>
            <li> Never use the extra cheap trimmer that comes with it.  </li>
            <li> He couldn&#x27;t believe how fast I got done &amp; that there was no fussing with a cord.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s cheap with 2 short ties to close.</li>
            <li> He loves it and says it shaves very close,  which is what he prefers.  </li>
            <li> The cape was cheap but protected from a majority of the hair, I bought a replacement to actually keep hair off the clothes.</li>
            <li> Just as powerful as my old Wahl clippers</li>
            <li> Very well made and sturdy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is everything I expected and more.</li>
            <li> I cut a lot of hair and they stay charged really well.</li>
            <li> and it works very well.</li>
            <li> but it is really infrequent</li>
            <li> Is fast to charge the battery.</li>
            <li> really like this clipper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s just what he needed and wahl is the brand he really likes.</li>
            <li> All I can say is it will make haircut so much easier.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> My husbands been using this since christmas and it works really well.  </li>
            <li> I really like the clipper.</li>
            <li> I have a beard and this would have been very helpful.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, no problems.</li>
            <li> hahaha..</li>
            <li> really wish Wahl had put a battery level on the unit so you could tell that it needs a charge before you start.</li>
            <li> He really likes the quality of this clipper.</li>
            <li> It does a very close clip and he likes the convenience of the the cordless.</li>
            <li> it cause the blade starts to tug on the hair if you go fast.</li>
            <li> It makes it so much easier for me to give him a hair cut, because we can go out on our porch and don&#x27;t have to worry about the hair getting all over inside the house.  </li>
            <li> It was shipped so fast</li>
            <li> Seems very well-made.  </li>
            <li> so the problem could have happened as much as two months ago</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say much about battery life and charging, except that in my usage I&#x27;ve had no problems.  </li>
            <li> And I always leave the clippers plugged in and charging when I&#x27;m not using it (according to the manual, it can&#x27;t overcharge, which is a very convenient feature).  </li>
            <li> Reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Very manual.  </li>
            <li> Charges fast and runs for plenty of time on a charge.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They work very well</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think I was going to get something</li>
            <li> Still wasn&#x27;t ready to drop the bucks.  </li>
            <li> the blade adjustment on the side feels very flimsy, something I wouldn&#x27;t expect from Wahl, and it can get caught on the case seam making you think you&#x27;ve adjusted it all the way forward when in fact it is not.  </li>
            <li> A case to organize the clipper guides would be very helpful as well....</li>
            <li> Five star for quality and function.&lt;br /&gt;blade seems very durable.&lt;br /&gt;battery</li>
            <li> Bought this to use on finer haired clients at work and it really hasnt made my job any easier.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not so much.  </li>
            <li> And it is very convenient being cordless as well.</li>
            <li> Love Wahl but were some drawbacks to switching from corded clippers as expected.  </li>
            <li> I tried another cheaper brand because I like their cordless shavers, but their cordless clipper did&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> Works really well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d gladly pay another $10-20 for something constructed more solidly, with the feel of the mains powered clippers, especially if it means they&#x27;ll last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have not used that much.</li>
            <li> Everything did not fit back as precisely as it did before and that effectively ruined a $60 clipper.  </li>
            <li> If they stop working tomorrow I would absolutely by another pair.</li>
            <li> Works better than expected.  </li>
            <li> This of course is very annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thankfully buzz cuts are in style not that I ever cared that much about being in style .</li>
            <li> I find cutting the hair then jumping in the shower the best way to go .</li>
            <li> Thankfully buzz cuts are in style not that I ever cared that much about being in style .</li>
            <li> I find cutting the hair then jumping in the shower the best way to go .</li>
            <li> devices feel very sturdy and well built.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So much for product development.</li>
            <li> I chose not to return it bacause it is too much of a hassle.</li>
            <li> Has to be plugged in the whole hair cut or it  </li>
            <li> My family said me thanks  for your purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Every</li>
            <li> This really works well.  </li>
            <li> The smaller clipper from the set didn&#x27;t come with attachments but a call to Wahl, and I was sent a set free of charge.</li>
            <li> Clipper seems to be very sturdy, not an el cheapo..</li>
            <li> , cordless is very convenient</li>
            <li> Free from the cord at last!</li>
            <li> Should have purchased this much sooner</li>
            <li> I really wanted to go cordless, but had some reservations about battery life and power.  </li>
            <li> The Li-Ion battery performs very well.  </li>
            <li> Fast.</li>
            <li> Very well and generously equipped.  </li>
            <li> It is very convenient for traveling.</li>
            <li> Absolute garbage.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bother me that much</li>
            <li> That close a cut requires a stylist to have care and finesse on any gentle skin on the scalp.  </li>
            <li> Well made and very convienant!Wish</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I really like the cordless feature</li>
            <li> clipper is very loud…</li>
            <li> Again, the cordless touch makes it so much easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use that one as much, but have had no issues and no complaints with performance on either.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The mini clipper works REALLY well.</li>
            <li> While this is battery powered, it has come in quite handy for trimming not only kids hair but also facial hair.  </li>
            <li> Third clipper I&#x27;ve  owned and by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I am nearly bald with nothing on top and some hair on sides and back of my head.  </li>
            <li> I contacted Wahl and I sent it back at my cost of shipping for repair and it was supposedly fixed but still does not hold a charge more then 90 seconds.</li>
            <li> So far I have used it once to trim my thick goatee, using the adjustable guide and it did a great job.</li>
            <li> some corded trimmer works better than this (in similar price range) but the convinience of cordless is far outweighted.</li>
            <li> comes in a nice zippered bag with a complete set of clipper heads from size 1/2 (1,5 mm) to size 8 (24,5 mm &#x3D; 1 inch), sharp scissors, ear-guide, and even a synthetic-fiber covering for the body to waer while clipping beard.</li>
            <li> This is definitely an amateur barber&#x27;s kit — it&#x27;s got everything you&#x27;ll need to give kids awesome bowl cuts, but sadly really is a little too much for my needs.</li>
            <li> The two sizes are nice for general cutting a more detailed work around the neckline and ears.</li>
            <li> Every other lithium ion powered device I have (phone, camera, etc) would still be charged after 2 weeks of not being used but this thing can&#x27;t hold a charge for more than a day or two.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a clipper before, but this one with the multiple heads and small daily trimmer works perfectly for my needs.</li>
            <li> Like the smaller charger and cool blue light indicator.</li>
            <li> Better than expected !</li>
            <li> , I have plugged it in for a full charge and cut my own hair once a week, and another person&#x27;s hair twice in two months before needing to plug them back in for a charge, and even then they weren&#x27;t completely dead.  </li>
            <li> I had let my hair go a little longer than I normally would have liked</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll have the charging problems other&#x27;s have commented on, but I charged them for a day when I got them 6 months ago, cut his hair 3 times since then &amp; they&#x27;re going as strong now as they did the first use.</li>
            <li> It charges very quickly and holds the charge for a very long time.</li>
            <li> We keep the clipper charged and we clean and oil it regularly.  </li>
            <li> have to admit, I was skeptical at first, but these clippers are great.</li>
            <li> This one cuts clean everytime and hair cuts only take minutes.</li>
            <li> The clipper stays charged so long, that I can do his hair, beard, mustache and still has enough charge to trim my own hair.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is horribly loud, but doesn&#x27;t cut close enough, or cleanly enough, to be more useful than the trimmer built into my Norelco razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Later a full charge would last 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> It came with a very basic cutting guide that was nice and holds a good charge.</li>
            <li> because in the end the clipper is only as good if it actually charges,holds that charge and actually works so spare the customers</li>
            <li> Though it has enough juice to get the job done, I can tell the power difference from a full charge.</li>
            <li> Wahl seems to make great quality clippers that last for a long long time.  </li>
            <li> The small trimmers kind of suck though.</li>
            <li> The extra set to line up is cool and works</li>
            <li> So far it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, my first cut turned out decent, but it will require some adaptive technique to do justice to old faithful.</li>
            <li> The taper lever on this one is much more stiff (a pleasant surprise), but the ridiculous power button they put on it is a bit of a hassle.</li>
            <li> Longer charges, new tech!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m now in the market for new clippers, thanks Wahl.</li>
            <li> Cutting my own hair was quick and painless unlike my old cheap set.</li>
            <li> They feel like they could be more substantial and be less pointed.</li>
            <li> Not only does this work better, it also comes with a larger selection of guides.</li>
            <li> Up until now i was  using an older wahl clipper.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Wahls, though, with decent quality.</li>
            <li> I have owned these for a few months now and after many uses they are working out very well.</li>
            <li> 79600-2101 CLIPPER to replace an older WAHL corded model.  </li>
            <li> Decently priced and power clippers.</li>
            <li> but they missed the boat on these particular set of clippers.</li>
            <li> so after I&#x27;ve cut my hair it steadily discharges.  </li>
            <li> I bought this primarily for the Lithium Ion battery given that my prior Wahl harit clippers were NiCad and 15+ years old</li>
            <li> I have several thinning spots on back of my head and it seemed to make these areas more pronounced since it cut some</li>
            <li> Large wall works right after a short charge.</li>
            <li> Like I said it cuts and has the power of my older pro clippers, but those are 3-4 times the cost.</li>
            <li> a side note, I would rather they have been absolutely bold type up front about the smaller clipper not being Lithium Ion and they should have a nose hair trimmer attachment for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blades don&#x27;t cut as close to the skin as my older Wahl clippers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the main cutter a number of times.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my husband&#x27;s older set - he loves this set and swears by it.</li>
            <li> The blade is replaceable but it is an extraordinary pain to put back on.</li>
            <li> The blade is replaceable but it is an extraordinary pain to put back on.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair short and always ask to use clippers on the back and sides but cut the top with scissors.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave the Wahl Ion cordless clippers a 4-star rating was because of mainly the battery issue.  </li>
            <li> The reason I gave the Wahl Ion cordless clippers a 4-star rating was because of mainly the battery issue.  </li>
            <li> Decent for the price.</li>
            <li> Have only used it twice so far, but seems maintenance free.</li>
            <li> However, the main clippers are a stronger plastic and feel sturdy in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend them.</li>
            <li> The cordless feature was the main draw.</li>
            <li> Would have given this 5 star only if the smaller shaver was better.</li>
            <li> Also it is very powerful compared to my last non professional corded version.</li>
            <li> Clipper is light and portable, but it also has a loose and cheap plastic feel to it, the front cover is loose and vibrating, thats why i gave it a 3 star rating.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts for many times of use (in fact I&#x27;ve never seen my battery run down because so far I&#x27;ve always recharged it after using 5 or 6 times, but I suspect it lasts much longer).&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s appears to be high quality compared to the otehr brands and models I researched.</li>
            <li> , high quality proffessional feel that the corded Wahls provide, and I wasn&#x27;t dissappointed.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> We highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I think they cut corners on the materials to counter the high cost of the batteries.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Recently I moved and got rid of my old clippers and picked up a cheap one in my new town.  </li>
            <li> This unit stays cooler, vibrates far less, and is easy to use!  </li>
            <li> My hair is originally just soft and sort of curly, but as it gets longer the curls get naturally bigger and my hair somehow gets even softer.</li>
            <li> This is our second cordless, but is far superior to the previous one we had.</li>
            <li> So far the battery on the large clipper seems to hold up well.</li>
            <li> You have to consciously move the lever a certain way so that it doesn&#x27;t catch on the body.  </li>
            <li> Came earlier than promised and exactly as described!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad my little guy will sit still for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems louder than my other wahl (110v).&lt;br /&gt;The blades arent easily removable for cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lots of clip on&#x27;s make fades easy and sharp.  </li>
            <li> It is easy removing the blade, but it is not putting the blade back on because both blade pieces must be put on back at the exact same time in the exact  same angle so that you can then HOVER THEM AT THE EXACT SAME TIME AND ANGLE TO BE ABLE TO SCREW THE BLADE PIECES BACK ON.</li>

            <li> It is a bit large and heavy - we are used to the smaller clippers, but these are built great and the battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> They also sent me a new different looking charger in addition to my old original charger.</li>
            <li> I threw them away and used my guides from the early 90&#x27;s instead which were a much thicker</li>
            <li> Most of the weight is in the head/clipper area, not the handle, so it ends up feeling top heavy and not entirely secure in the hand.  </li>
            <li> It is MUCH lighter than my old model.</li>
            <li> So much easier to use than my old corded Wahl clipper.</li>
            <li> Works very well so far.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- comes with small mineral oil bottle, this does need to be oiled regularly to prevent rusting and good function</li>
            <li> kit comes with everything you need, including cleaning oil and normal hair scissors (in addition to the two pictured cordless clippers).</li>
            <li> Would have been good to have some different sized plastic guides for the small clipper.</li>
            <li> The 2nd small clipper makes a good mustache clipper.</li>
            <li> but it has a lasting and powerful battery.  </li>
            <li> This Wahl is powerful and dynamic.</li>
            <li> After raising and lowering the blade height a few more times, I got it to settle right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With this not only do I save money I can have a fresh cut as often as I take the time .</li>
            <li> With this not only do I save money I can have a fresh cut as often as I take the time .</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend Wahl to improve this clipper by using a much better very long lasting charging battery in it and for a cord to be allowed to be used with it when the  battery doesn&#x27;t work!!!</li>
            <li> and I doubt there are for guys who are lucky enough not to be as far as I am on the way to Baldsville.</li>
            <li> I can get several haircuts and many beard trimmings out of a single charge.  </li>
            <li> After spending hours trying to figure out the right clipper on Amazon, I finally made the jump and got this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just used it for the first time for my sons (with a thick hair)&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s very comfortable, easy to handle, a lot of clips, and long lasting Battery.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a long time , and charges quickly.</li>
            <li> The machine feels smooth when cutting and is as powerful as a corded machine, my son also commented how much he likes the way it cuts and that it felt comfortable.</li>
            <li> The clipper looks solid and works fine with 220V not only 110V&lt;</li>
            <li> About every three months I kneel down over dry  bathtub and use #2 size adaptor and go to town, nice and short, then ear trimming adaptors and pretty much all done</li>
            <li> Knives with sharp shear machine smoothly without jerking.</li>
            <li> the clipper is the best clipper i ever owned.. out of the box the battery lasted long as i needed.. sadly the trimmer is complete trash.. uses one AA battery...</li>
            <li> I returned it for a new one.</li>
            <li> Wahl has re-gained my confidence as I received in the mail a new set of clippers to replace the ones I threw out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This new design does not permit removing the head.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Anyways, as you can see I&#x27;m sort of new to the &#x27;Amazonia&#x27; rage.</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers 2 years ago and they still work like new.</li>
            <li> Wahl apologized for the inconvenience, said I was covered under the 5 year warranty, and rush sent me a new clipper set.</li>
            <li> Bought this a year ago and still works like new.  </li>
            <li> I shave my head 2 or 3 times a week and after 2 years they cut like they are brand new.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying a new cordless Wahl trimmer set and don&#x27;t even use the one that came with this set.</li>
            <li> Used it for a couple of months and it works like brand new, no pulling at all.</li>
            <li> I would have attempted to exchange them for the new ones I had ordered, but knowing the expense of postage today</li>
            <li> /&gt;The trimmers were surprisingly powerful for only using 1 AA battery, they were loud but who cares, I can live with the noise.  </li>
            <li> The replacement battery costs almost as much as the device (note that these new ones use a 3.7V battery and not the more common 2.4V of predecessors).  </li>
            <li> I also have no use so far for the mini-me trimmer and wish I wasn&#x27;t compelled to pay for it to get the main unit.</li>
            <li> Instead of the traditional seesaw lever switch, they went with a cheap piece of rubber with a button deep underneath it somewhere</li>
            <li> When I plug the charger in, I hear the motor click and the blue light turn on for a second, but no charging appears to happen and it hasn&#x27;t turned on since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since the supplied oil will only last a dozen uses or so, you&#x27;ll want to pick some up.&lt;br /&gt;-Scissors: the scissors they supply with the kit are, understandable, cheap ...</li>
            <li> One earlier review said you couldn&#x27;t remove the blades for cleaning, but again this is is similar to my old corded one, and the blades are easily removed.</li>
            <li> They came with lots of extra attachments for adjusting the length of cut, but that wasn&#x27;t really important to me since I only use these to shave my head.  </li>
            <li> Now, in real life, it is not difficult to avoid this as long as you know it ahead of time, and I can tell you that it has not happened to me yet while my wife has been using it.</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;ll be more than satisfied with this when cutting hair unless your hair is like a bocage.</li>
            <li> These clippers are very powerful and sharp.</li>
            <li> I like the soft-sided bag it comes with (as opposed to the cheap plastic box you normally get).view down the road as to whether they hold up.  </li>
            <li> It worked fine for a while before it broke down.</li>
            <li> it is very loud when going around the ear  </li>
            <li> Totally user error but other Wahl clippers I&#x27;ve had before have not broken so easily.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m a pretty big guy</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m still using it from it&#x27;s first charge from two months ago only (using once a week for abouot 14 minutes) couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
            <li> Cordless option is so much better, no more getting strangled with cords.</li>
            <li> They work and it is a nice set, but no good for me</li>
            <li> So, I put in a higher capacity cell with the same output, and it worked again.  </li>
            <li> I charge lipo&#x27;s in a old crockpot !  </li>
            <li> They have given us a stellar level of customer support and I will again buy any product made by Wahl and I suggest the same to anyone reading this post!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> I would have thought this product was better, but if you are looking for an extremely close shave, then I would stick to the regular wahl or remington trimmer...</li>
            <li> and I use them on my 3 year old son too!</li>
            <li> this is my second set, first one the interior charging plug broke inside so could recharge the unit, checked the website to see if I could find a replacement part.......NL.</li>
            <li> No more unwelcomed strangling attempts by the dang cord when getting creative shaving the bank of your head.</li>
            <li> I would go back to a corded trimmer that is made of higher quality.</li>
            <li> The big razor is perfect, nothing has gone wrong at all!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed having the small machine because it helps to make the details when you&#x27;re almost finished.</li>
            <li> This is the second pair if these I have owned and the first pair lasted 3 yrs.  </li>
            <li> but one friend is exactly the opposite.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and pretty quiet.</li>
            <li> I cut my hair for the first time and got the very same haircut a barber could give !</li>
            <li> The first time I adjusted the blades short, the length I buzz my hair too</li>
            <li> Powerful clipper that are convenient and have a long battery life.</li>
            <li> EXACT same issues.</li>
            <li> Professional results from this clipper!  </li>
            <li> and I use it no more than 2 times a week for shaping mostly.</li>
            <li> But far from it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to purchase the Wireless clippers for that same reason, but these things have been stellar.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this clipper once a week for over six months for about 10 minute at a stretch on the initial charge I put on it when I first took it out of the box</li>
            <li> will cut skin if not careful, but shaves very close</li>
            <li> Wow !</li>
            <li> My corded Wahl never needed the second pass because it got all the hairs the first time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These clippers amazed me, they went through his thick fine hair like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li> They hold a nice long charge and we&#x27;ve been getting 2, 15 min haircuts out of them every single time with plenty of charge left over.</li>
            <li> This is an annoyance, especially since Walh tells you this is special oil and don&#x27;t use a different oil.  </li>
            <li> I got these the other day, because my old ones finally crapped out on me, and I&#x27;m glad I got these.</li>
            <li> The clipper is not excellent, but good enough to keep around, though I&#x27;m starting to have second thoughts because without good guide combs the machine becomes limited in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ditch the old corded clippers and join the new age of cordless.</li>
            <li> the only think i didnt like is the fact that the item looked as if it was used for very long period, everything else is fine</li>
            <li> They do an excellent job cutting my hair and the batteries hold their charge for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is easy to handle and cuts the hair without missing any places.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair (there I said it) and do a hell of a job if I say so myself, and for the past 8 yrs I used the same trusty set of Wahl clippers to do it without incident.</li>
            <li> Ok for use, but the small one sounds too loud.</li>
            <li> I already had a small lithium ion Wahl trimmer and really liked it, so I decided to purchase the larger cordless clipper via Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Used the smaller clipper for a travel head full head buzz, but not nearly as smooth and easy as the big guy.</li>
            <li> On a full charge it can last for weeks and multiple usage sessions!</li>
            <li> Was skeptical at first based on the negative reviews, but out of the box the trimmer was superb.</li>
            <li> The package itself is good with the second smaller machine, the bag and the rest of the things, but I am not pleased.</li>
            <li> When you open the case, all the&lt;br /&gt;pieces can fall out easily if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li> I would expect it to last more than a year and a half if the parts are not replaceable.</li>
            <li> The power button on the main large clipper is very difficult to activate, one must literally push the button into the body of the clipper to turn it on or off which is odd as the smaller clipper has a very nice, easy to use slide on/off switch.</li>
            <li> This product is so lightweight compared to other clippers that the first time I used it my hand slipped and cut too much off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d generally recommend this brand, but not this particular model.</li>
            <li> It is a bit loud but that&#x27;s not bad compared to other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> Single passes took his hair to the right length</li>
            <li> You certainly get every possible accessory with this set guides galore, scissors, hair clips, apron.</li>
            <li> trimmer (that runs on one AA-cell) ... and about as many clip-ons for the little trimmer as for the clipper (way mre than you&#x27;ll likely ever need.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to leave my clippers charging all the time, but in my current living situation it has become a little more of a nuisance to do so.</li>
            <li> wish it were a little bit more quite, but that would probably put it in a different price bracket.</li>
            <li> and as it cut hair decent enough while it worked, I bought a new one from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I bought this cordless clipper as an early Christmas present for my husband and he absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> This clipper is clearly intended for hair like mine.</li>
            <li> That $18 plus dollars I spent at Supercuts every 2-3 weeks now can be better spent elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> recommend it for the budget conscious buyer.</li>
            <li> This clipper pales in comparison to my 5 year old panasonic.  </li>
            <li> (old ones are in a plastic grocery bag)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s one I use frequently.</li>
            <li> Did not work as well as my old one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel professional at all using these.</li>
            <li> I guess it could work but don&#x27;t buy this if your a professional hairstylist or barber.</li>
            <li> so I cannot comment on exactly how long it lasts.  </li>
            <li> Nearly everytime</li>
            <li> I had this marked as 5 stars because it was everything I had hoped for,</li>
            <li> I was happily surprised with this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Clippers are a bit loud</li>
            <li> definatley not recommended for any stylist professional.</li>
            <li> He has been using it to trim his hair, thus saving the monthly barber cost, moreover he is also using it to trim his 3 year old sons hair.</li>
            <li> I finally have the freedom to position it as needed without worrying about the cord, and this has just as much power.  </li>
            <li> Put it on the charger overnight after cut so ready to go for cut next week</li>
            <li> So far I have had the kit for nearly 3 months</li>
            <li> That said, on th eold clipper I used a professional serwing machine service oil and never had any problem.  </li>
            <li> I bought these for my wife who is a professional cosmetologist.  </li>
            <li> These clippers really get the job done, and the lithium ion battery means she can cut all our hair and still have plenty of charge left in the battery.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;bad:&lt;br /&gt;they are loud</li>
            <li> Two young boys hair to cut.</li>
            <li> OLD REVIEW:</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Charging cord does not fit securely into the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> they cut my hair like butter not to loud</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I replaced my old machine with this newer battery operated one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cuts smoother and faster than my old clipper.</li>
            <li> I got these clippers to replace an old pair of corded ones.</li>
            <li> So far, it is doing its job well and have not had any issues with functionality, so I am upping it to 3 stars.  </li>
            <li> (so far).</li>
            <li> The corded clippers sound like a faint electric whir, while the wireless clippers sound like a loud mechanical buzz.</li>
            <li> Everything seems to be working well so far, but I&#x27;m waiting to see if the clipper stands the test of time like the one it</li>
            <li> It is loud</li>
            <li> Used once so far.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a bit loud..</li>
            <li> It also came with a 1st class zippered carrying case with slots of scissors (and a pair of scissors) and accessories, which is a classy feature.</li>
            <li> We like this kit so much that we actually bought another one as a gift.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at a local Walmart for a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> I have to say WOW.  </li>
            <li> i charged it up completely once when i received it and haven&#x27;t had to charge it since (about 6 20 minute sessions).</li>
            <li> Both are loud, but cut well.</li>
            <li> I have used the old barber-style plug-in Wahl that was designed and built in the USA and it has never had any of these problems.</li>
            <li> The larger set of Clippers comes with a whole attachment kit with all the need neccesities when motivating yourself to some trimming and beard up keep....</li>
            <li> So far they have worked well.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cut as well as my old one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still working a 10+ year old Wahl beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> No issues so far.</li>
            <li> but so far I haven&#x27;t used it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s also really loud.  </li>
            <li> no need to have the teeth so far apart.  </li>
            <li> If you wanted to shave your head bald these would not be close enough but they would get you ready for a Bic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He has been shaving his head for years with the old Wahl.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was very pleasantly surprised to get the response from a Wahl representative which can be seen in the comments section of my review.  </li>
            <li> My 22 year old son asked for these specifically.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it for myself, but however the user did inform me that it is a bit loud.  </li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> clipper is much the same.</li>
            <li> --so far I&#x27;ve had yet to need to recharge them;</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have to set near an outlet anymore.</li>
            <li> I have no complain so far and charges</li>
            <li> charge doesn&#x27;t last more than few days after 4 months of use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll rinse my hair with water, then I have to go back over it a few more times with the clippers to get all the hairs.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately could not charge in the good old USA.</li>
            <li> When the package arrived on time I was not surprised that it contains the clipper unit I ordered, but it was nice to also find the small clipper unit.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Blades cut through thick hair like it&#x27;s butter - much better than the Philips Norelco</li>
            <li> the trimmer isn&#x27;t very sharp but the price is right for a cordless clipper!</li>
            <li> This comes with a strong motor that lasts long enough to clip the hair of your entire head.</li>
            <li> A quick 15 min charge lasts long enough for me to cut my hair as far as a buzz cut.</li>
            <li> I decided to go short on my hair so rather than spend $25 to get a buzz cut every few weeks decided to try this - very nicely built, lots of clipping attachments, and I can touch my hair up every two weeks or so in just a few minutes with no problems.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d have to go through a hassle of getting a replacement and wouldn&#x27;t be able to cut my hair in the mean time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They did nothing to resolve the issue as other companies would do so with that being said I most likely will not be a Wahl customer in the future.</li>
            <li> It comes with a wide assortment of attachments that aid in getting the right length and look.  </li>
            <li> Some other clippers are a bit cheaper, but so far these are worth the money.</li>
            <li> The charge also lasts better than expected (as noted by other reviewers as well).  </li>
            <li> The power is strong for my usual number 1 cut.  </li>
            <li> clipper is very sensitive where if you are not careful it will pull you skin in and cut you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mini</li>
            <li> which was fine because I was usually done or nearly so.</li>
            <li> They also did chafe a little bit but compared to using my old full size clippers for touch ups</li>
            <li> I always had problems trying to work around the cord while cutting my own hair with the previous clipper, and having to stop &amp; unplug to untangle a knot in the cord...but didn&#x27;t know any better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this a short time and it&#x27;s my first</li>
            <li> This is my second Wahl Cordless and the first one last (5) years with weekly use.</li>
            <li> The clipper is powerful and has a long lasting battery.</li>
            <li> The battery I used is exactly the same (brand and size) as one I use daily in a high-power flashlight; the flashlight gets recharged about once every three days and has lasted for over 2 years with virtually no decline in performance</li>
            <li> I sent my first one back several months ago and they were replaced no questions asked.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Chances are I&#x27;ll just throw this one in the garbage too as even if I went through the hassle of getting a replacement, I don&#x27;t have faith that a 3rd will last any longer than the first 2.</li>
            <li> I had to face to the facts, I&#x27;m getting older and the 60&#x27;s are not coming back.</li>
            <li> This is my second pair of these (I left the first in a hotel).  </li>
            <li> So if you are worried about having to make sacrifices for the cordless convenience, the only sacrifice may be a higher purchase price relative to a corded unit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been looking for about a year for a decent cordless clipper and finally settled on this one.  </li>
            <li> Being spoiled by our society I could certainly look for some downsides of this product, but I have not had a single problem with this tool so far</li>
            <li> Not saying any other brand is either just that now days for quality you just have to spend too much money for a decent par of clippers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;would definitely recommend highly and buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After charging, and unplugging, the blue charging indicator light remains lit, a constant solid blue glow.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Being cordless allows me to go into my yard and do a quick buzz cut or trim and leave the mess on the grass.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The rechargeable is much sturdier, but I&#x27;ve noticed I have to be a little more careful with this trimmer than my first one as I&#x27;ve had a few cuts when running it without the guard.  </li>
            <li> lithium lasts long and holds charge very well</li>
            <li> /&gt;- small trimmer i haven&#x27;t used yet as my norelco still works fantastic</li>
            <li> Charges fast and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> ; which is the primary reason to go li-ion over nicad/nimh  - small charger  </li>
            <li> The other nice part is the small trimmer that comes with it.  </li>
            <li> The four stars is only because there is no real easy way to put the various pieces in order to make them easy to find.  </li>
            <li> The only gripe I have was that the chrome handle of the large clipper was all scratched up making it look second hand</li>
            <li> It was not easy to make a call based on others&#x27; reviews, and more so given that during the process, I became all paranoid about some of the reviewers vested interests in placing either a bad review or a good review...</li>
            <li> If all else fails read the directions.&lt;br /&gt;It is a quick charge, the charge lasts for a couple of long haircuts (I have not had the occasion to do more than two cuts).  </li>
            <li> I was contacted by manufacturer and they sent me a brand new unit and a return label to ship the defective one back.</li>
            <li> so when I saw a commercial for their new Lithium Ion cordless clipper.</li>
            <li> after several weeks of use are still working like new.</li>
            <li> the blue light does not light either.  </li>
            <li> Battery is strong on my thick hair.</li>
            <li> (major design flaw) on this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now 8 months later and my second one has now died with the same exact problem and will not charge.</li>
            <li> Other than that they do cut pretty well.</li>
            <li> This is the second time buying these clippers and the only reason I&#x27;m buying a second one is because I dropped the first one and broke the tines.</li>
            <li> no other reviews mentioned is the charger will not over charge the battery</li>
            <li> I replaced a cordless clipper that just wouldnt keep a charge, or actually seemed to be low charge and always forced me to plug it in to get full RPMs, which made me wonder why it was even cordless in the first place.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to clean up a messy hairy sink!</li>
            <li> Most other brands round the edges</li>
            <li> (we have purchased the two clipper kit three times since 2009 and the small clippers are all still working fine); however, the large clipper has had to be replaced every 28 months on average.  </li>
            <li> A tough decision for me since I know I cut my hair better than any barber out there</li>
            <li> Accessories are good just a little hard to swap out the different attachments.  </li>
            <li> Wahl went above and beyond to fix this for me, and I truly appreciate the high standard of their customer service.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery last for months and the overall build is high quality.</li>
            <li> The big (re-chargeable) clippers are pretty good but the little AA powered clippers failed within a week of purchase.</li>
            <li> The cordless feature is the best, no longer trapped in the same place cutting my hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect that I would use the smaller clippers, but have found myself using them nearly every day to trim my beard.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it a hole lot yet (about 3 hair cuts), so only time will tell how durable it is, but so far there is no flaw.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lithium battery made plenty of power for a solid 20 min. cut, but they don&#x27;t seem to cut as close as my old ones.</li>
            <li> so i dont have to raise the blade with a #1 guard and worry about i moving back to the shorter cut like my old ones.  </li>
            <li> and that was only minute compared to the old clippers</li>
            <li> They barely trim the hair around the neck...</li>
            <li> do volunteer services for the old folks (who are actually quite demanding.</li>
            <li> I used to have a heavy duty corded, then switched to the light norelco trimmer for cutting my own hair.</li>
            <li> Used only once so far.</li>
            <li> After giving it about 5 minutes I went back to my old trusty corded Wahl clippers.</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers to replace an old set of Wahl clippers that finally bit the dust.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that some of the higher numbered gaurds are harder to fit on there.</li>
            <li> Once I saw this item posted on amazon for $46.00 I had to have it and with no regrets at all.</li>
            <li> The attachment combs for the Fast Feeds were very expensive and they didn&#x27;t fit exactly as the Wahl combs do for their trimmers.  </li>
            <li> The attachment combs for the Fast Feeds were very expensive and they didn&#x27;t fit exactly as the Wahl combs do for their trimmers.  </li>
            <li> but NO REGRETS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m barely stressing the battery using it for 8 minutes once a week.</li>
            <li> This clpper provides the same power and quality that my 10 year old corded Wahl clipper does.</li>
            <li> The trimmer that comes with it uses regular batteries and is loud.</li>
            <li> This thing has power equal to my old corded  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of weeks and have no issues so far, I only charged it once</li>
            <li> only issue is how loud they are.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Wahl corded clippers for years, my last set being a professional set I purchased through a beauty supply.  </li>
            <li> Though it was a roughly the same price, the Andis quality is much higher.</li>
            <li> a full charge only lasts for few days, maybe 4-5 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Skip the expensive salon and cut your own hair.</li>
            <li> I did notice that there&#x27;s a little circuit board right on the battery in the clippers...</li>
            <li> Only drawback to Li Ion is that onc eit runs out of charge it happens quickly ...with little warning.  </li>
            <li> Used this for my beard, thought i&#x27;d be able to trim it down within 2 or 3 passes but it took a few tried.  </li>
            <li> I really love the cordless not cord tangling feature of this item and doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as the classic Wahl hair electric corded clipper that I have used in the past and which I still have this classic clipper-this cordless clipper has plenty of power for me to cut my bushy thick hair into a short military style #2 cut; nevertheless, I have had to send this cordless clipper back to Wahl for lithium battery replacement (lithium battery repair 5 year guarantee at no charge including parts and labor) in May 2013 because it stopped charging.  </li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re traveling on the road / to a new country for several months and don&#x27;t want to fuss with adapter/transformers (it will last you</li>
            <li> The only downside would be the actual bag these live in</li>
            <li> Very convenient to use and the battery last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, powerful, and allows me to give myself a haircut in less than 5 minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only used a few times but charge seems to hold adequately as well.</li>
            <li> Also, the plastic handle area did not fit together right.</li>
            <li> …I never had problems with my other clippers blades rusting before,  especially after just the first use…and, I used the clipper on &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; hair.  </li>
            <li> no use for the smaller unit as not very heavy duty but didn&#x27;t buy it for that.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the product I was a little skeptical seeing its cordless</li>
            <li> He has tried other cordless models over the years, and been very dissatisfied...</li>
            <li> I chose this product based on positive reviews and I was not let down.  </li>
            <li> Ion makes the cordless worth it and the quality of the clipper set will last you a few years.</li>
            <li> Blades not sharp enough.</li>
            <li> The big clippers didn&#x27;t get a very close cut and the little on pulled the hairs from the soft part of my neck below the jaw bone.</li>
            <li> I had Wahl wired clippers for years and needed a new set due to the old one having not enough power and would sometimes snag thicker</li>
            <li> One long charge in the clippers, even through the squirming and sliding around in the chair, I have less of a problem, because, I have a powerful set of clippers with no cords to get tangled up in with all the movement</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally got a chance to use it the other day, and gave myself a high and tight on the first try.</li>
            <li> just feels cheap and not good quality</li>
            <li> Hardware is good to great, packaging is poor to terrible</li>
            <li> Great explicit instructions for cutting hair included!</li>
            <li> very well made and hi quality thing , but unfortunately didn&#x27;t work on 220V and didn&#x27;t fit to any European sockets .</li>
            <li> I think the old trimmer head lasted so long</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it will hold up long term, but so far, it meets my needs and expectations.</li>
            <li> The basic square shape of my old clippers was a lot easier to handle in several different grips.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just bought this clipper a few days ago and  used it for the first time this morning to shave my head bald.</li>
            <li> on and off, but that blue light now remains lit forever and always until it slowly drains the entire battery to a zero charge state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair and most other clippers have to go over a line of hair a few times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it would do more than that as I haven&#x27;t tested it, but it didn&#x27;t seem like it was slowing down at all after the second shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , both the clippers have not broken down and its been years.</li>
            <li> Being cordless is a major improvement over any of the above mentioned hair clippers simply put.  </li>
            <li> Being cordless is a major improvement over any of the above mentioned hair clippers simply put.  </li>
            <li> Other than that I do like the wireless ability it possesses and the cut is of decent quality when the unit is working as it should.</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for this battery charging failure and that a much better very long lasting charging battery was used instead of this failed one and and if it weren&#x27;t for that it not being able to use a cord with it when the battery doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much lighter than my previous clipper.</li>
            <li> Previous cordless hair clippers (Phillips in Europe) much easer to adjust by dialing in blade extension instead of manually switching between all those plastic clip sizes.  </li>
            <li> Further, even if I plug it in will not cut for any period of time as apparently charger does not deliver enough juice.</li>
            <li> At first my hubby thought this was too big and heavy to use as a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Supplied oil: a very small amount of special, non-gumming, head lubricating oil is provided.  </li>
            <li> Not only did the Fast Feeds become less powerful after taking them apart to clean, but it was damn near impossible to reassemble them back properly.  </li>
            <li> I bared a spot on the wires, neg and pos, away from each other so they can&#x27;t short, then connected to older triton lipo charger  with alligator clips for about 15 minutes or so.  </li>
            <li> Also, there are many clip attachments (even one for the eyebrows!), hair cutting instructions and an apron.  </li>
            <li> My old corded Wahl would vibrate my hands too much and got too hot, it was uncomfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> I sometimes cut his hard and I much prefer these to the corded clippers!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Combined with the *slightly* less power of the corded model,  the non-removeable head (really gets messy under the hood fast) and the proclivity to malfunction,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I just use a number one and go over my whole head , trim with the little one around the ears and shave the back of my neck because I have no talent</li>
            <li> I just use a number one and go over my whole head , trim with the little one around the ears and shave the back of my neck because I have no talent</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and go online and buy a good pair of barbers scissors if you plan to do any serious scissors cutting, then the ones from the kit can be used in teh workshop of for your kids class projects ;-)  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is since these clippers are so sharp they will cut you easily.</li>
            <li> I will list some good and bad things</li>
            <li> ear attachment not great, eyebrow attachment didn&#x27;t cut anything (could be a good thing, maybe my eyebrows aren&#x27;t bushy enought \\&quot;yet\\&quot; as my wife commented), difficult to fit all the attachments in the bag (not a big deal, just inconvenient), cape wasn&#x27;t huge</li>
            <li> After initial charge and use, i tried leaving it on for 15 min straight to see if it would loose power, but it hasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer is sharp for edges.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> So they sent me the small clippers back with fixed teeth (i.e. a new set).  </li>
            <li> The power button is a tad awkward but you can&#x27;t as easily trip a push button as a normal  slide bar switch found on corded clippers  which would run the battery out - obviously why designers used  this style .</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and these cut right through it without any resistance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The blade got loose and uneven after first use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave myself a high and tight without a mirror.</li>
            <li> It is also very light weight, so if your cutting your own hair your hands get less tired.</li>
            <li> Not sure how long the AA batteries will last as I haven&#x27;t used it very much.  </li>
            <li> The single battery barely drives the motor.</li>
            <li> Then two weeks later when I want a trim again the battery is flat.  </li>
            <li> One thing I definitely didn&#x27;t like was the on/off button of the bigger machine, I hope it endures for a long time but it seems fragile.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted 17 years and the other \\&quot;recent\\&quot; ones less than 3 years.</li>
            <li> The new unit is just slightly re-designed, so it would appear that something has been updated.  </li>
            <li> , one other feature the clippers desperately need is a low battery indicator (maybe an LED light or something) that lights up when you have around 30 minutes of use left (at least enough time for one more haircut).</li>
            <li> This would also work great if you have kids or have a small on the side job of cutting hair-</li>
            <li> but thats what you get with such a long lasting LI ION battery.</li>
            <li> The side lever allows you to clip at even finer (&lt; 1,5 mm) lengths as desired.&lt;br /&gt;The small secondary clipper seems OK</li>
            <li> The small battery operated clipper is ok for small trimming requirements, but is a little loud as some have noted.  </li>
            <li> I like the large clipper and the small clipper.</li>
            <li> Have been using for a month now and for me the small clippers pull my face hair and large clippers do not cut as close on my head.  </li>
            <li> Luckily they are tough enough to survive a fall or two.</li>
            <li> You have to press the on/off button pretty hard for the switch to click.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m very conscious about holding it tightly.  </li>
            <li> No more cord getting hung up on everything; lots of attachments and it cuts really well.</li>
            <li> The unit keeps its charge long enough for me to use for a couple cuts.  </li>
            <li> There has been no apparent decline in battery capacity.  </li>
            <li> The clippers cut well but get caught on the skin if they are not held totally flat on my head.</li>
            <li> The battery makes all the difference, it holds a charge a long time , and adds extra power to the clipper.</li>
            <li> the key will be how long this lasts as the battery is not customer serviced .</li>
            <li> the key will be how long this lasts as the battery is not customer serviced .</li>
            <li> To make a long story short, I have zero cons on this item.  </li>
            <li> small secondary trimmers is pretty much a joke, but that&#x27;s not why I bought this set.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i have pretty thick hair</li>
            <li> Just hoping now that I can get new blades, mine are dulling and beginning to tug a little.</li>
            <li> major disappointment is that I purchased these as new clippers, but it was obviously refurbished as the plastic casing had a large, red scratch across the back of them.  </li>
            <li> The only problem i have is its a little loud compared to my corded version</li>
            <li> I had &#x27;The other major brand&#x27; of clippers for years &amp; it always took around 45 minutes to give my grandson a buzz cut.</li>
            <li> When I got it the #1 attachment was missing, called Amazon they sent a new one for me, one day shipping at no charge.</li>
            <li> I trim my hair about once a week without fail, and this definitely has cost justified itself over that time frame.  </li>
            <li> And I expected it to be better than what I already had (laughable).</li>
            <li> I just kneel in front of my toilet and let the hair fall in it .</li>
            <li> I just kneel in front of my toilet and let the hair fall in it .</li>
            <li> BUT VERY LOUD AND HEAVY--</li>
            <li> The large clippers like to bite into flesh if they get the chance, the guides are sharp and harsh.</li>
            <li> then vacuum hair from dry tub</li>
            <li> It charges plenty fast, I just wish it came with a little mirror like other Wahl clipper sets.</li>
            <li> And the plastic guide combs are cheap thin junk compared to the old Wahl guides from the past.</li>
            <li> That particular Wahl set lasted about 1 year before I got tired of them getting increasingly louder and less consistent on the cut.  </li>
            <li> Company is willing to repair or replace while under warranty with no charge except shipping which personally, i think should&#x27;ve been covered as well due to total failure of the product.  </li>
            <li> The other issue I have with these is the charger plug and indicator light on the clipper, both poorly designed/constructed.</li>
            <li> I was also surprsed that I did not have to go over the same spot over and over, against and with the grain, only to find that I looked like I had the mange due to tufts of hair still remaining-</li>
            <li> I would suggest a little rubber band tail attached to the end to the clipper would help prevent it falling from your hand and the little detail trimmer to be rechargable as well, but over all it recharges fast -it takes maybe 4 hours- after that it last a lot</li>
            <li> I also decided I wanted to play role-play as the \\&quot;friendly local barber\\&quot; to my personal friends by cutting the different types of hair they had.</li>
            <li> This is hard to explain, but I shave my whole head to a No. 2 guard every two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After going over all my head with the No. 2 guard, there are still a bunch of stray hairs standing around.</li>
            <li> :) Now I&#x27;ve regained the zest I had for cutting my hair by myself.</li>
            <li> Plenty of accessories, even a bib and a couple of combs and useless cheap scissors.</li>
            <li> they dont make my hand go numb love them</li>
            <li> They put a note on the old charger saying not to use it anymore, so apparently that charger was at least partly to blame for the malfunction.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Out of the box my first impression was not good.  </li>
            <li> so i have the job of keeping his hair and beard trimmed all year long.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I should have gotten this one long ago.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts a long time, too.</li>
            <li> Guess I gave it too long.  </li>
            <li> any where because the battery lasts quite long.</li>
            <li> One minor thing, is it does feel &amp;#34;plasticy&amp;#34; but it performs like a champ.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s been almost two years since I bought these clippers, but for the frequency I use them, I really expected they would last longer.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> but art not very sturdy the blade on the big one</li>
            <li> The battery lasts long; I have not had it run out on me</li>
            <li> , it has a long charge, and does just what I need for trimming my son&#x27;s hair once a month.  </li>
            <li> Waste of nearly $60 bucks.</li>
            <li> To cut long hair use scissors.</li>
            <li> (not professionally)</li>
            <li> battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Bought this clipper set for a replacement for old set that was missing parts.</li>
            <li> The clippers hold a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> long - 20-30 minutes maybe.</li>
            <li> Why does my review have to be so dang long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wahl clippers for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> because it has plenty of power, and dispite what others have written, it is not loud at all, compared to others I have heard.</li>
            <li> that it is cordless, holds a long charge and clips  </li>
            <li> Long battery life.  </li>
            <li> The charge has a long shelf life without requiring recharge, probably in the order of months.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time a a charge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While they are not as heavily constructed as the professional models, these are quite sufficient for my needs.  </li>
            <li> works well and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> The cordless aspect of these clippers make them superior to all others, as you can trim/shave your head hair to perfection and not be bothered with the annoying cord, which always gets in the way.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s necessary to shift my grip on the clippers often to get the right angle, it becomes uncomfortable and cumbersome to do so with the shape really only made for your hand to hold them one way.</li>
            <li> Right Ear Taper attachment (helps taper hair behind ears);</li>
            <li> Sharp blade and long lasting charge.</li>
            <li> It is relatively lighter than other trimmers which makes it easier to use for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> I was happy up to then but very disappointed in how short of time they lasted.</li>
            <li> The wahl, is a high quality product, cutting, raised accuracy, the battery recharge is very fast...</li>
            <li> After endless research and over thinking which clippers to buy I finally decided on these.  </li>
            <li> although it is advertized as a Cordles Lithium Ion Clipper set only one of clippers is Lithium Ion and the other requires 2 A batteries.</li>
            <li> Other cordless products that I&#x27;ve tried didn&#x27;t have the same quality of cut or options as this one does.  </li>
            <li> Battery lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for very long at all.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long.</li>
            <li> It is powered by dry battery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money because, needless to say, it will pay for itself over a very short time.</li>
            <li> Male, 30&#x27;s, thin, straight hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had these clippers a few weeks and have only used it twice</li>
            <li> The only reason i did not give it 5 stars was due to the blade getting loose.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t owned these long enough to test the life of the Li-ion battery, but it hasn&#x27;t shown any signs of even slowing down after 5 months.</li>
            <li> only complain is that the cape&#x27;s lazes are so loose and poorly seamed that I can see them coming off of the cape really soon.</li>
            <li> highly recommend to anyone looking for a clipper that will cut through thick hair and is well made.</li>
            <li> The result is that when you open the case, you are greeted with a hodgepodge of clipper, trimmer, trimmer combs, conventional combs, oil, cleaning brush, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it three times over 2 months off a single charge.  </li>
            <li> I have not had a single iota of a problem with battery life</li>
            <li> The cord also limited me to where I could cut my hair.  </li>
            <li> I believe that it is a little heavy compared with the old Wahl I left somewhere else in a trip</li>
            <li> The scissors work fine but are clumsy for serious haricutting</li>
            <li> Great clipper set I withhold two stars because the carrying case is very poorly designed and just about useless.  </li>
            <li> Soft, just plain vanilla soft, or just a little slightly thicker.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The small trimmer is really loud.</li>
            <li> Since I already owned a small rechargeable Wahl clipper, the one that comes with this product is a throw-away as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews, or at least until I have used the item, but this one compelled me to do so even before using it.  </li>
            <li> Cutability is only barely average.</li>
            <li> My other Wahl and Conair clippers have spent their entire life in the bathroom with no issues.</li>
            <li> Some of the casing broke and apparently the blow killed the wiring as well</li>
            <li> Only down fall was the cape that came with</li>
            <li> Only down, the smaller/edge clipper does not come with any attachment, so rating review @ 4 star.</li>
            <li> The only major complaint I have about the clippers is that the weight is not balanced.  </li>
            <li> I clip my hair every other week and fully charge these clippers after I finish, and every time I go back to use the thing 2 weeks later the battery is completely dead.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s good or bad.</li>
            <li> It makes cutting hair so easy, and enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> very low noise compared to my previous Wahl cord clipper.</li>
            <li> For the past month, I went back to getting my hair cut in the barber shop after almost 3 years of constantly shaving by myself.</li>
            <li> It turns on a hidden blue LED on the clippers when charging, then turns off when</li>
            <li> AFTER 3 MONTHS USE:  This unit will no longer hold a charge and is unpredictable when it will actually turn on.  </li>
            <li> We have noticed that the small one actually cuts closer than the larger one.</li>
            <li> hair cuts and there is a very low buzz noise which it makes unlike another model I previously used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m taking it back and hoping for better luck :-(</li>
            <li> Long battery life and razor sharp quality with lots of attachments.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s irritating, but I can live with it without the bother of sending it back to Wahl.</li>
            <li> The smaller ones battery life seems to be less than it was but still works so no real complaints.</li>
            <li> I mean very loud.</li>
            <li> The plastic cutting guides work fine.</li>
            <li> So, here I am about a year and a half later and the second clipper set is also dead.</li>
            <li> The noise is a little big.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is I wish it would cut a little closer.</li>
            <li> Sometimes they will pull a little when the charge gets low.</li>
            <li> I can use the clipper/attachments but the clippers are a little to big to get around the nose/ear area!</li>
            <li> (1) ear trim guide (provides a clean hairline behind and around the ears; (1) eye brow trimming guide; (2) combs; (1) pair of small hand clippers (scissors); and miscellaneous cleaning brush, oil, carrying case, neck/shoulder wrap (keep clippings out of clothing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not having to combat the cord while cutting his hair or trimming his beard it a huge plus.</li>
            <li> Warning this is dangerous, lipos are very flammable if you short them, maybe should be done outside!</li>
            <li> The smaller pair run off 2 AA batteries, which sucks IMO, wish they were rechargeable like the big one.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t cut as close as I would have expected from a Wahl product.</li>
            <li> So with a battery driven clipper, I didn&#x27;t expect the same heavy feeling</li>
            <li> With these there was absolutely no pulling (besides the ear trimmer guard</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can remove the blades for cleaning with a screw driver but be careful.</li>
            <li> Because the clipper and the trimmer are fairly heavy for such a flimsy case they fall to the floor.  </li>
            <li> It works well as expected.</li>
            <li> After owning the clipper for just a few months (which means only using it a couple times) it stopped holding the charge.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> and then it&#x27;s not ready to go when I have to use it in a rush.</li>
            <li> Machine was broken very noisy and prolonged use heats up...</li>
            <li> It stayed in the bathroom and I was overly careful with the charger.</li>
            <li> It is very loose and could come disconnected at any time while charging.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He is in the military and he loves it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s flimsy and has no real way to organize all the guides they give you.</li>
            <li> No nicks or cuts although I am careful.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not ideal that the clippers stopped charging in the first place, and that I had to be without my clippers for a couple weeks, and having to package and ship the clippers</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much else I can think of to say regarding that.  </li>
            <li> They made me pay for shipping the clipper to their repair center.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that the guide is not smoothly adjustable.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t stop my husband to use it in shower anyway, just gotta be careful.</li>
            <li> This leads to messy organization and &amp;#34;fighting&amp;#34; to find the proper length desired.</li>
            <li> A few minutes later I was all done.  </li>
            <li> but we&#x27;ve only had it a few months</li>
            <li> I included the small clipper with my shipment to Wahl, with a note explaining exactly what I wrote above - the teeth are broken, don&#x27;t know how/when it happened.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had absolutely no</li>
            <li> I didn’t realize the personal trimmer is just a disposable piece of garbage thrown in to round out the kit.</li>
            <li> I expected it too to be lithium ion (it is not rechargeable, runs on AA batteries).</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> It was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> The cordless feature is a plus…lithium battery lasts long, but the second time I went to use the clipper, I noticed that the blades were slightly rusted…I oiled the blades and ran the clipper for a little while before using it, however, the blades kept pulling on the hair causing pain…couldn&#x27;t use it after that</li>
            <li> Those of you who have had a bad experience with battery if you aren&#x27;t willing to let someone from their customer service help you out and get you a new set because you happened to get a faulty set, then you shouldn&#x27;t bother complaining about it.</li>
            <li> This is not the machine you want if you have a full blown very thick hard afro.</li>
            <li> zero is not as close as previous clippers I use that are half the size but with a cord, but close enough to blend at neck with a razor.</li>
            <li> Small trimmer little loud.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s starting to clip unevenly because it&#x27;s something I&#x27;m doing or what, but I&#x27;m thinking about trying a different brand.</li>
            <li> It looses a star because the preset guide locking mechanism is loose and the guards don&#x27;t stay down.</li>
            <li> I thought my previous cutter was a little short lived until I did some research.......</li>
            <li> The smaller clipper can be used to scale down your beard stuble if you don&#x27;t like to shave everyday.</li>
            <li> The Bad  - think of the cheapest plastic possible, now imagine all the accessories made of 10x cheaper plastic  - clipper body barely cuts it  - clipper metal head has a raw look to it, as if right out of a cast  </li>
            <li> I can find nothing wrong with and Wahl can definetely improve these if they introduce new cordless clippers later on.  </li>
            <li> I can find nothing wrong with and Wahl can definetely improve these if they introduce new cordless clippers later on.  </li>
            <li> only down side is that if the batteries die while you&#x27;re half way through a cut, you&#x27;re stuck standing in the bathroom naked for about 20 mins while you try to get a charge out of it (at least, I don&#x27;t wear clothes while trimming my head..</li>
            <li> So far no problems but 3 months is not a good test.  </li>
            <li> Blades are sharp and there s no snagging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 3 or 4 other cordless hair clipper solutions and had to return all of them.</li>
            <li> (I do not count the bag and cover what do not match quantity of the clipper and other parts).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure if all the Wahl sets have the same cape, shears, oil, and brush, but</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and cut hair like butter.</li>
            <li> Work as well as any other we have used in salon.</li>
            <li> I have seen other comments concerning that the blade cannot be disassembled for cleaning.  </li>
            <li> you just blow out the debris, use the small included brush to &#x27;whisk&#x27; away any hairs and the place 2-3 drops of oil on the head, run it for 2 seonds to spread the oil across the head, wipe it with a tissue and put it away for the next use.  </li>
            <li> but that does not even work as it dies when plugged in, not sure how that is possible.</li>
            <li> This is the alpha dog of all clippers, and they should just stop selling all other models.</li>
            <li> These clippers work extremely well and have held their charge for five uses without any noticeable reduction in power.</li>
            <li> I cut my hair every other week and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Throw in the trimmer and all the other bibs and bobs</li>
            <li> Before buying this Wahl I had been using cheaper clippers from other companies.</li>
            <li> I bought another one after trying other shavers.  </li>
            <li> The small trimmer sis used constantly for trimming between haircuts, and all three of them are still working fine.&lt;br /&gt;Wahl</li>
            <li> Even cleanup was easier since the hair fell together in clumps that didn&#x27;t scatter due to the ease with which the clippers went through the hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately no charger was sent unable to use the item.</li>
            <li> Just what they said it was and did the job extremely well.</li>
            <li> The small one works with battery and the bigger is chargeable.</li>
            <li> Other than that I would recommend and even buy these again if needed.</li>
            <li> and it makes me wonder how an obvious design flaw like this could have made it past product testing.</li>
            <li> Also the listing did not state that the small clipper comes without any guards for different types of trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> like I said, my other clippers were antique.</li>
            <li> The blades stay sharp.</li>
            <li> is extremely noisy for it&#x27;s size.  </li>
            <li> I saw them at Wal-Mart for $54 the other day (2/24/2013).</li>
            <li> to handle due to funky/odd \\&quot;ergonomic design\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> So I went and bought another one, with the intent of having two, and returning the other one for repair.</li>
            <li> I forgot to send the other ones for repair.</li>
            <li> this helped ease some fears  created in other reviews</li>
            <li> this helped ease some fears  created in other reviews</li>
            <li> I recharge it after every use, so I&#x27;m not sure if it holds up for multiple hair cuts without recharging.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the fact that I had to pay postage to take advantage of the warranty, but I believe that would be the case for other products as well.  </li>
            <li> You get all kinds of adapters and other things with it.  </li>
            <li> And don’t get me STARTED on the small, personal trimmer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand what other people are whining about.</li>
            <li> I purchased for my husband and he threw out his other 2.</li>
            <li> Other than that there is no problem.</li>
            <li> The tips of the clipper blades are extremely sharp, causing them to bite into the skin when not using a guard.</li>
            <li> If you unplug from the wall and leave the other end plugged into the clippers for storage, it will drain your battery in a day or two.</li>
            <li> I have to be very careful because the bottom blade is too sharp and it hurts my skin all the time.</li>
            <li> It is little heavy and big as compared to Phillips clipper I had.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the little was a bit quieter than the big one but the way u would be using the trimmer is not comfortable in ur hand.</li>
            <li> It was completely dead and unusable, after owning it for only a little over a year.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, the little &amp;#34;detail trimmer&amp;#34; is substantially underpowered and seems to drain the single AA battery in one or two uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very partial to Wahl.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the initial bad impressions I fired up the clippers and made a quick pass down the side of my head.  </li>
            <li> Most of those motorized units failed due to dullness, cutter-blade rust, broken parts or motor conk out.</li>
            <li> This translates to ease of shaving with less time spent doing it.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that from the description, I expected the detail trimmer to also be rechargeable, but instead it uses batteries.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second order the mini clipper had one tooth broken but I have decided to keep it, but the larger clipper head is not properly align.</li>
            <li> convenient to use, since it isn&#x27;t tethered to a receptacle, I can trim my hair outside and it doesn&#x27;t leave a mess.&lt;br /&gt;The push button on and off switch is a little stiff (my wife has problems getting the switch to turn off, but I don&#x27;t have any problem working it with my thumb).  </li>
            <li> The clip ( the length adjustment plastic thing ) does not fit to the blade properly (loose) and kept falling off while in use.</li>
            <li> saw many reviews about how loud and bad this thing is, but it is not too loud and not too bad.</li>
            <li> I had used a competitors corded for years which became dull and was causing a short in my GFCI breaker system .</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is borderline impossible to actually clean the clipper inside because the head itself is non-removable.</li>
            <li> Also tired of getting the same bad haircut, so decided I could do better with home set.</li>
            <li> Louder than his corded set, that&#x27;s the only complaint</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed the small AA operated trimmer does not operate long on before draining the AA.  </li>
            <li> Only negative is that it fell off the counter already and chipped the blade on one side.</li>
            <li> The average cut lasted 10-15 minutes with my friends hair.</li>
            <li> Another complaint I heard was this doesn&#x27;t cut close enough .</li>
            <li> Biggest complaint was not a close enough shave.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t cut as close as my corded Wahl Peanut clipper.</li>
            <li> This cordless ax seizes hair by its throat and quickly severs each victim in a bloodless mess while taunting the remaining population with its abhorrent, albeit soothing, buzz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My new hobby is cutting my hair at various locales on my scooter route.</li>
            <li> You have to push it in, instead of up or down</li>
            <li> 2 haircuts down</li>
            <li> You have to find somewhere to lay it down along with the accessories.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;d jam up in the clippers, bog them down &amp; pull at his hair.</li>
            <li> Colleen/Customer Service ... STOP the apologies and have a sit down with your engineers about replacing or recalling the Lithium Ion battery ...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will try to update my review down the road as to whether they hold up.  </li>
            <li> what a let down..</li>
            <li> I also use them on my son and for him I got from a 5 guard and fade down to a 3.</li>
            <li> Just be careful if you use it as a body clipper with no guard as the blades and &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; one in a while- it&#x27;ll sting !!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is it is a little hard to hold due to how thick it is near the blades.</li>
            <li> The 1-1/2 clipper guide comb does not fit well on the clipper as compared to other guides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Holds the charge and very sharp.</li>
            <li> Clippers are very sharp.</li>
            <li> The blades are very sharp.</li>
            <li> I tried a few other cordless</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about using a battery clipper especially with the negative reviews that said this clipper would tug at ones hair .</li>
            <li> They are also very sharp and cut hair easier than any previous clippers.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t use the small one but not high expectations.</li>
            <li> the battery stopped holding a charge in less than a year.</li>
            <li> and i was done in less than 20 minutes unlike before when it took me almost an hour (</li>
            <li> clipper maintains it charge longer than any previous clippers I have used.  </li>
            <li> My old clippers pulled like crazy and left lines in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Bought this unit less then 3 months ago.  </li>
            <li> Noisier than my previous Wahl with a cord.  </li>
            <li> My previous Wahl lasted over 15 years...</li>
            <li> Cut my time in half</li>
            <li> The only small small con I&#x27;ve manage to notice is the power button.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my boys&#x27; hair since they were old enough to get their hair cut.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still less than the price of a salon cut.</li>
            <li> this clipper you&#x27;ll be like a professional barber, I even didn&#x27;t go for hair cutting outside for a year</li>
            <li> Because of the shape of the body of the clippers, when you pivot the blade length adjusting lever, the body of the clippers slightly interferes with the movement of the lever.  </li>
            <li> Unit won&#x27;t charge nor work with the cord in less than 4 months time...</li>
            <li> Seriously, I don&#x27;t even remember when was the last time I charged it.</li>
            <li> and I have previously owned cordless clippers and they batters</li>
            <li> I used the 1/16th with the lever moved up for closeness and buzzed my head in less then 5 minutes .</li>
            <li> they are about 40% less in price at around $30 .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> they are about 40% less in price at around $30 .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I previously owned&lt;br /&gt;Wide</li>
            <li> The battery operated shaver is what took the half star from it.</li>
            <li> Remington trimmer does not hold a charge well these days and the worn guides have a tendency to slip (dangerous when trimming – see: bald spot) but for now, I will continue to use the old trimmer – with plans to put this one into a box for future “garage sale.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve had two break in a years time which is a major inconvenience to me and poor quality/reliability.</li>
            <li> But it was disappointing after using it for the first time.</li>
            <li> No cord to mess with</li>
            <li> and I wont make a mess in the house.</li>
            <li> I expected the small trimmer to come with guides (it does not).</li>
            <li> When my wife started during my hair with them they pulled my hair and bogged down over and over and over and over until we both said no more.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The case is also a little confusing as there are not clear spots to put each defined guides/combs.</li>
            <li> But, when I moved the blades up and down, it moves unevenly, which would give you an uneven cut.</li>
            <li> a little rubbing alcohol took care of it</li>
            <li> I have had these cutter for a little over a year now and have never ran into a problem with them.</li>
            <li> A little heavier than I thought it would be</li>
            <li> and I feel a need for a little defense...</li>
            <li> :(&lt;br /&gt;I emailed customer service attaching a copy of my e-receipt for the original purchase.</li>
            <li> The little clipper is a throwaway little thing but works in a pinch.  </li>
            <li> I use them to trim unwanted body hair and do a little manscaping.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the easiest hair to cut, tons of cowlicks, but have never had a problem with a little patience.  </li>
            <li> I am using the little clipper to trim around my ears and my eyelashes .</li>
            <li> I am using the little clipper to trim around my ears and my eyelashes .</li>
            <li> I cut my hair about every two weeks and this little puppy helps.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never powerful, missed a lot of hair!</li>
            <li> Price at $40 plus is a little steep.</li>
            <li> I previously had a corded Wahl for several years and got tired of hassling with the cord.  </li>
            <li> and they did not have the power for a complete haircut or they would loose power halfway through the cutting job.  </li>
            <li> The set comes with everything you need including a 1&amp;1/2 guard (absurdly unneccessary) and a smaller little shaver that runs on two AA batteries and sounds like a chainsaw (very cheap feeling and annoying, I gave this one to Granny to shave her legs with).</li>
            <li> Its a little heavy</li>
            <li> much easier cutting my sons hair</li>
            <li> I finally got tired of dodging the cord when I cut my hair with an el-cheapo set of clippers.</li>
            <li> I had a few hair cut with it.</li>
            <li> Plus my wife has trouble with the hair line/ trimming part of the hair cut anyway</li>
            <li> that was kind of nasty and rubbed off on my neck but</li>
            <li> Feel like I wasted my money on this one.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty machine.</li>
            <li> Used it for 3 cuts...went to cut my hair for the 4th time and it is dead.  </li>
            <li> If Wahl is headed towards a &amp;#34;made-in-China&amp;#34; disposable level of quality, I suppose I will just replace with a cheaper competitor and plan on buying a replacement every few years.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dead.</li>
            <li> and it is always completely dead.</li>
            <li> I ordered as a gift to someone and when they received it, something was missing out the box - a pair of scissors</li>
            <li> 4 or 5 haircuts over span of a few months before it even sees the charger.</li>
            <li> It was uneven looking.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this one a few weeks, use it about 3 times a week.  </li>
            <li> trouble.</li>
            <li> After being unplugged for a few days the would not recharge.</li>
            <li> The 79600-2101 is a waste of money, has anyone out there tried to establish a line with this thing?</li>
            <li> After proper installation of 2 AA batteries, the detail trimmer worked for approximately 2 seconds then died.  </li>
            <li> I will update this review with the its performance in a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I managed to get it a few day before Christmas.</li>
            <li> Pulled a lot at my hair each time until I realised that there was a broken tooth on the upper blade.</li>
            <li> Despite these few issues, I don&#x27;t regret buying these clippers.  </li>
            <li> One day I tried to use it, but the battery was dead and it refused to charge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this clipper for close to three years now, and I&#x27;ve already sent it in once for it being completely dead</li>
            <li> No light or charge).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband uses it a few times a week</li>
            <li> The combs for the Osters are spring loaded and very difficult to load onto the clippers and Wahl&#x27;s are exactly</li>
            <li> The combs for the Osters are spring loaded and very difficult to load onto the clippers and Wahl&#x27;s are exactly</li>
            <li> However, when I got the package it turns out the charger was missing and I needed them for that day.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t just dead, they were DEAD.</li>
            <li> Completely dead.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge, and once it was completely dead, that was the end.</li>
            <li> 2 dead clippers.    </li>
            <li> Not cheap either.  </li>
            <li> I can check behind my head with my back to a mirror and using a hand mirror to look into it to see what I have done .</li>
            <li> I can check behind my head with my back to a mirror and using a hand mirror to look into it to see what I have done .</li>
            <li> This product became useless after just 3 months of purchasing it, having used it maybe twice so far.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy duty, holds a charge,</li>
            <li> It is quite poor compared to the big one.</li>
            <li> Will update after a few months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now dead after 4-5 uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times.</li>
            <li> other complaint is the &amp;#34;contoured shape&amp;#34; of the clippers.</li>
            <li> I just have to slow down a little to get through the haircut.</li>
            <li> Not easy to accidentally break a blade</li>
            <li> I bought this product to start cutting my hair at home and it has been a decent product.</li>
            <li> Small little things</li>
            <li> - Corded clippers usually have a little rubber loop where the cord meets the clippers, used to hang the clippers on a hook.  </li>
            <li> Ordinary care is required aka put a little oil on the blades</li>
            <li> It is a little bulky but the small trimmer is sleek.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I just need to slow down.</li>
            <li> but you could immediately notice the difficulty and slow down the clippers had with the hairs as they got thicker.</li>
            <li> , I decided to live with the disappointment in the quality of the case.</li>
            <li> a professional job.&lt;br /&gt;The power switch is small and needs  firm, well-aimed pressure but the location is awkward.</li>
            <li> Swapping the battery out helps for a little while, but it&#x27;s hard as the battery was not designed to be replaceable.  </li>
            <li> Unbelievable, way pass my expectation.</li>
            <li> No more Whal for me.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of the small trimmer</li>
            <li> charger is small and portable.  </li>
            <li> not sure how i feel about the power button on the clipper.  </li>
            <li> I gave it just over a month, using it to usually trim my somewhat thicker beard..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why, but they just won&#x27;t turn on.  </li>
            <li> We have 2 small children too &amp; this comes with everything to give them a haircut too.</li>
            <li> The small one doesn&#x27;t have attachments.</li>
            <li> Finally, a powerful,long lasting, multi use, multi attachment follicle cutting device that is cordless!</li>
            <li> The small clipper lasts seemingly forever</li>
            <li> Not sure why it stopped working.</li>
            <li> Wahl products are usually reliable.</li>
            <li> The small one had the plastic part that closes on the battery break off as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how everyone else does it</li>
            <li> Also the small clipper that you see in the pic does not come with any clips for length adjustments.</li>
            <li> I did a small amount of research before my purchase looking for customer ratings, quality of product and cost.</li>
            <li> small peeve.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure...</li>
            <li> No more spinning around, ducking under the cord, worrying about where to plug in, messing with extension cords</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my haircuts are too brief (10 min) to test the battery.  </li>
            <li> the small clipper uses replaceable aa batteries and&lt;br</li>
            <li> small clipper is not rechargeable.</li>
            <li> It came with tons of guards that are for longer hair, but not many for shorter hair.</li>
            <li> The small clippers does not have any adjustment or clipper guides which makes them useless unless you&#x27;re wanting as close a clip as possible.      </li>
            <li> I picked up the Wahl Ion cordless clippers a Wal-Mart for $59.99 and that includes everything from 1/2 to 8 attachment combs, barber cape, brushes/oil, and also a small detail trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I usually reserve 5-star reviews for products</li>

            <li> I usually reserve 5-star reviews for products</li>
            <li> Also I hoped that the trimmer (the small wahl) is rechargeable like the hair cutter.</li>
            <li> No more then 10 minutes unless I am shaving my neck .</li>
            <li> No more then 10 minutes unless I am shaving my neck .</li>
            <li> This, however, is a small inconvenience given the quality and ease of use.</li>
            <li> I usually recharge it after two uses, so it&#x27;s never died on me.  </li>
            <li> The small side clipper that comes with it is another story.  </li>
            <li> Not really sure how they would have done that anyway.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;The small clipper doesnt have battery...</li>
            <li> My wife has been cutting our families hair for nearly 13 years.</li>
            <li> One small issue about the small trimmer, they should have made it lithium battery also instead of AA battery and the small one is noisy.</li>
            <li> Small clipper did not work.</li>
            <li> Also, feels slick in the hand</li>
            <li> No more cord😎</li>
            <li> You simply cannot go wrong with a Whal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m bit disappointed that the little Trimmer is not rechargeable lithium ion as the main clipper.  </li>
            <li> Not satisfied with the product due to it being broken already.</li>
            <li> However, the corded clippers are very frustrating to use because of having to constantly adjust if you are giving a haircut</li>
            <li> I ordered this one because the other was also so cumbersome that i was getting tired of carrying around the kit and extention cords everywhere</li>
            <li> As other people mentioned - the trimmer is only one bad piece in the set.</li>
            <li> I never used but I&#x27;ve purchased at least 10 over the past year or so.</li>
            <li> I usually cut my hair at least once a month</li>
            <li> It even comes with a secondary close trimmer to get into the small areas around for an even trim.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless this seems like a very plain oversight in design</li>
            <li> Wahl&#x27;s customer service was not very pleasant.</li>
            <li> ALSO it is poorly designed in that the adjustment arm catches on the case seam every time - typical junk of today&#x27;s design and manufacturing standards.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy a cordless as my previous one did not only keep its power for one cut, but the cutting ability was weak.  </li>
            <li> Trouble is the power on the trimmer is weak</li>
            <li> Also they are all black and not color coded so looking for a different size is a little annoying.</li>
            <li> it impractical never having a hard time because he is running for Aetjob</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t thing they will break, the length clips for the clippers aren&#x27;t completely hard plastic.</li>
            <li> Hard to judge...</li>
            <li> Nappy and hard afro</li>
            <li> Hard to handle / tears at your skin /</li>
            <li> The blade was broken little.</li>
            <li> After getting totally frustrated with the cords of my old pair, it was time to go cordless.  </li>
            <li> I kept thinking the charge allows an hour of cutting only till I re-looked at the package</li>
            <li> The big one cuts your neck if you try to use it as a trimmer with the cutting edge against the skin.</li>
            <li> Before owning this product, I was commonly referred to as &amp;#34;ape&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;bigfoot&amp;#34;, and &amp;#34;Mommy, why is that man</li>
            <li> Read several bad reviews, but haven&#x27;t seen any issues after a few months of use.  </li>
            <li> Used only twice and stopped cutting my hair and started pulling it.</li>
            <li> In any case, I compared them to my corded Wahl clippers and it&#x27;s at least 3 times louder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone at least 2 or 3 haircuts without charging it.</li>
            <li> Cords always get in my way when I am cutting hair and this not only saves me time, but also frustration.</li>
            <li> Corded trimmers are aggravating to say the least.  </li>
            <li> There are multiple cutting size options....which confuses you...</li>
            <li> I have cut my hair myself for at least 10 years with a Wahl corded clipper.</li>
            <li> Conair clippers have worn out entirely, so the Li Ion clippers will see some usage – time will tell whether they are as disappointing as I</li>
            <li> Stop confusing people.</li>
            <li> and it could never get through my husbands thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair.</li>
            <li> The rpm&#x27;s slow, the exhaust pops and gurgles, the grass isn&#x27;t evenly cut.</li>
            <li> His hair is as thick as a brillo pad.</li>
            <li> Sadly Wahl said this battery charging failure has been happening for this unit and is like common place and is to be expected for this type of charging battery that they use in this cordless clipper; nevertheless, I still like using it</li>
            <li> So if you try to pivot the lever while slightly pressing down on it (haphazardly with say, your thumb), it will catch on the body of the clippers and get stuck.  </li>
            <li> A little disappointed as the smaller clipper doesn’t contain the lithium ion rechargeable battery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to take painfully slow shallow passes to keep from hurting him.</li>
            <li> the battery which results in rapid failure.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously there was a breakdown in email communications and they did not receive my email about the product failure.</li>
            <li> So barring any mechanical failure, like I said before, I think this one is a winner.</li>
            <li> Will tear at your skin and bite you badly if you are not careful about how you move it and angle it.</li>
            <li> I noticed that on the small clipper the tips of a couple of the teeth appeared to be broken.  </li>
            <li> There is something wrong with the design of these clippers that will run down the battery to the point where it will not longer charge.</li>
            <li> Annoying I have to fork out for a new wahl blade set...</li>
            <li> The reports of an hour and a half are laughable.</li>
            <li> I take my grooming seriously.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a serious issue with these.</li>
            <li> EVERY company, that makes anything at all OCCASIONALLY has a bad egg.  </li>
            <li> Here is the issue, when it is on and running, if you put pressure on the switch, it will stop, but when you take pressure off, it turns on again, so you have to be careful about how you hold this thing while you are cutting, or you might be making a cut, and while you are gliding thru the hair, you could stop the blades</li>
            <li> /&gt;TL;DR Avoid Wahl products unless you like poor and slow customer service and unreliable products</li>
            <li> The case sucks!  </li>
            <li> One day I decided that spending $18 on a hair cut that only takes, no kidding, 15 minutes was crazy!</li>
            <li> I first tried the cheapest set of Conair clippers and they were the worst set I had ever tried.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;you will only be disappointed</li>
            <li> The small clipper imho is useless.  </li>
            <li> it cuts the cutting time by half beacause of no cord.</li>
            <li> Bad experience every single time with this item.  </li>
            <li> I also had to go very slow with</li>
            <li> I have yet to run them dead !!!</li>
            <li> And by sturdy I mean I dropped it 4 times in my shower (no not while I was bathing!</li>
            <li> I like the small trimmer that comes along with it, but i probably wont recommend this product due to the annoying rattle when using the clipper.</li>
            <li> It can be a little awkward, but I have never dropped it, but I did come close to nipping the tip of my finger.</li>
            <li> it was unnecessary.</li>
            <li> Unless you plan your haircuts in advance, the battery will not be charged and the clipper does not work with the cord when the battery is drained...very frustrating.</li>
            <li> I do it approximately every 2-3 weeks</li>
            <li> One of them was broken in the box and another broke soon after.</li>
            <li> At the end of my haircut I pulled on it and the cords that tie it behind the neck snapped off.</li>
            <li> Not happy and now am faced with spending another twenty dollars returning yet another pair.</li>
            <li> Lots of plastic that  fits poorly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;What&#x27;s improved:&lt;br /&gt;-Lithium Ion batteries: are a big improvement over Ni Cad (which have annoying &#x27;memory&#x27;) or even NiMH (which don&#x27;t have memory but lose charge just sitting unused).  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re tired of paying $20 for a haircut, then you need to buy these.</li>
            <li> That would be approximately 43 haircuts, then the battery dies.</li>
            <li> I got tired of twisting around a cable to cut my husband&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I returned the broken one.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this set of clippers and returned it.</li>
            <li> poorly designed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hard</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s even worse getting one from a corded clipper.  </li>
            <li> I charged it, but alas, it no longer holds any power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an engineer, and I know mechanical stuff, so I can tell you that the switch is a poor choice based on how it works.</li>
            <li> but I think some clippers are way worse).</li>
            <li> /&gt;First time I ordered the item arrived on time but the mini clipper had all the front teeth broken</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace our broken corded clipper.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is to keep DYI barbers from cutting themselves or what.</li>
            <li> No more having the cord in your way when you are cutting hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product for cutting my son&#x27;s hair in place of a corded machine which my son complained was uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> The mini clipper is a useless, underpowered toy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;LiIon battery will probably render the unit useless in 4 years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because of this, they are useless to me.</li>
            <li> This is expensive approx.</li>
            <li> unfortunately the charging system failed after a couple of months.  </li>
            <li> every week without fail, this trimmer allowed us to do 31 trims on one charge.  </li>
            <li> No impressed with clips for the price.</li>
            <li> The trimmer had no guide attachments making this piece useless to me.</li>
            <li> I feel that this Wahl 79600-2101 Lithium Ion Cordless Clipper kit has been unfairly judged by reviewers who regard the clipper as &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;cheaply constructed&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Sorry Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since the prices of haircuts and styling are so outrageous, I began home hair cuts and styling back in 2008</li>
            <li> Something is absolutely wrong with the design of these clippers.    </li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t had a reason to use it though for those who were sad</li>
            <li> Power button is in the wrong place but just being picky.</li>
            <li> Unable to use.  </li>
            <li> The cape is very poorly made.</li>
            <li> The battery thing is really annoying, because it&#x27;s no better than NiCad.</li>
            <li> and the scissors that came with it were really bad too (worse than if you just bought some at office depot).</li>
            <li> I had my doubts on this because i&#x27;ve never tried a cordless Clipper,I was amazed at the cutting power of these clippers,the Chrome accent doubles as a  mirror which helps to see weird angle cuts.</li>
            <li> From not holding a charge, to the &#x27;blades&#x27; not moving, to it actually cutting hair.  </li>
            <li> and it still is a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> The case is terrible, poor quality and poorly suited to the task of storing and organizing all the accessories.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a corded Wahl clipper for cutting my hair (I do it myself) for about 10 years.  </li>
            <li> Nothing a bit of crazy glue can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> Has lots of accessories and makes cutting and trimming almost fool</li>
            <li> I no longer fight the curled cord when cutting my hair.</li>
            <li> I will recommend and buy from Wahl with all my hair cutting and trimming needs.</li>
            <li> Cutting hair just got easier.&lt;br /&gt;Pastor</li>
            <li> Cutting hair at friends place (can literally throw it in your pocket with their clipper size)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife has been  cutting my hair for 40 years.</li>
            <li> Will be cutting again tomorrow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair for years</li>
            <li> What I would rather have is lots of shorter hair guards like for cutting a \\&quot;fade.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> We save money by her cutting the children&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> plugged in all the time and just plug it in before cutting my hair .</li>
            <li> plugged in all the time and just plug it in before cutting my hair .</li>
            <li> He had tto dig it out of the trash because of the disappointment.</li>
            <li> And since the cutting edge is between the blades, the sandpaper did not affect cutting performance.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m disappointed, but I&#x27;m not impressed, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very difficult to store and organize attachments.</li>
            <li> /&gt;THE BAD</li>
            <li> Assume I just have a bad battery and will have to return.</li>
            <li> My bad.  </li>
            <li> Too bad it doesn&#x27;t work, and Wahl customer service is slow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the price wasn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> Also it would yank hairs out around my sideburns which was painful.</li>
            <li> I started shaving my son&#x27;s head and found the trimmer so painful to use so decided to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Wahl products for years and this one hasn&#x27;t disappointed me at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed and oil training</li>
            <li> Neither of them work and I was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Unable to use !!</li>
            <li> That would be stupid).</li>
            <li> Piece of crap product.  </li>
            <li> I really hate that.</li>
            <li> also where the lever is on the side it catches on the plastic where the plastic attaches, which i found to be annoying.</li>
            <li> is CRAP.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll do the trick and cut your hair without being tethered to a wire and wall plug, but it pulls hair as it cuts, which I find a tad annoying as heck.</li>
            <li> : Trimming my hair with this machine was as painful as pulling hair out of my nose!</li>
            <li> and i have spinal arthritis which it made very painful)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very, VERY disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It just got boring and with the cord getting in the way</li>
            <li> but they are awful!  </li>
            <li> but these 2 are horrible.  </li>
            <li> Very annoying.</li>
            <li> , I could do without that horrible power switch.</li>
            <li> Am very disappointed about that!</li>
            <li> This one just works horribly.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the clippers! Should have invested in them sooner. Pretty decently quiet, and cut very smoothly. I&#x27;m happy with the purchase for sure.</li>
            <li> good bye barber&lt;br /&gt;easy to use with guards&lt;br /&gt;can get 6 haircuts on one charge</li>
            <li> I used mine once or twice a week and it is amazing. Battery life is great as well (I still haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet)</li>
            <li> Item as described, great seller!</li>
            <li> Came fast, great product.</li>
            <li> there are no attachment selections for the tiny trimmer. i shouldn&#x27;t have bought that-- it was unnecessary. the material feels like cheap plastic. and the scissors that came with it were really bad too (worse than if you just bought some at office depot). the hair clips are also cheap plastic rather than metal. the whole set just feels set just feels cheap and not good quality</li>
            <li> I finally got tired of dodging the cord when I cut my hair with an el-cheapo set of clippers. Not only does this work better, it also comes with a larger selection of guides. I didn&#x27;t expect that I would use the smaller clippers, but have found myself using them nearly every day to trim my beard. All-in-all an excellent purchase.</li>
            <li> I received this product on time, in good package and perfect condictions. It´s a excellent for cut hair and trim beard. It´s work very well.</li>
            <li> The performance is at its best and would recommend to anyone who needs a clipper at home.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut as close as anticipated.</li>
            <li> I got this a couple of months ago.  It clips great but the battery life is horrendous.  I clip my hair every other week and fully charge these clippers after I finish, and every time I go back to use the thing 2 weeks later the battery is completely dead.  Every other lithium ion powered device I have (phone, camera, etc) would still be charged after 2 weeks of not being used but this thing can&#x27;t hold a charge for more than a day or two.  Piece of crap product.  Don&#x27;t buy it.  I&#x27;m trying to get Wahl to give me my money back.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable, way pass my expectation.</li>
            <li> The item works very well and the battery life is quite amazing...so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it for the budget conscious buyer.</li>
            <li> - The price is good, you get a lot of stuff for little money.&lt;br /&gt;- The clipper looks solid and works fine with 220V not only 110V&lt;br /&gt;- Haven&#x27;t used it a hole lot yet (about 3 hair cuts), so only time will tell how durable it is, but so far there is no flaw.&lt;br /&gt;- If it still works fine in 3 years, I&#x27;ll upgrade to 5 stars :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product and excellent array of accessories and clipper guides, very low noise compared to my previous Wahl cord clipper. Far better precision that allows me to get shorter hair lengths without looking shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complain is that the cape&#x27;s lazes are so loose and poorly seamed that I can see them coming off of the cape really soon. I really like the cape though. I&#x27;m gonna have to reinforce the seam by hand with needle and thread.</li>
            <li> The cordless trimmer works great. I like the selection of the clipper lengths. The noise is a little big. The small trimmer works great on the back head side to give good shapes.</li>
            <li> Very well made. Exceeded my expectations</li>
            <li> I love love love this clipper! We had a crappy 20 dollar target bought clipper for over a year and it could never get through my husbands thick hair. (So I never wanted to cut it!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this for 3 months I can now confess that unstead of him bothering me to cut his hair... I am bugging him! It makes cutting hair so easy, and enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend to anyone looking for a clipper that will cut through thick hair and is well made.</li>
            <li> This was a very good purchase. The item came in excellent condition. Operarates great. Charges fast and it is very useful for speed jobs. I am very please and happy with this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Good deal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. The trimmers don&#x27;t edge low haircuts as closely as I need them to...</li>
            <li> I never used but I&#x27;ve purchased at least 10 over the past year or so. My friends overseas are the users...they apparently love it, which is why I keep on getting more and more orders through words of mouth...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this a short time and it&#x27;s my first so I&#x27;ve nothing else to compare it to. It seems well made and solid and does a good job of shearing my hair to the 1/2&amp;#34; length I want quite easily.&lt;br /&gt;If I could change one thing it would be the location of the on/off switch to one where your grip doesn&#x27;t trip it in mid-cut. I also have no use so far for the mini-me trimmer and wish I wasn&#x27;t compelled to pay for it to get the main unit.</li>
            <li> Cutting my own hair was quick and painless unlike my old cheap set. Having no cord is also a nice bonus. Just make sure you have a good grip on it.</li>
            <li> excellent product, price and shipping.  well done</li>
            <li> Strong , cut mine , son , dad. With one charge..</li>
            <li> After using an old Wahl for many years, I was reluctant to try anything else.  This model cuts as well as the classic corded version but is much more convenient to use.</li>
            <li> The clippers are really quite and are great quality blades. All the extra clip pieces are nice to have. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Love these clippers! Cordless is awesome!</li>
            <li> Bought this for Dad for birthday.  He has used a corded one for many years.  He has tried other cordless models over the years, and been very dissatisfied... This one works great!</li>
            <li> as strong as the corded version I had before; cordless feature allows much more flexibility</li>
            <li> the battery stopped holding a charge in less than a year.</li>
            <li> Best clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Free trimmer is a welcome addition to kit.</li>
            <li> Nice to have cordless with no cord getting in yhe way.  it seems to be powerful.  no use for the smaller unit as not very heavy duty but didn&#x27;t buy it for that.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t cut as close as I would have expected from a Wahl product.</li>
            <li> for the price we paid, it&#x27;s a great value. it does all the job plus more, really love it !</li>
            <li> This is my second Wahl Cordless and the first one last (5) years with weekly use. Great product and life span. Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product. It has worked as expected, so far. No problems. Many complements. Battery is good enough!!</li>
            <li> The cordless lithium ion wahl clippers are the greatest.  Up until now i was  using an older wahl clipper.  I had been using it for over 12 yrs and the motor was finally starting to go. I ordered this one because the other was also so cumbersome that i was getting tired of carrying around the kit and extention cords everywhere (my husband has a beard and looks like S.Claus so i have the job of keeping his hair and beard trimmed all year long.  This makes it so much easier. Just 1 charge and it was ready to go and i was done in less than 20 minutes unlike before when it took me almost an hour (and i have spinal arthritis which it made very painful) This one took all that pain away by shortening the time it took.  It is Awesome. Its great.</li>
            <li> Nice product, happy with it.</li>
            <li> This clipper pales in comparison to my 5 year old panasonic.  I just can&#x27;t find a battery for it any longer.  I will return this junky clipper.  No more Whal for me.</li>
            <li> These clippers were great. They come with all types of sizes that you really need to care hair. The only con I have is the blade cut by itself is not as close as others but everything else is exceptional.</li>
            <li> Nice machice, great delivery, best price found.</li>
            <li> It was a gift to my son who seems to like it. It&#x27;s appears to be high quality compared to the otehr brands and models I researched.</li>
            <li> I just bought this clipper a few days ago and  used it for the first time this morning to shave my head bald. I love it because it is cordless. This translates to ease of shaving with less time spent doing it. The clipper is sleek and light weight. Seems to be of good quality. For the past month, I went back to getting my hair cut in the barber shop after almost 3 years of constantly shaving by myself. It just got boring and with the cord getting in the way, i decided to go to barber shops until i find a clipper such as this one. A tough decision for me since I know I cut my hair better than any barber out there :) Now I&#x27;ve regained the zest I had for cutting my hair by myself. The clipper comes with a complete set of tools needed for home hair cut and the smaller trimmer is very powerful and gives a nice trim of the beard. I&#x27;m certainly happy i purchased this. Hopefully it lasts a long time. It&#x27;s worth the money because, needless to say, it will pay for itself over a very short time. I gave a 4 star because it doesn&#x27;t look as solid as in the picture or package. Body is made of plastic.</li>
            <li> Works Great, but the small clippers use batteries.  I would prefer they also were rechargeable.</li>
            <li> Excellent clippers, well balanced and does a superb job.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer basically just to shave my arms. Being cordless is awesome. I&#x27;ve probably had this trimmer about 2 months and still on first charge!!! Blades are sharp and there s no snagging. All the accessories it comes with is pretty impressive. Very happy with my purchase and recommend this product. Shipping was also pretty fast</li>
            <li> Only one haircut done. Battery is strong on my thick hair. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Great product. Sharp blade and long lasting charge. I have barbed and shaved more the four times on a single full charge.</li>
            <li> I  really like these clippers</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair (there I said it) and do a hell of a job if I say so myself, and for the past 8 yrs I used the same trusty set of Wahl clippers to do it without incident. But once I saw these and realized they didn&#x27;t have a pesky cord attached to them (that has so many times attempted to strangle me while knocking off everything on my bathroom sink), I thought I&#x27;d give em a try. The set comes with everything you need including a 1&amp;1/2 guard (absurdly unneccessary) and a smaller little shaver that runs on two AA batteries and sounds like a chainsaw (very cheap feeling and annoying, I gave this one to Granny to shave her legs with). So with a battery driven clipper, I didn&#x27;t expect the same heavy feeling, high quality proffessional feel that the corded Wahls provide, and I wasn&#x27;t dissappointed. But they aren&#x27;t as light and cheap as I expected them to be. The lithium battery made plenty of power for a solid 20 min. cut, but they don&#x27;t seem to cut as close as my old ones. The taper lever on this one is much more stiff (a pleasant surprise), but the ridiculous power button they put on it is a bit of a hassle. Instead of the traditional seesaw lever switch, they went with a cheap piece of rubber with a button deep underneath it somewhere (major design flaw) on this one.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, my first cut turned out decent, but it will require some adaptive technique to do justice to old faithful.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0058SY1X6 Wahl 79600-2101 Lithium Ion Cordless Clipper]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clipper maintains it charge longer than any previous clippers I have used.  It is easy to handle and cuts the hair without missing any places.</li>
            <li> it was a great deal for  anyone that cuts hair,the clipper-the trimmer-and everything else you need to cut hair</li>
            <li> It is good clipper and cuts hair pretty good. I cut hair for my both kids and mine and it works great. Battery life is good.&lt;br /&gt;There are only two concerns with this clipper...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- It is little heavy and big as compared to Phillips clipper I had.&lt;br /&gt;2- The 1-1/2 clipper guide comb does not fit well on the clipper as compared to other guides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is good clipper and I would recommend to who don&#x27;t mind big and bulky clippers.</li>
            <li> It was excellent, I use it  in my visit to Chile South America since the electricity was 220 v.&lt;br /&gt;I had to use a electrical converter  to change it from 220 v  - 115 v&lt;br /&gt;then  I charged the Clippe&#x27;s  Lithium battery and it worked very well..I had a few hair cut with it.</li>
            <li> I just used this clipper and it works great.  I bought the balding clipper a few months ago and this works just as good and I can cut my hair outside.  I was using the balding clippers and hit the end of my cord and dropped them and they broke so I bought this cordless one.</li>
            <li> After endless research and over thinking which clippers to buy I finally decided on these.  I was glad I got them; they worked like a champ.  They replaced my old  cheap clippers and these are a thousand times better in performance and quality.  I use a 1 1/2 guard all over and these clippers came with a 1 1/2 guard so i dont have to raise the blade with a #1 guard and worry about i moving back to the shorter cut like my old ones.  My old clippers pulled like crazy and left lines in my hair.  With these there was absolutely no pulling (besides the ear trimmer guard and that was only minute compared to the old clippers, I just won&#x27;t use it again; don&#x27;t really need them anyway cuz of the included trimmer). They cut even, which sped up the cut and made it look better, no chafing either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmers were surprisingly powerful for only using 1 AA battery, they were loud but who cares, I can live with the noise.  They also did chafe a little bit but compared to using my old full size clippers for touch ups it was nothing.  Plus my wife has trouble with the hair line/ trimming part of the hair cut anyway so that could have been the issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: quality for the cost, even cut, convienience of cordless without loss of power, tons of attachments including a barber cape (didn&#x27;t use the scissors so I can&#x27;t comment), carry case (old ones are in a plastic grocery bag)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: ear attachment not great, eyebrow attachment didn&#x27;t cut anything (could be a good thing, maybe my eyebrows aren&#x27;t bushy enought \\&quot;yet\\&quot; as my wife commented), difficult to fit all the attachments in the bag (not a big deal, just inconvenient), cape wasn&#x27;t huge but I&#x27;m a pretty big guy, also the cape had some sort of greasy glue that was kind of nasty and rubbed off on my neck but a little rubbing alcohol took care of it right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I was very impressed and would definitely recommend getting them if you want a great cut for not a ton of money.</li>
            <li> This is the best product on the market and great for ladies too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 3 or 4 other cordless hair clipper solutions and had to return all of them. This comes with a strong motor that lasts long enough to clip the hair of your entire head. It charges plenty fast, I just wish it came with a little mirror like other Wahl clipper sets.</li>
            <li> I use these in cosmetology school and love them. They&#x27;re light, sleek, and cut better than my Oster and Andis clippers. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because I got 2 #7 guards, but no #8 and that&#x27;s one I use frequently.</li>
            <li> These cut very well. I am not a fan of the small trimmer but I have yet to find one I am in love with anyway. I have no training and am able to cut 3 adult men&#x27;s hair and 2 children.</li>
            <li> Did not work as well as my old one.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very satisfied with it, and charging is very quick. Will recommend to buyers. Its serving for the purpose</li>
            <li> I should have gotten this one long ago. It cut my hair so effortlessly and quietly that I didn&#x27;t even think it was working</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a corded model of this clipper for a little over 10 years and have been very pleased.  When I lost my clipper guards during a recent trip I checked online for possible replacements and stumbled across the cordless Li version.  I gave it a try and have since retired my venerable corded model.  Excellent price for a great product!</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I always charge if 100% after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now owned it for about 3 months and the battery has drained on me frequently.&lt;br /&gt;At first, a full charge lasted a month if not used.&lt;br /&gt;Later a full charge would last 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Now a full charge only lasts for few days, maybe 4-5 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clipper can be good if you need wireless but you must charge it fully before use.&lt;br /&gt;The charge doesn&#x27;t last more than few days after 4 months of use.  I have used it about 15 times so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks to be good quality. Just got it. Haven&#x27;t used it yet.  I&#x27;m bit disappointed that the little Trimmer is not rechargeable lithium ion as the main clipper.  The trimmer requires battery to operate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger is small and portable.  The clipper is little bigger than i had anticipated but it looks stylish and good clean, contemporary design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how i feel about the power button on the clipper.  You have to push it in, instead of up or down the clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all my first impression 4/5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m charging the clipper now. Will test it in a week or so.</li>
            <li> Blades not sharp enough. Not near as good as the wahl with cord.</li>
            <li> They work great. I am able to cut my hair on my own now. Just wish it would also run off corded power instead of just the battery</li>
            <li> Been going strong since purchased in 2013. Great pair of clippers, Battery life is great!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband and he is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift. He loved it!</li>
            <li> Great clipper set I withhold two stars because the carrying case is very poorly designed and just about useless.  Very difficult to store and organize attachments.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money. I have owned  several shavers but this is by far the best quality. The extra smaller shaver is very handy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a clipper before, but this one with the multiple heads and small daily trimmer works perfectly for my needs.</li>
            <li> The unit worked very well, the only thing that I did not like was the size of the hair clippers, but I will get use to it; the smaller unit ,the trimmer, is great!</li>
            <li> The battery life is good but the on and off button feels flimsy and the accessory is cheap looking.</li>
            <li> I gave it 5 stars because it works perfectly fine but had I known that I could have purchased the same set of clippers at Target/Walmart...I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered these. I don&#x27;t feel professional at all using these. They&#x27;re Wahls, though, with decent quality. The battery lasts a long time, too. I did 50 hair cuts before I had to charge it again. Hopefully they&#x27;ll last!</li>
            <li> Im a hairstylist and need really well made clippers and trimmers... I bought these bc the reviews seemed great but they are awful!  They feel really lightweight and cheap and I guess I have a short or something in my clippers bc even though its plugged in it still keeps going out!  I also should have read more carefully I guess bc the trimmers are battery operated which means they suck and they aren&#x27;t that powerful... They barely trim the hair around the neck... I have used Wahl products before and they have been great but these 2 are horrible.  If your just wanting it for yourself at home I guess it could work but don&#x27;t buy this if your a professional hairstylist or barber.</li>
            <li> Light weight  easy  to maintain  cordless  It is powerful easy to handle  Trimmer is more powerful than the older Wahl I had</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these clippers for about a month and have cut my hair twice. So far they have been great! Nice clean cut, easy clean up, and plenty of power. Some other clippers are a bit cheaper, but so far these are worth the money.</li>
            <li> Works well. Holds the charge and very sharp. Small trimmer little loud. Overall great buy.</li>
            <li> Clipper is light and portable, but it also has a loose and cheap plastic feel to it, the front cover is loose and vibrating, thats why i gave it a 3 star rating. I like the small trimmer that comes along with it, but i probably wont recommend this product due to the annoying rattle when using the clipper.</li>
            <li> Love this set.  Great quality</li>
            <li> This thing is great.  Cuts great, cleans easy and i&#x27;m still using it from it&#x27;s first charge from two months ago only (using once a week for abouot 14 minutes) couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
            <li> I have owned these for a few months now and after many uses they are working out very well. I like not having a cord, my older Wahl was great but the cord is a major annoyance. Just remember to charge them right before you use them for the best performance.</li>
            <li> I researched extensively for cordless hair clippers.  After getting totally frustrated with the cords of my old pair, it was time to go cordless.  I primarily needed these to cut my kids hair and occasionally mine.  The clippers work great and come with more attachments that what I have traditionally seen in other units.  The unit keeps its charge long enough for me to use for a couple cuts.  I have not used it for a longer period of time so I cannot comment on exactly how long it lasts.  The other nice part is the small trimmer that comes with it.  While this is battery powered, it has come in quite handy for trimming not only kids hair but also facial hair.  Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of this clipper. Unless you plan your haircuts in advance, the battery will not be charged and the clipper does not work with the cord when the battery is drained...very frustrating. I have not been able to achieve the advertised 15 minute quick charge. I am going back to a standard corded clipper. Feel like I wasted my money on this one. The battery powered detail trimmer works well.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this so much that he bought two more to give as gifts for his friends. Its so quiet and cuts to his delite</li>
            <li> First let me start by saying I used this clippers to cut my own shortly cropped hair (about 1/2\\&quot;)-- I do it approximately every 2-3 weeks and it takes about 15 minutes. I take extremely good care of all my things and carefully cleaned it and oiled between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this clippers in summer 2012. My first one had misaligned blades which I tried to adjust but they would always go back. It worked OK but was not cutting evenly. Then it suddenly stopped working after about a month- no power, would not charge. I returned it for a new one. This one lasted me about 9 months and a dozen or so hair cuts before it stopped working too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it did work I got 15-20 minutes cut time-- which was fine because I was usually done or nearly so. The reports of an hour and a half are laughable. Also it would yank hairs out around my sideburns which was painful. The mini clipper is a useless, underpowered toy. And the plastic guide combs are cheap thin junk compared to the old Wahl guides from the past. One of them was broken in the box and another broke soon after. I threw them away and used my guides from the early 90&#x27;s instead which were a much thicker construction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my 4th wahl clipper in 20 years. My first one lasted 17 years and the other \\&quot;recent\\&quot; ones less than 3 years. I bought Wahl because my old one was fantastic and used hundreds of times. But the new models seem to be cheap junk and I&#x27;m really starting to doubt they make quality products anymore. If this clipper was still working I would give it 3 stars because cordless is convenient and it did cut my hair. But I&#x27;ve had two break in a years time which is a major inconvenience to me and poor quality/reliability. Because of this I cannot recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I am used to the 110v clippers and feared this one would be underpowered.  It isnt.  Works just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems louder than my other wahl (110v).&lt;br /&gt;The blades arent easily removable for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;LiIon battery will probably render the unit useless in 4 years.&lt;br /&gt;So, I expect this isnt going to last 12years (like my last one) no matter how well you take care of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small trimmer with AA battery works great too.  I shaved my beard off in about 90 seconds (i tried to bog it down by going too fast, but it did a great job of keeping up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note, I saw the same one at Wallyworld for $59 (11$ more)</li>
            <li> As other people mentioned - the trimmer is only one bad piece in the set. (I do not count the bag and cover what do not match quantity of the clipper and other parts).&lt;br /&gt;Battery capacity is exceptional. Used it 5 times with the shortest time 20 minutes and did not recharge yet. $40 is good price for clipper and combs.&lt;br /&gt;Do not by it because of trimmer, you will neither use it nor want to keep.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty machine. Detailer is powerful too if you put Nicads in it. Not the quietest or easiest  handling but probably the fastest cutter on the market. My whiskers grow fast and in every direction and many are curly, but after 3 full days without a trim, no strays have popped up and it still looks like a professional job.&lt;br /&gt;The power switch is small and needs  firm, well-aimed pressure but the location is awkward. Bummer!</li>
            <li> Good product works well</li>
            <li> Purchased this item WAHL LITHIUM CORDLESS 79600-2101 CLIPPER to replace an older WAHL corded model.  Item works well and power compares to corded model and case is well made.  Only used a few times but charge seems to hold adequately as well.</li>
            <li> Legit pair of of clippers!!!!</li>
            <li> Seem to still be working great after several months.  Able to cut my husband&#x27;s hair at home and make it look pretty decent!</li>
            <li> although it is advertized as a Cordles Lithium Ion Clipper set only one of clippers is Lithium Ion and the other requires 2 A batteries.</li>
            <li> Bad experience every single time with this item.  From not holding a charge, to the &#x27;blades&#x27; not moving, to it actually cutting hair.  Nearly everytime I&#x27;ve gone to use this cordless shaver I&#x27;ve been disappointed.  I gave it just over a month, using it to usually trim my somewhat thicker beard.. and it still is a disappointment.  After getting fed today when I went to use it I went to go process a return and found out that I&#x27;m beyond the return period.  Guess I gave it too long.  Don&#x27;t make my mistake.  LOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> THE GOOD&lt;br /&gt;The clipper and trimmer are pretty good. I added oil all along the blades on both before using, and still had some tugging from both, but I just did a second oiling and the tugging went away.&lt;br /&gt;I like the tiny charger for the clippers. It turns on a hidden blue LED on the clippers when charging, then turns off when done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BAD&lt;br /&gt;The cape that comes with this set is a joke. When sitting it didn&#x27;t even cover my knees. I got hair all over me. At the end of my haircut I pulled on it and the cords that tie it behind the neck snapped off. I&#x27;ll have to buy a better one soon.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the oil and brush on this thing are tiny and cheap like toys. These and the cape made the whole set feel cheap.&lt;br /&gt;The shears are also kind of cheap feeling. Like good arts and crafts scissors, not what I would expect from a $50 dollar Wahl set though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall expected more for my money. Not sure if all the Wahl sets have the same cape, shears, oil, and brush, but oh well, I&#x27;ll keep it.</li>
            <li> Works well after 1 use. I will update if needed</li>
            <li> The clipper is powerful and has a long lasting battery. The trimmer is powered by two AA batteries, so not so much. The set has every comb type you are likely to need for a clipper. The case is terrible, poor quality and poorly suited to the task of storing and organizing all the accessories. The result is that when you open the case, you are greeted with a hodgepodge of clipper, trimmer, trimmer combs, conventional combs, oil, cleaning brush, etc. The cape is very poorly made. The ties tore off the cape the first time I tied them. Hardware is good to great, packaging is poor to terrible</li>
            <li> I love love love this hair cutting set, best I have ever owned. I will never go back to a corded cutter. I cut my own hair and no cord getting in my way is amazing. I have had these cutter for a little over a year now and have never ran into a problem with them.</li>
            <li> The big clippers didn&#x27;t get a very close cut and the little on pulled the hairs from the soft part of my neck below the jaw bone. Ouch. I really hate that. Thanks for the return Amazon.</li>
            <li> Works well for buzzing my hubby&#x27;s head</li>
            <li> We own a corded Wahl clipper which works wonderfully. After seeing this cordless clipper by Wahl, we felt we needed to get it. But it was disappointing after using it for the first time. The clip ( the length adjustment plastic thing ) does not fit to the blade properly (loose) and kept falling off while in use. Unable to use !!</li>
            <li> I decided to go short on my hair so rather than spend $25 to get a buzz cut every few weeks decided to try this - very nicely built, lots of clipping attachments, and I can touch my hair up every two weeks or so in just a few minutes with no problems. I&#x27;ve had it a couple of months and already it&#x27;s more than paid for itself.</li>
            <li> I had this marked as 5 stars because it was everything I had hoped for, everything I wanted in cordless clippers.  But then about 16 months into using them about once every 3-5 weeks to trim my beard....They stopped working.  I&#x27;m not sure why, but they just won&#x27;t turn on.  When I plug the charger in, I hear the motor click and the blue light turn on for a second, but no charging appears to happen and it hasn&#x27;t turned on since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now in the market for new clippers, thanks Wahl.</li>
            <li> Quite simply the best cordless clipper I have ever purchased.  Long battery life and razor sharp quality with lots of attachments.  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Cordless option is so much better, no more getting strangled with cords.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews on clippers before buying this one. I like to cut my hair outside &amp; that was the biggest appeal about this being cordless. It comes with all the attachments needed to give a perfect haircut. It cuts perfect &amp; I look like I got a haircut at a salon, but I didn&#x27;t have to pay $25 for it. We have 2 small children too &amp; this comes with everything to give them a haircut too. If you don&#x27;t want to pay for a haircut then this is a great product for you.</li>
            <li> I bought this item essentially wanting a cordless option to the wahl clippers I had. I got the item, charged it up and used it the next day. I shave my head without any guards on the clippers. This pair does not cut as close as the corded clippers I have. Because of this, they are useless to me. They work and it is a nice set, but no good for me and now I have clippers that I can&#x27;t get rid of.</li>
            <li> I was happily surprised with this product.  After a full charge, I can&#x27;t tell any difference in clipping between it and the corded version.  Also, there are many clip attachments (even one for the eyebrows!), hair cutting instructions and an apron.  This is a very good purchase.  R. Cooke</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this cordless clipper set! Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I love this clipper. It works great, holds a good charge &amp; works perfectly. I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I have been getting my head shaved since I was 7 years. I have been shaving my own head since I was 19. I am now 28. Over the last 21 years, I have never found a hair trimmer that cuts hair this well. NONE!!  The blades are sharp and cut hair like butter. I was able to shave my entire head in under 5 minutes. I have owned many razors (Conair, Norelco, etc...). I love this product and am contemplating buying more as back-ups in the future. With just 4 hair cuts, your money is made back.   Along with being a head trimmer, it is great for beards, too. Also, the smaller razor is used for precision trimming and it works great as well.</li>
            <li> This was on my husbands wish list for Christmas, so I got it for him.  He loves the lightweight design and it worked well.  I love that as soon as summer comes he can cut his hair outside and I don&#x27;t have to clean up a messy hairy sink!</li>
            <li> I have a corded model by wahl and it was good except the cord would always get in the way. Once i got this it was light and of course no wire it cuts the cutting time by half beacause of no cord. The best part is you can cut your hair any where because the battery lasts quite long. The only problem i have is its a little loud compared to my corded version But it being cordless surpasses everything elce.</li>
            <li> Excellent clippers. This is the 2nd time I&#x27;m buying it. The first time I used it, a friend of mine was so impressed that she asked me to get one for her. Decently priced and power clippers. I kept thinking the charge allows an hour of cutting only till I re-looked at the package and it says it&#x27;s 2 hours running time. BONUS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do volunteer services for the old folks (who are actually quite demanding. heh) and pop up barber shops from time to time. Excellent tool to carry around in a small pouch. Clippers are really powerful and the trimmer runs on batteries which is no biggie for me. You can get a AA battery anywhere in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is that I&#x27;m running on 220-240V but no problem. I just got a transformer for a couple of dollars and ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clippers are a bit loud but it&#x27;s not a concern either. The lithium ion battery overrides that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can remove the blades for cleaning with a screw driver but be careful. The spring inside is pretty strong and it&#x27;ll pop out immediately once you loosen the screen. Takes a bit getting used to putting it back. Just stick your thumb on the blade and hold it in place and screw away ;)</li>
            <li> This has saved my Husband many trips to the barber shop!!!</li>
            <li> Battery life is good, and does a good job. Work as well as any other we have used in salon.</li>
            <li> Bought this unit less then 3 months ago.  Used it for 3 cuts...went to cut my hair for the 4th time and it is dead.  I will contact Wahl.</li>
            <li> so i purchashed these clippers and i came home and looked at the package and turned on the big clippers and it was louder than what i thought it would be, i was expecting a quieter clipper. also where the lever is on the side it catches on the plastic where the plastic attaches, which i found to be annoying. the little was a bit quieter than the big one but the way u would be using the trimmer is not comfortable in ur hand. one thing i did like thought is it it had a 1/2,1 1/2, 5,7, attachements which most clippers dont come with. definatley not recommended for any stylist professional.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my husband for Christmas, he LOVES them. Not having to combat the cord while cutting his hair or trimming his beard it a huge plus. I sometimes cut his hard and I much prefer these to the corded clippers!!</li>
            <li> Great clippers, do a great job, easy to clean with lots of guides.  Everything you  need to cut your hair.</li>
            <li> THE BIG ONE IS CORDLESS BUT VERY LOUD AND HEAVY--THE SMALL ONE IS OK BUT USES BATTERIES!!</li>
            <li> It is powerful, fast and precise. It is relatively lighter than other trimmers which makes it easier to use for long periods of time. Many accessories come into the box for different lengths and styles of hair cuts. The Small precision trimmer is a very nice addition.  One disadvantage is that the charger is not travel-friendly as it only operates on 120V 60Hz.</li>
            <li> The smaller clipper quit working by the second use. The big one cuts your neck if you try to use it as a trimmer with the cutting edge against the skin.</li>
            <li> Noisier than my previous Wahl with a cord.  The freedom to trim hair without a cord is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Before owning this product, I was commonly referred to as &amp;#34;ape&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;bigfoot&amp;#34;, and &amp;#34;Mommy, why is that man so hairy?&amp;#34; Those days are over with the Wahl 79600-2101. This cordless ax seizes hair by its throat and quickly severs each victim in a bloodless mess while taunting the remaining population with its abhorrent, albeit soothing, buzz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surrender your bio-foliage to the supreme Wahl 79600-2101, or else.</li>
            <li> My wife has been providing me with haircuts for most of the 50-years that we have been married. We&#x27;ve gone through quite some quantity of clippers. Our 1st clipper was one of the manually operated units. Then we graduated to motorized. Most of those motorized units failed due to dullness, cutter-blade rust, broken parts or motor conk out. With this pair of Wahl Clippers my wife can now buzz through the job like a pro and make me look like I&#x27;m always ready for the Gandy Dancers Ball.</li>
            <li> While the performance was fine (cut smoothly, reasonably powerful though not like their corded models), the battery situation is a problem on these.  I cut my hair once per week.  I always take the time to fully charge after each use (but not overcharge).  The battery on this lasted about 15 weeks (15 haircuts) and then died.  I took it apart, and it&#x27;s got a commonly available cell inside.  So, I put in a higher capacity cell with the same output, and it worked again.  However, that battery was also ruined after about 15 weeks.  The battery I used is exactly the same (brand and size) as one I use daily in a high-power flashlight; the flashlight gets recharged about once every three days and has lasted for over 2 years with virtually no decline in performance (so I&#x27;m 99% sure it&#x27;s not the battery itself).  I did notice that there&#x27;s a little circuit board right on the battery in the clippers... I assumed it had something to do with recharging the battery.  However, I would say that it&#x27;s a chance that the board is the problem (or perhaps even planned obsolescence seeing as it rapidly destroyed both batteries).  Regardless, there is a problem in the way it charges (or maintains) the battery which results in rapid failure.  Swapping the battery out helps for a little while, but it&#x27;s hard as the battery was not designed to be replaceable.  My advice - get something else.  I&#x27;m still using mine, but I have to have it plugged into a wall to do it... kind of defeats the purpose of \\&quot;wireless.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;*Update*&lt;br /&gt;Wahl contacted me and rapidly sent me a unit in exchange for mine - they even paid for all the shipping.  The new unit is just slightly re-designed, so it would appear that something has been updated.  Trimming capability is just as good as before.  Hopefully, this one wont exhibit the limited battery life I experienced with the old design.  I will update later on that.  In the meantime, I want to give Wahl (and Colleen at Wahl) praise for their customer service.  Notmany companies take the initiative to make things right for their customers these days.  Wahl went above and beyond to fix this for me, and I truly appreciate the high standard of their customer service.&lt;br /&gt;*FINAL UPDATE*&lt;br /&gt;I have now had the chance to evaluate the replacement clippers for 6-months worth of haircuts.  The clipper has performed flawlessly and has held its charge between haircuts perfectly.  There has been no apparent decline in battery capacity.  THIS is what I expect of Wahl - a great product that performs week after week just the way it should.  Again, I want to thank Wahl for taking the time to proactively make this right for me.  I am amending my review rating to reflect my experience with both the replacement product and the prompt, respectful customer service.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, I bought it for my brother. He has been using it to trim his hair, thus saving the monthly barber cost, moreover he is also using it to trim his 3 year old sons hair. The multiple size heads are very good and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Worked great for over a year, but then became unchargeable (and hence unusable) after sitting in storage for a few months.  The replacement battery costs almost as much as the device (note that these new ones use a 3.7V battery and not the more common 2.4V of predecessors).  If Wahl is headed towards a &amp;#34;made-in-China&amp;#34; disposable level of quality, I suppose I will just replace with a cheaper competitor and plan on buying a replacement every few years.  My previous Wahl lasted over 15 years...</li>
            <li> We liked the clipper.  We found it light and easy to use.  It is noisy so we rated it with three stars.</li>
            <li> I wish there were attachments longer then the size 8 clip.&lt;br /&gt;The cordless feature is the best!&lt;br /&gt;remember to charge after use and to oil the edge and you&#x27;ll be in good shape.</li>
            <li> great clippers and comes with a bunch of extras</li>
            <li> I have used other brands of clippers but Wahl is the best. It&#x27;s quiet, gives a great cut and holds a charge.</li>
            <li> I have been waiting years to get one. This was a great purchase. One minor thing, is it does feel &amp;#34;plasticy&amp;#34; but it performs like a champ. I tell my wife i could shear a sheep with this thing. 5 haircuts and havent had to charge it yet :)</li>
            <li> These clippers work well EXCEPT I now have had a second pair of the Ion Cordless clippers die because they will not charge. The good news - I sent my first one back several months ago and they were replaced no questions asked. However, I just plugged the second pair of Ion cordless clippers I keep at our vacation home into the charger and........nothing. It&#x27;s dead. Not happy and now am faced with spending another twenty dollars returning yet another pair. I will not buy another pair of these and will move on to something else. The other issue I have with these is the charger plug and indicator light on the clipper, both poorly designed/constructed. Wahl has always been a quality name but they missed the boat on these particular set of clippers.</li>
            <li> These clippers cut great and are easy to use.</li>
            <li> Louder than his corded set, that&#x27;s the only complaint</li>
            <li> love it would buy it again works well stays charged great cut</li>
            <li> Wahl is by far the best consumer products out there. I have used other products and they were no near as nice or good of quality as Wahl.</li>
            <li> Shipped on time. The clipper is awsome, powerful, ergonomic and stylish. I would suggest a little rubber band tail attached to the end to the clipper would help prevent it falling from your hand and the little detail trimmer to be rechargable as well, but over all it recharges fast -it takes maybe 4 hours- after that it last a lot -I havent timed it yet- very strong just like any corded clipper. look pretty well and brings every thing you could need to get started -even oil-. Totaly worth the purchase. Very satisfy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a corded Wahl clipper for cutting my hair (I do it myself) for about 10 years.  I finally have the freedom to position it as needed without worrying about the cord, and this has just as much power.  I&#x27;ve used it three times over 2 months off a single charge.  Win.</li>
            <li> The smaller clippers did not work.. It was a Christmas gift for my father.. I was a bit disappointed..</li>
            <li> I have had wahl clippers before but this is the perfect clipper. it seems to give me a much smoother cut and no cord to wrap around your neck. good job done wahl.</li>
            <li> great clippers, I recommend this product to everyone</li>
            <li> CHARGE PROBLEM ! only reason gave it a one rating, After third use, I left charger plugged into clipper, but was unplugged from wall.  This drained battery. NEVER LEAVE CORD PLUGGED INTO CHARGER. I put a piece of tape on cord reminding me to unplug  from clipper after charging.  This is expensive approx. $25 battery. I was able to revive battery. I have older Triton lipo charger because I fly rc planes and helicopters. Warning this is dangerous, lipos are very flammable if you short them, maybe should be done outside! I charge lipo&#x27;s in a old crockpot !  I bared a spot on the wires, neg and pos, away from each other so they can&#x27;t short, then connected to older triton lipo charger  with alligator clips for about 15 minutes or so.  Then wahl charger was able to finish charge. Next time i&#x27;ll just buy one with a cord, cheaper and seem more durable I think. Oh yea put oil all over metal parts after using, it&#x27;s like a corrosion magnet. even though kept oiled looks  like it is slightly starting to corrode,  cheap metal, no metal coating or whatever. Otherwise have used maybe six times and it has more than  paid for itself. Never use the extra cheap trimmer that comes with it.  If you drop it that would suck, have not dropped yet. About every three months I kneel down over dry  bathtub and use #2 size adaptor and go to town, nice and short, then ear trimming adaptors and pretty much all done, about 15 min. then vacuum hair from dry tub</li>
            <li> long lasting battery,, and,, good quality,,</li>
            <li> Nice that it is cordless, but didn&#x27;t shave as close as my corded version.  Use when I travel for shaving my head.</li>
            <li> My Husband was Thrilled when My cordless clippers came within 2 days. He had Me charge them &amp; that same night got a haircut. He couldn&#x27;t believe how fast I got done &amp; that there was no fussing with a cord. Only down fall was the cape that came with, it&#x27;s cheap with 2 short ties to close. I tossed that one &amp; kept the one I had.</li>
            <li> Awesome.  Third clipper I&#x27;ve  owned and by far my favorite.  Great cut and great battery life.</li>
            <li> Very cheap construction.  Lots of plastic that  fits poorly.  The clipper will actually scratch you unless you have one of the plastic guides attached. Plenty of accessories, even a bib and a couple of combs and useless cheap scissors. Noisier than most clippers I&#x27;ve used.  The beard trimmer requires batteries and I haven&#x27;t bothered with it at all.  I may have missed it but there was no mention of that in the description.</li>
            <li> arrived intact, on time, and works great</li>
            <li> I used to have a heavy duty corded, then switched to the light norelco trimmer for cutting my own hair. Trouble is the power on the trimmer is weak and i would have to go over one area multiple times to make sure the cut was good. I started shaving my son&#x27;s head and found the trimmer so painful to use so decided to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- it is super powerful like my old corded, one pass and it takes off all the hair&lt;br /&gt;- lithium lasts long and holds charge very well&lt;br /&gt;- comes with small mineral oil bottle, this does need to be oiled regularly to prevent rusting and good function&lt;br /&gt;- comes with many size attachments&lt;br /&gt;- seems fairly waterproof. i cut my own hair in the shower and it seems to be unaffected&lt;br /&gt;- small trimmer i haven&#x27;t used yet as my norelco still works fantastic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would definitely recommend highly and buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way if you want more mineral oil go to the anti-constipation section of walmart/target and get their mineral oil in large bottle. yeah yeah i know, kinda gross but it does work well and is dirt cheap.</li>
            <li> I first bought one of these Wahl Lithium Ion clippers a couple of years ago and it worked for about a year until it died and would not charge. As I did not save the receipt I had to throw it away and as it cut hair decent enough while it worked, I bought a new one from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well It&#x27;s now 8 months later and my second one has now died with the same exact problem and will not charge. Sure, I could get a replacement for this one but I&#x27;d have to go through a hassle of getting a replacement and wouldn&#x27;t be able to cut my hair in the mean time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chances are I&#x27;ll just throw this one in the garbage too as even if I went through the hassle of getting a replacement, I don&#x27;t have faith that a 3rd will last any longer than the first 2. Instead of getting another lemonithium clipper, I&#x27;ll likely get the Wahl 5 Star Balding clipper instead.</li>
            <li> I shave my head once a week. Bought this to make the process easier.&lt;br /&gt;After using it twice , I am very happy. Cuts very well and smooth. Cut my time in half</li>
            <li> Nice clippers but my battery is not holding a charge. Put it on the charger overnight after cut so ready to go for cut next week and it is always completely dead. Further, even if I plug it in will not cut for any period of time as apparently charger does not deliver enough juice. Assume I just have a bad battery and will have to return.</li>
            <li> this is the first cordless clipper i&#x27;ve owned. i think it&#x27;s awesome. i wish the beard trimmer was rechargeable as well.</li>
            <li> I used mine about three or four times and then it died. Will not turn on even after being charged, This was a gift so I emailed customer service to ask how to handle a warranty claim and they never answered. No method of contacting customer support worked so I took it out and put it in dumpster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED INFORMATION. Wahl has re-gained my confidence as I received in the mail a new set of clippers to replace the ones I threw out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously there was a breakdown in email communications and they did not receive my email about the product failure. They have given us a stellar level of customer support and I will again buy any product made by Wahl and I suggest the same to anyone reading this post!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Wahl Customer support. You are the best!</li>
            <li> Awesome clippers. Cut like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li> I am nearly bald with nothing on top and some hair on sides and back of my head.  I use the Wahl cordless clipper and the Number 1 comb 1/8 to buzz my entire head.  It is easy enough to do myself.  I buzz my head every 2 weeks.  So far I have had the kit for nearly 3 months and I am still on the first charge.  For the money it cannot be beat.  I have seen other comments concerning that the blade cannot be disassembled for cleaning.  I just clean what I can and keep it oiled after every use.  So far no problems but 3 months is not a good test.  It does cut quick, even and does a great job.  I am so glad I did not spend hundreds on a more professional clipper because this is the bomb and I am completely satisfied with it.  The smaller trimmer that comes with the kit I use for side burns and around ears.  The trimmer takes batteries, I can&#x27;t remember if they are triple A or double A but they are still working for this 3 month period.  Since both the clipper and the trimmer are cordless I wanted to make sure you knew that the power of both units is incredible.  Don&#x27;t fear not having enough juice power through the job.  Units sound and act as though they&#x27;re plugged into power.  Not bad at all considering these are battery powered devices.  Buy with confidence it works great!  So why 4 stars and not five?  The case sucks!  All they had to do was put a piece of cardboard in the case walls to give it some form of rigidity and I would have given this kit 5 stars.  The case flops around and sometimes (for me) the contents will fall out if not handled perfectly.  Because the clipper and the trimmer are fairly heavy for such a flimsy case they fall to the floor.  Luckily they are tough enough to survive a fall or two.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Arrived before I expected and worked perfectly .</li>
            <li> It works well as expected. I  like this product. Battery lasts several hair cuts.</li>
            <li> Bought  this for my son who shaves his head.  He loves it and says it shaves very close,  which is what he prefers.  He is on the road a lot so he wanted one that was battery operated and is very pleased with the performance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic and have sharp blades give perfect result and sizes very suitable for palm and contain the bag on many options and wonderful&lt;br /&gt;But there is a problem in operating the machine button big it impractical never having a hard time because he is running for Aetjob Sometimes I wish from the manufacturer to focus on this problem</li>
            <li> Thought smaller trimmer was also cordless but discovered it ran on AA..all in all very happy with purchase of convenience and mobilbility</li>
            <li> Although this clipper cuts my hair great (I shave my head twice a month with it) unfortunately the charging system failed after a couple of months.  Now after it is charged the bright blue charging light stays on permanently, even when unplugged.  There seems to be nothing I can do to fix that so after I&#x27;ve cut my hair it steadily discharges.  Then two weeks later when I want a trim again the battery is flat.  So I have to remember to charge it the night before always.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s irritating, but I can live with it without the bother of sending it back to Wahl.</li>
            <li> I bought this primarily for the Lithium Ion battery given that my prior Wahl harit clippers were NiCad and 15+ years old and I had changed batteries twice already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s improved:&lt;br /&gt;-Lithium Ion batteries: are a big improvement over Ni Cad (which have annoying &#x27;memory&#x27;) or even NiMH (which don&#x27;t have memory but lose charge just sitting unused).  Lithium Ion batteries hold a charge for a very long time so are an excellent choice for this device.&lt;br /&gt;-Adjustable head: with no attachments clipped on the head, theis lever permits adjusting how close the clipper will cut.  This is handy for trimming around the ears.&lt;br /&gt;-Modern design: sleeker and more comfortable in the hand than the old design&lt;br /&gt;-Accessories: lots of clipper accessories in this kit ...more size selections than previous kits -- probably more than you&#x27;ll ever need since a 3-4 size would have been fine but you get more than a half-dozen for the clipper-Packaging: comes in a zip case that hold everything.&lt;br /&gt;-Bonus trimmer (that runs on one AA-cell) ... and about as many clip-ons for the little trimmer as for the clipper (way mre than you&#x27;ll likely ever need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minor faults:&lt;br /&gt;-Non-removeabel head: one of the reasons I think the old trimmer head lasted so long is that the head was removeable so could easily be cleaned and thoroughly lubricated after each use.  I did this after every use (only takes a minute or two) and after 15 years of regular family haircuts it worked as flawlessly as it did on day-1 (except for the old NiCad batteries)  This new design does not permit removing the head.  Instread you just blow out the debris, use the small included brush to &#x27;whisk&#x27; away any hairs and the place 2-3 drops of oil on the head, run it for 2 seonds to spread the oil across the head, wipe it with a tissue and put it away for the next use.  However, I&#x27;d prefer if the head were removeable so it can more easily be cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;-Supplied oil: a very small amount of special, non-gumming, head lubricating oil is provided.  However, if you clip the spout and put the cap on it WILL leak all over the case, so either keep the oil separate r put it in another container.  This is an annoyance, especially since Walh tells you this is special oil and don&#x27;t use a different oil.  That said, on th eold clipper I used a professional serwing machine service oil and never had any problem.  Since the supplied oil will only last a dozen uses or so, you&#x27;ll want to pick some up.&lt;br /&gt;-Scissors: the scissors they supply with the kit are, understandable, cheap ...but they do work.  Do yourself a favor and go online and buy a good pair of barbers scissors if you plan to do any serious scissors cutting, then the ones from the kit can be used in teh workshop of for your kids class projects ;-)  The scissors work fine but are clumsy for serious haricutting chores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I gave this product a 4 out of 5 stars for the above reasons (chintzy oil container and scissors) but I would nothesitate to recommend it -- it&#x27;s the best home-use clipper and trimmer on the market especially at this price. Overall it&#x27;s an improvement over the prior Wahl NiCad clipper kits and the Lithium Ion battery works awesome -- you can put it way after a couple of uses and take it out a month later and there&#x27;s no loss of charge.  I&#x27;ve done two haircuts back-to-back on a fully charged battery, then did another a month later and there was still plenty of charge.  Only drawback to Li Ion is that onc eit runs out of charge it happens quickly ...with little warning.  Good thing is that you can plug it in for just 15 (if needs be) and won&#x27;t affect the overall capacity (no memory) of the battery.  So, I&#x27;d recommend you charge it fully after every two or three haircuts and should be fine on battery capacity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small single-AA trimmer (for mustache and neck-line etc) works surprisingly well ...still on the original AA battery after several uses and seems just as strong as firstuse, so my guess is the battery will last quite some time.</li>
            <li> Strong durable but pulls hear and is kind of heavy.  Like the smaller charger and cool blue light indicator. Didn&#x27;t use the small one but not high expectations.</li>
            <li> Fantastic quality and good battery life retention...well worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> We use the clippers weekly, so far so good. The two sizes are nice for general cutting a more detailed work around the neckline and ears. It came with a very basic cutting guide that was nice and holds a good charge. The cape was cheap but protected from a majority of the hair, I bought a replacement to actually keep hair off the clothes. The big trimmers don&#x27;t cut as close to the skin as the industry ones do. I&#x27;m not sure if this is to keep DYI barbers from cutting themselves or what. But it means the edges and sideburns are never shaved to the skin and need to be touched up more often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with them and I use them about once a month.</li>
            <li> Been using this clipper for months and it&#x27;s still on the original charge! Cuts well and it comes with a lot of clipper guides. The only small small con I&#x27;ve manage to notice is the power button. It&#x27;s not the most usable design, but this is very minor. Good purchase overall.</li>
            <li> Great product - light and easy to use</li>
            <li> Just as powerful as my old Wahl clippers</li>
            <li> 45$ and comes with everything you&#x27;ve every needed to cut hair, trimmer seems strong, wahl is a solid company. should last for years</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Charges fast and lasts a long time.  Very well made and sturdy.</li>
            <li> This unit comes with everything you will ever need to cut hair, even oil to lubricate the blades between cuts.  Nice carrying case for portability.  Comes with Scissors and combs too.  Every blade to cut whatever length you require.  GREAT PRODUCT!  The cordless feature is amazing and so easy to use.  Best buy from amazon.com.</li>
            <li> your product was excellent I&#x27;m very happy with itthank you so much for your product</li>
            <li> Came earlier than promised and exactly as described!  Easy to use.  Great explicit instructions for cutting hair included!</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my boys&#x27; hair since they were old enough to get their hair cut. I have used Wahl clippers ever since. These new cordless clippers are really great. In the summer, I cut hair outside and with the clippers being cordless, it really makes it more convenient! Plus they are Wahl clippers!! That&#x27;s the best part! This is an excellent product!</li>
            <li> I would have thought this product was better, but if you are looking for an extremely close shave, then I would stick to the regular wahl or remington trimmer...non-cordless one</li>
            <li> I ordered as a gift to someone and when they received it, something was missing out the box - a pair of scissors</li>
            <li> After spending hours trying to figure out the right clipper on Amazon, I finally made the jump and got this one. It was not easy to make a call based on others&#x27; reviews, and more so given that during the process, I became all paranoid about some of the reviewers vested interests in placing either a bad review or a good review...&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, as you can see I&#x27;m sort of new to the &#x27;Amazonia&#x27; rage. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love Amazon... Enough rambling, here is my review: Trimming my hair with this machine was as painful as pulling hair out of my nose! The machine was not cutting smoothly and blocked continuously at certain parts of my head (for no apparent reason, I have no head implants and no head scars... I promise). Also, you won&#x27;t get a close cut with this machine. DO NOT BUY!! My lesson, pay a bit more a get a proper one.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working well. A little heavier than I thought it would be</li>
            <li> Its a good product, however, the faceplate on the big cutter came off so now it rattles away. Nothing a bit of crazy glue can&#x27;t fix. Battery lasts a very long time. 4 or 5 haircuts over span of a few months before it even sees the charger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Wahl products for years and this one hasn&#x27;t disappointed me at all.  Read several bad reviews, but haven&#x27;t seen any issues after a few months of use.  We do lots of hair cuts and these clippers are as easy to use as any, no pulling, switches work fine, cordless is very nice, holds a charge through three or more hair cuts.  We put it on the charger between cuts after the 2nd haircut (5-10 minutes) and it works great.  Very pleased with this product and am glad to recommend it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I bought this product for cutting my son&#x27;s hair in place of a corded machine which my son complained was uncomfortable. The machine feels smooth when cutting and is as powerful as a corded machine, my son also commented how much he likes the way it cuts and that it felt comfortable.</li>
            <li> 2 haircuts down and it&#x27;s performed great so far. Battery is holding a charge well when not in use also.</li>
            <li> These were nice clippers but they didn&#x27;t cut short enough for me. There is only 2 blade settings and neither allowed me to cut short enough. I have several thinning spots on back of my head and it seemed to make these areas more pronounced since it cut some but not all of the hair. It was uneven looking. I know what I&#x27;m doing so it&#x27;s not user error. I&#x27;ve been using a Remington corded clipper that cuts close but wanted to try a cordless unit. I will say that these were powerful and the unit is well made.</li>
            <li> Great clippers, plenty of power to get the job done, quiet, minimal vibration, and a nice storage case to put them away until next time.</li>
            <li> Good value here.  Just be careful if you use it as a body clipper with no guard as the blades and &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; one in a while- it&#x27;ll sting !!</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as describe. I give this as a gift to a friend thats is learning barber hair cuts, and he love it!! plus amazon made speedy delivery A+++&lt;br /&gt;i do recommend tis product.</li>
            <li> I did not believe noise level would be an issue but my dog hates this compared to the corded clippers I only use it when I am in a pinch and the cord is getting in the way!</li>
            <li> These cut smoothly and very quickly! Wish we had switched to these sooner. My husband uses these and I use them on my 3 year old son too! It goes so quickly that my son does not mind getting his hair cut!!! They come with a guard for trimming around the ears and I found them to be helpful. Love Love the lithium ion battery!!!! Big and heavy but not too much so at all.</li>
            <li> This went to my husband who cuts his own hair and all 3 of our sons. He loves it. The trimmer is a great adition, as we have only had the main clippers up until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cordless feature is WONDERFUL - really makes cutting everyone&#x27;s hair that much easier!&lt;br /&gt;Price was right for what we purchased.</li>
            <li> I tried to give Wahl a chance to make me happy but it just didn&#x27;t happen. After owning the clipper for just a few months (which means only using it a couple times) it stopped holding the charge. I contacted Wahl and I sent it back at my cost of shipping for repair and it was supposedly fixed but still does not hold a charge more then 90 seconds. It says you can use while plugged in too but that does not even work as it dies when plugged in, not sure how that is possible. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 05/07/2014: I was contacted by manufacturer and they sent me a brand new unit and a return label to ship the defective one back. So far after a month (about 2 uses) it is working much better.</li>
            <li> This clipper is great and real easy to use.  As soon as it was fully charged I got to work.  By simply following the instructions that come with it I was able to give myself a great haircut in only a matter of a few minutes.  It is simple to use and comes with everything you need. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to save some money and cut your own hair or family&#x27;s hair at home.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews on these clippers, I decided to go ahead and buy them. I used them for the first time today and was pleasantly surprised with how strong they were. I don&#x27;t know for sure, but it felt like they cut better than my old plug-in clippers (also Wahl). Also, being wireless, they make clipping my hair much more convenient. As a matter of fact, my entire routine has just about changed because I no longer have to be tied to a wall socket.&lt;br /&gt;So, yeah, I&#x27;m a huge fan and would definitely recommend these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: May 20th, 2014. Going from five stars to two. The battery no longer holds a charge. I know it&#x27;s been almost two years since I bought these clippers, but for the frequency I use them, I really expected they would last longer. A lot longer. When they worked, they were great, but for the price, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re worth. Looks like I&#x27;m going back to corded.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my wife who is a professional cosmetologist.  She uses them to cut my hair as well as our two sons.  These clippers really get the job done, and the lithium ion battery means she can cut all our hair and still have plenty of charge left in the battery.  She says they are as good or better than some salon clippers she has used.</li>
            <li> Has lots of accessories and makes cutting and trimming almost fool proof.&lt;br /&gt;It is everything I expected and more.I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I previously had a corded Wahl for several years and got tired of hassling with the cord.  I&#x27;ve had this one a few weeks, use it about 3 times a week.  It seems just as powerful, works great, have had no problems with battery life or recharge rate.  One earlier review said you couldn&#x27;t remove the blades for cleaning, but again this is is similar to my old corded one, and the blades are easily removed.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cordless one and have always considered Wahl one of the best. This one is no different.</li>
            <li> Been using it for over 3 years. Wahl resharpened the blade for free!</li>
            <li> very well made and hi quality thing , but unfortunately didn&#x27;t work on 220V and didn&#x27;t fit to any European sockets . It is 110V and with US sockets ... So i have to buy another omvolter  from 220 to 110 V , and another think to fit in to  US to EU sockets ... But anyway i&#x27;m happy with it :)</li>
            <li> Good machine.&lt;br /&gt;No trouble.</li>
            <li> Clippers work great, attachments seem a bit cheep. Beard trimmer has no attachments. Guess you freestyle.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that they&#x27;re cordless and very powerful.</li>
            <li> Great clipper. It holds a charge for a long time. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is I wish it would cut a little closer.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift. It was a hit.</li>
            <li> I no longer fight the curled cord when cutting my hair. Life is SOOO good. lol</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best cordless clipper I have owned. It&#x27;s quiet, powerful, and allows me to give myself a haircut in less than 5 minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may be obvious for most users, but be sure to clean and oil the clipper after every use. Otherwise, it starts sounding like it&#x27;s running out of juice because of the friction between the blades.</li>
            <li> I have bought many clippers over the years (primarily from Wahl), and have witnessed the evolution of this product to what it is today. This is the alpha dog of all clippers, and they should just stop selling all other models. The cordless aspect of these clippers make them superior to all others, as you can trim/shave your head hair to perfection and not be bothered with the annoying cord, which always gets in the way. Plus mine came with the mini-clippers which is perfect for trimming your hairline precisely and evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re tired of paying $20 for a haircut, then you need to buy these.</li>
            <li> Stopped charging after 1 year.  I have sent back to factory for repair.  We will see what happens.</li>
            <li> It works great, no clipper attachments to small unit. They are just trimmers. I thought it was a traveling kit.</li>
            <li> I was looking to replace the plug-in version of the Wahl I currently own with a rechargeable version. I was also looking to replace my trimmer. The small trimmer that comes with this set does not come with any attachments and the overall build quality is not as nice as the plug-in versions (they feel light and cheap). So far the battery on the large clipper seems to hold up well.</li>
            <li> VERY FAST VERY SMOOTH</li>
            <li> These are very handy and work great. Love that they are cordless.</li>
            <li> I wanted to learn to cut my hair and save some money so i bought these clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me just these are phenominal. I have been able to cut in all sort of places in which i would never be able to because of a cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being cordless allows me to go into my yard and do a quick buzz cut or trim and leave the mess on the grass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the little trimmer is great for the ears and my neck hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit pricey but it is well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery lasts for hours&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: So I ended up dropping the trimmers on the ground as I opened up the carrying bag. The blade teeth broke clean off. Small little things so no surprise there. After an email than a phone call i purchased a new set of trimmer blades for $6.95 -free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wahl has great customer service and after immense research they really put a lot of love into their product. I will recommend and buy from Wahl with all my hair cutting and trimming needs.</li>
            <li> Large wall works right after a short charge. Very sharp blades, cuts just as good as the corded one I had before.  The smaller one is very good, a little louder than my older corded one but is so nice not to be fighting with the cord, cuts very precise and is easily stored in the case.  Kit comes with a pair of sissors, several attachments, a plastic drape and oil and combs.  The attachments are well made and snap on nicely. The small one doesn&#x27;t have attachments.</li>
            <li> They are OK the trimer pulls ur hair.</li>
            <li> These clippers work extremely well and have held their charge for five uses without any noticeable reduction in power.</li>
            <li> At first my hubby thought this was too big and heavy to use as a beard trimmer. Was going to return it, but he decided to give it a try and really liked it. So now I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great clipper. I have been using this for almost a year. Holds a great charge and the more you use it the better you get. My haircuts now look great, take 5 minutes and I have saved hundreds of dollars on salon cuts. I recommend this. Skip the expensive salon and cut your own hair. It&#x27;s easier than you think and this is a great clipper.</li>
            <li> Very happy with Wahl clippers</li>
            <li> I have these and I love them. I cut a lot of hair and they stay charged really well. Sometimes they will pull a little when the charge gets low. I just have to slow down a little to get through the haircut. Then, I charge them and they are good as new. They cut smooth and are light weight. They fit really nice in your hand. Perfect for a beautician. I can&#x27;t say enough about them. I am very partial to Wahl. I have owned several different models.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Almost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a cordless clipper, but after 1 charge the charging LED got stuck,&lt;br /&gt;so now even after I unplug the clipper from the charger the LED is still on and&lt;br /&gt;draining the battery. so basically I lost the cordless functionality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing.</li>
            <li> These are a nice set, defiantly get the job done.</li>
            <li> The product is good and it does it job properly. However I thought it would be a little bit more sophisticated, but that is just the looks. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to a friend</li>
            <li> it was a gift and he is still using it.</li>
            <li> I got it about 2 maybe 3 years back and the only problem I have had with it is that I lost the charger. I cut my hair every other week and it works like a charm. You can do about 25-30 cuts without charging it and for the money it&#x27;s the best deal I have found.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of clipper reviews before buying these Wahls. They seem to strike a nice balance between power and price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit comes with everything you need, including cleaning oil and normal hair scissors (in addition to the two pictured cordless clippers). There&#x27;s even a booklet on how to cut hair with the kit -- which I should&#x27;ve read instead of watching the numerous YouTube tutorials. It was far more to-the-point and useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Tip: Divide the head into regions, use ascending numbers from bottom to top, blend with a rocking motion.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me: Male, 30&#x27;s, thin, straight hair. No power issues and I doubt there are for guys who are lucky enough not to be as far as I am on the way to Baldsville. I still don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing and yet I&#x27;m already getting many complements on my cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;The free case that holds everything could have more pouches to keep things organized. It could be a nicer material. I&#x27;m sure the barber&#x27;s scissors are not top-of-the-line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But really, if all you got was the main clipper set, this would still be a great value. Throw in the trimmer and all the other bibs and bobs and it&#x27;s still less than the price of a salon cut. Happy chopping!</li>
            <li> Before buying this Wahl I had been using cheaper clippers from other companies. I am amazed by the huge difference in performance. With this clipper I cut my hair ten times faster than before. It works as smooth as the professional clippers of hairdressers. It also works nicely for beards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using it in Europe, so I had to buy a convertor 230/220V -&amp;#62; 110V, but that is cheap and easy to buy. So no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really recommended!</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd one I&#x27;ve purchased. After being unplugged for a few days the would not recharge.</li>
            <li> this is my second set, first one the interior charging plug broke inside so could recharge the unit, checked the website to see if I could find a replacement part.......NL. I am very pleased with this unit, it even self sharpens.</li>
            <li> I had an older version of this clipper with the cord, and I have to say the new one is not as good.  I was trying to replace the older one, but I find myself using that more than this one.  I forget to charge it and then it&#x27;s not ready to go when I have to use it in a rush.</li>
            <li> Finally, a powerful,long lasting, multi use, multi attachment follicle cutting device that is cordless! No more unwelcomed strangling attempts by the dang cord when getting creative shaving the bank of your head. Best clippers I&#x27;ve used in ten years. Bonus mini trimmer could use attachments though...</li>
            <li> charge lasts a good long time</li>
            <li> This is really an amazing product from Wahl&lt;br /&gt;I use it for one year now and it works very well. Being cordless is really awesome and makes me move freely during hair cutting.&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts long time and even I don&#x27;t remember how frequently I charge it but it is really infrequent&lt;br /&gt;With this clipper you&#x27;ll be like a professional barber, I even didn&#x27;t go for hair cutting outside for a year now&lt;br /&gt;having your own clipper protects you from disease transmission and save your money&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend even if you&#x27;ll have regular hair cut with a barber as you&#x27;ll be able to trim your hair in between hair cuts and during your travel.</li>
            <li> Machine was broken very noisy and prolonged use heats up...I&#x27;m disappointed and oil training bak if I gat the owlish</li>
            <li> Wahl has to go back to the drawing board with this one. The 79600-2101 is a waste of money, has anyone out there tried to establish a line with this thing? It can&#x27;t be done! the adjuster simply cannot fade. My $20.00 Wahl works better!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Easy to use and very convenient since the main clipper can be charged and used on the go</li>
            <li> DISPOSABLE CLIPPERS. Use once, throw away.  Won&#x27;t work a 2nd time.  Don&#x27;t worry about the money, your pet is worth it. And if you don&#x27;t believe the review here, remember AMAZON reviews only gets published if you praise the product. So really great product. But disposable</li>
            <li> Amazing, love the style, and its efficiency</li>
            <li> Good basic trimmer which does everything you would expect it to and the battery life is amazing.  I trim my husbands hair (buzz cut) every week without fail, this trimmer allowed us to do 31 trims on one charge.  Worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just used it for the first time for my sons (with a thick hair)&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s very comfortable, easy to handle, a lot of clips, and long lasting Battery.&lt;br /&gt;the haircut went like a pro ...</li>
            <li> Ok for use, but the small one sounds too loud. It can scar babies. The big one I still not trying yet.</li>
            <li> Amazing clippers! Decided to spend some money on some decent clippers, and these work perfectly. I have pretty thick hair and most other clippers have to go over a line of hair a few times. These never pulled and always just shredded through my hair like a flaming knife through butter. Love them 10/10</li>
            <li> I like these. I will list some good and bad things&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good:&lt;br /&gt;They cut well. only needed to go through once for my hair to be buzzed.&lt;br /&gt;They are rechargeable&lt;br /&gt;I used it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;it comes with a lot of clips, 2 combs, oil and a tiny brush to get hair out of the clippers.&lt;br /&gt;they cut evenly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bad:&lt;br /&gt;they are loud&lt;br /&gt;although i don&#x27;t thing they will break, the length clips for the clippers aren&#x27;t completely hard plastic. if u touch it, it can wiggle.</li>
            <li> Seem okay, just not what I really needed.  My bad.  Many thanks</li>
            <li> Two young boys hair to cut. One long charge in the clippers, even through the squirming and sliding around in the chair, I have less of a problem, because, I have a powerful set of clippers with no cords to get tangled up in with all the movement&lt;br /&gt;of my grand sons.  Cutting hair just got easier.&lt;br /&gt;Pastor in Detroit.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: This shaver has once again stopped charging. SECOND TIME! Just out of warranty. I will NEVER buy another WHAL product. It stayed in the bathroom and I was overly careful with the charger. OLD REVIEW: Great shaver.  No cord, cuts and trims perfect.  Best I have had.  But after a short time the charger would not work.  It is very fragile where the plug incerts into the shaver.  I bought another one after trying other shavers.  Just beware of the charger connection to the shaver.  That&#x27;s the reason for three stars.</li>
            <li> great device&lt;br /&gt;works well, the battery lasts several cuts without recharging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ótimo aparelho&lt;br /&gt;funciona bem, a bateria dura vários cortes, sem precisar recarregar</li>
            <li> Great deal and nicequality set of hair tools. I have used it several times now and I am very pleased. It has already paid for itself in haircut savings.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe that Wahl would put their name on this, the company must have been sold. Look up the name for a &amp;#34;Chinese Boat&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I recommend it 100%. All accessories are good. Is fast to charge the battery. Is very good, i love it.</li>
            <li> After proper installation of 2 AA batteries, the detail trimmer worked for approximately 2 seconds then died.  Either order another detail trimmer product, or just do not place an order for this product.</li>
            <li> Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;-Set comes with a regular size trimmer and a detail trimmer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;-No stand for this unit ... so it isn&#x27;t grab and go.  You have to find somewhere to lay it down along with the accessories. This tends to create clutter on dressers, bathroom counters, etc.&lt;br /&gt;-Charging cord does not fit securely into the trimmer.  It is very loose and could come disconnected at any time while charging.&lt;br /&gt;-No clip-on length adjustments for the detail trimmer&lt;br /&gt;-Expensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE AFTER 3 MONTHS USE:  This unit will no longer hold a charge and is unpredictable when it will actually turn on.  I would go back to a corded trimmer that is made of higher quality.</li>
            <li> We were paying to have my husband&#x27;s hair cut every three weeks. He had started keeping it very short so we decided to do it ourselves. We bought this clipper and it works great. Paid for itself in 3 haircuts. It even gives directions on how to cut the hair in sections. Works great!</li>
            <li> I love my clippers and trimmers and don&#x27;t have to worry abt cords is awesome :)&lt;br /&gt;Battery works great even when I haven&#x27;t charge it that day</li>
            <li> really like this clipper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros:&lt;br /&gt;cordless&lt;br /&gt;good for fades/tapers&lt;br /&gt;many accessories&lt;br /&gt;good price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;not as powerful as corded clipper</li>
            <li> This is a good product but the large hair clipper has a short battery life compared to the trimmer.  We keep the clipper charged and we clean and oil it regularly.  The small clipper lasts seemingly forever (we have purchased the two clipper kit three times since 2009 and the small clippers are all still working fine); however, the large clipper has had to be replaced every 28 months on average.  My wife cuts my hair once every 3 weeks.  That would be approximately 43 haircuts, then the battery dies. The small trimmer sis used constantly for trimming between haircuts, and all three of them are still working fine.&lt;br /&gt;Wahl products are my wife&#x27;s favorite for the quality of the cut; but not the quality of the battery life.</li>
            <li> Used only twice and stopped cutting my hair and started pulling it. It has been oiled and taken care of. Not sure why it stopped working. Have used other Wahl Lithium Ion clippers and they were great. Bummer</li>
            <li> I bought this for a gift and it was well received.  He loves all of the accessories and said that this makes quick and accurate work of his trimming and head shaving.  The battery holds a good charge.  The bag and bib are a nice touch.  It is assembled in the US, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> This is the best clipper i&#x27;ve ever used. Excellent battery life, clear sharp cuts. LITHIUM ION is the only way to go</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s for my husband and he love&#x27;s it, It&#x27;s just what he needed and wahl is the brand he really likes.</li>
            <li> I had &#x27;The other major brand&#x27; of clippers for years &amp; it always took around 45 minutes to give my grandson a buzz cut. Kept them oiled as instructed &amp; always chalked it up to my grandsons baby fine hair. It&#x27;d jam up in the clippers, bog them down &amp; pull at his hair. I&#x27;d have to take painfully slow shallow passes to keep from hurting him. These clippers amazed me, they went through his thick fine hair like a hot knife through butter. Single passes took his hair to the right length &amp; I was through in about 10 minutes complete with trimming around the ears and neck, made nice by the included trimmer clippers. Even cleanup was easier since the hair fell together in clumps that didn&#x27;t scatter due to the ease with which the clippers went through the hair. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll have the charging problems other&#x27;s have commented on, but I charged them for a day when I got them 6 months ago, cut his hair 3 times since then &amp; they&#x27;re going as strong now as they did the first use. Grandson says he&#x27;ll ask for haircuts more often now since this is so painless.&lt;br /&gt;They also  work great for keeping my beard trimmed, and will take neck stubble down almost as close as my razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an anniversary gift for my boyfriend. He is in the military and he loves it. We have noticed that the small one actually cuts closer than the larger one. He can be picky so if he likes it-its great! This would also work great if you have kids or have a small on the side job of cutting hair-Im not a barber but it seems to come with everything!</li>
            <li> Love the hair clippers, don&#x27;t care for the beard trimmer.  The hair clippers hold a charge great, I mean really great..  They are also very sharp and cut hair easier than any previous clippers. It feels light and somewhat cheap, but it&#x27;s holding up very well and no issues.  I take these with me on business trips and it&#x27;s easy to cut my hair with them.  I don&#x27;t bring the charger as it&#x27;s no problems lasting several hair cuts. The beard trimmer is ok, but I use an even cheaper one that also takes batteries.</li>
            <li> Wahl quality in a cordless. Check back in five years....</li>
            <li> Saw this product originally at BB&amp;B, bought it online, and now 1 year later - still happy and going strong with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wireless clipper is a godsend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uses I&#x27;ve come across:&lt;br /&gt;- if you&#x27;re traveling on the road / to a new country for several months and don&#x27;t want to fuss with adapter/transformers (it will last you about 5-6 haircuts I estimate).&lt;br /&gt;- If you cut hair outdoors (I have a project where I give free haircuts on the sidewalk or at events I&#x27;m invited to)&lt;br /&gt;- If your bathroom doesn&#x27;t have an outlet and would require an extension cable (yup)&lt;br /&gt;- If you cut your own hair and don&#x27;t want to get tangled in the cord and yank on it and accidentally make a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;- Cutting hair at friends place (can literally throw it in your pocket with their clipper size)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The huge kit it comes in is a bit overkill. The hair tarp thing is not the best quality, nor are the scissors etc. It&#x27;s a starter pack - but the main product is good. Overall, why buy? Investment. Save over $400 on haircuts a year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using these 2 years later. They work pretty well and the battery lasts a while. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s starting to clip unevenly because it&#x27;s something I&#x27;m doing or what, but I&#x27;m thinking about trying a different brand.</li>
            <li> I got tired of twisting around a cable to cut my husband&#x27;s hair. They are pretty decent for the price point. I assumed the trimmers wear rechargeable too but they require a couple AA batteries.</li>
            <li> Love the cordless design. The small trimmer is really loud. Scares my son. The larger trimmer is quieter.</li>
            <li> Very nice cut the case it comes in could be better but overall very nice clippers they cut my hair like butter not to loud they dont make my hand go numb love them</li>
            <li> Wahl products are usually reliable. That&#x27;s why I replaced my old machine with this newer battery operated one. It may be just mine, but the battery never hold a charge.</li>
            <li> Better than expected !</li>
            <li> Did not want to spend as much for clippers, but glad I did.  The cordless feature is the best, no longer trapped in the same place cutting my hair.</li>
            <li> The clippers hold a charge FOREVER! I traveled for over a week and never used the recharger! It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Colleen/Customer Service ... STOP the apologies and have a sit down with your engineers about replacing or recalling the Lithium Ion battery ... because in the end the clipper is only as good if it actually charges,holds that charge and actually works so spare the customers the constant apologies and the &amp;#34;1-800&amp;#34; number and fix the issue that so many of us are complaining about !</li>
            <li> As soon as it was charged I gave myself a haircut. Looks great except a little short. I ordered the 1 1/2&amp;#34; comb for my next cut. I figure I save $20 on each cut so I put an Andy Jackson in the safe each time.</li>
            <li> After buying several sets of wahl clippers, I was glad to see that they made a cordless version. Comes in a nice zip case to store all the guide combs, with a small trimmer great for over ears and back of neck trimming, and have had them for going on five years now. I am looking around to see if I can get replacement blades for them and I feel a need for a little defense... I have not had a single iota of a problem with battery life, I have plugged it in for a full charge and cut my own hair once a week, and another person&#x27;s hair twice in two months before needing to plug them back in for a charge, and even then they weren&#x27;t completely dead.  --- S*** happens, people. Those of you who have had a bad experience with battery if you aren&#x27;t willing to let someone from their customer service help you out and get you a new set because you happened to get a faulty set, then you shouldn&#x27;t bother complaining about it. Not allowing them to correct the problem for you when they offer means it is your OWN FAULT that you are now out the money and don&#x27;t have a functioning set. They have tried to make it right, so it&#x27;s on you for not letting them. EVERY company, that makes anything at all OCCASIONALLY has a bad egg.  --- My PERSONAL experience, ten minutes charge gets me a haircut with no cord in my way. Just hoping now that I can get new blades, mine are dulling and beginning to tug a little. *** I DO recommend that you buy some more oil for the blades, seeing as the set comes with (I think) a ONE ounce bottle. ***</li>
            <li> All I can say is it will make haircut so much easier. I would absolutely recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended. Good use on a single battery charge.lots of accessories provided and useful too.can be used while traveling without the chager</li>
            <li> This the best set of hair clippers!! Lots of size options and especially like the dual power source-battery or electricity!!!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the clippers so far (have only used twice). Would have been good to have some different sized plastic guides for the small clipper. The only gripe I have was that the chrome handle of the large clipper was all scratched up making it look second hand</li>
            <li> We love them and found them easy to use.  We highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately no charger was sent unable to use the item.</li>
            <li> Big and bulky. Eye brow trim runs on AA batteries. No impressed with clips for the price. Should have bought the set sold at Costco.</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers 2 years ago and they still work like new. These clippers are great. Clean cut every time.</li>
            <li> Works Great and Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Tried something else.  NOPE.  Came back to this one.</li>
            <li> The clippers cut well but get caught on the skin if they are not held totally flat on my head. They don&#x27;t cut the skin but pull it. Very annoying.</li>
            <li> My husbands been using this since christmas and it works really well.  cuts great, cordless, easy to use.  Not complaints at all, especially since i managed to get it for 50$</li>
            <li> Great clipper. It&#x27;s done very well for me and continues giving excellent haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small secondary trimmers is pretty much a joke, but that&#x27;s not why I bought this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lithium-ion battery is the way to go. It holds the charge quite well.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality blades, as a Hair Solon for 35 years these blades are pro quality!  The attachments are excellent also with additional ones for special application. It has a great contoured grip and its great not having a cord wobbling around when you try to make a precision line cut. Also it is very powerful compared to my last non professional corded version. I&#x27;ve been retired for 10 years now, but still get to cut family and friends and this clipper is by far the best I&#x27;ve used to date that is for a reasonable price. Like I said it cuts and has the power of my older pro clippers, but those are 3-4 times the cost. The smaller clipper is also amazingly powerful and cuts great, my only wish is that it was rechargeable, rather than 2 double A&#x27;s. But regardless this combo still get 5 stars from my point of view, as it&#x27;s wireless, very powerful, top notch blades, cuts great, and all for a great price!</li>
            <li> We previously had a corded version - this cordless one is still great Wahl quality, but more flexible and therefore can be used anywhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend and would buy again.</li>
            <li> Just what they said it was and did the job extremely well.</li>
            <li> This ciipper works great and has plenty of battery life, but it doesn&#x27;t trim as close as I would like. I dished out a few more bucks and picked up the Wahl Chromado and that thing is much better.</li>
            <li> I keep my hair short and I cut it about once a month, but I always forget to charge it. Though it has enough juice to get the job done, I can tell the power difference from a full charge. It looses a star because the preset guide locking mechanism is loose and the guards don&#x27;t stay down. Also they are all black and not color coded so looking for a different size is a little annoying.</li>
            <li> These work well but art not very sturdy the blade on the big one had a part of it break off and i&#x27;m not even sure how it happened I did not drop it or anything and I only had it for around six months. The small one had the plastic part that closes on the battery break off as well. Other than that they do cut pretty well.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Quiet and nice cut.</li>
            <li> The battery makes all the difference, it holds a charge a long time , and adds extra power to the clipper. The 2nd small clipper makes a good mustache clipper.</li>
            <li> Forget Hair Club for Men and transplants and sidecombs.  I&#x27;ve shaven it all off.  All my peachfuzz and sparsely scattered remnants of what was once a head full of hair.  Now that I&#x27;ve pretty accepted my tonsure&#x27;s fate as being bald, this Wahl 79600 is pretty much not much of use to me, but hey, it looks good.</li>
            <li> I already had a small lithium ion Wahl trimmer and really liked it, so I decided to purchase the larger cordless clipper via Amazon.  It&#x27;s awesome!  The clipper holds a charge for a long time and cuts even better than the corded Wahl it replaced.  Since I already owned a small rechargeable Wahl clipper, the one that comes with this product is a throw-away as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  I didn&#x27;t even put batteries in it to see how it works.  Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased and highly recommend this kit!</li>
            <li> Very Happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and these cut right through it without any resistance. Amazing set of clippers, and a great price too.</li>
            <li> Great kit.  The four stars is only because there is no real easy way to put the various pieces in order to make them easy to find.  That is more a bag design thing than unit design.  It needs a better carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, I would rather they have been absolutely bold type up front about the smaller clipper not being Lithium Ion and they should have a nose hair trimmer attachment for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solid though.</li>
            <li> Been using for 2 months now to shave my head weekly. Still only charged the big guy once and haven&#x27;t recharged yet. Used the smaller clipper for a travel head full head buzz, but not nearly as smooth and easy as the big guy. You certainly get every possible accessory with this set guides galore, scissors, hair clips, apron. I just wish they put more effort into the case. It&#x27;s flimsy and has no real way to organize all the guides they give you.</li>
            <li> Not as sturdy as my last Remington clipper. The silver decorative part moves around as if it&#x27;s a cheap add on. The power button on the main large clipper is very difficult to activate, one must literally push the button into the body of the clipper to turn it on or off which is odd as the smaller clipper has a very nice, easy to use slide on/off switch. They both cut very well and came with many clipper guards that fit the large clipper only. I like both of them, I could do without that horrible power switch. I am happy for the price paid.</li>
            <li> Neither of them work and I was really disappointed. I am still in disbelief that they lasted such a short time.</li>
            <li> I use this machine for three months, all is well, his hair cut himself, grandson. Knives with sharp shear machine smoothly without jerking. Overall, I am satisfied with by this unit convenient and not expensive for the family will I like it</li>
            <li> Works well enough. There is some pulling though which is something my boyfriend hates. I feel like when I cut his hair it doesn&#x27;t cut it even. I have to go over it numerous times because there are lots of strays.</li>
            <li> I really like the clipper. Build quality feels good, battery lasts plenty long for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that from the description, I expected the detail trimmer to also be rechargeable, but instead it uses batteries. I ended up going out and buying a rechargeable detail trimmer, which also ended up having a lot more features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The description needs to specify that the detail trimmer is not rechargeable.</li>
            <li> Been using this for about a year now. The big razor is perfect, nothing has gone wrong at all! The smaller ones battery life seems to be less than it was but still works so no real complaints.</li>
            <li> Great product!! This is the second time buying these clippers and the only reason I&#x27;m buying a second one is because I dropped the first one and broke the tines. It still runs great though even after two years.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend any one to purchase.</li>
            <li> The cordless feature is a plus…lithium battery lasts long, but the second time I went to use the clipper, I noticed that the blades were slightly rusted…I oiled the blades and ran the clipper for a little while before using it, however, the blades kept pulling on the hair causing pain…couldn&#x27;t use it after that…I never had problems with my other clippers blades rusting before,  especially after just the first use…and, I used the clipper on &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; hair.  Am very disappointed about that!</li>
            <li> The trimmer had no guide attachments making this piece useless to me. I have a beard and this would have been very helpful. I can use the clipper/attachments but the clippers are a little to big to get around the nose/ear area! The clippers do well on shaving my head and being cordless works great. I would say more like a 3 1/2 to 4 star, but still rather ticked that they would not include trimmer attachments!</li>
            <li> I got these the other day, because my old ones finally crapped out on me, and I&#x27;m glad I got these. It works great, and would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> The timing for the delivery was perfect. The product seems very good. I enjoyed having the small machine because it helps to make the details when you&#x27;re almost finished. The small one works with battery and the bigger is chargeable. One thing I definitely didn&#x27;t like was the on/off button of the bigger machine, I hope it endures for a long time but it seems fragile.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts on this because i&#x27;ve never tried a cordless Clipper,I was amazed at the cutting power of these clippers,the Chrome accent doubles as a  mirror which helps to see weird angle cuts. I would recommend these to anyone</li>
            <li> These clipper are amazing! It&#x27;s cuts smoother and faster than my old clipper. Now I can cut hair to any places where it doesn&#x27;t have outlets. I can use these clipper if my friend is in need of a haircut. Love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice to have a cordless clipper. My wife has been  cutting my hair for 40 years.Now in the warm weather it is so nice to sit outside and get a haircut</li>
            <li> Great gift for my son and he uses it daily.  So far still going strong.</li>
            <li> Right now the only thing I found that I think could have been better is the carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case needs more pockets for all the loose pieces.When you open the case, all the&lt;br /&gt;pieces can fall out easily if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, no problems.</li>
            <li> I heard great things about this product and can&#x27;t wait to try while hunting and while being in the woods.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get a cordless clipper, but it does not hold a charge.  Even if you continuously leave it plugged in you might get through your next haircut, but if you don&#x27;t plug it in immediately it will not hold the charge.  I left it unplugged for a couple of weeks and now it will not charge at all or cut your hair with the cord plugged in to electricity..</li>
            <li> This was a very good purchasing experience.  The item was just as described and was shipped immediately.  I really liked it.</li>
            <li> Would have gotten 5 stars if they had they included several attachments for the smaller clippers.  Two or three step attachments would help for some fine-tuned trimming</li>
            <li> I got these clippers to replace an old pair of corded ones. Very smart choice. These clippers are very powerful and sharp. The battery last for months and the overall build is high quality. The only complaint I have is since these clippers are so sharp they will cut you easily. Other than that I would recommend and even buy these again if needed.</li>
            <li> Love the cordless I am in a wheelchair&lt;br /&gt;Cut my husband and sons hair.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with many  attachments very happy with the product</li>
            <li> These are wonderful, the best part is having no cord!</li>
            <li> Used only once so far. Will be cutting again tomorrow. I have thick hair. Clippers are very sharp. No snagging. No nicks or cuts although I am careful. No cord!&lt;br /&gt;A zero is not as close as previous clippers I use that are half the size but with a cord, but close enough to blend at neck with a razor.</li>
            <li> Great! I&#x27;ve been using with my husband and son for about 2 years with no problems.</li>
            <li> Love the cordless feature and unit stays charged for a long time without having to recharge.</li>
            <li> I always cut my own hair since I keep it so short. I had a plug in Wahl clipper to keep my hair short but it didn&#x27;t work so well last time I went abroad. I used a voltage converter, but it still made a sound like a machine gun! So this time, i bought the cordless version. Charging it was not an issue and you didn&#x27;t need it to be plugged in in order to use it.. GREAT! It also made me wonder why I didn&#x27;t switch to cordless earlier.. the wires always get in the way. And I get about 3-4 good sessions before the battery dies.. not bad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is that if the batteries die while you&#x27;re half way through a cut, you&#x27;re stuck standing in the bathroom naked for about 20 mins while you try to get a charge out of it (at least, I don&#x27;t wear clothes while trimming my head.. I&#x27;m not sure how everyone else does it ;) Hopefully its not TMI! hahaha..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wish Wahl had put a battery level on the unit so you could tell that it needs a charge before you start. Get on it guys!</li>
            <li> My husband shaves his head every three days or so. He really likes the quality of this clipper. It does a very close clip and he likes the convenience of the the cordless.</li>
            <li> Excellent clipper, good value</li>
            <li> Not as great as I expected material seams cheap and small clipper requires AA batteries plus it dose not one with attachments, it also doesnt cut as close as my 15yo wired wahl</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair for years and I&#x27;ve always have had problems with cords tangling. I obviously don&#x27;t have that problem with this cordless clipper. It&#x27;s great - keeps the charge well and doesn&#x27;t take long to charge it from empty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Wahl clippers for over 15 years and have always been satisfied so when I saw a commercial for their new Lithium Ion cordless clipper. I didn&#x27;t think twice about buying it. In fact I bought 2, one for my brother as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;Once I got the clipper in my hand, I thought.. Man this feels cheap.. Plastic like and very light.. After giving it a charge, I decided to try it out on my brother. You have to press the on/off button pretty hard for the switch to click. It is so cheap that the plastic body feels like its going to crack every time you turn it on/off. I than oiled the blade and gave it a run. The blades don&#x27;t cut as close to the skin as my older Wahl clippers. I also had to go very slow with it cause the blade starts to tug on the hair if you go fast. After giving it about 5 minutes I went back to my old trusty corded Wahl clippers. Hoping to return this one. Also the small clipper that you see in the pic does not come with any clips for length adjustments. It is not chargeable and runs off a aa battery. I found those to also tug on your hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this cordless clipper as an early Christmas present for my husband and he absolutely loves it.  It makes it so much easier for me to give him a hair cut, because we can go out on our porch and don&#x27;t have to worry about the hair getting all over inside the house.  The clipper stays charged so long, that I can do his hair, beard, mustache and still has enough charge to trim my own hair.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews, or at least until I have used the item, but this one compelled me to do so even before using it.  Albeit, I will update this after using it....  The Good:  - clipper made in the usa  - lithium ion (will update this 2 years from now see if it has the same juice; which is the primary reason to go li-ion over nicad/nimh  - small charger  The Bad  - think of the cheapest plastic possible, now imagine all the accessories made of 10x cheaper plastic  - clipper body barely cuts it  - clipper metal head has a raw look to it, as if right out of a cast  I will update this review with the its performance in a few weeks.  ----------------  Update 2/17/2012:  I&#x27;ve used the main cutter a number of times.  The battery lasts long; I have not had it run out on me yet so I don&#x27;t know the limit.  I&#x27;ve recharged it about 3 times and used the trimmer about 20 times.  The little trimmer good for going around the ear and hairs under the nose/upper mustache, but it is very loud when going around the ear  So far, it is doing its job well and have not had any issues with functionality, so I am upping it to 3 stars.  I would give it 3.5 if I could.  Not at 4 yet.</li>
            <li> I bought this as Christmas gift for my boyfriend and he loves it. It was shipped so fast I managed to get it a few day before Christmas.</li>
            <li> Nice clipper for the money seems to cut very nice and the trimmer works well too. I would buy it again if I needed to.</li>
            <li> These are the first clippers I have every owned. I did a small amount of research before my purchase looking for customer ratings, quality of product and cost. I think this one is a winner. My hair has been in a pony tail for years (20). I had to face to the facts, I&#x27;m getting older and the 60&#x27;s are not coming back. I used scissors to take off the length and then cranked up the Wahl. I was very pleased with how easy it was to cut my hair. The multiple guide combs worked like a charm. I kept changing them until I got to the desired length. So barring any mechanical failure, like I said before, I think this one is a winner.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my husband&#x27;s older set - he loves this set and swears by it.</li>
            <li> Used these for about a month now, all works well, nice cut.</li>
            <li> I GIVE MYSELF A HAIR CUT EVERY WEEK. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Best of the home-use cordless trimmers I&#x27;ve found.  Seems very well-made.  I give it 4 instead of 5 because after a year or two it has been getting louder and it vibrates more than when it was new.  But overall it&#x27;s a great product for this price.  I shave my head every 2 or 3 days, so it gets a lot of use.</li>
            <li> The Clipper cannot be fully adjusted to shape the hairline.so for people of African descent please do not purchase this Clipper. besides that the clipper seems solid.</li>
            <li> Hard to judge... Pulled a lot at my hair each time until I realised that there was a broken tooth on the upper blade. Not easy to accidentally break a blade so can only assume it came in the box as it is now..... Annoying I have to fork out for a new wahl blade set...</li>
            <li> I have been using this product eversince and very good for 4X2 cut. Most importantly without the cord, I can do it all by myself.</li>
            <li> I brought and my clippers 12/19/14 . and i have to say i love them . I cut both of my sons hair , and my own with this product ,and still have enough juice to do more hair cuts . only peeve is that the trimmer did&#x27;nt come with a battery . small peeve. its a great beginning for a single father on a budget who wants to keep there boys neat a trim.</li>
            <li> LOVE these things!!! Great value for the price, and cutting my husband&#x27;s hair is now SO easy!!! :)</li>
            <li> 4/3/16 update- replacement clippers are still going strong, so that&#x27;s good. I realized, though, one other feature the clippers desperately need is a low battery indicator (maybe an LED light or something) that lights up when you have around 30 minutes of use left (at least enough time for one more haircut). I used to leave my clippers charging all the time, but in my current living situation it has become a little more of a nuisance to do so. So now when I use it, I&#x27;m always wondering if it&#x27;s going to run out of juice in the middle of my haircut. A low battery indicator would help me to charge it only as often as necessary.  --- 4/20/15 update- About 3 weeks ago, I went to charge my clippers but the blue charging indicator did not turn on. I discovered my clippers could no longer charge or receive power even when plugged in. It was completely dead and unusable, after owning it for only a little over a year. (With my use I only need to charge it about once every month or two so the problem could have happened as much as two months ago and I just didn&#x27;t know until 3 weeks ago.) I called Wahl and they said it has a 5 year warranty and that I could ship it to them and that they would send me a free fixed or replacement clippers within 2 to 3 weeks. So that&#x27;s what happened and now I have working clippers again (so far). They look like the same clippers I sent them judging by the wear, but now the clippers charge. They also sent me a new different looking charger in addition to my old original charger. They put a note on the old charger saying not to use it anymore, so apparently that charger was at least partly to blame for the malfunction. Granted it&#x27;s not ideal that the clippers stopped charging in the first place, and that I had to be without my clippers for a couple weeks, and having to package and ship the clippers is a bit of a chore, but otherwise the customer service was good and the replacement process was relatively painless. The only thing I wish they did waspay for my shipping. I had to pay to ship to them, and they paid to ship to me. It would have been nice if they emailed me a paid shipping label to print out. Hopefully these clippers don&#x27;t have the same charging problem after another year. If it does I&#x27;ll be sure to update this review. Also I should note.. I&#x27;m not sure... but it seems like these clippers are louder than they were before. It could be my imagination. In any case, I compared them to my corded Wahl clippers and it&#x27;s at least 3 times louder. The corded clippers sound like a faint electric whir, while the wireless clippers sound like a loud mechanical buzz. Not a deal-breaker for me, but if you&#x27;re sensitive to that kind of thing, or if you are giving a haircut to a young child who might get scared, it could be an issue. I&#x27;m lowering my rating to 3 stars from my original rating of 4 stars, because though the customer service was good, I still had to go through the hassle of replacing the clippers, plus I had to pay for my own shipping, and also I realize now how loud the clippers are. --- (Original review)  I had another Wahl clipper which served me very well for many years (and still works perfectly actually), but I really wanted cordless clippers, so I got the Lithium Ion.  I&#x27;ve had it for a couple months now and have used it a handful of times cutting my own hair, and as expected it works great and is much more convenient being cordless.  Note- I can&#x27;t review the included trimmer because I&#x27;ve never used it.  I really didn&#x27;t want it in the first place but it didn&#x27;t seem possible to buy the clippers by itself.  First off, cordless anything is awesome, and these clippers are no exception.  No more spinning around, ducking under the cord, worrying about where to plug in, messing with extension cords--it&#x27;s great.  I can&#x27;t say much about battery life and charging, except that in my usage I&#x27;ve had no problems.  Unfortunately my haircuts are too brief (10 min) to test the battery.  And I always leave the clippers plugged in and charging when I&#x27;m not using it (according to the manual, it can&#x27;t overcharge, which is a very convenient feature).  Of course, the clippers&#x27; main function is to cut hair, and like my previous corded Wahl clippers, these do it perfectly.  There&#x27;s not much else I can think of to say regarding that.  It just works.  Wahl seems to make great quality clippers that last for a long long time.  I have a feeling these are going to follow in that same tradition.  The only major complaint I have about the clippers is that the weight is not balanced.  Most of the weight is in the head/clipper area, not the handle, so it ends up feeling top heavy and not entirely secure in the hand.  I feel like I might accidentally drop it so I&#x27;m very conscious about holding it tightly.  I&#x27;m considering somehow attaching some sort of weighted material to the bottom of the clippers to make it more balanced, but haven&#x27;t thought of a good plan yet.  Two more minor things... - Because of the shape of the body of the clippers, when you pivot the blade length adjusting lever, the body of the clippers slightly interferes with the movement of the lever.  So if you try to pivot the lever while slightly pressing down on it (haphazardly with say, your thumb), it will catch on the body of the clippers and get stuck.  You have to consciously move the lever a certain way so that it doesn&#x27;t catch on the body.  I&#x27;ve gotten used to it so it&#x27;s not a big deal for me, especially since I don&#x27;t adjust the lever often.  Nevertheless this seems like a very plain oversight in design and it makes me wonder how an obvious design flaw like this could have made it past product testing. - Corded clippers usually have a little rubber loop where the cord meets the clippers, used to hang the clippers on a hook.  This can be very useful and it would be great if these clippers had a rubber loop too. (edit- or a lanyard?)  Despite these few issues, I don&#x27;t regret buying these clippers.  The pros definitely outweigh the cons for my use.  I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I bought a Wahl beard/hair clipper from Bartell Drugs in Seattle some 15+ years ago for about $15. It was a powerhorse until my cat knocked it off of the vanity recently. Some of the casing broke and apparently the blow killed the wiring as well (it kept tripping the circuit breaker... not cool).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I ordered this cordless Wahl clipper. Cordless is nice! It&#x27;s much lighter than my previous clipper. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s good or bad. It came with a cheaper-feeling trimmer clipper. Everything seems to be working well so far, but I&#x27;m waiting to see if the clipper stands the test of time like the one it replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fingers crossed!</li>
            <li> I like the large clipper and the small clipper. the gripe I have is that&lt;br /&gt;1) the small clipper uses replaceable aa batteries and&lt;br /&gt;2) small clipper is not rechargeable. Also the listing did not state that the small clipper comes without any guards for different types of trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the listing needs to be more forthcoming. Jim</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these clippers for 5 or 6 hair cuts and they work great!  No complaints.  If you want to save money by cutting your own hair these will do the job well.</li>
            <li> I was happy with this trimmer until it died about a month ago. Tried contacting Wahl through there website about getting a replacement battery with no response. I would expect it to last more than a year and a half if the parts are not replaceable.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these Wahl 79600-2101 clipper sets about 4 years ago. It worked flawlessly for about 4 years. One day I tried to use it, but the battery was dead and it refused to charge. :(&lt;br /&gt;I emailed customer service attaching a copy of my e-receipt for the original purchase. Wahl apologized for the inconvenience, said I was covered under the 5 year warranty, and rush sent me a new clipper set. I returned the broken one. I am one happy Wahl customer! #AwesomeCustomerService</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this clipper for close to three years now, and I&#x27;ve already sent it in once for it being completely dead (the charging indicator light wouldn&#x27;t turn on when plugged in and it wouldn&#x27;t charge or turn on -- I kept it plugged into the wall for days... No light or charge).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took two weeks for it to return (my hair grows back very quickly, so I need these on a weekly basis). It has died again on me. Same issue. I refuse to wait another two weeks. Why wait a month&#x27;s worth of time? That said, it works well when it does, and it&#x27;s saved me hundreds of dollars. Too bad it doesn&#x27;t work, and Wahl customer service is slow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I almost forgot. They made me pay for shipping the clipper to their repair center. Are you serious?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR Avoid Wahl products unless you like poor and slow customer service and unreliable products</li>
            <li> Just what my husband wanted!</li>
            <li> Been using both of these for two years and recommend very highly.  One would only say the larger clipper was&amp;#34;loud&amp;#34;  if they never got a haircut before.  These both are very good products and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this clipper set for over two years now and I am charging it for the first time as we speak.  Ordinary care is required aka put a little oil on the blades and you should be fine for years.  The little clipper is a throwaway little thing but works in a pinch.  It is loud so care is needed around your ears...</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a long time , and charges quickly. You get all the attachments you need , to cut your hair.  Reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li> Item as described .. Fair shipping time . Happy with the service . Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with this li-ion unit!  No cord to mess with, it has a long charge, and does just what I need for trimming my son&#x27;s hair once a month.  Turn on his favorite show on the tablet, and I get a pretty easy experience with a great tool!  My old corded Wahl would vibrate my hands too much and got too hot, it was uncomfortable to use.  This unit stays cooler, vibrates far less, and is easy to use!  I am happy!</li>
            <li> The big pair of clippers is light, charges fast, and is the LOUDEST pair of clippers i&#x27;ve ever used. they cut great but sound like you&#x27;re holding a lawn mower next to your ear. The smaller pair run off 2 AA batteries, which sucks IMO, wish they were rechargeable like the big one. Kind of a short cut. but again, they cut great.</li>
            <li> So far I have used it once to trim my thick goatee, using the adjustable guide and it did a great job. The only issue I have is that the guide is not smoothly adjustable.</li>
            <li> Wahl should drop the scissor&#x27;s and make the included oil in a larger size.</li>
            <li> Cordless is nice - battery powered trimmer seems cheap.</li>
            <li> I feel that this Wahl 79600-2101 Lithium Ion Cordless Clipper kit has been unfairly judged by reviewers who regard the clipper as &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;cheaply constructed&amp;#34;. This Li-ion powered clipper is simply lightweight and having hoisted heavy corded Wahl clippers over my head for years, I welcome both the lightness and battery power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The companion trimmer is AA battery powered and also works quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Wahl needs to improve upon is the included zipper bag and hair length adapters. These do neither the clipper or the Wahl name justice. Please hear me Wahl Corp., and market this product in a manner deserving of a low-cost, high quality product that bears your name.</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers to replace an old set of Wahl clippers that finally bit the dust.&lt;br /&gt;I was excited when it arrived because it was cordless and adustable, without using guards. But, when I moved the blades up and down, it moves unevenly, which would give you an uneven cut. Also, the plastic handle area did not fit together right. I returned it before using it, as it was obviously a low quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I did end up buying the similar product from Andis, and have now used them a couple of times. Though it was a roughly the same price, the Andis quality is much higher.</li>
            <li> Unit won&#x27;t charge nor work with the cord in less than 4 months time... Company is willing to repair or replace while under warranty with no charge except shipping which personally, i think should&#x27;ve been covered as well due to total failure of the product.  Not the best shears either.  Cutability is only barely average.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this set of clippers and returned it. I never used it. I left it in the bathroom overnight to charge and the blades rusted. My other Wahl and Conair clippers have spent their entire life in the bathroom with no issues.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for the job(s) intended.  Perfect price. Easy to clean and maintain.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use. Recommend it to all+-</li>
            <li> The best hair clipper I evere had. I recommend it to everybody. You will not regret it. So very good!</li>
            <li> After 4 months or so&lt;br /&gt;**********************&lt;br /&gt;I saw many reviews about how loud and bad this thing is, but it is not too loud and not too bad. Great, that you can use it with or without cord. With cord it is more powerful. Without cord more comfy. Only con is that it is not water proof, can not use it while showering yourself. But it doesn&#x27;t stop my husband to use it in shower anyway, just gotta be careful. Blades are made of steel and looks like good steel.&lt;br /&gt;About extra stuff in package: scissors are fine, colorful heads are quite too cheap, but not broken yet. Shoulder covering thing was thrown right the way. Trimmer is a nice addition, nice for travel pack, cuz it uses AA batteries which are easy to replace.&lt;br /&gt;Overall feeling is not bad, worth money that you spend, 4 stars for cheap extra stuff in package.</li>
            <li> Kind of noisy but works. Used once so far. Very manual.  Previous cordless hair clippers (Phillips in Europe) much easer to adjust by dialing in blade extension instead of manually switching between all those plastic clip sizes.  Unfortunately could not charge in the good old USA.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this clipper.  Worked good for 2-3 uses, and then started leaving cornrows in my head as I shaved-my head looked like a crop field.  Been using clippers for 10 years, I maintain them well with oil and cleaning.  This one just works horribly.  And now I can&#x27;t even get my money back because its beyond 30 days.  Waste of nearly $60 bucks.</li>
            <li> the only think i didnt like is the fact that the item looked as if it was used for very long period, everything else is fine</li>
            <li> so far so good. the trimmer isn&#x27;t very sharp but the price is right for a cordless clipper!</li>
            <li> This is the second pair if these I have owned and the first pair lasted 3 yrs.  Works great and no cord or cables to get tangled up in.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed as the smaller clipper doesn’t contain the lithium ion rechargeable battery. It is powered by dry battery.</li>
            <li> The smaller trimmer uses regular battery&#x27;s and is not rechargable</li>
            <li> It does the job..But it&#x27;s a bit loud..</li>
            <li> I definitly recommend this product. The quality is great,its light weight, its cordless thats also great. To all women out there, buy this for your partner they would love you for it. Belive me...coming for a guys perspective. 3 thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Wish the mini clippers were lithium ion battery too</li>
            <li> the wahl product is great but good condition 100% better than thought it is really good proffesional use it everyday</li>
            <li> I shopped for days trying figure out which clipper would serve me best and decided on this one because of a good history with Wahl and the lithium ion battery it has. I have gone to Lithium Ion on everything I purchase anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Finally got a chance to use it the other day, and gave myself a high and tight on the first try. Did it myself just looking into the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to handle and cuts perfectly. Looks like the same cut I was paying $15 for at my barber.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a ton of accessories and easy instructions. Charges fast and runs for plenty of time on a charge.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for personal use. The blades are very sharp. Be sure to put the oil that they provide you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guide combs snap on very nicely. You might find it kind of hard to take on and off upon initial use but once you start using them, they snap on nicely and secure and can be interchanged very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that this model is wireless. I can take it with me in the backyard or in the bathroom and not have to worry about finding an outlet. I charge the battery for 2 hours for it to fully charge initially. It lasted for my entire trim (about 30mins).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little trimmer is handy too for sideburns. This one uses a AAA battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far so good. I have no complaints after a couple weeks of use. Will update this review as I go along.</li>
            <li> The larger hair flipper is fine. Works as advertised. The smaller battery powered is not. Underpowered and not of good quality. Three stars mostly for the price.</li>
            <li> This is my second pair of these (I left the first in a hotel).  They work very well, I use them to shave my head and trim my beard.  I&#x27;ve noticed the small AA operated trimmer does not operate long on before draining the AA.  The rechargeable is much sturdier, but I&#x27;ve noticed I have to be a little more careful with this trimmer than my first one as I&#x27;ve had a few cuts when running it without the guard.  Perhaps I just need to slow down.</li>
            <li> works great, so much easier than messing with a cord.</li>
            <li> After reading a billion reviews and comparing all types of clippers I decided on these - a christmas gift for my boyfriend. So far so good - he says the cut quick and perfectly and loves the easy cord free feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend these for all of you searching for a nice pair of clippers.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think I was going to get something this big with such impressive build quality, but here it is.  Does a great job, plenty of trimming sizers too.  The little trimmer is a pretty handy accessory too</li>
            <li> so far so good. I will check back in a couple of years to tell how the battery life is.</li>
            <li> Bought it for the large clipper. I have had a large Wahl plug-in clipper for years. The cordless is great. Lightweight but strong. It came with tons of guards that are for longer hair, but not many for shorter hair. Why? To cut long hair use scissors. What I would rather have is lots of shorter hair guards like for cutting a \\&quot;fade.\\&quot; It also came with a 1st class zippered carrying case with slots of scissors (and a pair of scissors) and accessories, which is a classy feature. I always expect a class act from Wahl. Very happy with this relatively inexpensive product.</li>
            <li> This product is so lightweight compared to other clippers that the first time I used it my hand slipped and cut too much off. It definitely takes an adjustment but it is perfect. The cordless aspect is clutch. Only negative is that it fell off the counter already and chipped the blade on one side. Totally user error but other Wahl clippers I&#x27;ve had before have not broken so easily. Still a great buy.</li>
            <li> As good as corded versions</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a gift for my son&#x27;s birthday.  He travels a lot and he is definitely enjoying it.  My sons have all grown up with the Wahl brand.  They have always been a good value for the dollar.</li>
            <li> Clippers worked fine until I had them 20 months. The clippers quit taking a charge and won&#x27;t even work with charger plugged into them. I was happy up to then but very disappointed in how short of time they lasted.</li>
            <li> This thing has been put to work. (not professionally) You know that sound a lawnmower makes when when it gets into tall grass? The rpm&#x27;s slow, the exhaust pops and gurgles, the grass isn&#x27;t evenly cut. You will not run into that with this machine. It slices! It dices! It will shave you bald in a moments notice. Hopefully the last one I ever have to buy!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and value. No more cord getting hung up on everything; lots of attachments and it cuts really well. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Clippers are awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and the cordless is a plus.  Seperate neck trimmer works great for being powered by a AA volt battery.</li>
            <li> Not the best I have ever seen but for the price these are the first Wahl clippers under $100 that are worth it.  Not saying any other brand is either just that now days for quality you just have to spend too much money for a decent par of clippers.</li>
            <li> Bought these instead of spending $200 on a pearl set.  Still wasn&#x27;t ready to drop the bucks.  This is a great bang for your buck.  Ion makes the cordless worth it and the quality of the clipper set will last you a few years. My hair cut looked better then before and clippers did not scratch me at all.  Lots of clip on&#x27;s make fades easy and sharp.  Great set, well worth the money, highly recommend if you don&#x27;t want to spoil yourself with a matching set of Pearl 76&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent clipper set. My husband hates going to the salon or barber to get his hair cut, so we use the clippers every 2-3 months at home. It charges very quickly and holds the charge for a very long time. Seriously, I don&#x27;t even remember when was the last time I charged it. I&#x27;ve gone at least 2 or 3 haircuts without charging it. It works very well and has a wide range of tips that make it easy to give a good haircut. The trimmer is excellent as well. My husband uses it a few times a week and he loves it. He doesn&#x27;t even shave with razors anymore, he just uses the trimmer. We like this kit so much that we actually bought another one as a gift. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> This clipper is the best ever.  Very easy to use and since it&#x27;s cordless it can go anywhere!!  I bought it to cut my husbands hair now my nephews come over too!!  Made a great gift for the father in law as well!!  It&#x27;s so nice for the guy always on the go!!</li>
            <li> I like them. I purchased this product at a local Walmart for a very affordable price. This clipper is very light and will work great on kids because there won&#x27;t be any cords for them to grab! :) Great great great.</li>
            <li> I have to say WOW.  I had a cheap set of clippers before that I used for years.  They performed the work ok I guess, but sounded like a lawnmower.  The cord also limited me to where I could cut my hair.  I was impressed with this set of clippers out of the box, I was able to cut my hair right away.  I was also surprsed that I did not have to go over the same spot over and over, against and with the grain, only to find that I looked like I had the mange due to tufts of hair still remaining-like I said, my other clippers were antique. I think we will be able to cut our boys hair now without having to worry about shattering their eardrums from the loud noise of my old clippers.</li>
            <li> this, like all electronics, benefits greatly from the lack of wires. i charged it up completely once when i received it and haven&#x27;t had to charge it since (about 6 20 minute sessions). i have pretty thick hair but that was never an issue for this thing, cuts right through.</li>
            <li> This is a good clipper. The battery life is amazing. The blades stay sharp. And, you can easily hold it in one hand.</li>
            <li> Satified with my purchase.</li>
            <li> HELLO AMAZON CUSTOMERS,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIRST THE HAIR ON THE HEADS THE CLIPPER CUT!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this item in September 10, 2014 and have now decided to write a review after usage and the passage of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a Man with very soft, big-curls but strong type of hair. My hair is originally just soft and sort of curly, but as it gets longer the curls get naturally bigger and my hair somehow gets even softer. I also decided I wanted to play role-play as the \\&quot;friendly local barber\\&quot; to my personal friends by cutting the different types of hair they had. Most of friends my have soft hair like mine but one friend is exactly the opposite. His hair is as thick as a brillo pad. Nappy and hard afro type basically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK NOW ABOUT THE MACHINE!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The machine went through my hair like a hot knife goes thru butter. Never did it tug or pull or have any difficulty at all with my hair. However with my friends hair it did not tug or pull either but you could immediately notice the difficulty and slow down the clippers had with the hairs as they got thicker. This is not the machine you want if you have a full blown very thick hard afro. This clipper is clearly intended for hair like mine. Soft, just plain vanilla soft, or just a little slightly thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The machine is very plastic-y and feels borderline cheap in build quality materials, but is very powerful. The battery lasts for 15 haircuts or more and but to be fair once again I would like to stress my entire head can be cut in 2 minutes or less. The average cut lasted 10-15 minutes with my friends hair. So I would say the battery life is impressive. the power button is sort of awkward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTHING WILL PREPARE YOU FOR THE NIGHTMARE THAT IS REMOVING THE BLADE, CLEANING THE CLIPPER AND PUTTING THE BLADE BACK ON!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is borderline impossible to actually clean the clipper inside because the head itself is non-removable. In order to clean out all the gunk and build up you will accumulate overtime you have to completely remove the blade with a hex key to be able to get inside the clipper.The blade is replaceable but it is an extraordinary pain to put back on. Without any exaggeration It took me maybe 2+ hours trying to figure out how to put the blade pieces back on. It is easy removing the blade, but it is not putting the blade back on because both blade pieces must be put on back at the exact same time in the exact  same angle so that you can then HOVER THEM AT THE EXACT SAME TIME AND ANGLE TO BE ABLE TO SCREW THE BLADE PIECES BACK ON. By the way all this has to happen at the same time as the blade pieces slip and slide in your hands because of the inner lubrication on the blade pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit I did not use the trimmer, but one good look at them and you can figure out for yourself that they are nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product if WAHL redesigns this line for easier cleaning and maintenance at some point in the future.ade with a hex key to be able to get inside the clipper.The blade is replaceable but it is an extraordinary pain to put back on.

            <li> I like the cordless clippers but the smaller clipper is extremely noisy for it&#x27;s size.  The small clippers does not have any adjustment or clipper guides which makes them useless unless you&#x27;re wanting as close a clip as possible.      I do like the larger clipper but the blade adjustment on the side feels very flimsy, something I wouldn&#x27;t expect from Wahl, and it can get caught on the case seam making you think you&#x27;ve adjusted it all the way forward when in fact it is not.  A case to organize the clipper guides would be very helpful as well....just something you could slide each guide into instead of them all being jumbled around the the clipper case.  It would also help you find the correct guide without having to search through several.    Wahl could have really made this a great clipper set if they would have put forth a bit more effort.  Heck, I would have even paid a bit more if the cons I listed were addressed properly.</li>
            <li> Works nicely.  Both are loud, but cut well.</li>
            <li> These are great clippers. You can also find them at Wal-Mart. You should shop around and make sure you&#x27;re getting the very best deal. I saw them at Wal-Mart for $54 the other day (2/24/2013). They are built just like any Wahl clipper and meant to last. They hold a nice long charge and we&#x27;ve been getting 2, 15 min haircuts out of them every single time with plenty of charge left over. I&#x27;m guessing you could leave them on for 25-30 min with no issues. I have yet to run them dead !!! They come with all the sizes and tools / goodies all in one nice bag. The only downside would be the actual bag these live in is CRAP. Go buy a different travel size bag and throw this travel bag in the trash as soon as you get it.. All the parts just flop around and get all tangled up.</li>
            <li> Worked really well, glad I got it....battery lasts a long time. Thought the trimmer would be a little better, but it&#x27;s AA powered, so not as strong, but still works okay. Overall very happy with it</li>
            <li> Bought this clipper set for a replacement for old set that was missing parts. Also tired of getting the same bad haircut, so decided I could do better with home set. Worked great, and I love that its cordless.</li>
            <li> The clippers hold a charge for a long time. It feels comfortable and balanced to hold. They cut thru hair like butter. The plastic cutting guides work fine. The 3/16\\&quot; is perfect for trimming my sideburns and eyebrows every week or so.&lt;br /&gt;My wife is the one who uses the clippers on my hair about once a month. There is no pinching at all. She uses the smaller included clippers around my ears and to fine tune by my neck. It looks great and we have already saved money since she has given me at least 10 haircuts. Some reviewers said that they could cut their own hair with these clippers, but I haven&#x27;t tried that.</li>
            <li> Hard to handle / tears at your skin / poorly designed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hard to handle due to funky/odd \\&quot;ergonomic design\\&quot;. Will tear at your skin and bite you badly if you are not careful about how you move it and angle it. ALSO it is poorly designed in that the adjustment arm catches on the case seam every time - typical junk of today&#x27;s design and manufacturing standards.  Would have sent it back if I did not miss my return window. I have used the old barber-style plug-in Wahl that was designed and built in the USA and it has never had any of these problems.</li>
            <li> I really love this Wahl clipper! Cords always get in my way when I am cutting hair and this not only saves me time, but also frustration. It is lightweight and pretty quiet. My only complaint is that some of the higher numbered gaurds are harder to fit on there. Otherwise, pretty pleased!</li>
            <li> I was hoping to replace my simpler Wahl razor which I use primarily for &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; (more like maintaining a round-the-clock 5-o&#x27;clock shadow). Turns out I overbought. This is definitely an amateur barber&#x27;s kit — it&#x27;s got everything you&#x27;ll need to give kids awesome bowl cuts, but sadly really is a little too much for my needs. Furthermore, the little &amp;#34;detail trimmer&amp;#34; is substantially underpowered and seems to drain the single AA battery in one or two uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For someone else, this may be an awesome kit; for me it really didn&#x27;t meet my expectations or needs.</li>
            <li> I love it.  I believe that it is a little heavy compared with the old Wahl I left somewhere else in a trip but it has a lasting and powerful battery.  The &amp;#34;little sister&amp;#34; clipper works OK to do the detailing.  Should I dare to confess that I also use the Whal 79600-2101 to groom my my poodle?</li>
            <li> Five star for quality and function.&lt;br /&gt;blade seems very durable.&lt;br /&gt;battery life is spectacularly long.&lt;br /&gt;over my expectations for home use.</li>
            <li> Bought this to use on finer haired clients at work and it really hasnt made my job any easier. Have to pass and repass through sections, lifting with my comb to even get it to catch hair sometimes. Alright for at-home use, dont bother if ur trying to work every day with it.</li>
            <li> Works very well! No issues!</li>
            <li> Works Perfect, holds a decently long charge, and comes with more than enough accessories. Would definitely recomend to a friend.</li>
            <li> Cordless is awesome...I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times already ad have not had to recharge it yet...it&#x27;s still going from the initial charge!</li>
            <li> I bought this product to start cutting my hair at home and it has been a decent product. I did have to send the unit back because the blade was crooked after a couple cuts and obviously would effect the cut quality. Wahl&#x27;s customer service was not very pleasant. They sent the unit back and I had to pay the shipping, also they sent it back and it is still crooked after almost a month or so of wait. They did nothing to resolve the issue as other companies would do so with that being said I most likely will not be a Wahl customer in the future. Other than that I do like the wireless ability it possesses and the cut is of decent quality when the unit is working as it should. The case is also a little confusing as there are not clear spots to put each defined guides/combs. This leads to messy organization and &amp;#34;fighting&amp;#34; to find the proper length desired.</li>
            <li> I have used Wahl clippers for years and will use nothing else.  Recently my trimmer died out and I decided to purchase another, doing so I upgraded and purchased the Model 79600-2101 and to replace my trimmer I purchased the Lithium Ion all in one trimmer.  The best of all worlds. The Clipper allows me to keep my hair the way I like it, The All in one trimmer takes care of my facial hairs. Leaving the battery operated trimmer for my business case. Thank Wahl they never pinch, pull, or cut.</li>
            <li> Great Set Up!. -1 Star becuase of the inability to recharge the smaller set of clippers.. But all in all a great package deal. Perfect for me because I just moved out of my parents and need somewhere to start as I was new to the world of clippers. The larger set of Clippers comes with a whole attachment kit with all the need neccesities when motivating yourself to some trimming and beard up keep.... No attachments for the smaller set of clippers... Hell... I don&#x27;t even think they gave you batteries to run the smaller set out of the box...Good Starter Package though.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  Charged once and still has juice left after multiple cuts. I can&#x27;t speak to how it will hold up over time.  I have extremely short hair and facial hair so I can&#x27;t speak to how it would work with longer hair.</li>
            <li> Clippers cut well, and I love the fact that it doesnt have a cord to constantly get in the way.</li>
            <li> Purchased this here on Amazon to replace my corded Wahl 79300-400 Color Pro 20 Piece, and thought that $45 would give me a great cordless solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so much.  Used this clipper about 6 times over the course of 2 months and it has already gone into malfunction mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After charging, and unplugging, the blue charging indicator light remains lit, a constant solid blue glow.  I can press the button on and off, and it will&lt;br /&gt;turn on and off, but that blue light now remains lit forever and always until it slowly drains the entire battery to a zero charge state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No combination of powering on/off with the cord in/out resolves the issue.  Wahl customer service via email states I can send it back to them at my expense&lt;br /&gt;and wait for them to repair or replace the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combined with the *slightly* less power of the corded model,  the non-removeable head (really gets messy under the hood fast) and the proclivity to malfunction,&lt;br /&gt;I dont know if my $10 shipping and waiting is worth it.  Will probably get a better ROI on a better corded model and roll my $10 elsewhere.  Sorry Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use caution before jumping on this one.</li>
            <li> Great item much better than expected for the price...</li>
            <li> I have been going to a salon for my hair cuts for several years now. One day I decided that spending $18 on a hair cut that only takes, no kidding, 15 minutes was crazy! I wear my hair short and always ask to use clippers on the back and sides but cut the top with scissors. So, the solution, cut my own hair. I was a bit nervous but I purchased the Wahl Lithium Ion Clippers. They arrived quickly. They charged fast and I used them for the first time today. The best investment that I have made! The best clippers ever. Goodbye salon, hello DIY haircut!</li>
            <li> its very good. I cut my hair for the first time and got the very same haircut a barber could give !</li>
            <li> Awesome clippers, the Lithium batteries last much longer and the motor is more powerful. And it is very convenient being cordless as well.</li>
            <li> Everything I wanted with cordless convenience.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny. My new hobby is cutting my hair at various locales on my scooter route. The scenery is amazing and birds always enjoy it. Put it on your christmas list meow. This Wahl is powerful and dynamic. Love the color coded guards for my aging eyes. Smooth as silk.</li>
            <li> It is a good seller, received what you buy in very good quality and well protected. I recommend</li>
            <li> Like it. Plenty of power and feel is good. As one said it looks like it&#x27;s made of plastic but what isn&#x27;t?</li>
            <li> I love these clippers. I have shaved my head once a week for the last 13 years. I have gone through several clippers. None were as good as these.</li>
            <li> The first pair didn&#x27;t charge amazon replaced them and they are awesome clippers.</li>
            <li> Love Wahl but were some drawbacks to switching from corded clippers as expected.  Have been using for a month now and for me the small clippers pull my face hair and large clippers do not cut as close on my head.  Good to get rid of cords though.</li>
            <li> I tried another cheaper brand because I like their cordless shavers, but their cordless clipper did&#x27;t work very well. I should have stayed with Wahl clippers. I have used their corded clippers for decades with total satisfaction. These cordless clippers are exactly what I wanted and they really do the job. I am very happy with them.</li>
            <li> Works really well, I&#x27;m a professional and they hold a charge all day, trimmers aren&#x27;t as great though I put new energizer batteries in them and they lasted 1 day</li>
            <li> They worked great but the battery died in less than a year</li>
            <li> I have always been one to cut my own hair for several years. i cut it short. and I have previously owned cordless clippers and they batters go after a couple years.this is the lithium Ion and they are suppose to last longer and stay charged longer. So far they have worked well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wahl clippers to buzz my hair for years now.  I&#x27;ve always been pretty happy with them.  Recently I moved and got rid of my old clippers and picked up a cheap one in my new town.  It didn&#x27;t cut as well as my old one.  When I came across this cordless clipper I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically buzz my hair in the bathtub to make clean up easy.  No longer needing an extension chord was a big plus.  Having Li-ion batteries was a plus as well.  Finally, I&#x27;m trying to buy Made in America as much as I can, so I was happy to see they were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the box my first impression was not good.  Compared to most clippers they feel light and cheap.  I think they cut corners on the materials to counter the high cost of the batteries.  The on/off button is clunky, compared to the mains powered clippers.  Finally, the adjusting lever is cheap/flimsy too.  The first time I adjusted the blades short, the length I buzz my hair too, it almost felt like I was going to break it.  I also noticed the blades weren&#x27;t even.  After raising and lowering the blade height a few more times, I got it to settle right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the initial bad impressions I fired up the clippers and made a quick pass down the side of my head.  I had let my hair go a little longer than I normally would have liked and I tensed up waiting for them to &#x27;catch&#x27; or tangle in my hair like my cheap clippers would have.  Surprisingly, they buzzed right through, no problem at all.  I stepped into the bathtub and went at it.  A few minutes later I was all done.  They worked wonderfully.  Having no chord made the process so much more easy, quick, and enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point in time I am cautiously optimistic that these will work out well.  I only wish they had a nicer version.  I&#x27;d gladly pay another $10-20 for something constructed more solidly, with the feel of the mains powered clippers, especially if it means they&#x27;ll last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try to update my review down the road as to whether they hold up.  I am tossing the second clipper as I already have a Li-ion mini clipper that I use for my beard.  I like the soft-sided bag it comes with (as opposed to the cheap plastic box you normally get).view down the road as to whether they hold up.  I am tossing the second clipper as I already have a Li-ion mini clipper that I use for my beard.  I like the soft-sided bag it comes with (as opposed to the cheap plastic box you normally get).</li>
            <li> The clipper is everything advertised and more. Have used several times now and each time was a great experience. So Thumbs up on this product.</li>
            <li> For the price, I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better set of clippers.  I never used the bonus trimmer, so I can&#x27;t comment on that.  I&#x27;m still working a 10+ year old Wahl beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Great clippers and the best part....cordless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit, I was skeptical at first, but these clippers are great. Smooth as butter and just as powerful as my corded clippers.</li>
            <li> Not the best or not the worst. Have not used that much. So fare happy.</li>
            <li> I have tried Con-air, Norelco and Remington. Unless you are willing to pay $70-$80.00 at a department store including Walmart, forget it. Once I saw this item posted on amazon for $46.00 I had to have it and with no regrets at all. The battery life is great since it&#x27;s lithium ion, nice accessories and a really nice fabric zip pouch to put it all in. This clipper will not snag on your hair at all either,&lt;br /&gt;it was designed with that in mind. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> A noisy machine. Will do what it needs to do.</li>
            <li> Good battery life, and it cuts through my hair really well.  The only thing I wish they would change is the design of the guards.  They feel like they could be more substantial and be less pointed.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as good as I thought it would.  Need to specify that the smaller clipper is battery operated.</li>
            <li> such a great deal. And super fast delivery:)</li>
            <li> Big trimmers are louder than what I was expecting from reading the reviews, but they work great. The small trimmers kind of suck though.</li>
            <li> When the package arrived on time I was not surprised that it contains the clipper unit I ordered, but it was nice to also find the small clipper unit.  I have tried both and they both work great.  I would recommend to anyone looking for a clipper unit.</li>
            <li> the clipper is the best clipper i ever owned.. out of the box the battery lasted long as i needed.. sadly the trimmer is complete trash.. uses one AA battery... should of been a matching set.. what a let down..</li>
            <li> Since the prices of haircuts and styling are so outrageous, I began home hair cuts and styling back in 2008 and I&#x27;ve tried alot of brands since then to try and find the right clipper.  I first tried the cheapest set of Conair clippers and they were the worst set I had ever tried.  They did not give an even cut or finish and the attachment combs were very cheaply made and easy to break.  I next bought the Wahl corded clippers @ Wal-Mart and found them surprizingly better quality all around.  However, the corded clippers are very frustrating to use because of having to constantly adjust if you are giving a haircut and it&#x27;s even worse getting one from a corded clipper.  Corded trimmers are aggravating to say the least.  That particular Wahl set lasted about 1 year before I got tired of them getting increasingly louder and less consistent on the cut.  I then bought the Wahl color pro set because it seemed to be a better concept that would work more accurately with the number/color setup.  Those were pretty good and much higher quality than anything Conair has to be sure.  The color pro set lasted much longer than the first Wahl set did, which was about 2 1/2 years before I finally decided to stop being cheap and invest in the Oster Fast Feed set.  They got really good reviews so I believed they would be higher quality and more durable in the long run so I bought those to see if more money meant better clippers.  In the beginning, they did seem better to me as far as more precise cutting and more motor power.  However, for the Fast Feeds to be efficient you have to take them apart to clean them thoroughly and then reassemble them.  That&#x27;s where the problem came in.  Not only did the Fast Feeds become less powerful after taking them apart to clean, but it was damn near impossible to reassemble them back properly.  Everything did not fit back as precisely as it did before and that effectively ruined a $60 clipper.  Not including the comb set you have to buy seperately[$30.00 at the time] and the shipping that made the overall total $100.  The attachment combs for the Fast Feeds were very expensive and they didn&#x27;t fit exactly as the Wahl combs do for their trimmers.  The combs for the Osters are spring loaded and very difficult to load onto the clippers and Wahl&#x27;s are exactly the opposite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had already considered the Wahl Lithium Ion cordless because it&#x27;s a Wahl clipper for one and it also has properly fitting attachment combs.  Being cordless is a major improvement over any of the above mentioned hair clippers simply put.  You can use them indoor or outdoor and they do just as good as the corded clippers.  The battery life is decent, although for a Lithium Ion battery you&#x27;d expect more.  Even so, I could overlook that because everything else is perfect.  The clippers give an even level cut that does better than the high dollar clippers like Oster and the price makes it a must have.  I picked up the Wahl Ion cordless clippers a Wal-Mart for $59.99 and that includes everything from 1/2 to 8 attachment combs, barber cape, brushes/oil, and also a small detail trimmer.  And while the detail trimmer isn&#x27;t as good as the clippers themselves, it&#x27;s still a much better deal than anything else currently available.  The reason I gave the Wahl Ion cordless clippers a 4-star rating was because of mainly the battery issue.  Plus, companies can always improve a product more.  I usually reserve 5-star reviews for products I can find nothing wrong with and Wahl can definetely improve these if they introduce new cordless clippers later on.

            <li> This cordless Wahl is very powerful and with the lithium battery there&#x27;s no need to worry about finishing the job you start.  I tried a few other cordless and they did not have the power for a complete haircut or they would loose power halfway through the cutting job.  I am very happy with this coreless product I have used the corded Wahl for years and this is the first cordless to even come close.</li>
            <li> I replaced a cordless clipper that just wouldnt keep a charge, or actually seemed to be low charge and always forced me to plug it in to get full RPMs, which made me wonder why it was even cordless in the first place. This new Wahl works great in the battery department. I bought it, charged it, used it and the first haircut was great, did not pull hair, was smooth cutting, battery did not flinch. I put it away, 2 weeks later got it back out and gave another hair cut, battery still full charge and just as good as the first time. I have had it for several months now, given maybe 6 haircuts(i cut my own hair and my son) and only had to charge it one time. Love it. My only complaint is it is a little hard to hold due to how thick it is near the blades. I hold it close when shaving my own head. It can be a little awkward, but I have never dropped it, but I did come close to nipping the tip of my finger. I think I will get used to it but NO REGRETS. The power and battery life are what make this clipper a 5.</li>
            <li> As advertised. Powerful clipper that are convenient and have a long battery life. Trimmer functions well also. No issues so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll do the trick and cut your hair without being tethered to a wire and wall plug, but it pulls hair as it cuts, which I find a tad annoying as heck. I keep it around for those emergency grooming situations when power is an issue. I take my grooming seriously.</li>
            <li> Decent for the price. Heats up</li>
            <li> My son came home from college and used my clippers.  He requested this as his Christmas gift this year he loved it so much.  I was able to send it right to his home several states away.  Gift giving was a breeze. Great product.  Love mine.</li>
            <li> THE CLIPPERS ARE GREAT ON CUTTING MY GRAND- CHILDRENS HAIR .THEY ARE GOOD QUALITY AND HOLD A CHARGE&lt;br /&gt;GOOD .A++++++</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. The quality is very good and the priced has matched it. You will like it.</li>
            <li> Works as you&#x27;d expect. I buzz my head once a week and it&#x27;s zipping right through it, no problems. I&#x27;m barely stressing the battery using it for 8 minutes once a week. I try to charge it before I use it (and after I&#x27;m done with it for that matter) out of habit, but since I&#x27;ve never come close to draining it&#x27;s never on the charger long - 20-30 minutes maybe. I haven&#x27;t use the trimmer and I don&#x27;t see myself using it soon - just don&#x27;t have a need for it. In a perfect world they would offer the clippers by themselves, not bundled with the trimmer, and charge a little less. As it is the trimmer and most of the attachments will be gathering dust on a high shelf in my bathroom cabinet. But the clippers themselves work great the price wasn&#x27;t bad so 5 stars it is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool one only it has alittle loud sound. Also I hoped that the trimmer (the small wahl) is rechargeable like the hair cutter.But generally it&#x27;s good so far.</li>
            <li> This unit is perfect for do yourself hair cuts and there is a very low buzz noise which it makes unlike another model I previously used. It stays charged for quite a while.</li>
            <li> finally a lithium Ion version of this cordless trimmers, I hope to get great use out of these!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT AND FAST DELIVERY !!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to hold.  I was pleasantly surprized at the quality.</li>
            <li> Instead of bothering my wife all the time for a trim, the cordless allows me to do it myself. This clpper provides the same power and quality that my 10 year old corded Wahl clipper does. Great product at a good Amazon price !</li>
            <li> because the trimmer only came with batterys, i wish that i could charge the trimmer to, but i do like the clippers</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked around for a good hair clipper that was cordless and couldn&#x27;t find anything that was durable. Had a Norelco which use to cut good until the attachments broke twice (not durable at all). Then I came across this Wahl. Was skeptical at first based on the negative reviews, but out of the box the trimmer was superb. It had enough charge to cut my hair twice. It is a bit loud but that&#x27;s not bad compared to other products I have tried. It cuts great, many attachments and DOES NOT GET HOT! I don&#x27;t know how ppl are saying it does. Pls read ur instructions. Oil the clippers first. I have given 3 hair cuts consecutively and it still did not get hot.&lt;br /&gt;  There is one problem I had, and it was not with the product. When I got it the #1 attachment was missing, called Amazon they sent a new one for me, one day shipping at no charge. Plus they sent me a return label so I can return the original one at no cost to me. Great customer service!!!&lt;br /&gt;  So if ur looking for a great trimmer, at a good price and cordless get this it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> so easy to use  met all expectations if you need one like this I highly recommend it great value for the price</li>
            <li> Depending on what you use this item for it may be one of the most versatile shavers not in the regular advertising cycle light. A bit bulky if you&#x27;re attempting man-scaping, however, that is what the accompanying smaller shaver is for.</li>
            <li> You charge it once, you can use it several times. The small clipper looks like a plastic toy but the main clipper is awesome.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this to cut hair with. We save money by her cutting the children&#x27;s hair. The battery life is really great and lasts through multiple hair cuts with out a recharge. Good strong mooter which works on even wet hair. Even the toughest nastiest teenage boy&#x27;s hair is no problem for this cutter. A+ item I was impressed, I will only buy lithium ion powered devices. It was not very expensive but definatly worth the price. Ditch the old corded clippers and join the new age of cordless.</li>
            <li> Better than expected, great battery life. Better than expected, great battery life. Why does my review have to be so dang long.</li>
            <li> Bought this a year ago and still works like new.  I trim my hair about once a week without fail, and this definitely has cost justified itself over that time frame.  The smaller clipper can be used to scale down your beard stuble if you don&#x27;t like to shave everyday.</li>
            <li> We have been using this for over a year and we are well satisfied.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Good product. Great Quality. Would not hesitate to recommend. Easy charging and battery time is sufficient. Have only used it twice so far, but seems maintenance free.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband. He needed cordless clippers. They are light in weight. The only flaw is they pinch sometimes. My husband decided to keep them which was ok with me. That is the only thing I didn&#x27;t like about these clippers.</li>
            <li> Wireless clippers are the way to go.  No more having the cord in your way when you are cutting hair.  There is no sacrifice of power.  Feels the same as a corded one.</li>
            <li> These clippers were great while they lasted, but the motor in these clippers have quit working after one year of use.  When it&#x27;s is plugged up the blue light does not light either.  Threw them in the trash and will look for a different brand.  You may want to consider the same.</li>
            <li> I have been using these clippers for 2 years and I love them.  I only use them to shave my head and cut my sons hair. Over the years I have used many clippers and these are by far my favorite. I see complaints about how they feel cheap. I can&#x27;t say that I agree. I shave my head 2 or 3 times a week and after 2 years they cut like they are brand new. That&#x27;s all I need them to do. If they stop working tomorrow I would absolutely by another pair.</li>
            <li> Works great and always can find the right tool between the two clippers and multiple attachments.</li>
            <li> Wahl I&#x27;ve been using this since 1984</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. Lots of accessories. Cuts very well !</li>
            <li> Works better than expected.  Higher speed than my older plug-in clippers.</li>
            <li> This is the second wahl clipper I bought.  The first was louder and vibrated more than a sherman tank.  this one is far better.  The clipper is not excellent, but good enough to keep around, though I&#x27;m starting to have second thoughts because without good guide combs the machine becomes limited in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guide combs fall off when in use far to easily.  This of course is very annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery however holds the charge very very well.  quite impressive.</li>
            <li> These clippers work great!  I use them to trim unwanted body hair and do a little manscaping. They work great and the Lithium battery is well-worth the extra expense.  It is more powerful and lasts longer than other battery powered units.</li>
            <li> Light weight plastic exterior.  I had doubts about durability, but it survived several drops without damage (take care when unzipping the travel case, the clipper falls out easily).  I charged the battery per the directions and it held a charge for 5 weeks of weekly trims.&lt;br /&gt;Very convenient to use, since it isn&#x27;t tethered to a receptacle, I can trim my hair outside and it doesn&#x27;t leave a mess.&lt;br /&gt;The push button on and off switch is a little stiff (my wife has problems getting the switch to turn off, but I don&#x27;t have any problem working it with my thumb).  I&#x27;ve had it a couple of months, so I don&#x27;t know how it will hold up long term, but so far, it meets my needs and expectations.</li>
            <li> The cordless clipper set is great for guys. I stopped going to the barber and instead use these myself, saving $20 a month. Granted I have short hair so I&#x27;m not doing anything fancy but it comes with instructions on how-to. I also use them on my son and for him I got from a 5 guard and fade down to a 3. It is easy to use and there are even videos online showing you how to use them. The trimmer that comes with it uses regular batteries and is loud. I only use for the back of the neck which you will need someone to do for you.</li>
            <li> The adjustment screw is cheap and doesn&#x27;t always work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this item twice over a span of about a year. After about 20 charges the large units just stop working. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I love these clippers, This is the second time I bought them because a friend dropped the first ones I had. However, when I got the package it turns out the charger was missing and I needed them for that day. So I returned it with amazon and had to buy another one at walmart which was about $15 more. Overall I highly recommend this product but when you receive it, be sure to check and make sure that everything is there.</li>
            <li> Love it but lite too short</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a serious issue with these. I bought a set about 3 years ago. I cut my hair once a month. I&#x27;m simple... just a #1 all the way around. So, based on their claim, right there on the box, that it will hold a charge for up to a year, I figured I could charge them after I use them, then unplug and store. Oh, no... that&#x27;s not at all how it works. It doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for very long at all. So I&#x27;d leave them plugged in all the time. Then about 14 months after I bought them, I cut my hair, left them unplugged, and came back almost 2 months later to cut my hair. They weren&#x27;t just dead, they were DEAD. Would not charge, charge light would not come on. Completely dead. Wahl has a 5 year warranty, but I can&#x27;t wait for that. I&#x27;m a shaggy, terrorist look-a-like. I need to cut my hair. So I went and bought another one, with the intent of having two, and returning the other one for repair. I forgot to send the other ones for repair. So, here I am about a year and a half later and the second clipper set is also dead. EXACT same issues. Wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge, and once it was completely dead, that was the end. 2 dead clippers.    There&#x27;s something ALWAYS draining the battery. Something is absolutely wrong with the design of these clippers.    They cut great, and when they are charged, I don&#x27;t have any issues with them. The battery thing is really annoying, because it&#x27;s no better than NiCad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wahl clippers for as long as I can remember.  They&#x27;re usually great.  I got these because they don&#x27;t have a cord.  They hold the charge fine for me, but don&#x27;t cut my hair.  I don&#x27;t have the easiest hair to cut, tons of cowlicks, but have never had a problem with a little patience.  These clippers cut some hairs and just pet the others.  Not cheap either.  I&#x27;d generally recommend this brand, but not this particular model.</li>
            <li> Great product but we&#x27;ve only had it a few months and it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long.</li>
            <li> The item was delivered before the estimated time.&lt;br /&gt;It supports 110 - 240 V, which is needed outside US.&lt;br /&gt;The charge is enough for more than 40 mins of operation.&lt;br /&gt;However, it produces the noise similar to most of the hair clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards&lt;br /&gt;Subbu</li>
            <li> This replaced my old plug-in clippers and it works great. A wonderful choice of guards are included. I use this to trim my hair and beard and it does a great job. It is MUCH lighter than my old model.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about using a battery clipper especially with the negative reviews that said this clipper would tug at ones hair . I had used a competitors corded for years which became dull and was causing a short in my GFCI breaker system . I know what tugging is and this WAHL has good power for a personal clipper . Another complaint I heard was this doesn&#x27;t cut close enough . Don&#x27;t listen . I was excited to try the ear trimmer as I have never been able to do white walls over the ears . I made a \\&quot; mistake \\&quot; and needed a fix as we know hair grows back . I used the 1/16th with the lever moved up for closeness and buzzed my head in less then 5 minutes . This thing has power equal to my old corded  and it is easier to use without a cord . It cut close enough to shave with one pass  . Firefighters who like to go shaved will love this .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very important item no other reviews mentioned is the charger will not over charge the battery so you can leave it plugged in all the time for a full charge ( a surge protected outlet may be best ) . It also comes in a wonderful soft carry bag that would fit easily in a small carry bag for traveling . It could easily fit in a glove box . With a hour and 4o minute reserve one could easily do several cuts when off grid for whatever reason or traveling . The power button is a tad awkward but you can&#x27;t as easily trip a push button as a normal  slide bar switch found on corded clippers  which would run the battery out - obviously why designers used  this style . As far as the oil provided not being adequate Amazon has a bottle that will last years for $3 that also qualifies for free shipping if combined with the order . The casting on my blades was absolutely not rough but very clean and the clipper is chrome and black very nice in appearance as well as full normal size .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer that comes with it is also very nice but I haven&#x27;t had a reason to use it though for those who were sad it wasn&#x27;t a lithium Lion tool a simple enuloop rechargeable battery creates the same efficiency . Good luck and have a great day hope this helped ease some fears  created in other reviews the key will be how long this lasts as the battery is not customer serviced . My last corded went over 10 years they are about 40% less in price at around $30 .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note : it is March of 2013 clipper is working great as well as my talents with it are improving . It will quick charge in 15 minutes so I have stopped leaving it plugged in all the time and just plug it in before cutting my hair . I am using the little clipper to trim around my ears and my eyelashes . I cut my hair much more often with this set up . I just kneel in front of my toilet and let the hair fall in it . Thankfully buzz cuts are in style not that I ever cared that much about being in style . I find cutting the hair then jumping in the shower the best way to go . With this not only do I save money I can have a fresh cut as often as I take the time . No more then 10 minutes unless I am shaving my neck . I take duct tape and go from ear to ear and shave my neck below making a nice clean line in the back of my head . I can check behind my head with my back to a mirror and using a hand mirror to look into it to see what I have done . Hope this helps someone . You can do it I just use a number one and go over my whole head , trim with the little one around the ears and shave the back of my neck because I have no talent and it still looks great . Some people are able to style just like a barber with practice . If you make a mistake just cut like I do and it will grow back .ool a simple enuloop rechargeable battery creates the same efficiency .

            <li> There is something wrong with the design of these clippers that will run down the battery to the point where it will not longer charge. Lithium Ion batteries need to maintain a minimum voltage otherwise they become damaged. I suspect there is no rundown protection in these clippers and somehow the battery got below the minimum level.  This product became useless after just 3 months of purchasing it, having used it maybe twice so far.  I left it plugged in for 2 days and it still wouldn&#x27;t charge at all. I will try another brand (Philips) to see if those are any better.</li>
            <li> average at best.  Conair clippers I had, were better.  Kind of cheap.</li>
            <li> Professional results from this clipper!  My husband LOVES it!!!!  Use it weekly and can&#x27;t be without it!  This one is the best!</li>
            <li> Overview:&lt;br /&gt;This is the first set of clippers I have ever purchased, and I am quite happy with it.  I used it for the first time today, and it work just as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The directions for the clippers specifically state that it cannot be overcharged, so you can charge it after every haircut and know it will be safe from damage.&lt;br /&gt;Both the trimmers and the clippers are weighted very well and fit perfectly in your hand while cutting.&lt;br /&gt;Both devices feel very sturdy and well built.&lt;br /&gt;The product comes with a carrying kit that includes pouches for the attachments and both devices as well as a cover / bib to keep the hair off of the person getting their hair cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The trimmers are powered by two (2) AA batteries.  When I bought it I thought it was rechargeable as well.  This, however, is a small inconvenience given the quality and ease of use.</li>
            <li> It works great. Holds in the hand comfortably. Battery lasts. No complaints. Priced well. Use it all the time. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Charged the clippers out of the box and used for three haircuts.  It won&#x27;t recharge and cannot be used plugged in either.  I&#x27;ve had three Wahl clipper units.  The best one is the oldest and cheapest one I have.  So much for product development.</li>
            <li> I got this hair clipper, in the box we are getting two units of hair clipper,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after one use only, the clipper got rusted, both of them.&lt;br /&gt;as a user that uses the clipper once every month, I got rejected trying to return it because &amp;#34;Expiration of returns period&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt; - wireless&lt;br /&gt; - Two units&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt; - getting Rusted after one use&lt;br /&gt; - the price of two units&lt;br /&gt; - no warranty</li>
            <li> This rating is because the trimmer is not assembled correctly so the smaller one isnt even usable.  I chose not to return it bacause it is too much of a hassle.</li>
            <li> I cut my hair about every two weeks and this little puppy helps.  It is nice to not have to plug it in to the wall to cut your hair.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my personal use.  It&#x27;s heavy duty, holds a charge, clips well. It meets all my expectations.</li>
            <li> It is a bit large and heavy - we are used to the smaller clippers, but these are built great and the battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This clipper cuts hair like butter. Definitely professional-grade quality. The battery lasts for many times of use (in fact I&#x27;ve never seen my battery run down because so far I&#x27;ve always recharged it after using 5 or 6 times, but I suspect it lasts much longer).&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a nice zippered bag with a complete set of clipper heads from size 1/2 (1,5 mm) to size 8 (24,5 mm &#x3D; 1 inch), sharp scissors, ear-guide, and even a synthetic-fiber covering for the body to waer while clipping beard. The side lever allows you to clip at even finer (&lt; 1,5 mm) lengths as desired.&lt;br /&gt;The small secondary clipper seems OK but so far I haven&#x27;t used it.</li>
            <li> Nice strong and mobile. I can cut my own hair out side and I wont make a mess in the house. Nothing to clean up ....</li>
            <li> It is light weight, but Dies too fast. It&#x27;s never powerful, missed a lot of hair! Has to be plugged in the whole hair cut or it  Won&#x27;t hold charge.</li>
            <li> The package itself is good with the second smaller machine, the bag and the rest of the things, but I am not pleased. When I cut my hair I have to be very careful because the bottom blade is too sharp and it hurts my skin all the time. I would not recommend this especially for people who cut their hair often and rely on this.</li>
            <li> These probably make my fourth set of clippers and they are definitely the best so far. The previous best was the first set of Wahl clippers that I had. These are just as good as those but the cordless aspect makes them that much better by lessening the time it takes to cut my hair.</li>
            <li> These clippers work well.  They came with lots of extra attachments for adjusting the length of cut, but that wasn&#x27;t really important to me since I only use these to shave my head.  The cut is always even and smooth.  I find the battery lasts pretty well.  I usually recharge it after two uses, so it&#x27;s never died on me.  I usually cut my hair at least once a month so it does hold a charge for a while between uses.  The smaller clipper that comes with this kit isn&#x27;t that great and it&#x27;s also really loud.  Overall the large clipper is really great.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is a little bulky but the small trimmer is sleek. Came in a timely fashion and as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had these clippers a few weeks and have only used it twice but it works great!  This is my first set of electric clippers and I&#x27;m still learning how to use them to cut my own hair in front of the mirror .  It comes with a wide assortment of attachments that aid in getting the right length and look.  It came with (10) comb attachments (controls hair length); (1) Left and (1) Right Ear Taper attachment (helps taper hair behind ears); (1) ear trim guide (provides a clean hairline behind and around the ears; (1) eye brow trimming guide; (2) combs; (1) pair of small hand clippers (scissors); and miscellaneous cleaning brush, oil, carrying case, neck/shoulder wrap (keep clippings out of clothing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to hold a pretty good charge throughout the haircutting process, which takes me about 15-30 minutes of intermittent on/off use.  I recharge it after every use, so I&#x27;m not sure if it holds up for multiple hair cuts without recharging.  Note: the smaller set of clippers require AA batteries which are not included.</li>
            <li> The unit cuts well and is has all of the pieces needed to give myself a good haircut.  Just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It is amazing ..my husband loves it ...</li>
            <li> It is really an amazing thing. Easy to cut the hair. It has a lot of different accessories. Very good quality. My family said me thanks  for your purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Every time when we use it we say  wonderfull clipper.</li>
            <li> Nice powerful motor on the larger unit.  Used it 3 or 4 times to cut my son&#x27;s hair in the space of 4 months.  Next time I went to turn it on, nothing.  Made sure it was plugged and tried to recharge.  Light won&#x27;t even come on.  This thing is DEAD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the smaller trimmer - frankly the space between the teeth is too large, making it too easy to grab skin and draw blood.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a great design for a detail trimmer - no need to have the teeth so far apart.  Had to stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next trimmer / set will not be a Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** Update as of 12-6-2012 *****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel compelled to update this to reflect a positive customer support experience.  I did send in the defunct clipper with an explanatory note, and within a couple of weeks received it (or one like it?) back in working condition.  I don&#x27;t care for the fact that I had to pay postage to take advantage of the warranty, but I believe that would be the case for other products as well.  Generally speaking the process was very easy and I didn&#x27;t have to go to great lengths to make this happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another item on the positive side of the ledger.  I noticed that on the small clipper the tips of a couple of the teeth appeared to be broken.  This probably contributed to the problems I had with it.  I have no idea how that happened, I never dropped the thing or banged it against anything, and I kept the cover on it when not in use - perhaps I hadn&#x27;t noticed that they had been that way when I received them (my eyes ain&#x27;t what they used to be).  I included the small clipper with my shipment to Wahl, with a note explaining exactly what I wrote above - the teeth are broken, don&#x27;t know how/when it happened.  So they sent me the small clippers back with fixed teeth (i.e. a new set).  No questions asked.  I do appreciate good customer service, and I&#x27;m upgrading this review to three stars, more for the company than for the product per se.  We&#x27;ll see - maybe I&#x27;ll update this again when I&#x27;ve had some good trouble-free service with my fixed clippers.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of weeks and have no issues so far, I only charged it once and I use it no more than 2 times a week for shaping mostly. The smaller unit needs a battery so for potential buyers, you could invest in a rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li> My son was so happy that it went thru his hair like butter.  All is great so far.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and having the the cordless option is wonderful.  I use it to cut my husband&#x27;s hair every six weeks, as he hates to go to a salon.</li>
            <li> Throw that corded clipper in the dumpster.&lt;br /&gt;This is what the pros use, and there is a good reason why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just an awesome product !!!</li>
            <li> This really works well.  I got this for my son who cuts both  his hair and his children&#x27;s hair.  Their hair always look great!&lt;br /&gt;He said it does everything he needs it to do.</li>
            <li> Great machine. So much easier to use than my old corded Wahl clipper.</li>
            <li> Just what the doctor ordered</li>
            <li> It worked fine for a while before it broke down. Went and bought another one and it works good without any problems so far.</li>
            <li> I have had these clippers for 9 months now. I purchased them to replace a corded shaver my dog chewed up that I had owned for ten years. I shave my head twice a month with a #2. If you wanted to shave your head bald these would not be close enough but they would get you ready for a Bic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am amazed by the battery life. When I first got them I charged them over night and I have not had to charge them again in 9 months! Just amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not use the beard trimmer, but the beard trimmer does feel very cheap. However, the main clippers are a stronger plastic and feel sturdy in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend them.</li>
            <li> These clippers were a gift to my boyfriend who shaves his head regularly. Cordless Wahl seemed perfect. But far from it! These cordless items look great on the box. Once out its a different story. Biggest complaint was not a close enough shave. Slips out of hand, and not as powerful as corded Wahl. He has been shaving his head for years with the old Wahl. He had tto dig it out of the trash because of the disappointment. I&#x27;m taking it back and hoping for better luck :-(</li>
            <li> All was going well until on my last haircut it appeared to run out of battery. I charged it, but alas, it no longer holds any power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sticking with Wahl, but for its replacement I shall be going corded...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** UPDATE April 22nd 2013 **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleasantly surprised to get the response from a Wahl representative which can be seen in the comments section of my review.  This was rather unexpected, but brilliant customer service.  I contacted Wahl as Ms. Butts suggested and received a reply offering to replace or refund my defective device.  Kudos to Wahl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the excellent customer service, I upgraded the number of stars from 2 to 3.</li>
            <li> Great product, very happy with the purchase. The cordless feature is great for cutting one&#x27;s own hair. Battery life is good.</li>
            <li> I had Wahl wired clippers for years and needed a new set due to the old one having not enough power and would sometimes snag thicker hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to purchase the Wireless clippers for that same reason, but these things have been stellar.  They haven&#x27;t snagged once.  The charge also lasts better than expected (as noted by other reviewers as well).  I&#x27;m able to cut both of my boy&#x27;s hair, one right after the other, without having to charge it between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend these to anyone looking for cordless clippers.  I&#x27;ve had absolutely no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  The small side clipper that comes with it is another story.  It does the job, but it&#x27;s battery powered.  It&#x27;s great for a quick trim around the mustache/neckline areas, but didn&#x27;t have enough attachments, and didn&#x27;t fit other &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34; attachments I also had from Wahl.  I ended up buying a new cordless Wahl trimmer set and don&#x27;t even use the one that came with this set.</li>
            <li> They are awesome. Light weight handle effortlessly. Cuts clean. Allows me to give him hair cuts and styles that looks like it was done procreational. He gets great comments every time I do his hair. I would recommend them to everyone.</li>
            <li> If you travel a lot, this is a good buy. It&#x27;s rechargeable so no worries of buying batteries. The wall charger only works for US so I recommend buying an adapter if you travel overseas.</li>
            <li> Wahl makes a great product and Amazon shipped it fast. No complaints here!</li>
            <li> I would buy these clippers again.  We are using them in a commercial setting and after several weeks of use are still working like new.</li>
            <li> This machine was made to last more than seven years.So buy it.</li>
            <li> These clippers are awesome they don&#x27;t bind up with thick hair or when making fast passes. Nice and sharp, wireless, awesome.</li>
            <li> Great kit, pouch, has all the add ons for different hair length. The smaller razor is a great bonus, cuts all the ear hair, etc....&lt;br /&gt;I recommended 5 Stars.</li>
            <li> Very light weight and effective. I use them professionally for work and they are a great product.</li>
            <li> All that I expected from Wahl, and more! The smaller clipper from the set didn&#x27;t come with attachments but a call to Wahl, and I was sent a set free of charge. Yeah Wahl ! :-)</li>
            <li> Just stopped charging.  The blades were nice and gave a great cut but now I have to send it back.  Am I supposed to go to a f%#%$#ing barber now!?!? DAMNN YOU WAHL !!!!  Used a Remington with a cord for about 5 years without a problem, only got this for the convenience of not having a cord.</li>
            <li> Excellent Grooming Kit.  Charges really good and perfect for wireless device.</li>
            <li> I looked around and all the different brands, types, styles.........etc., and this one just seemed to keep coming to the top of what I was looking at. I wanted my wife to try and cut my hair, but I wanted to be able to do it outside if we wanted, without having to haul a cord around all the time. This thing works great, and other than a goofy on/off switch, it is a great unit. I&#x27;m an engineer, and I know mechanical stuff, so I can tell you that the switch is a poor choice based on how it works. Here is the issue, when it is on and running, if you put pressure on the switch, it will stop, but when you take pressure off, it turns on again, so you have to be careful about how you hold this thing while you are cutting, or you might be making a cut, and while you are gliding thru the hair, you could stop the blades and it might pull hair. Now, in real life, it is not difficult to avoid this as long as you know it ahead of time, and I can tell you that it has not happened to me yet while my wife has been using it. It is more a matter of understanding how it works, and then making sure you pay attention to it. Not a reason to avoid this clipper, because it has plenty of power, and dispite what others have written, it is not loud at all, compared to others I have heard. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this clipper. You get all kinds of adapters and other things with it.  It works great!</li>
            <li> Five stars because the Wahl Cordless Lithium Ion&lt;br /&gt;Clipper earned it. What I like the most about  this clipper&lt;br /&gt;is that it is cordless, holds a long charge and clips  hair great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this clipper to everyone!</li>
            <li> Used it for a couple of months and it works like brand new, no pulling at all. Battery life is awesome.</li>
            <li> Great product but the charger is for 110 volts not for 220 volts. I transferred to another country of 220 volts sockets, so I had to use a different adapter.</li>
            <li> My 22 year old son asked for these specifically.  He&#x27;s a self-sufficient college grad and has been doing his own hair for years.  Loved the look on on his face when he opened this gift!</li>
            <li> Purchased the product in May of 2012. Liked the product because it is cordless, quiet, and cuts well. But the clipper has already broke, won&#x27;t take a charge anymore and I&#x27;ve only had it for 7 months. I understand that yes Wahl is a &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; brand but I did expect it to last longer than 7 months. Not satisfied with the product due to it being broken already.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this clipper so far. It works really well: cuts hair smoothly without any problems, no cord, holds the charge well, doesn&#x27;t sound loud (depends on your preference but I think some clippers are way worse). I love this 27-piece kit: guide combs are excellent and you can choose from many sizes, scissors are not of good quality but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. The detail trimmers works well, I also use it for trimming my beard every 3 days and it feels great for my soft skin. If you use it as often as I do the battery will last about 1 month. Being spoiled by our society I could certainly look for some downsides of this product, but I have not had a single problem with this tool so far and therefore I am not going to. It was worth spending the money to buy it!!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Keeps my hair neat enough to avoid the barber for weeks. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Cut through my hair with ease with different comb sizes. Would prefer the small trimmer to be better for alignments, but it does the job ok.</li>
            <li> Works great and has lots of accessories.  If I had any complaints, which I don&#x27;t, it would be that the included case doesn&#x27;t keep the accessories well organized.  Not really sure how they would have done that anyway.  Oh and cordless is the way to go.  Especially since it doesn&#x27;t use NICAD batteries.  I try not to purchase anything that uses NICADS!</li>
            <li> Clipper seems to be very sturdy, not an el cheapo.. A quick 15 min charge lasts long enough for me to cut my hair as far as a buzz cut. Haven&#x27;t used for a long period of time so can&#x27;t comment, but sure with a full charge it would be fine. Another great purchase from Amazon..</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the one that plugs into the wall</li>
            <li> sturdy and rechargeable. And by sturdy I mean I dropped it 4 times in my shower (no not while I was bathing! That would be stupid). Why did I have it in the shower? Well....er...ENOUGH TALK. Buy this product!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t work after a couple of months</li>
            <li> Nice clippers. Works well and delivers a nice haircut.</li>
            <li> very nice first clipper set, cordless is very convenient</li>
            <li> This is my first wahl trimmer and I am more than satisfied with the performance thus far.</li>
            <li> bought this as a gift. I didn&#x27;t use it for myself, but however the user did inform me that it is a bit loud.  Still working after a year!</li>
            <li> To make a long story short, I have zero cons on this item.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> There are multiple cutting size options....which confuses you...&lt;br /&gt;easy to hold &amp; cut...&lt;br /&gt;The small clipper doesnt have battery... so have to buy them...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall nice product... a must have product if you plan to cut your hairs at home...</li>
            <li> Excellent.  I am a sports clips employee and they do a great job.</li>
            <li> The best ever, this device have really saved me time and money and it really works great. Love it Love it check it out people</li>
            <li> Clippers work great.  Long battery life.  No attachments for trimmer.</li>
            <li> My wife has been cutting our families hair for nearly 13 years. This is our second cordless, but is far superior to the previous one we had. The 15 minute quick charge means that we don&#x27;t have to plan tonight to cut my hair tomorrow night.</li>
            <li> Free from the cord at last!</li>
            <li> I use the product to cut my own hair in the shower (weekly).  This is the right mix of quality (cut) and convenience (cordless).  Other cordless products that I&#x27;ve tried didn&#x27;t have the same quality of cut or options as this one does.  Also, I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months now and the battery charge seems to last nicely as well.  I&#x27;ve only had to charge it a couple of times.</li>
            <li> Just as powerful as the corded Oster clipper that i have been using for years.  Very convenient to use and the battery last a very long time.  Should have purchased this much sooner</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Love my new clippers and trimmers.</li>
            <li> Very nice for being cordless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and I love it, both the clippers have not broken down and its been years. Cleans well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Amazing! I would buy them over and over again. Have bought two pairs, one fore the salon and one for home. Won&#x27;t use anything but now. So efficient and convenient for use anywhere!!</li>
            <li> Wow.  The power is strong for my usual number 1 cut.  I was hesitant to buy a cordless as my previous one did not only keep its power for one cut, but the cutting ability was weak.  Great job Wahl.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  I&#x27;ve owned the corded Wahl products and they each lasted several years.  I really wanted to go cordless, but had some reservations about battery life and power.  But I took a chance and am very pleased.  The Li-Ion battery performs very well.  The charge has a long shelf life without requiring recharge, probably in the order of months.  I can get several haircuts and many beard trimmings out of a single charge.  So if you have reservations about the cordless aspect, not to worry.  This trimmer also has plenty of power.  So if you are worried about having to make sacrifices for the cordless convenience, the only sacrifice may be a higher purchase price relative to a corded unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate this product with 5 stars is because it had a tendency to snag the skin when doing a close beard trim.  The corded Wahl products never had this problem.  Happy to say I was able to fix this problem by running the tip of the blades back and forth across a piece of sandpaper on a counter top.  This fully resolved the snagging problem.  And since the cutting edge is between the blades, the sandpaper did not affect cutting performance.  But this is an issue that Wahl should fix/redesign at the factory.  Either way, don&#x27;t let that stop you from buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if they could just make it water proof for use in the shower...</li>
            <li> It´s ok, but be aware the trimmer is not rechargeable, you have to use AA batteries.</li>
            <li> The lifetime of the battery for these clippers is amazing I rarely have to charge it. It cuts smooth and even and allows for easy self-cutting. The extra set to line up is cool and works but I prefer to have another professional set to make my lineup very clean</li>
            <li> Strong. Fast. Very well and generously equipped.  Do not hesitate!</li>
            <li> It seems to cut nicely but does not charge well the connection is very cheaply made. Three months in and it will no longer charge.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Used it 3 times now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always owned plugin clippers and did not like at all the inconvenience of the cord while i cut. Also after a while the cord its self would get tangled.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cuts well. I did not receive any hair pull from the clippers.&lt;br /&gt;Battery holds charge. After initial charge and use, i tried leaving it on for 15 min straight to see if it would loose power, but it hasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer is sharp for edges.&lt;br /&gt;Good amount of clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The blade got loose and uneven after first use.&lt;br /&gt;to tighten the blade, it requires a star bit not regular Philips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion. For personal use i think this is a great product. The only reason i did not give it 5 stars was due to the blade getting loose. It is also very light weight, so if your cutting your own hair your hands get less tired.</li>
            <li> I have an Oster clipper and an Oster trimmer, but the trimmer was quite old and the clipper is huge. So I figured I&#x27;d give this a try since it got such good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed. The trimmer is horribly loud, but doesn&#x27;t cut close enough, or cleanly enough, to be more useful than the trimmer built into my Norelco razor. It certainly doesn&#x27;t compare to my ancient Oster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper is much the same. Much sound and fury, signifying nothing.</li>
            <li> Until you use this cordless clipper you won&#x27;t be able to appreciate the convenience of not being tethered to a wall outlet. I&#x27;ve been using this clipper once a week for over six months for about 10 minute at a stretch on the initial charge I put on it when I first took it out of the box and it&#x27;s still running strong. Cuts with precision every time. No hang ups or pulling. I recommend this clipper to anyone who needs a good quality clipper for personal grooming.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Comes with combs for every use.</li>
            <li> Cheap quality! I guess you get what you pay for!!</li>
            <li> some corded trimmer works better than this (in similar price range) but the convinience of cordless is far outweighted. Besides, with lithium battery I dont have to charge it everytime I use it. One small issue about the small trimmer, they should have made it lithium battery also instead of AA battery and the small one is noisy. Overall, it is better than anything I owned before.</li>
            <li> Powerful, long-lasting. I have had two haircuts and weekly beard trim with the larger device without needing to charge it (except for the initial charge). My NiCad cordless had to be charged after every use. Even my corded clippers didn&#x27;t have the power that this one has. I have used it for about 4 months now without a problem. So far it appears to be a very high quality product, complete with a lot of nice accessories.</li>
            <li> Great pair of clippers! Works very well so far.</li>
            <li> one of the best for the money and easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;do not buy cheaper brands&lt;br /&gt;you will only be disappointed</li>
            <li> So convenient.  Can go simple or fancy with this.  I&#x27;m so glad my little guy will sit still for me.</li>
            <li> So far it works pretty well. Ive had for about a month.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the product I was a little skeptical seeing its cordless but  it has the power.very quiet . much easier cutting my sons hair</li>
            <li> Product performs as advertised ... cordless feature is outstanding!</li>
            <li> First one went dead after one charge, but the second one works great!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Good weight and shape for holding while cutting&lt;br /&gt;Blades cut through thick hair like it&#x27;s butter - much better than the Philips Norelco I previously owned&lt;br /&gt;Wide array of attachments, most of which I will never use&lt;br /&gt;Extra trimmer and scissors are good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Case is a bit lacking - does not provide protection for devices or a way to organize the many attachments&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;I bought these for cutting my own hair. Pays for itself in a matter of months. I don&#x27;t foresee myself paying for a haircut ever again. I haven&#x27;t owned these long enough to test the life of the Li-ion battery, but it hasn&#x27;t shown any signs of even slowing down after 5 months. Also, once it dies I will still be able to cut my hair while it&#x27;s plugged in. Don&#x27;t forget to clean and oil (with included brush and oil) after each use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been looking for about a year for a decent cordless clipper and finally settled on this one.  Wahl has a good name and I really liked the fact that it has a lithium battery rather than a ni-cad.  Lasts a long time a a charge. Comes with an extensive range of depth control clip ons, including a great eyebrow attachment.  I ordered the Wahl 4oz clipper oil with it and am glad I did.  The small battery operated clipper is ok for small trimming requirements, but is a little loud as some have noted.  Not sure how long the AA batteries will last as I haven&#x27;t used it very much.  Was shipped promptly.</li>
            <li> I just bought this 2 months ago for a christmas gift. They were used once and will not stay charged.</li>
            <li> It is very convenient for traveling. All of the attachments are good and allows a lot of choices. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t cut as close as my corded Wahl Peanut clipper.</li>
            <li> My wife is a hairstylist and has used Wahl products for some time now and I was excited for her to buy these for home use. When I first picked them up I told her they seemed really cheap but \\&quot;Wahl wouldn&#x27;t put their name on it.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, they are junk. Absolute garbage. I bought them at Costco and took them back 24hrs later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We fully charged them before use. When my wife started during my hair with them they pulled my hair and bogged down over and over and over and over until we both said no more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are light, ridiculously light, plastic, just junk.</li>
            <li> Great clipper, have been using since March 2012 and have only charged it 3 times. It is very easy to use, my wife now cuts my hair. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have used the Wahl line of clippers for years. I have cut my hair myself for at least 10 years with a Wahl corded clipper. Recently my girlfriend started doing it for me and I realized a need for cordless clippers. These fit the bill and go right along with my beard trimmer that is a Wahl lithium Ion as well.</li>
            <li> Been using this clippers set on my boys haircuts for the last 4 months; works great!!! Only down, the smaller/edge clipper does not come with any attachment, so rating review @ 4 star.</li>
            <li> Everything you need and usable right out of the box.  Plenty of attachments, if needed, but simple if you don&#x27;t.  The case is an excellent feature as well.</li>
            <li> will cut skin if not careful, but shaves very close</li>
            <li> i think if you want to save money instead of going to the hairdresser this is defenetely the purchase you should do, the clippler cuts really nicely and im happy with it.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to buzz my hair. Does a great job and works well. I have only had for about 6 weeks and haven&#x27;t had any problems yet.</li>
            <li> Clippers work fine, and the battery life is great--so far I&#x27;ve had yet to need to recharge them; although admittedly I only use them to trim my beard so I&#x27;m going weeks on the same charge.  The last clippers I had was Conair which never held a charge longer than 3-min.&lt;br /&gt;My major disappointment is that I purchased these as new clippers, but it was obviously refurbished as the plastic casing had a large, red scratch across the back of them.  I would have attempted to exchange them for the new ones I had ordered, but knowing the expense of postage today, I decided to live with the disappointment in the quality of the case.</li>
            <li> Quick charge, cuts well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it were a little bit more quite, but that would probably put it in a different price bracket.</li>
            <li> Works great, hold a charge for a long time. Power button is in the wrong place but just being picky. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> No complaints.  This is a well made product.</li>
            <li> Good product good service.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect, I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Used to cut homeless peoples hair where there is no electricity...Batteries/charge lasted all day everyday Love these!!!</li>
            <li> Small clipper did not work. Replacement was sent right out.</li>
            <li> These clippers are great. They do an excellent job cutting my hair and the batteries hold their charge for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is how loud they are. It doesn&#x27;t bother me that much but if noise is something you are looking out for, these are definitely noisy.</li>
            <li> I went for this clipper because of the cordless feature. That made it perfect for traveling. The battery works wonderfully. On a full charge it can last for weeks and multiple usage sessions! The battery operated shaver is what took the half star from it. It is quite poor compared to the big one. The single battery barely drives the motor. If the big clipper had a close shave as the small shaver, it would be perfect. I recommend the product.</li>
            <li> It did not take a charge.  Unable to use.  I finally called Wahl.  They asked me to return it to them.  I did.  They have not  returned it yet.  I&#x27;m expecting it any day now.  Thank you,  Bob.</li>
            <li> Cut fast and clean and stay cool doing it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made a huge mistake buying this clipper.  That mistake was NOT buying this years ago...!!! I had been getting a short 0A buzz cut for over 10 years and recently went to a 000. That close a cut requires a stylist to have care and finesse on any gentle skin on the scalp.  Going to the local Supercuts for years afforded me countless scheduling conflicts with my preferred stylist only to once find me at the mercy of a flock of seagulls nose pierced skinny jean wearing EMO newbie who&#x27;d take the edge of the blade as close to my skull cap just short of removing my flesh...translation very MUCH pain.  My brother who has used a Wahl for years buzzing his own head often suggested me getting my own Wahl clipper which I shunned. As Supercuts increased their buzz cut pricing to nearly the same price as a person with a full head of hair I began to see the light. BIG mistake.....???  Yea...I should have done this years ago.  I&#x27;ve used this cordless Wahl clipper for 3 weeks now and find using it every Sunday affords me a fresh, clean looking cut every Monday at work. That $18 plus dollars I spent at Supercuts every 2-3 weeks now can be better spent elsewhere.  If your hesitate like I was for years to buzz your own cut....get this CLIPPER. It will be the best money you spent on your head EVER.....!!!</li>
            <li> I really love the cordless not cord tangling feature of this item and doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as the classic Wahl hair electric corded clipper that I have used in the past and which I still have this classic clipper-this cordless clipper has plenty of power for me to cut my bushy thick hair into a short military style #2 cut; nevertheless, I have had to send this cordless clipper back to Wahl for lithium battery replacement (lithium battery repair 5 year guarantee at no charge including parts and labor) in May 2013 because it stopped charging.  Sadly Wahl said this battery charging failure has been happening for this unit and is like common place and is to be expected for this type of charging battery that they use in this cordless clipper; nevertheless, I still like using it and I recommend it but with caution with the charging battery failure and it not being able to use a cord with it when the battery doesn&#x27;t work!!!  I would have given it 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for this battery charging failure and that a much better very long lasting charging battery was used instead of this failed one and and if it weren&#x27;t for that it not being able to use a cord with it when the battery doesn&#x27;t work.  I would highly recommend Wahl to improve this clipper by using a much better very long lasting charging battery in it and for a cord to be allowed to be used with it when the  battery doesn&#x27;t work!!!</li>
            <li> The big (re-chargeable) clippers are pretty good but the little AA powered clippers failed within a week of purchase.</li>
            <li> I looked at these at the retail stores for ages before I bought. First, the backstory. I am replacing cordless Conair clippers and a rechargeable Remington trimmer. Lithium Ion! Longer charges, new tech! That is what I wanted. These “feel” cheap in every way compared to both the Conair and Remington items they replaced. The large clippers like to bite into flesh if they get the chance, the guides are sharp and harsh. And don’t get me STARTED on the small, personal trimmer. A bit of reading would have been a good start for me. I didn’t realize the personal trimmer is just a disposable piece of garbage thrown in to round out the kit. I expected it too to be lithium ion (it is not rechargeable, runs on AA batteries). I expected the small trimmer to come with guides (it does not). And I expected it to be better than what I already had (laughable). It sounds like they’ve designed it to send WAY too much power to the motor – like the whole thing could fly apart at any moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Conair clippers have worn out entirely, so the Li Ion clippers will see some usage – time will tell whether they are as disappointing as I believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Remington trimmer does not hold a charge well these days and the worn guides have a tendency to slip (dangerous when trimming – see: bald spot) but for now, I will continue to use the old trimmer – with plans to put this one into a box for future “garage sale.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very, VERY disappointed.</li>
            <li> These are great.  No cord so you can cut anywhere.  Battery life seems to be doing good.  cut 6 mens haircuts and still no sign of battery dying.  Will update after a few months.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  Does not cut clean, may need new blades already.</li>
            <li> Blade adjustment initially didn&#x27;t work at all. I had to spend about 35 minutes to fix it. It&#x27;s a shame to know that it was made in USA!!!</li>
            <li> Well made and very convienant!Wish I had got away from the cord years ago. Don&#x27;t have to set near an outlet anymore.</li>
            <li> Feels cheap in your hand and the power button was a poor design selection.  Top cover needs more ribs for rigidity and give the unit a more solid feel.  Also, feels slick in the hand and I&#x27;d rather have something that feels more secure or not as slippery.  The small clipper imho is useless.  I have no idea what its used. Mustache?  At the end of the day it cuts hear just fine and Lithium Ion is a perfect battery for clippers. So the things I mention are just to make it better but you&#x27;ll be more than satisfied with this when cutting hair unless your hair is like a bocage.</li>
            <li> My thought for this is Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well and saves me money!!! I read reviews before placing the purchase. I don&#x27;t understand what other people are whining about. One was complaining about power button? Come on. Stop confusing people.</li>
            <li> Nothing beats a Wahl clipper for the price. This one cuts clean everytime and hair cuts only take minutes. Its a little heavy but thats what you get with such a long lasting LI ION battery.</li>
            <li> Great razor. I purchased for my husband and he threw out his other 2. He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Clippers cut well. I really like the cordless feature so it&#x27;s easy to handle without the cord.  Price at $40 plus is a little steep.</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect right out of the box.  I&#x27;ll do it again in two weeks.</li>
            <li> The only downside is this is a replacement for a set I bought at Wal-Mart about two years ago. I loved the performance, the case and all the clip on guides. I thought my previous cutter was a little short lived until I did some research.......I never oiled the old set and it is important that you do as directed. If all else fails read the directions.&lt;br /&gt;It is a quick charge, the charge lasts for a couple of long haircuts (I have not had the occasion to do more than two cuts).  a great shape, it is very comfortable to hold.  Light weight also.  I guess you get the picture. It is a great clipper package just oil it occasionally.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from ingrown hair this is a must have product, I can finally use a razor blade to shave with!!!</li>
            <li> I have only used it a couple of times but have been very pleased. The cordless feature was the main draw. Fortunately it cuts and trims well also.</li>
            <li> Would have given this 5 star only if the smaller shaver was better. The smaller shaver does not cut well at all. The large main one works great. No tugging or pulling. I like all the different guides and accessories.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, perfect knife for thick hear</li>
            <li> Best professional clipper. Works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace a WHAL corded that bit the dust. So far these are great! It&#x27;s nice to not have the cord when i&#x27;m in the shower to shave my head. The battery seems to hold on for a good amount of time.  They look great. The only thing I&#x27;d like to see is a charging stand so I can leave it in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> It works fine. But the trim kit, smaller one, is defected. The blade was broken little. Other than that there is no problem.</li>
            <li> The tips of the clipper blades are extremely sharp, causing them to bite into the skin when not using a guard. Most other brands round the edges so they are more comfortable.</li>
            <li> It was everything I expected. It works great, no problems at all with the product. Just a quality American product.</li>
            <li> Wow ! No more cord😎 I gave myself a high and tight without a mirror. So so easy. Nice grip. Excellent quality.</li>
            <li> The best pair of clippers I&#x27;ve bought.  By far the best with usage after a charge and have not had any snags.</li>
            <li> With many handy features such as the quick charge, and the many adjustable settings this cordless Wahl delivers a 1-2 knockout punch. It&#x27;s versatile, lightweight, and powerful. You simply cannot go wrong with a Whal. It even comes with a secondary close trimmer to get into the small areas around for an even trim.</li>
            <li> Loved the clipper, it was loud but worked great.  I have had it 1 year and it will no longer charge. and has only been used maybe 10 or so times.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Pro:&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is very good I have no complain so far and charges fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am able to keep myself trimmed and well groomed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come with all accessories and oil to maintain the clippers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;First time I ordered the item arrived on time but the mini clipper had all the front teeth broken so I had to return it again and reorder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second order the mini clipper had one tooth broken but I have decided to keep it, but the larger clipper head is not properly align. (I had to open it with screw driver and align it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mini clipper is very sensitive where if you are not careful it will pull you skin in and cut you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mini clipper is very loud…I mean very loud.</li>
            <li> i was just looking for something to trim my hair, but this came in a nice bag with both clippers, a bunch of guards, two combs, and a cutting apron.&lt;br /&gt; the clippers are both fantastic and hold a nice long charge.&lt;br /&gt;this will save me a ton on haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;a great buy for sure.</li>
            <li> I chose this product based on positive reviews and I was not let down.  Great battery life and a solid performer.</li>
            <li> Bought this clipper 3/13. It&#x27;s now dead after 4-5 uses. Will attempt to work with manufacturer. We&#x27;ll see how that goes...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Wahl corded clippers for years, my last set being a professional set I purchased through a beauty supply.  When the time came to replace the blades on the corded units, I decided to look at cordless alternatives.  After reading the reviews, I decided to take a chance on these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While they are not as heavily constructed as the professional models, these are quite sufficient for my needs.  The large clipper works great... as good or better than my corded unit, but eliminating the cord makes cutting SO much easier!  The trimmer is much more lightweight than the professional version I had, and it does require a battery, but works just fine for me.  Again, the cordless touch makes it so much easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combined price of these two units was just a wee bit more than the price of replacement blades for the professional model.  Time will tell how the batteries hold up, but for now I have to say I&#x27;m very pleased and would definitely buy these again.</li>
            <li> Used this for my beard, thought i&#x27;d be able to trim it down within 2 or 3 passes but it took a few tried.  Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my beard but sometimes it snagged on my beard.  Accessories are good just a little hard to swap out the different attachments.  All in all it does the job and I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace our broken corded clipper.  I always had problems trying to work around the cord while cutting my own hair with the previous clipper, and having to stop &amp; unplug to untangle a knot in the cord...but didn&#x27;t know any better.  After buying this baby, I&#x27;ll never go back to corded again!  Seems to hold a charge for a long time, before having to re-charge, and I love not having to deal with the cord anymore.  Comes with all the attachments you&#x27;ll need, and can be stored in the included soft-shell case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: The second &amp;#34;detail&amp;#34; trimmer is NOT rechargeable lithium ion - it takes either AAA or AA batteries (not included).  I don&#x27;t use that one as much, but have had no issues and no complaints with performance on either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a corded Wahl clipper set for over 10 years, and wanted to get something more portable. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m disappointed, but I&#x27;m not impressed, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They haven&#x27;t pulled my hair, and they cut pretty cleanly and powerfully, but for some reason they don&#x27;t seem to cut all my hairs. This is hard to explain, but I shave my whole head to a No. 2 guard every two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After going over all my head with the No. 2 guard, there are still a bunch of stray hairs standing around. I&#x27;ll rinse my hair with water, then I have to go back over it a few more times with the clippers to get all the hairs. My corded Wahl never needed the second pass because it got all the hairs the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mini clipper works REALLY well. In fact, I don&#x27;t even use it anymore because I nicked the back of my neck several times. The big clippers actually do a great job of cleaning up my neck without nicking it (as much), so I just use those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other complaint is the &amp;#34;contoured shape&amp;#34; of the clippers. Because it&#x27;s necessary to shift my grip on the clippers often to get the right angle, it becomes uncomfortable and cumbersome to do so with the shape really only made for your hand to hold them one way. The basic square shape of my old clippers was a lot easier to handle in several different grips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery lasts quite a while (see warning below). I&#x27;ve charged it over night, then waited 2 weeks, shaved my head, waited another two weeks, and shaved my head again all on the original charge. I&#x27;m not sure if it would do more than that as I haven&#x27;t tested it, but it didn&#x27;t seem like it was slowing down at all after the second shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHARGING WARNING: If you charge the clippers with the wall charger, make sure you unplug the clipper from the cable when you&#x27;re done. If you unplug from the wall and leave the other end plugged into the clippers for storage, it will drain your battery in a day or two. I don&#x27;t know why it does this, but it definitely does it as I&#x27;ve experimented 3 times now and found this to be the case. As long as you either leave them plugged into the wall all the time, or unplug the clippers when they&#x27;re full, you&#x27;ll be fine. It&#x27;s just when you leave the clippers plugged into the cable, but don&#x27;t plug the cable into the wall to keep drawing power.is, but it definitely does it as I&#x27;ve experimented 3 times now and found this to be the case.
