            <li>I purchased this product based on the reviews I read on Amazon, and I was not disappointed!  </li>
            <li>Well Africa&#x27;s Best Kid&#x27;s Organics Extra Virgin Olive Oil Plus Shea Butter Detangling Moisturizing Hair Lotion does it all AND is cheap to boot.</li>
            <li>After washing it with creme of nature no sulfate shampoo, then used the africa&#x27;s best kids organics conditioner, I sectioned her hair in four sections and applied this on each section I brushed it through with a brush similar to the denman brush &amp; she had beautiful curls afterwards</li>

            <li>I concur with the other reviewers as to how great that \\&quot;Africa&#x27;s Best Organics Detangle Lotion\\&quot; (with extra virgin olive oil plus shea butter)</li>
            <li>Works great in my daughters hair (mixed-</li>
            <li>I love it so much!  </li>

            <li>It provides enough hold to keep my style in check without frizz and smells SO good.</li>
            <li>It works great on my daughters hair, but I will discontinue using it due to the parabens.</li>
            <li>- This is a heavier product, best suited for African American hair textures.   </li>
            <li>What I like most about this product is that it moisturizes the hair while leaving the hair naturally soft.  </li>
            <li>It made it really soft and even made some curls more defined.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also perfect for both wet and dry braid outs.</li>
            <li>Good product, it really fights knots when hair is wet.</li>
            <li>This product can be safely used by both children and adults from various racial backgrounds.  </li>
            <li>Seems like the minute I find a product I love, some big wig decides to fix what ain&#x27;t broke</li>
            <li>When I braid my hair for the night at the end of Day 2, I lightly spritz a little water mixed with my favorite hair oil, put a tiny bit of the lotion on my ends, and my curls stretch out more and more as the days go by (3 days max without a wash</li>
            <li>Smells good and not oily or heavy on my daughter&#x27;s hair after her swims!</li>
            <li>I thought it was purely &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; and safe.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Works much better on wet hair.  </li>
            <li>Very sticky, and this products contains parabens.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many curl creams that were more expensive on my daughter&#x27;s 4c hair</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It really moisturizes my hair which is usually pretty dry</li>
            <li>My hair was soft and manageable with a minimum of elbow grease!  </li>
            <li>Leave my daughter&#x27;s natural hair so shiny for days!</li>
            <li>In the past, before setting my hair on rollers I put a small amount of this on each section and my hair turned out great.</li>
            <li>is for both naturally curly and relaxed hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to stick with all natural products.</li>
            <li>I am growing out my relaxer and read about this product on a natural hair site.  </li>
            <li>Her hair was soft all day.</li>
            <li>it is very watery and it only keeps my hair moisturized for like and hour or two</li>
            <li>I just went natural about 9 months ago</li>
            <li>I am using this for my 11 month old&#x27;s curly hair.</li>
            <li>My girls are African American and Latino with very different grades of hair (one has loose curls with smooth texture, the other with beautiful and thick coils that spiral in some places and</li>
            <li>so that when I need more hold and extra shine it doesn&#x27;t make a big mess.</li>
            <li>but it leaves my hair very soft when used as a daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I am a woman with naturally curly hair that changes textures depending on the weather (here in the D.C. area it can get both humid and rainy in the same day during the summer), and this product keeps my hair moisturized even when the rain gets to it.  </li>

            <li> Really good hair softener and detangler.  Pleasant smell, very light, non-greasy.  Works much better on wet hair.  Can get this cheaper from [...].</li>
            <li> really great product, My son have lots of hair and I&#x27;m able to comb it through, However I only pay $3.49 in stores</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on the reviews I read on Amazon, and I was not disappointed!  This is easily the best detangling product I have ever used.  I have African American hair, and it was so dry and tangled that I was considering just allowing it to form dreadlocks.    This product seems to melt tangles and absorbs easily into hair.  My hair was soft and manageable with a minimum of elbow grease!  Here are a few things to know:    - This is a heavier product, best suited for African American hair textures.   - No need to wet hair, this product will add moisture.  - I&#x27;m not sure what other reviewers are talking about... it just smells okay.    The ingredients may not be perfect, but this is a great inexpensive solution!</li>
            <li> I concur with the other reviewers as to how great that \\&quot;Africa&#x27;s Best Organics Detangle Lotion\\&quot; (with extra virgin olive oil plus shea butter) is for both naturally curly and relaxed hair.  What I like most about this product is that it moisturizes the hair while leaving the hair naturally soft.  I am a woman with naturally curly hair that changes textures depending on the weather (here in the D.C. area it can get both humid and rainy in the same day during the summer), and this product keeps my hair moisturized even when the rain gets to it.

            <li> In the past, before setting my hair on rollers I put a small amount of this on each section and my hair turned out great. I recently starting putting my hair in two strand twist and needed a moisturizer because my hair was so dry. Instead of spraying with water at night when redoing a twist out I use this. It moisturizes and softens my hair.</li>
            <li> I love using this product, my hair feels healthy and my tangles are greatly reduced.  My only issue is that it can be a bit heavy and greasy feeling if you use to much.</li>
            <li> Items as Described. Thank you AAA+++</li>
            <li> Hated it. Very sticky, and this products contains parabens. I&#x27;m trying to stick with all natural products. Even though I didn&#x27;t get all my money back, I had to return it.</li>
            <li> This cream is thick so it takes a while to work it in.  The smell is very light so that&#x27;s a plus.  You have to really massage it into the scalp to get good results.  I was very pleased with the price.</li>
            <li> Best product ever!  Leave my daughter&#x27;s natural hair so shiny for days!</li>
            <li> It has parabins and I hadn&#x27;t noticed.  I thought it was purely &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; and safe.&lt;br /&gt;Will be returning it. It worked great if you want to have parabins.</li>
            <li> I am growing out my relaxer and read about this product on a natural hair site.  I was a little skeptical at first but after several uses I am hooked. It really moisturizes my hair which is usually pretty dry and I love that it does not leave it feeling greasy.  I am not sure how well it works as a detangler because I have not tried it on wet hair but it leaves my hair very soft when used as a daily moisturizer.  My husband even commented that my hair smells like berries!  I will definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> Good product, it really fights knots when hair is wet. I use it for mu granddaughter&#x27;s thin-curly-long-knotty hair. It works</li>
            <li> I put this on my LO&#x27;s hair and leave in for a few hours but then wash with a moisturizing shampoo as this leaves his hair looking and feeling greasy. I do think it has helped his hair to be less frizzy so I will use BUT only to condition the hair and then wash out.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products to help my daughter&#x27;s hair. After seeing so many good reviews on YouTube &amp; here I decided to pick some up at my beauty store. I am so glad I found it. I have tried so many curl creams that were more expensive on my daughter&#x27;s 4c hair and they were either too heavy or did nothing. After washing it with creme of nature no sulfate shampoo, then used the africa&#x27;s best kids organics conditioner, I sectioned her hair in four sections and applied this on each section I brushed it through with a brush similar to the denman brush &amp; she had beautiful curls afterwards i sealed it with olive oil. Her hair was soft all day. At night I use their triple gro on her scalp or on a twist out. Their line is amazing even on 4c hair</li>
            <li> it is very watery and it only keeps my hair moisturized for like and hour or two then it starts to make my hair really dry and it is also sticky</li>
            <li> Nothing to write home about didn&#x27;t see any chance in the hair</li>
            <li> This stuff tangled my hair. I&#x27;m not sure what i did wrong, but it gives such a profound buildup of product that i wasn&#x27;t even used to that i just KNEW i could only attribute it to this hair lotion. Suffice to say it didn&#x27;t help with detangling, and it dried my hair out and made it feel cakey. Ended up havin to wash my hair out the next day. I used it with water, so i don&#x27;t know if that was the problem or what, but it was a little disappointing considering that others had given it good reviews.</li>
            <li> When I first went natural, I spent a small fortune trying to find products that would do a myriad of different things for my dry, thirsty, unruly 3C hair(i.e. give my curls length, no frizz, shine, nice scent, not sticky, provide hold without stiffness, etc.). Well Africa&#x27;s Best Kid&#x27;s Organics Extra Virgin Olive Oil Plus Shea Butter Detangling Moisturizing Hair Lotion does it all AND is cheap to boot. Yes, it does a nice job of detangling on just washed &amp; conditioned hair but there&#x27;s another big plus. It&#x27;s also perfect for both wet and dry braid outs. It keeps curls tamed but still gives my hair some freedom. It provides enough hold to keep my style in check without frizz and smells SO good. This lotion also \\&quot;plays nice\\&quot; with my other styling products (Vanilla Silk shine serum and Eco Styler Olive Oil Gel) so that when I need more hold and extra shine it doesn&#x27;t make a big mess. I also don&#x27;t need to use it every day to get a nice style. When I braid my hair for the night at the end of Day 2, I lightly spritz a little water mixed with my favorite hair oil, put a tiny bit of the lotion on my ends, and my curls stretch out more and more as the days go by (3 days max without a wash or I&#x27;ll lose my mind!). I just hope this stuff stays on the market forever. Seems like the minute I find a product I love, some big wig decides to fix what ain&#x27;t broke and I&#x27;m back to square one. So while it&#x27;s here give it a try. At this price, you&#x27;ve got nothing to lose.</li>
            <li> Works to detangle both of my daughter&#x27;s hair without leaving sticky or heavy residue. My girls are African American and Latino with very different grades of hair (one has loose curls with smooth texture, the other with beautiful and thick coils that spiral in some places and zig-zag in other places). This product is affordable and works fantastically on my girls&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li> I love this for my girls hair but I would never pay this price. I get it from my local beauty supply for $3.99. But love the product.</li>
            <li> Smells good and not oily or heavy on my daughter&#x27;s hair after her swims! Good leave-in hair moisturiser. Love it</li>
            <li> Works great in my daughters hair (mixed- Vietnamese, Native Am, and Black). It smells great and is very moisturizing. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference instantly when i put this in my daughters hair. It made it really soft and even made some curls more defined. I will def keep buying this</li>
            <li> This product really does a great job getting rid of the tangles!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re buying this because you&#x27;ll think that your hair will curl like I did then you&#x27;re wasting your time. Of course the bottle doesn&#x27;t guarantee anything about hair curling but some people think that that would happen and I&#x27;m saying that that is just another myth.</li>
            <li> The lotion is a good detangler but not a hair lotion nor moisturizer! if you are looking to moisturize your hair , this is not it</li>
            <li> I just went natural about 9 months ago and I looked everywhere for a product that would help keep my hair moisturized without being sticky or smelly!  THis product is amazing.  I love it so much!  Everyone should try this!</li>
            <li> I am using this for my 11 month old&#x27;s curly hair. She is african american and I needed a product that wasnt too harsh and this is great. It smells lovely and makes her hair so curly and shiny. I love that it has olive oil and shea butter!</li>
            <li> Would have given this 5 stars, but it contains parabens. It works great on my daughters hair, but I will discontinue using it due to the parabens.</li>
            <li> detangles the most tangled hair! I use it on all of my girls hair which are 3 totally different textures. It works to detangle on all of them. It works great as a moisturizer as well.</li>
