            <li>I was completely satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>, I probably spit most of the gel out.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good results.  </li>
            <li>Love , Love this product worth every penny I saw results in just 3 days .</li>

            <li>Great product and does a remarkable in bringing your teeth back to the day when you were young.</li>
            <li>The dental appointment was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>These are fantastic.</li>
            <li>These Venus Ultra Whitening Trays truly work and they are super easy to use.  </li>
            <li>how noticeably and significantly whiter your teeth become after just one usage.</li>
            <li>Originally purchased these from my dentist, then followed up with Amazon.</li>
            <li>First te I used it I purchased it from my dentist office for a lot more money.</li>
            <li>It make your teeth sensitive but results are nice.</li>

            <li>The first time I used this product my mouth was hurting.</li>
            <li>I would have been better off with the Crest White strips for a month.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather spend more money on a treatment that will last.</li>
            <li>More than 1/2 of the 4-star and 5-star reviews on Amazon are suspiciously written by people who have one and only one review--i.e., for this product.  </li>
            <li>I first heard about this at my dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>I used my first pack of 7 in about a month, and my teeth were sparkling.</li>

            <li>I ended up with a large amount of gel in mouth away</li>
            <li>up with a large amount of gel in mouth away from teeth</li>
            <li>That either means it&#x27;s such an amazing product that it compelled people to join Amazon who weren&#x27;t already in the 21st century.</li>
            <li>The whitening gel is contained in plastic trays that are really flimsy.</li>
            <li>Looking at it from that perspective, this product is a real bargain.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I am very please with this product</li>
            <li>You have to quickly put these in place and bite down to secure the trays.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product but be aware that can make your teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li>I still have 3 trays left and most likely won&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>These are a cheap alternative to other custom trays.</li>
            <li>Pleased enough not to want any other whitening products, whether used at home or at the dentist.</li>
            <li>I bought these for me and my mom and there was zero difference after following the directions exactly and using for one week.</li>
            <li>I already have pretty white teeth</li>
            <li>They come with 14 trays, 7 upper &amp; 7 lower; I used all of them on my upper because when I smile, you don&#x27;t really see my bottom teeth.</li>
            <li>Would not recommend for those with already sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>by far the worst&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did not make my teeth feel sensitive.</li>
            <li>My teeth are much whiter after using Ultra White.</li>
            <li>Shouldn&#x27;t be a problem unless you have an awfully wide smile.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the money spent!!</li>
            <li>Ordered many times,but this time the trays are no way the same can&#x27;t hardly use.</li>
            <li>The trays barely adhered to my teeth.</li>

            <li> Steer clear of this silly product.</li>
            <li> This product worked in less then 7 days with no sensitivity!</li>
            <li> Well, as soon as you do that, this disgusting slimy catapillar of gel squooshes out the top and all over your gums.  </li>
            <li> I mean no one really likes holding gel in their mouths for an hour, but it doesn&#x27;t taste bad, and they work so, so well.</li>
            <li> The product seemed stale and dry..</li>
            <li> I have used these in the past and they work like a charm!</li>
            <li> I keep it in place for about 2 hours per usage instead of the 30 to 45 minutes recommended and have not experienced any problems.</li>
            <li> product was very uncomfortable to wear.&lt;br /&gt;Did not adhere to teeth well&lt;br /&gt;almost impossible to talk</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed in this purchase!</li>
            <li> Horrific!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is very effective at whitening teeth, as claimed. It does, however, take a little practice using it correctly. The whitening gel is contained in plastic trays that are really flimsy. You have to quickly put these in place and bite down to secure the trays. The more gel you have in contact with your teeth, the better it will work. I put these in and then watch a movie. You quickly forget they&#x27;re there. You do have to continue to bite down or the trays will just fall out. I keep it in place for about 2 hours per usage instead of the 30 to 45 minutes recommended and have not experienced any problems. The gel will irritate your gums so take care not to let it ooze out of the trays.&lt;br /&gt;It really is amazing how noticeably and significantly whiter your teeth become after just one usage. It does seem the trays don&#x27;t continue to whiten your teeth. After about the third or fourth application your teeth are as white as they&#x27;re going to get with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased. Pleased enough not to want any other whitening products, whether used at home or at the dentist. Looking at it from that perspective, this product is a real bargain.</li>
            <li> My dentist gave me the Venus Whitening kit for customer appreciation.  I was completely satisfied with the results. It was very easy to use. I plan on buying a kit in the future.</li>
            <li> a little difficult to fit and stay on teeth; but, did the job. am going to try another treatment</li>
            <li> I used this product every night for 1 week as i was directed by my dentist. I normally do not have sensitive teeth but this product had my mouth aching&#x27; for a while. My teeth got about 1-2 shades lighter after the 1 week. Would not recommend for those with already sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Stick with Crest whitening strips as these do NOT do the job at all! I bought these for me and my mom and there was zero difference after following the directions exactly and using for one week. I am so disappointed in this purchase! Manufacturer will not take any blame for these not working. They do not back their product.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product my mouth was hurting. It make your teeth sensitive but results are nice. I would recommend this product but be aware that can make your teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;ve only tried Crest White strips, I would not recommend this product at ALL.  I called my dentist, who recommended the product, and asked for my money back. The gel began to ooze out of the flimsy trays almost immediately. It created a white foam all in my mouth. The trays barely adhered to my teeth. The bottom tray, forget it!!!!  I ended up with a large amount of gel in mouth away, I probably spit most of the gel out.  I still have 3 trays left and most likely won&#x27;t use them. I paid $75 for this mess.  I would have been better off with the Crest White strips for a month.</li>
            <li> The product seemed stale and dry..Please look into the problem, is it on the shelf too lonh? Would like to know what other similar product is recommended?</li>
            <li> Great product and does a remarkable in bringing your teeth back to the day when you were young. Plus, makes the coffee stain disappear.</li>
            <li> The trays are pretty flimsy and hard to keep them in place but what do you expect for 30 bucks?  Anyways my teeth looked noticeably whiter for about a week and then they turned back to how they were before.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again.  And I got these based off a recommendation from my dentist... I&#x27;d rather spend more money on a treatment that will last.</li>
            <li> I used these before my wedding and they worked so well. I already have pretty white teeth but this product helped me to achieve that pearly white look I was going for. I have purchased it for my sister and recommended it for a friend. I did not use all the trays because my gums were a bit irritated, but my teeth were already very white by then.</li>
            <li> This product worked in less then 7 days with no sensitivity! I had my teeth whitened before at the dentist and felt great sensitivity. Love Venus Ultra!</li>
            <li> Ive tried several different brands of whiteners. by far the worst&lt;br /&gt;This product was very uncomfortable to wear.&lt;br /&gt;Did not adhere to teeth well&lt;br /&gt;almost impossible to talk&lt;br /&gt;ended up with a large amount of gel in mouth away from teeth</li>
            <li> Love , Love this product worth every penny I saw results in just 3 days . Yes the trays do move around a little bit but once I got use to them on my teeth it worked awesome. And can&#x27;t beat the price.  I went to my dentist they had them for 70 bucks . I said no thanks came home looked on amazon and got them for a way cheaper price and in two days. I will definitely be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> These are a cheap alternative to other custom trays. Keep in mind they won&#x27;t affect your back teeth. Shouldn&#x27;t be a problem unless you have an awfully wide smile. Originally purchased these from my dentist, then followed up with Amazon. Expect some sensitivity but your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> NOTE: More than 1/2 of the 4-star and 5-star reviews on Amazon are suspiciously written by people who have one and only one review--i.e., for this product.  Apparently these people registered only to write the review. That either means it&#x27;s such an amazing product that it compelled people to join Amazon who weren&#x27;t already in the 21st century. Or these reviewers are shills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway. I received a pack of these as part of a Groupon deal, along with a dental appointment. The dental appointment was fantastic.  But I don&#x27;t wonder why Venus White Ultra Whitening Trays whitening are being given away.  They are gross! And if offered again, I wouldn&#x27;t accept them for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;trays\\&quot; are super thin.  You&#x27;re supposed to push them against your teeth and smoosh them around so the gel spreads. Well, as soon as you do that, this disgusting slimy catapillar of gel squooshes out the top and all over your gums.  You have to push the gel back in, and then the \\&quot;tray\\&quot; falls off---there is NO way to make the tray adhere to your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF you immediately bite down and clench your teeth--as one reviewer suggests--the trays collapse anyway, each side (front and back) fall away from your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And THEN when you can&#x27;t imagine the situation becoming any more charming, the frothing at the mouth begins. It&#x27;s like Peter Brady&#x27;s science project volcano. Horrific! Even a lobster bib wouldn&#x27;t help keep you civilized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went through 4 sets of upper/lower trays --- same thing happened every time. The last 3 sets of trays were flung down the trash chute where they belonged.  Steer clear of this silly product. And ignore the paid positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Product works well, I only used it 4 days and noticed an improvement.  Does leave your teeth sensitive, but it goes away after a few days.  I would use again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stick to the teeth, returned it and got the crest 3d</li>
            <li> Pretty good results.  Reasonable price.  As with anything of this nature, you need care in using so as not to cause discomfort.  I first heard about this at my dentist&#x27;s office.  That was the recommendation to me to try it.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price! First te I used it I purchased it from my dentist office for a lot more money.It did not make my teeth feel sensitive. The trays stay in place as long as you don&#x27;t  move your mouth!</li>
            <li> These are fantastic. I mean no one really likes holding gel in their mouths for an hour, but it doesn&#x27;t taste bad, and they work so, so well. I used my first pack of 7 in about a month, and my teeth were sparkling. Now, about 5 years later, I split a pack with my boyfriend and I used the other 3 to kind of touch up. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> These trays definitely work! I noticed a difference right away. They come with 14 trays, 7 upper &amp; 7 lower; I used all of them on my upper because when I smile, you don&#x27;t really see my bottom teeth. I&#x27;m getting married this summer and plan on buying another box before the wedding. Definitely reccommend!</li>
            <li> I have used these in the past and they work like a charm! They produce great results after using and I recommend them to others looking to brighten their teeth!</li>
            <li> These Venus Ultra Whitening Trays truly work and they are super easy to use.  There is a fresh minty taste and they cause no sensitivity to teeth, gums or lips.  Extremely easy to use and I did get compliments after the first four days.  My teeth were several shades whiter.  I am very please with this product and I&#x27;ll continue buying this brand only.</li>
            <li> The trays are easy to use, not messy and the solution did not irritate my gums (unlike other products I&#x27;ve used in the past).&lt;br /&gt;The best thing is, the product really works. My teeth are much whiter after using Ultra White. It&#x27;s definitely worth the money spent!!</li>
            <li> Ordered many times,but this time the trays are no way the same can&#x27;t hardly use.</li>
