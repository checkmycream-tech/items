            <li> Smells really but it&#x27;s really not that long lasting. I work a really long shift and I have to apply maybe about three times a day. Might be different for some one else.</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance. Light and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Smells Great when you first apply does not seem to last long on me anyway. Last about 2 hours for me.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is GENUINE MICHAEL KORS  PARFUM!!  When I compared it to the tester in MACY&#x27;S, they did not smell alike.  Also, it did not last long on me....less than 1 hour....the one from Macy&#x27;s can still be smelled!!  IT DID ARRIVE QUICKLY, THOUGH!</li>
