            <li>I tried the soap without using the lotion and it too noticably improved my soreness, and no bad smells.  </li>
            <li>By combining the hot shower with this soap, I am seeing (and feeling!)</li>
            <li>Thanks for helping to improve my quality of life!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 24 years old and have osteoarthritis in most of my joints.</li>
            <li>Personally, I find that the soap is more convenient for me if I&#x27;m at home; however, it&#x27;s effectiveness doesn&#x27;t cover my full sixteen hour day away at school.</li>
            <li>In my case, I have found a hot shower almost always brings some pain relief.</li>
            <li>Fortunately for me, the first few hours of my day are some of the ones I need the most help with.</li>
            <li>I tried the lotion first and thought it gave fast long-lasting relief.</li>

            <li>I also purchased the lotion since my pain is pretty severe throughout the day as well, and I have 3&amp;4 year old boys to keep up!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have purchased this Two Old Goats Soap and also its bottles of lotion.  </li>
            <li>Price is to high for what you get</li>

            <li>After using this soap bar on his feet for about 3 weeks, major results...  positive results.  </li>
            <li>It is now 2 weeks later and the elbow is still pain free with only that ONE application of soap and lotion application.  </li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>

            <li> It works well but leaves a thick soap ring in the tub.</li>
            <li> I purchase this for my father, who&#x27;s in a nursing home.  He was experiencing swelling in his feet.  After using this soap bar on his feet for about 3 weeks, major results...  positive results.  The swelling his going down!</li>
            <li> My husband suffers from arthritis and has tried everything out on the market but nothing comes close to the relief he feels every time he takes a shower and uses this soap.  He then towels off and uses Two Old Goats lotion and lets in soak in for continued relief.  He says these items have helped his pain more than anything out on the shelf.  Go ahead and try it--you will be amazed!</li>
            <li> THIS SMELLS SO GOOD AND IT RELAX YOUR BODY I BOUGHT SOME FOR MY MOTHER AND THE LOTION TO HELP WITH MY PAIN , SO I TELL PEOPLE TO BUY IT.</li>
            <li> Although I didn&#x27;t observe this soap benefits for what it claim,&lt;br /&gt;I do like the way it makes my skin feel soft. A neighboring  feed store&lt;br /&gt;already sells the two old goats lotion, hopefully they&#x27;ll start selling&lt;br /&gt;the soap also.</li>
            <li> I have only used this soap for a few days since I just received it this week. I have fibromyalgia, and most mornings I wake up achy all over. In my case, I have found a hot shower almost always brings some pain relief. By combining the hot shower with this soap, I am seeing (and feeling!) much relief from the pain. Rather than dreading the mornings, I feel like I finally have a &amp;#34;therapy&amp;#34; I can use to help with the discomfort. I also purchased the lotion since my pain is pretty severe throughout the day as well, and I have 3&amp;4 year old boys to keep up! Again, I feel that the lotion has also aided in taking that terrible edge off and allowing me to live more normally. I would recommend these products to anyone diagnosed and suffering from fibromyalgia. I actually just told my mom about them as she has severe arthritis. She said she will be trying some too! Thanks for helping to improve my quality of life!!</li>
            <li> soap only lasted 5 days.  not impressed. not worth the money&lt;br /&gt;should be a bigger piece of soap. not a good buy</li>
            <li> No matter how you look at it, this is wonderful soap.  Just as the lotion is.  You won&#x27;t find a better price anywhere.</li>
            <li> I have not tried the soap.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased this Two Old Goats Soap and also its bottles of lotion.  I did not expect that it would be so great but I was TOTALLY SURPRISED.  WOW!  It works!  It is a GREAT SOAP and the lotion has removed two terrible place of pain on my body.  I had a terrible right elbow that was inflammed with arthritis.  I washed it with this soap and then applied the lotion and within 24 hours, the pain was GONE!  It is now 2 weeks later and the elbow is still pain free with only that ONE application of soap and lotion application.  I have used this soap on other areas and have found that IT WORKS!  Yes I am surprised... but very grateful.  I like natural products for health problems... rather than chemicals.  Try it, you will be amazed as how it works.</li>
            <li> I purchased the soap along with the lotion.  The concept of a muscle/ache relieving soap was new to me, so I was curious.  I&#x27;m troubled by a little arthritis, bursitis, and sore muscles from re-starting a workout regime. I tried the lotion first and thought it gave fast long-lasting relief. I tried the soap without using the lotion and it too noticably improved my soreness, and no bad smells.  I gave it to my mom who has had a knee replacement and suffers frequently from knee pain.  We both liked the smell and she felt is gave noticable relief.  It&#x27;s a bit expensive, especially with the shipping, but I&#x27;ll likely keep it on hand.</li>
            <li> Warm shower and soap knocked down my pain level to an acceptable place.  Kept me happy most of the day.  Suffer with chronic psin so this is a big plus.</li>
            <li> WASN&#x27;T TERRIBLY IMPRESSED.  JUST GOOD SOAP.</li>
            <li> Price is to high for what you get</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this soap as a gift for people who need fast pain relief before bedtime. Smells good, feels good, and soaping up with this before soaking my aching body in a hot bath helps me sleep through the night. Pills can&#x27;t touch the relief I get with Two Old Goats.</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my skin feel, didn&#x27;t notice any pain relief from it, however. Way overpriced for a very small bar of soap. Won&#x27;t purchase again</li>
            <li> I really liked this lotion and soap and would recommend it to everyone for just any use they need it for..</li>
            <li> very pleasant scent, would love for bar to come in extra large size, but will order this again, and will recommend to friends</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 24 years old and have osteoarthritis in most of my joints. Unfortunately, my health insurance has been dropped and even when I had it, the steroids and anti-inflammatory drugs only went so far and have by no means been a panacea. I also have a three and a half mile walk to the bus twice a week and I have to walk the same distance back. Needless to say, I&#x27;m flirting with the temptation to jam a pocket knife into my leg all day and anything that can alleviate the pain is welcomed with open arms. Anyway, now that the background is done with I&#x27;ll get to the brass tax. This soap works pretty well, but only for about six hours. It may have a more lasting effect, but it&#x27;s difficult to tell since the weather hasn&#x27;t changed in a few days. The first three hours are pretty good and after it starts to regress in it&#x27;s effectiveness. Fortunately for me, the first few hours of my day are some of the ones I need the most help with. It got you through the mornings and that helps allot. Personally, I find that the soap is more convenient for me if I&#x27;m at home; however, it&#x27;s effectiveness doesn&#x27;t cover my full sixteen hour day away at school. I&#x27;m currently awaiting the arrival of the lotion and may be updating my review to compare the two products in a few days. Like I said, it&#x27;s no cure-all, but I&#x27;ll take what I can get.</li>
            <li> great product with great results....used it for a few years...best one yet, works on my back pain.  Suggested it to others who love it too.</li>
            <li> Very relaxing and comforting soap.  After bathing with it, you emerge with a really authentic clean smell.  I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I love the creamy lather that it makes and my hands and body feel great after using it.</li>
            <li> This is a great soap and at a decent price.  You will want to buy several bars to keep around the house.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from FM most of my life.  The soap and the blue bottle -- what a combination!  I love this stuff. All natural ingredients, takes the pain away.  Not a cure, but gives relief with no side effects.  I&#x27;ve recommended this to everyone I know and sent one to my daughter.</li>
            <li> I Loved it!  Use it all the time.  Feels cool and refreshing when I shower. Don&#x27;t use on private parts.</li>
            <li> nice soap, but useless, dont bother.  It did nothing at all for aches and pains.  But it was a good soap, very drying though.  Pretty much useless</li>
            <li> I have fibromyalgia, along with arthritis and severe spinal problems ( 6 bad discs) and have severe pain all over my body.  I was hoping to receive some relief from this procuct that was recommended to me by a friend.  I have used the lotion, cream, and soap and have noticed NO CHANGE with it at all.  I am glad that some people do, but I have not.</li>
