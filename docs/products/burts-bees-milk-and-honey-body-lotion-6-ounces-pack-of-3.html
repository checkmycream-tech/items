            <li>i&#x27;d say stick with their honey and grapeseed lotion if you want something that smells awesome!!</li>
            <li>This product is awesome!</li>
            <li>are very nice</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful light honey scent!</li>
            <li>I use it for feet, in my massage business and the effect is good..</li>
            <li>Once I put it on, everyone tells me how good I smell.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my skin in good condition, even in the El Paso desert.</li>
            <li>I does not feel so good.</li>
            <li>They haven&#x27;t looked this good since I stopped using Avon.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion!</li>
            <li>What could be better than that!</li>
            <li>AMAZING lotion.</li>
            <li>This one soaks in immediately (which could be a good point for many)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really bothering me right now, partly because i&#x27;m usually so impressed with how good Burt&#x27;s Bees products smell.</li>
            <li>I used Avon for many years and loved it, but when I decided to go paraben free, I couldn&#x27;t use it anymore</li>
            <li>This lotion goes on very smoothly without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>mild and honey sound great</li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products and the Milk and Honey lotion WAS my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love the Burt&#x27;s Bees products and this is one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li>My favorite hand lotion.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this lotion.</li>
            <li>I gifted this to a friend and she loved it so much that she insisted I get her more.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion and this 3 pack was a fantastic price.</li>
            <li>,i was exposure to  strong sunlight,so be sunburn.</li>
            <li>used it on my body and it does not feel smooth at all.</li>
            <li>So if you prefer light smell, I recommend not choose this one.</li>
            <li>it smells fabulous (without being too girly or overpowering).</li>
            <li>It also has a very fresh, clean, just stepped out of the shower smell.  </li>
            <li>this lotion is non-greasy and absorbs quickly which i enjoy.</li>
            <li>I ALWAYS ask them if the scent is overwhelming or too much and every time I have been given a resounding \\&quot;no\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite lotion.  </li>
            <li>It took TWO WEEK&#x27;s worth of oral Benadryl and apple cider vinegar rubdowns with baking soda baths to get rid of the rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell wonderful, but it keeps my skin so soft and smooth without some of the harmful ingredients other lotions have.</li>
            <li>The former version felt more hydrating and seemed to stick around longer after application.  </li>
            <li>The first couple of times I wore it</li>
            <li>Rather buy 12oz - more for the money but can only buy 6 oz bottles now.</li>
            <li>My thumbs still cracked and the tips of most of my fingers were dry and flaky until I found Burt&#x27;s Bees Milk and Honey.</li>
            <li>I too was a little concerned that the scent would be too heavy as I use it for an all over body moisturizer, but I cannot tell you how many people (both men and women, friends and strangers) have stopped me to tell me how good I smell and to ask me what it is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pungent and plasticky.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend  it!</li>
            <li>this is give to my wife,she is very like.</li>
            <li>It did absorbed quickly but the skin feels strange.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this lotion after long research for natural and healthy body lotion.</li>
            <li>If applied to the face it gives a mild minty burn but only lasts for 5 seconds when you apply it.</li>
            <li>and I have been going nuts trying to find a decent lotion ever since.</li>
            <li>My skin needs more intense moisture - nursing student and my hands are raw from handwashing by the end of day.&lt;br /&gt;Sad.  </li>
            <li>I definitely think it&#x27;s worth trying a bottle and seeing for yourself.</li>
            <li>once applied it smells like a mixture of mint and plastic, then slowly wears off to smell like warm plastic.  </li>
            <li>I use it daily right out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>I returned it and got a new bottle.........</li>
            <li>Within a few days the crack was fully healed and the rest of my hands were back to healthy normal.</li>
            <li>When I first bought the new formula it smelled soo strange</li>
            <li>This stuff not only works great on the hard dry skin on our hands and feet,  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work anywhere near a well as the old formula.</li>
            <li>I read at health ratings websites that it was the number one product for natural lotions.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural body lotion and picked this up.  </li>
            <li>bother if you have sensitive skin and are prone to allergic reactions.</li>
            <li>The new Milk and Honey is not the same as the old one.</li>
            <li>I do wear a less odoriferous brand of lotion on the days when I want to wear perfume but other than that I love it.</li>
            <li>BRING THE OLD MILK AND HONEY BACK.!!!!</li>
            <li>I am going to stock up on the old one and eventually have to search for a different lotion.</li>
            <li>Very thick, not an overwhelming scent, and totally moisturizes my legs</li>
            <li>This is a super compliment because she is hard to please.</li>

            <li> Honestly I&#x27;m a little shock by how much the other reviewers don&#x27;t like this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found a few people carrying the old version here on Amazon, and I&#x27;ll be scooping it up until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> I stay moisturized all day long!</li>
            <li> It works well on my dry skin/eczema</li>
            <li> It takes only a little to go a long ways.</li>
            <li> However, the smell is truly as strange as the other reviews have noted -</li>
            <li> In my job, I must wash my hands frequently and in the winter months I usually have dryness and painful skin cracks on more than one fingertip.  </li>
            <li> Guess you get for you pay for,the real organic creams in this size are expensive.</li>
            <li> I found some pure Shea Butter this summer and started our very dry, cold Colorado winter using that.</li>
            <li> This smells a little like cocoanut, which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago, my sister-in-law introduced me to it.</li>
            <li> Once I applied this, it started healing within a few hours and the pain went away.</li>
            <li> It absorbs well, does not feel heavy and is soothing.  </li>
            <li> It has decreased the number of cracks and my hands are a lot less dry.  </li>
            <li> I live in Alberta, Canada where the air is very dry and it can be very cold.</li>
            <li> I do not love this reformulated Milk &amp; Honey lotion.</li>
            <li> By suppertime, I was itchy, red and wholly uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> This product has very heavy smell.</li>
            <li> but it has a weird smell even a little stinky.</li>
            <li> The new formula is HORRIBLE!!!!!</li>
            <li> Expensive for what you get</li>
            <li> I thought it must have been a bad batch.</li>
            <li> Perhaps now that Burt&#x27;s Bees is owned by Clorox they are trying to cut corners with the fragrance used, regardless, the smell of this lotion is bad.</li>
            <li> I had a painful crack on my thumb that wouldn&#x27;t heal.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> The scent is NASTY!!!!</li>

            <li> AMAZING lotion. Very thick, not an overwhelming scent, and totally moisturizes my legs</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products and the Milk and Honey lotion WAS my favorite. The new formula is HORRIBLE!!!!! It doesn&#x27;t work anywhere near a well as the old formula. The scent is NASTY!!!! When I first bought the new formula it smelled soo strange I thought it must have been a bad batch. I returned it and got a new bottle.........Nope! same gross scent! I hope Burt&#x27;s reads these reviews......BRING THE OLD MILK AND HONEY BACK.!!!!</li>
            <li> I do not love this reformulated Milk &amp; Honey lotion. Meh. The former version felt more hydrating and seemed to stick around longer after application.  This one soaks in immediately (which could be a good point for many) but then it doesn&#x27;t feel like I used it!  My skin needs more intense moisture - nursing student and my hands are raw from handwashing by the end of day.&lt;br /&gt;Sad.  I&#x27;ve found a few people carrying the old version here on Amazon, and I&#x27;ll be scooping it up until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> this lotion is non-greasy and absorbs quickly which i enjoy. but it smells like windex for some reason, or like some combination of Windex and rubber. it&#x27;s really bothering me right now, partly because i&#x27;m usually so impressed with how good Burt&#x27;s Bees products smell. i&#x27;d say stick with their honey and grapeseed lotion if you want something that smells awesome!!</li>
            <li> Honestly I&#x27;m a little shock by how much the other reviewers don&#x27;t like this product.  The first couple of times I wore it I too was a little concerned that the scent would be too heavy as I use it for an all over body moisturizer, but I cannot tell you how many people (both men and women, friends and strangers) have stopped me to tell me how good I smell and to ask me what it is. I ALWAYS ask them if the scent is overwhelming or too much and every time I have been given a resounding \\&quot;no\\&quot;. Maybe it just works differently with my body chemistry???  I do wear a less odoriferous brand of lotion on the days when I want to wear perfume but other than that I love it. It works well on my dry skin/eczema and now I can&#x27;t imagine going without it.  I definitely think it&#x27;s worth trying a bottle and seeing for yourself.</li>
            <li> This lotion goes on very smoothly without feeling greasy. It takes only a little to go a long ways. I stay moisturized all day long! I love this lotion!</li>
            <li> Boooo! The new Milk and Honey is not the same as the old one. The smell is nauseating. It&#x27;s very pungent and plasticky. The consistency is thicker. Why do you change your ingredients, Burt&#x27;s Bees??!?!?!   I am going to stock up on the old one and eventually have to search for a different lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and this 3 pack was a fantastic price. Not only does it smell wonderful, but it keeps my skin so soft and smooth without some of the harmful ingredients other lotions have. I live in Alberta, Canada where the air is very dry and it can be very cold. I highly recommend  it!</li>
            <li> I keep buying Burt&#x27;s products because I have not used one I hadn&#x27;t like.  That is until I used this.  The lotion actually made my hands feel dry.  Thinking it was just me I gave one to a family member and she thought the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;For this Burt&#x27;s product I will not try again and I&#x27;ll be giving these tubes away.</li>
            <li> I love the Burt&#x27;s Bees products and this is one of my favorites.  It goes on silky, dries on the skin quickly and leaves no residue behind to get on your clothes.  It also has a very fresh, clean, just stepped out of the shower smell.  My husband loves the fragrance.  What could be better than that!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a Burt&#x27;s Bees honey and bilberry scent.  I didn&#x27;t find it.  This smells a little like cocoanut, which I don&#x27;t like. I use it for feet, in my massage business and the effect is good..</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite lotion.  I use it daily right out of the shower.  Once I put it on, everyone tells me how good I smell.  Keeps my skin in good condition, even in the El Paso desert.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! My favorite hand lotion.</li>
            <li> Rather buy 12oz - more for the money but can only buy 6 oz bottles now. Expensive for what you get</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this lotion after long research for natural and healthy body lotion. I read at health ratings websites that it was the number one product for natural lotions.&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my body and it does not feel smooth at all. It did absorbed quickly but the skin feels strange. Another downside is the smell(!), mild and honey sound great but it has a weird smell even a little stinky. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural body lotion and picked this up.  However, the smell is truly as strange as the other reviews have noted - once applied it smells like a mixture of mint and plastic, then slowly wears off to smell like warm plastic.  Perhaps now that Burt&#x27;s Bees is owned by Clorox they are trying to cut corners with the fragrance used, regardless, the smell of this lotion is bad.</li>
            <li> I used this lotion twice, applying it once in the morning and once in the afternoon. By suppertime, I was itchy, red and wholly uncomfortable. Dealing with the reaction overtook my life. It took TWO WEEK&#x27;s worth of oral Benadryl and apple cider vinegar rubdowns with baking soda baths to get rid of the rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t bother if you have sensitive skin and are prone to allergic reactions.</li>
            <li> If applied to the face it gives a mild minty burn but only lasts for 5 seconds when you apply it.I wish it was one hundred percent organic,instead it&#x27;s only got some organic stuff in it.Guess you get for you pay for,the real organic creams in this size are expensive.Overall it&#x27;s ok,doesn&#x27;t feel sticky like some creams when applied.</li>
            <li> This product has very heavy smell. I does not feel so good. So if you prefer light smell, I recommend not choose this one.</li>
            <li> This stuff not only works great on the hard dry skin on our hands and feet,  it smells fabulous (without being too girly or overpowering).</li>
            <li> this is give to my wife,she is very like.But one day ,i was swimming in outdoor，there&#x27;s lake are very nice,i was exposure to  strong sunlight,so be sunburn.Be used it when i got home,doesn&#x27;t hurt the next day!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion. I used Avon for many years and loved it, but when I decided to go paraben free, I couldn&#x27;t use it anymore and I have been going nuts trying to find a decent lotion ever since. I run a home day care and wash my hands constantly. I found some pure Shea Butter this summer and started our very dry, cold Colorado winter using that. I put it on at night (to greasy for day time) and put on gloves. My thumbs still cracked and the tips of most of my fingers were dry and flaky until I found Burt&#x27;s Bees Milk and Honey. A few weeks ago, my sister-in-law introduced me to it. I had a painful crack on my thumb that wouldn&#x27;t heal. Once I applied this, it started healing within a few hours and the pain went away. I also didn&#x27;t feel like I needed to apply lotion every three minutes! Within a few days the crack was fully healed and the rest of my hands were back to healthy normal. They haven&#x27;t looked this good since I stopped using Avon. I don&#x27;t even wear gloves at night anymore like I did with the Avon. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.  It has a wonderful light honey scent!</li>
            <li> In my job, I must wash my hands frequently and in the winter months I usually have dryness and painful skin cracks on more than one fingertip.  I can carry this with me and use it after every hand-washing.  It has decreased the number of cracks and my hands are a lot less dry.  It absorbs well, does not feel heavy and is soothing.  I use it on my face, around my eyes and it is not greasy.  I will always have this on hand</li>
            <li> I gifted this to a friend and she loved it so much that she insisted I get her more. This is a super compliment because she is hard to please.</li>
