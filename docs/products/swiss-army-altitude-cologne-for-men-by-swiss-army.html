            <li>Let me start off by saying I own well over 30 colognes.</li>

            <li>Refreshing scent</li>
            <li>so I recommend it with greater security that you will be satisfied with your purchase.</li>
            <li>I would say this should be worn more for evenings but that depends solely on your preference.</li>

            <li>gladly recommend it.</li>
            <li>100% satisfied.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would be a more refined smell.</li>
            <li>but if you do, its 60 dollars or more.  </li>
            <li>I am Happy that I got a good perfume buy following others review about this product.</li>
            <li>all ok, thank you</li>
            <li>because I love the perfume&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And so many friends loves the smell.</li>
            <li>This smells like eucalyptus and lime (more of a hand soap than cologne).  </li>
            <li>One of my husband,s favorite perfumes.</li>
            <li>great product highly recommended</li>
            <li>The cap is very secure, and is easy to remove, and re-apply.</li>
            <li>So if that is what you want it&#x27;s nice and the packaging is cool.</li>
            <li>new and Swiss Army has and will be always a great fagrance for men..</li>
            <li>All these fragrances smell great, but it is nothing new.  </li>
            <li>Excellent Very goog care and delivery was on time thanks</li>
            <li>Although not my favorite for the price its fine.</li>

            <li>Excellent , it&#x27;s just what I expected</li>
            <li>However, most people seem to enjoy it.</li>
            <li>This really smells good.</li>
            <li>excellent fragrance, very good and lasts long enough to say it&#x27;s original, recommend, arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;buy</li>
            <li>I love this cologne  very fresh smelling ....</li>
            <li>The scent is strong.</li>
            <li>highly recommended for women, smells good</li>
            <li>The blend of floral, musk, and woodsy notes (and “a hint of mint”) in Swiss Army’s Altitude is easy on the nose and will leave the wearer feeling cool and refreshed most of the day.  </li>
            <li>pretty nice smell.</li>
            <li>I really love the smell and its not over strong but it has very sweet and fresh smell to it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not only the design that is so attractive but the smell.</li>
            <li>design of the bottle can be just as important as the smell if you collect them.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for something with more zest and fresh.</li>
            <li>smell of Swiss Army is very fresh/fruity, and brings to mind a warm summery type day with friends and family all around.</li>
            <li>… Enjoy your day…</li>
            <li>Smells Good but doesnt last more than 5 hours.</li>
            <li>This is a very NICE smell, and it last for 8 hours.</li>
            <li>This is a very NICE smell, and it last for 8 hours.</li>
            <li>It has a unique smell, with that of the outdoors, and a hint of wood.</li>
            <li>Original  Fragance?  </li>
            <li>IT IS ORIGINAL.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I received the original perfum</li>
            <li>I love the essence, really freshening!</li>
            <li>EXELENTE PRODUCTO Y ORIGINAL, ENTREGADO EN EL TIEMPO CONVENIDO</li>
            <li>But in my opinion there are so many more colognes out there which are much, much better for around the same cost.</li>
            <li>excelente original, paquete recibido en perfectas condiciones</li>
            <li>Very strong, and a little overwhelming, going on but mellows to a really nice scent.</li>
            <li>Altitude offers great flexibility to be worn in any season, any event, and will generally be unobtrusive to most of the crowd.  </li>
            <li>Good long lasting aroma is what makes this Swiss Army product a great purchase.</li>
            <li>its mild it&#x27;s not too strong its just right.</li>
            <li>Use imm after shower for the full effect.</li>
            <li>MY DADDY LOVE HIS COLONGE AND WANT TO BUY ANOTHER ONE VERY SOON...</li>
            <li>Not a bad cologne for the price.</li>
            <li>so fare not bad , its not Ralf Lauren thou</li>
            <li>Not a bad thing, but some critics suggest the need for originality.</li>
            <li>I live in Venezuela and I am getting is just the products, everything went well, delivery times were respected and everything is in good condition, greetings, blessings and successes, recommended 100%, thanks.</li>
            <li>if you sniff it quickly it reminds me a bit of licorice candy.  </li>
            <li>It lasts pretty long and has a great effect on the body.</li>
            <li>My only problem is that it last a couple hours at best.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stand Cool Water and those higher type colognes so this fit for me.</li>
            <li>Y el envio fue super rapido.</li>
            <li>decent smell, thought it would be better since its the highest rated one on here</li>
            <li>I really like this clean smell!</li>
            <li>Cheap and very nice for everyday use.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s like so many other fruity/citrus/flower scents which seem so popular.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product,  especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I wish it lasted a little longer but its still great.</li>
            <li>Smells pretty fresh and clean scent its value is definitely worth its price</li>
            <li>Smells like tangerine peels, fresh cut grass, with a hint of lavendar....</li>
            <li>What a fresh cologne...</li>
            <li>fresh from the shower smell, sporty</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional and have bought much more costly cologne&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Excellent fragrance scented a peculiar and very original, the negative is used by many people but is better smelling well although it is repeated to not smell anything or worse, stink.</li>
            <li>This scent is not for me, as for the scent itself, it&#x27;s powerful at first but quickly fades.  </li>
            <li>Its bold and exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Hi, first of all buy this product with the greater expectation because I live in Venezuela and did not know how he was in physical, but to have it in my hands I feel satisfied because it was exactly as it was in the publication.</li>
            <li>Overall, the color design is very unique, and overall a nice look on a shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this seller, I&#x27;ve had trade mark&#x27;s EDT and can tell you with no doubts that it is an original one.</li>
            <li>Swiss Army is a name brand and very trust worthy.</li>
            <li>I believe that this must be more for a younger type demographic than myself—I’m 31, but I can’t imagine anyone of any age not finding something that they may like about the fresh smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a hard time locating this great cologne in stores.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>Prefer this for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;Masculine scent - in a sense that more on the lines of like Calvin Klein Truth or Tommy Hilfiger.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You may actually like the smell more than I do; but just be warned that this does not smell outdoorsy at all.</li>
            <li>, I really liked the product, what I expected.</li>
            <li>It is pretty aggressive.</li>
            <li>A real classic from Victorinox.</li>
            <li>Thanks and regards from Colombia!</li>
            <li>This is a good everyday cologne for men.  </li>
            <li>All good, this product is excelent and rapid of obtein in few minuts.</li>
            <li>To be totally honest about this fragrance, I am not the biggest fan of the smell or other products by the brand.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because the price was very reasonable, but the girlfriend really likes the woodsy smell, so it was a win-win purchase.</li>
            <li>the seller is very responsible and the product is more than I expected</li>
            <li>smells really good and last long</li>
            <li>thanks for the product all this fine see you later</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>in addition to me not liking the scent that much to begin with.  </li>
            <li>Might be that my sweat mixes with its scent really well, anyways, this is my number one.</li>
            <li>Very manly smell to this cologne.</li>
            <li>, thanks a lot.</li>
            <li>thanks for everything</li>
            <li>I really like the fragrance&lt;</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t appear to have much refinement.</li>
            <li>thanks for your product ..</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Really manly smell.</li>
            <li>there was much delay</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Smells young and fresh</li>
            <li>It has a very sturdy, heavy feel to the case, and travels very easily.</li>
            <li>It is not the original fragrance, has a different smell.</li>
            <li>On a personal note, I do like the Swiss Army bottles – each unique and cleverly designed.  </li>
            <li>A cheap fragrance, offers nothing special, is very short, not back to buy</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would buy this again in a heartbeat when I am ready for a new bottle.</li>
            <li>this one  and the classic one.</li>
            <li>Not perfect but perfect enough.</li>
            <li>classic cologne, beauty smell</li>
            <li>Really fresh smell and it last long, which is important.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this item if you have used their products before or if you want to add to the collection.</li>
            <li>I had this when i was in high school</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>is marked thanks</li>
            <li>This cologne overall has a nice scent to it, a few compliments.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s reality, it seems the original this perfume, in that I&#x27;m giving my opinion later, you do not use it when removing them, but to use the smell goes very fast, or is expired or imitation is not recommend to buy them ...</li>
            <li>young, fresh, elegant and \\&quot;secretly sexy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>This one is by far one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>I know colognes can be very subjective as individuals have different preferences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only reason I ever tried the fragrance was because my wife absolutely loves the smell</li>
            <li>I believe through the early 2000&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I like and is masculine.</li>
            <li>Is it old product ?</li>
            <li>Cannot find in the mall near here</li>
            <li>but i guess all these cheap deals wont last long ... as simple as that ...</li>
            <li>this is an everyday fragrance or a special occasion fragrance</li>
            <li>, it is very powerful so only use a little bit.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re in the cologne thing this scent is not original but its a good one from the past with different package</li>
            <li>If a decent smelling cologne lasts a long time, I see it as a quality cologne, but the scent doesn&#x27;t last long...</li>
            <li>Performance is average, perhaps better than average, lasting 6-8 hours at arm’s length and less projection.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the one I bought is the original, because I compared my last empty bottle</li>

            <li> But frankly in my honest opinion, it works like a cologne.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying I own well over 30 colognes.</li>

            <li> Refreshing scent</li>
            <li> so I recommend it with greater security that you will be satisfied with your purchase.</li>
            <li> I would say this should be worn more for evenings but that depends solely on your preference.</li>
            <li> im smelling better than yesterday because I have this...</li>
            <li> gladly recommend it.</li>
            <li> 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would be a more refined smell.</li>
            <li> but if you do, its 60 dollars or more.  </li>
            <li> I am Happy that I got a good perfume buy following others review about this product.</li>
            <li> all ok, thank you</li>
            <li> because I love the perfume&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And so many friends loves the smell.</li>
            <li> This smells like eucalyptus and lime (more of a hand soap than cologne).  </li>
            <li> One of my husband,s favorite perfumes.</li>
            <li> great product highly recommended</li>
            <li> The cap is very secure, and is easy to remove, and re-apply.</li>
            <li> So if that is what you want it&#x27;s nice and the packaging is cool.</li>
            <li> new and Swiss Army has and will be always a great fagrance for men..</li>
            <li> All these fragrances smell great, but it is nothing new.  </li>
            <li> Excellent Very goog care and delivery was on time thanks</li>
            <li> Although not my favorite for the price its fine.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, arrived on time and is as above ose is original.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it for all people using amazon just what I wanted and time for delivery without remembering nothing more to add I bid good day</li>
            <li> Excellent , it&#x27;s just what I expected</li>
            <li> However, most people seem to enjoy it.</li>
            <li> This really smells good.</li>
            <li> excellent fragrance, very good and lasts long enough to say it&#x27;s original, recommend, arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;buy</li>
            <li> I love this cologne  very fresh smelling ....</li>
            <li> The scent is strong.</li>
            <li> highly recommended for women, smells good</li>
            <li> The blend of floral, musk, and woodsy notes (and “a hint of mint”) in Swiss Army’s Altitude is easy on the nose and will leave the wearer feeling cool and refreshed most of the day.  </li>
            <li> pretty nice smell.</li>
            <li> I really love the smell and its not over strong but it has very sweet and fresh smell to it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not only the design that is so attractive but the smell.</li>
            <li> design of the bottle can be just as important as the smell if you collect them.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for something with more zest and fresh.</li>
            <li> smell of Swiss Army is very fresh/fruity, and brings to mind a warm summery type day with friends and family all around.</li>
            <li> … Enjoy your day…</li>
            <li> Smells Good but doesnt last more than 5 hours.</li>
            <li> This is a very NICE smell, and it last for 8 hours.</li>
            <li> This is a very NICE smell, and it last for 8 hours.</li>
            <li> It has a unique smell, with that of the outdoors, and a hint of wood.</li>
            <li> Original  Fragance?  </li>
            <li> IT IS ORIGINAL.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I received the original perfum</li>
            <li> I love the essence, really freshening!</li>
            <li> EXELENTE PRODUCTO Y ORIGINAL, ENTREGADO EN EL TIEMPO CONVENIDO</li>
            <li> But in my opinion there are so many more colognes out there which are much, much better for around the same cost.</li>
            <li> excelente original, paquete recibido en perfectas condiciones</li>
            <li> Very strong, and a little overwhelming, going on but mellows to a really nice scent.</li>
            <li> Altitude offers great flexibility to be worn in any season, any event, and will generally be unobtrusive to most of the crowd.  </li>
            <li> Good long lasting aroma is what makes this Swiss Army product a great purchase.</li>
            <li> its mild it&#x27;s not too strong its just right.</li>
            <li> Use imm after shower for the full effect.</li>
            <li> MY DADDY LOVE HIS COLONGE AND WANT TO BUY ANOTHER ONE VERY SOON...</li>
            <li> Not a bad cologne for the price.</li>
            <li> so fare not bad , its not Ralf Lauren thou</li>
            <li> Not a bad thing, but some critics suggest the need for originality.</li>
            <li> I live in Venezuela and I am getting is just the products, everything went well, delivery times were respected and everything is in good condition, greetings, blessings and successes, recommended 100%, thanks.</li>
            <li> if you sniff it quickly it reminds me a bit of licorice candy.  </li>
            <li> It lasts pretty long and has a great effect on the body.</li>
            <li> My only problem is that it last a couple hours at best.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand Cool Water and those higher type colognes so this fit for me.</li>
            <li> Y el envio fue super rapido.</li>
            <li> decent smell, thought it would be better since its the highest rated one on here</li>
            <li> I really like this clean smell!</li>
            <li> Cheap and very nice for everyday use.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s like so many other fruity/citrus/flower scents which seem so popular.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product,  especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I wish it lasted a little longer but its still great.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty fresh and clean scent its value is definitely worth its price</li>
            <li> Smells like tangerine peels, fresh cut grass, with a hint of lavendar....</li>
            <li> What a fresh cologne...</li>
            <li> fresh from the shower smell, sporty</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional and have bought much more costly cologne&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Excellent fragrance scented a peculiar and very original, the negative is used by many people but is better smelling well although it is repeated to not smell anything or worse, stink.</li>
            <li> This scent is not for me, as for the scent itself, it&#x27;s powerful at first but quickly fades.  </li>
            <li> Its bold and exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Hi, first of all buy this product with the greater expectation because I live in Venezuela and did not know how he was in physical, but to have it in my hands I feel satisfied because it was exactly as it was in the publication.</li>
            <li> Overall, the color design is very unique, and overall a nice look on a shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this seller, I&#x27;ve had trade mark&#x27;s EDT and can tell you with no doubts that it is an original one.</li>
            <li> Swiss Army is a name brand and very trust worthy.</li>
            <li> I believe that this must be more for a younger type demographic than myself—I’m 31, but I can’t imagine anyone of any age not finding something that they may like about the fresh smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a hard time locating this great cologne in stores.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> Prefer this for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;Masculine scent - in a sense that more on the lines of like Calvin Klein Truth or Tommy Hilfiger.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You may actually like the smell more than I do; but just be warned that this does not smell outdoorsy at all.</li>
            <li> , I really liked the product, what I expected.</li>
            <li> It is pretty aggressive.</li>
            <li> A real classic from Victorinox.</li>
            <li> Thanks and regards from Colombia!</li>
            <li> This is a good everyday cologne for men.  </li>
            <li> All good, this product is excelent and rapid of obtein in few minuts.</li>
            <li> To be totally honest about this fragrance, I am not the biggest fan of the smell or other products by the brand.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because the price was very reasonable, but the girlfriend really likes the woodsy smell, so it was a win-win purchase.</li>
            <li> the seller is very responsible and the product is more than I expected</li>
            <li> smells really good and last long</li>
            <li> thanks for the product all this fine see you later</li>
            <li> fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> in addition to me not liking the scent that much to begin with.  </li>
            <li> Might be that my sweat mixes with its scent really well, anyways, this is my number one.</li>
            <li> Very manly smell to this cologne.</li>
            <li> , thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> thanks for everything</li>
            <li> I really like the fragrance&lt;</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t appear to have much refinement.</li>
            <li> thanks for your product ..</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Really manly smell.</li>
            <li> there was much delay</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Smells young and fresh</li>
            <li> It has a very sturdy, heavy feel to the case, and travels very easily.</li>
            <li> It is not the original fragrance, has a different smell.</li>
            <li> On a personal note, I do like the Swiss Army bottles – each unique and cleverly designed.  </li>
            <li> A cheap fragrance, offers nothing special, is very short, not back to buy</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would buy this again in a heartbeat when I am ready for a new bottle.</li>
            <li> this one  and the classic one.</li>
            <li> Not perfect but perfect enough.</li>
            <li> classic cologne, beauty smell</li>
            <li> Really fresh smell and it last long, which is important.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this item if you have used their products before or if you want to add to the collection.</li>
            <li> I had this when i was in high school</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> is marked thanks</li>
            <li> This cologne overall has a nice scent to it, a few compliments.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s reality, it seems the original this perfume, in that I&#x27;m giving my opinion later, you do not use it when removing them, but to use the smell goes very fast, or is expired or imitation is not recommend to buy them ...</li>
            <li> young, fresh, elegant and \\&quot;secretly sexy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This one is by far one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I know colognes can be very subjective as individuals have different preferences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only reason I ever tried the fragrance was because my wife absolutely loves the smell</li>
            <li> I believe through the early 2000&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I like and is masculine.</li>
            <li> Is it old product ?</li>
            <li> Cannot find in the mall near here</li>
            <li> but i guess all these cheap deals wont last long ... as simple as that ...</li>
            <li> this is an everyday fragrance or a special occasion fragrance</li>
            <li> , it is very powerful so only use a little bit.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re in the cologne thing this scent is not original but its a good one from the past with different package</li>
            <li> If a decent smelling cologne lasts a long time, I see it as a quality cologne, but the scent doesn&#x27;t last long...</li>
            <li> Performance is average, perhaps better than average, lasting 6-8 hours at arm’s length and less projection.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the one I bought is the original, because I compared my last empty bottle</li>
            <li> expected no less from this brand.</li>
            <li> I really like swiss army altitude, i used to use on my ordinary life</li>
            <li> The smell is long lasting</li>
            <li> The essence of a fragrance to be smelled by anyone in a distant may seemed to wear down unexpectedly for an eau de toilet.</li>
            <li> as long it&#x27;s applied twice a day.</li>
            <li> I hope excuse what I&#x27;ll say</li>
            <li> The fragrance is not maintained during the day, only lasts about two hours, I have previously purchased this product and is not equal</li>
            <li> It is not very strong nor long lasting.  </li>
            <li> because slightly shorter duration of stay and the price is constantly changing....</li>
            <li> This cologne has a very weak scent and the scent it does carry isn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
            <li> As expected it.</li>
            <li> Not enough fixer , lasts very , very little , what happened ?</li>
            <li> I usually switch between this and red ellis 360.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I&#x27;ve heard from friends is that it smells \\&quot;too outdoorsy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I had this cologne back in the late 90&#x27;s</li>
            <li> , The smell progressively deteriorates in just few hours.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of a light bug repellent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very good at describing scents but it has an earthy pine(?)</li>
            <li> Had a hard time finding this product.</li>
            <li> Duh.</li>
            <li> and I get asked at least once or twice</li>
            <li> It turned out to be an imitation, but disappointment.</li>
            <li> Dumb question from some prospective buyer.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My girlfriends love it I get many compliments</li>
            <li> excellent item and good seller</li>
            <li> This is a very NICE smell, and it last for 8 hours. Women love this smell</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re in the cologne thing this scent is not original but its a good one from the past with different package</li>
            <li> Excellent product, arrived on time and is as above ose is original. He fulfilled all my expectations. I will keep ordering this product with this supplier.</li>
            <li> excellent price. fast shipping. i recommend it.</li>
            <li> Mi mejor recomendacion es que vayan a una perfumeria y pidan una muestra y pruebenlo por ustedes mismos! El olor es sutil pero durarero y el rociador ayuda a ahorrar bastante la colonia</li>
            <li> scent fades away after a while</li>
            <li> This must be one of the best smells I had- young, fresh, elegant and \\&quot;secretly sexy\\&quot;. Aside from that, the bottle was very nice and so masculine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, The smell progressively deteriorates in just few hours. Although I can guarantee that it would really last for about 24 hours that is if you smell it yourself with your nose close to the cloth. The essence of a fragrance to be smelled by anyone in a distant may seemed to wear down unexpectedly for an eau de toilet. This is not a parfum and neither a cologne. But frankly in my honest opinion, it works like a cologne.</li>
            <li> Hi, I just bought this product and I&#x27;m totally satisfaied... the scent is great, my girlfriend loves it... what more can I ask ... &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Me gusto  porque es exquisita</li>
            <li> I did not like . It is not the original fragrance, has a different smell. I do not recommend it .</li>
            <li> Great smell, great price, great size. Highly recommended!! I bought it because its price was reduced in more than 45%. Great business!</li>
            <li> I recommend them. According to the product.</li>
            <li> Exce&amp;ntilde;ente aroma.</li>
            <li> Great scent. Love it. Might buy again. Prefer this for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;Masculine scent - in a sense that more on the lines of like Calvin Klein Truth or Tommy Hilfiger. And NOT like Davidoff coolwater or Issey Miyaki.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying I own well over 30 colognes. This one is by far one of my favorites. It was gifted to me by my family on my birthday. I know colognes can be very subjective as individuals have different preferences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cologne is my go to scent. It&#x27;s not only the design that is so attractive but the smell. It has a unique smell, with that of the outdoors, and a hint of wood. I really like it, it is very powerful so only use a little bit. The only complaint I&#x27;ve heard from friends is that it smells \\&quot;too outdoorsy\\&quot;. In all honesty, that&#x27;s what I was going for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design of the bottle can be just as important as the smell if you collect them. It has a very sturdy, heavy feel to the case, and travels very easily. The cap is very secure, and is easy to remove, and re-apply. Overall, the color design is very unique, and overall a nice look on a shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I will conclude with the obvious, the fact it is a name brand. Swiss Army is a name brand and very trust worthy. I would highly recommend this item if you have used their products before or if you want to add to the collection. It has a nice scent in my opinion, and the case itself is something to cherish as well.</li>
            <li> Thank you received the product in good condition</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume and I received on time and everything is great! 100% recommendable! Is just as how I remember it!</li>
            <li> I really love the smell and its not over strong but it has very sweet and fresh smell to it *****5ive star</li>
            <li> This is a very NICE smell, and it last for 8 hours. Women love this smell</li>
            <li> Smells like tangerine peels, fresh cut grass, with a hint of lavendar.... if you sniff it quickly it reminds me a bit of licorice candy.  I didn&#x27;t know what to expect since I saw amazing reviews, thought I&#x27;d give it a try for the price. This scent is not for me, as for the scent itself, it&#x27;s powerful at first but quickly fades.  If a decent smelling cologne lasts a long time, I see it as a quality cologne, but the scent doesn&#x27;t last long... in addition to me not liking the scent that much to begin with.  I was hoping for something with more zest and fresh.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else but Amazon had this great smelling product. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because the price was very reasonable, but the girlfriend really likes the woodsy smell, so it was a win-win purchase.</li>
            <li> Smell Great! For the price, i dont think there&#x27;s anything to compete...i always get compliments at work that i always smell great...worth</li>
            <li> Love it. Its bold and exactly what I wanted. I wish it lasted a little longer but its still great. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> The only perfume that doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling after I sweat while wearing it. Might be that my sweat mixes with its scent really well, anyways, this is my number one.</li>
            <li> Smells good but lasts for 30 minutes!</li>
            <li> manly,elegant aroma!!</li>
            <li> It is an excellent brand, the colony is excellent. highly recommended for women, smells good&lt;br /&gt;I love the style.&lt;br /&gt;The product is great.&lt;br /&gt;I arrive in the estimated time</li>
            <li> Dumb question from some prospective buyer.  Answer: &amp;#34;No, it smells hideous.  That&#x27;s why people buy and wear it.&amp;#34;  Duh.</li>
            <li> To be totally honest about this fragrance, I am not the biggest fan of the smell or other products by the brand. The only reason I ever tried the fragrance was because my wife absolutely loves the smell and I take one for the team every now and again. She continues to buy me the cologne thinking that I actually love it, but I just don&#x27;t have the heart to tell her it&#x27;s not one of my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of Swiss Army is very fresh/fruity, and brings to mind a warm summery type day with friends and family all around. I think the smell is quite invigorating, but at times can be almost overpowering. I believe that this must be more for a younger type demographic than myself—I’m 31, but I can’t imagine anyone of any age not finding something that they may like about the fresh smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may actually like the smell more than I do; but just be warned that this does not smell outdoorsy at all. This is another fresh/fruity smell that seems to be all the rage with colognes these days.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for myself. Packaging, appearance, odor, all very nice and charismatic. but I gave 4 star. because slightly shorter duration of stay and the price is constantly changing....</li>
            <li> I had this cologne back in the late 90&#x27;s I believe through the early 2000&#x27;s. I ran out in about 2005. I had a hard time locating this great cologne in stores. So I decided to look for it on amazon and bam, it was there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of all my colognes I have had through out life this cologne has gotten me the greatest and most compliments by the ladies, friends and just anyone I run across that smells and I get asked at least once or twice every time I wear this cologne to what the brand is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would buy this again in a heartbeat when I am ready for a new bottle. No hesitation at all on my end.</li>
            <li> great smell, fresh and lasts, good price.</li>
            <li> Good smell, but more for the day time then night. Really fresh smell and it last long, which is important.</li>
            <li> Original  Fragance?  different price</li>
            <li> This is a good everyday cologne for men.  Although not my favorite for the price its fine.</li>
            <li> Not a bad cologne for the price.</li>
            <li> excellent product, I am satisfied with it and with the Store esponsibility 100% recommended</li>
            <li> Do about this fragrance that already it is not said? Excellent fragrance scented a peculiar and very original, the negative is used by many people but is better smelling well although it is repeated to not smell anything or worse, stink.</li>
            <li> The colony smells divine my husband loved it</li>
            <li> Great scent, Medium-Long wear (6-7 hours), and sexy bottle.&lt;br /&gt;(Oh and cheap!)&lt;br /&gt;Definitely gets a spot in my daily rotations.</li>
            <li> Bought this one and using it together with Boss deodorant stick. Refreshing scent as long it&#x27;s applied twice a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the one I bought is the original, because I compared my last empty bottle and I noticed that both are very different, and smell different too</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what else to say besides this stuff is good this is an everyday fragrance or a special occasion fragrance its mild it&#x27;s not too strong its just right.</li>
            <li> Hi, first of all buy this product with the greater expectation because I live in Venezuela and did not know how he was in physical, but to have it in my hands I feel satisfied because it was exactly as it was in the publication. so I recommend it with greater security that you will be satisfied with your purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great if you want to have a &amp;#34;Spicy&amp;#34; smell. It lasts pretty long and has a great effect on the body.</li>

            <li> Excellent. I recommend it 100%. As expected it. expected no less from this brand. As always what I have used.</li>

            <li> El perfume llego en el tiempo indicado y el precio es excelente, viene en buen estado y buen empaque, lo recomiendo</li>
            <li> I bought it for my dad and I&#x27;m realy disspaointed not to buy one for me, very good eau de toilette</li>
            <li> Todo bien, producto perfecto, gracias</li>
            <li> very nice smell ... but i guess all these cheap deals wont last long ... as simple as that ...</li>
            <li> thanks for the product all this fine see you later</li>
            <li> I had this when i was in high school and I always come back to it. I usually switch between this and red ellis 360. They&#x27;re both amazing smells</li>
            <li> This cologne overall has a nice scent to it, a few compliments.  My only problem is that it last a couple hours at best.</li>
            <li> great product highly recommended</li>
            <li> Smells good, good for night on the town.</li>
            <li> it was a gift, and like so much, this amazing, great smell, very nice product. to use diary. recommended :D</li>
            <li> Excellent product, recommended 100%</li>
            <li> Very good high quality</li>
            <li> good seller, good product, satisfied</li>
            <li> I hope excuse what I&#x27;ll say but it&#x27;s reality, it seems the original this perfume, in that I&#x27;m giving my opinion later, you do not use it when removing them, but to use the smell goes very fast, or is expired or imitation is not recommend to buy them ...</li>
            <li> Very manly smell to this cologne. The smell is long lasting and I&#x27;ve gotten compliments every time I use this cologne.</li>
            <li> Very strong, and a little overwhelming, going on but mellows to a really nice scent. I&#x27;d say this lasts, on me, around 7 or 8 hours in an office setting. I&#x27;m not very good at describing scents but it has an earthy pine(?) note I like and is masculine. I can&#x27;t stand Cool Water and those higher type colognes so this fit for me. Not perfect but perfect enough. I would say this should be worn more for evenings but that depends solely on your preference. I use it about two days a week day or night.</li>
            <li> it has a pleasant aroma</li>
            <li> Excelente producto!!!</li>
            <li> I got this for my son so when he ran out he asked me to get more!  He loves it!</li>

            <li> Nice scent but it&#x27;s like so many other fruity/citrus/flower scents which seem so popular. So if that is what you want it&#x27;s nice and the packaging is cool. Yet it was my choice to buy it scent unsmelled wishing the woodsy description was what I imagined.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I received the original perfum</li>
            <li> smells really good and last long</li>
            <li> el perfume me gusto es duradero y el vendedor es responsable y puntual con el producto el olor es ricoi</li>

            <li> My husband loves it too! Cannot find in the mall near here but if you do, its 60 dollars or more.  I steal a spray of this from time to time because it smells so wonderful!  I also have the Women&#x27;s Swiss Army for Her which is a nice compliment to the mens fragrance.</li>

            <li> exelente el producto!</li>
            <li> This is easily one of the best Men&#x27;s fragrance available in the market. Good long lasting aroma is what makes this Swiss Army product a great purchase. I have been purchasing this from quite sometime now and would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent perfume, nice fragance. A real classic from Victorinox.</li>
            <li> EXELENTE PRODUCTO Y ORIGINAL, ENTREGADO EN EL TIEMPO CONVENIDO Y BAJO LAS CONDICIONES DESCRITAS, MUY AGRADECIDO POR EL TIEMPO DE RESPUESTA.</li>
            <li> Been buying this cologne for years. I&#x27;m a professional and have bought much more costly cologne&#x27;s. but I like this one the best and so do ladies. Try this great price and it will not disappoint.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Meets expectations.</li>
            <li> ME EN CANTO PERFECTO LO R E C O M I E N D O , A L 1 0 0 %</li>
            <li> This smells like eucalyptus and lime (more of a hand soap than cologne).  It is not very strong nor long lasting.  I get about two or three hours and then it dies.</li>
            <li> This cologne has a very weak scent and the scent it does carry isn&#x27;t worth the price. It reminds me of a light bug repellent. However, most people seem to enjoy it. But in my opinion there are so many more colognes out there which are much, much better for around the same cost.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne  very fresh smelling .... I will buy it again. I really like this clean smell! Awesome</li>
            <li> A cheap fragrance, offers nothing special, is very short, not back to buy</li>
            <li> All perfect thank you i recommend you 100%</li>
            <li> excelente original, paquete recibido en perfectas condiciones y fue enviado a tiempo sin ningun inconveniente, recomiendo a la tienda 100% confiables</li>
            <li> The blend of floral, musk, and woodsy notes (and “a hint of mint”) in Swiss Army’s Altitude is easy on the nose and will leave the wearer feeling cool and refreshed most of the day.  I have four of the Swiss Army fragrances and all have that common theme – the fresh showered effect.  Not a bad thing, but some critics suggest the need for originality. All these fragrances smell great, but it is nothing new.  Altitude offers great flexibility to be worn in any season, any event, and will generally be unobtrusive to most of the crowd.  Performance is average, perhaps better than average, lasting 6-8 hours at arm’s length and less projection.  The beauty of the Swiss Army fragrances is price – all are fairly inexpensive.  On a personal note, I do like the Swiss Army bottles – each unique and cleverly designed.  Final tally for Altitude is 3.7 stars out of 5 stars.  I would recommend to the audience looking for an inexpensive option to add to their collection, otherwise, take a pass on Altitude.  A solid “Like” to the “Fragrantica Following”… Enjoy your day…</li>
