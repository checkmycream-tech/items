    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Best whitening product I have tried.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>My face was brighter and has a magnificent glow.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sympathetic to manufacturers who feel they may add some scent as some consumers are intolerant of the odors of ingredients.  </li>
            <li>The latter supposedly works best in combination with niacinamide &amp; in concentrations of 2% or</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>We will see if it makes me more luminous as time goes by.  </li>
            <li>This is Olay what more can I say.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;ve only been using this a week, but I&#x27;m still impressed.</li>
            <li>Has a strong perfume smell.  </li>
            <li>If I wear make up, I spray last, but it all starts with beautiful skin, I.e., serem.  </li>
            <li>now haven&#x27;t seen any changes with the light spots I have on my face, will keep using it</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>course no skin lightening formula will work unless one consistently protects skin from tanning rays of sun with an effective full spectrum sunscreen.)</li>
            <li>I think their was a little improve after a month, but one great improvement that I could se.\e.</li>
            <li>I really like this light serem.  </li>
            <li>and this is helping better than many other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>I add moisturizer on top, then spray my face with mineral water if I&#x27;m going bare</li>
            <li>Only been using for a few days, but makes my feel wonderful!</li>
            <li>This is a great product of Olay&#x27;s - works as well as more expensive serums and does not cause any breakouts.</li>
            <li>From the first week I started using this product i could see a difference.</li>
            <li>This product is very much like the original Olay White Radiance from Asia.</li>
            <li>Been using this product for about 2 months now---not seeing a whole lot of difference but will keep using it, just to see.</li>
            <li>Nothing has really helped much in healing my skin.</li>
            <li>Item arrived very quickly but have only been using for a few days so can&#x27;t really comment on effectiveness, but have used Olay products in the past and have always been very happy.</li>
            <li>Time will tell if its fades a dark spot (OK an old age spot) on my cheek.</li>
            <li>I live in Australia on the beach</li>
            <li>and wow the difference.</li>
            <li>So far I have not seen a difference.  </li>
            <li>Olay regenerist luminous is completely working for me  </li>
            <li>Let me just start by saying I&#x27;m a guy with horribly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel sooo smooth and firm.  </li>
            <li>(Originally rated this product 4 stars, but just removed one because the EXCESSIVE SCENT in the product is getting to me.</li>
            <li>Will continue to use until it&#x27;s gone, only because it does make my face feel soft.  </li>
            <li>a little irritant for the first time use</li>
            <li>This product really works to reduce, very gradually, dark spots due to aging.</li>
            <li>I have been using for 3 weeks on some large sun marks that I have used other whitening products on for 2 years and this is making a big difference.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> So far so good.  I don&#x27;t know yet if it helps making dark spots brighter.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I combine it with my vitamin c and wow the difference.</li>
            <li> a little irritant for the first time use</li>
            <li> Only been using for a few days, but makes my feel wonderful!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting for 2 weeks now haven&#x27;t seen any changes with the light spots I have on my face, will keep using it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to give this a three.  Started using on April 2nd.  So far I have not seen a difference.  Will continue to use until it&#x27;s gone, only because it does make my face feel soft.  But so did my last &amp;#34;so-called&amp;#34; miracle cream.</li>
            <li> This product is very much like the original Olay White Radiance from Asia. I saw results within a week. Brighter and even skin tone. I love the way it smells. This stuff works.</li>
            <li> Best whitening product I have tried. I have been using for 3 weeks on some large sun marks that I have used other whitening products on for 2 years and this is making a big difference. The marks are smaller and starting to fade. I live in Australia on the beach and I have just turned 60. I have some problem melatonin skin marks, some on my face and this is helping better than many other products I have tried. I use everyday as a spot treatment as per recommended on the bottle. Trying to order again.</li>
            <li> I have been using it religiously every am and every pm and my dark spots have become lighter. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care for the feel, seems to drag across your face.  We will see if it makes me more luminous as time goes by.  Time will tell if its fades a dark spot (OK an old age spot) on my cheek.</li>
            <li> It dont take not tone out off my face</li>
            <li> Used it for 8 weeks- saw no difference.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This is Olay what more can I say. Item arrived very quickly but have only been using for a few days so can&#x27;t really comment on effectiveness, but have used Olay products in the past and have always been very happy. My only problem; as soon as I ordered this product for $21.99 another seller on this same site offered this product for less this $12.00</li>
            <li> Received on time, product works well</li>
            <li> My face had grown splotchy, not only from age and sun, but also as a result of extensive reconstructive surgery as a result of skin cancer. I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a difference, as have people who haven&#x27;t seen me in a while.</li>
            <li> Olay regenerist luminous is completely working for me  I luv this product</li>
            <li> I think their was a little improve after a month, but one great improvement that I could se.\e.</li>
            <li> Let me just start by saying I&#x27;m a guy with horribly sensitive skin. Nothing has really helped much in healing my skin. This instantly smoothed my skin and helped heal marks let behind from acne including scabs. Now I&#x27;ve only been using this a week, but I&#x27;m still impressed. I recommend giving a shot.</li>
            <li> This product really works to reduce, very gradually, dark spots due to aging.</li>
            <li> Has a strong perfume smell.  No results as far as lightening my dark spot.</li>
            <li> From the first week I started using this product i could see a difference. My face was brighter and has a magnificent glow. Been getting compliments daily as to how different my face looks. It is fading the spots in my face.As for those who says they aren&#x27;t seeing any fading of spots, it is NOT a bleaching cream. I am about to start my second bottle and would recommend it to everyone. The only other product I am using it with is the Luminous Brightening cream cleanser.</li>
            <li> I really like this light serem.  A little goes a long way.  It makes my skin feel sooo smooth and firm.  I add moisturizer on top, then spray my face with mineral water if I&#x27;m going bare faced that day.  If I wear make up, I spray last, but it all starts with beautiful skin, I.e., serem.  I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a great product of Olay&#x27;s - works as well as more expensive serums and does not cause any breakouts.</li>
