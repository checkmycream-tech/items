            <li>Does a good job of trimming around the tree and over the boulders..</li>
            <li>He was very pleased.</li>
            <li>mini version comes with all of the clip lengths and is much more space-savvy, allowing for us both to be happy travelers.</li>
            <li>Paired with my Apple rechargeable AA batteries, this has been an incredibly travel-friendly addition to my ruck - light, effective, efficient.</li>

            <li>love these things  i can cut my dads hair who is wheel chair bound anytime anywhere  </li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>but I love this one.</li>
            <li>for another $10 you can get a MUCH better quality trimmer.</li>
            <li>I have had it for more than a year</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s battery operated its suprisingly strong and for traveling this one is the top choice.</li>
            <li>Great for trimming sensitive areas!</li>
            <li>, you need powerful battery (the kind of rechargeables), ideal for camping or several days trekking.</li>
            <li>in addition, strong vibration during working.</li>
            <li>The product works fine, but if you are looking for a rechargeable battery this one isn&#x27;t it.  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful little clipper.  </li>
            <li>it works and is cheap</li>
            <li>Of course don&#x27;t open up a barber shop with these, but there great for trimming and touch-ups</li>
            <li>I guess it was too cheap.</li>
            <li>Amazon did great in getting me this item the next day.</li>
            <li>works good so far.</li>
            <li>Now I am stuck with it  because I was able it use it right away.</li>
            <li>I bought these clippers originally just for body trimming, but after seeing how well they worked I used them to cut my head hair too.</li>
            <li>I use it for trimming the bottom of haircuts and the neck to clean up after a haircut.  </li>
            <li>Liked the fact that it was lighter than his old one.</li>
            <li>This was a problem when traveling because he insisted on lugging around the full sized version with all its clips, which often took the place of my pillow in the carry-on:(&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It can cut hair as good as the larger plug in models.  </li>
            <li>Price was more then reasonable.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe that it is full of hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is just the ticket for quick touch ups</li>
            <li>Came quickly and does the job</li>
            <li>This trimmer was exactly what we were looking for!</li>
            <li>It arrived exactly as stated!</li>
            <li>Seems very cheap, loud.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, I was able to personally buzz my 3 inches of hair without any problem.</li>
            <li>It cuts OK however other whal products better performance.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast got it in 2 days!</li>
            <li>It just the right size.</li>
            <li>lol Save yourself time and hassle and get yourself a slightly more expensive model.</li>
            <li>but we often abandon them for the bigger more powerful clippers.  </li>
            <li>Stopped working exactly after the return time frame had expired.</li>
            <li>I bought one from Rite Aid over 10 years ago and it seems much more solid and reliable than this one.</li>
            <li>Mine works well but not always powers on in the first attemp, I have to keep moving the switch until it starts.</li>
            <li>it works on batteries what makes it pretty portable.</li>
            <li>It was a waste of money for me, thought Wahl was a good brand, either its not</li>
            <li>small (really) but very handy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using trimmers for the past 20 years and never realy loved any of the cordless units I\\&quot;ve owned</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t consistently remember to clean my facial hair trimmer, so</li>
            <li>(Yes, had I read the fine print, I would have known this but for TWENTY-TWO DOLLARS, you would kind of expect a RECHARGEABLE, model, especially considering that there are numerous rechargeable trimmers starting at around fifteen dollars.)</li>
            <li>It performs well and is very reliable.</li>
            <li>is very well described and the product meets customer specifications no complaints.</li>
            <li>For the price I bought it for, I really don&#x27;t mind doing that.</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>I wanted it for triming the sides of my haircuts and its works very well for this.</li>
            <li>I do wish it did not have so much plastic in it, but for the price I paid I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice little ten dollar trimmer.</li>
            <li>Multiple uses will require you to clean out the clipper for hair.</li>
            <li>This was cheap enough that I won&#x27;t worry when I have to throw it away to get a new one.  </li>
            <li>Good for a fast neck trim but not strong enough to cut hair with ..</li>
            <li>They are a little loud but effective with the required AA battery.</li>
            <li>Less gimmick more power.</li>
            <li>WAHL makes some great products, but unfortunately, this bargain basement model just isn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
            <li>everything works normally and has passed the tests of continuous use</li>
            <li>Good but not great.</li>
            <li>I was only looking for a device that I could easily trim my facial hair and not have to worry about losing a charger.  </li>
            <li>and its is very loud.</li>
            <li>Still going strong; the micro bottle of oil will last that long.</li>
            <li>On the second, it hiccuped and after changing the battery, then back to the original it ran.  </li>
            <li>Not worth the money, cheap plastic all the way around, should have returned it</li>
            <li>I tried going near my dog with it and he practically shuttered with fear!</li>
            <li>Glad we picked this one AND only uses 1 battery compared to the other one I had.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of weak.</li>
            <li>A complete piece of junk.</li>
            <li>I will NOT trust Amazon.com again as far as reasonableness of price is concerned.</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as other Wahl cordless trimmers I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>After turning the razor on, I was a little concerned that this would be true.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts a long time and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>When it does run, it doesnâ€™t run fast enough to actually cut the hair.</li>
            <li>Uses battery power very fast and gets clogged and slows down working, even stops working from getting hair in blades.</li>
            <li>So loud that the client in the next spa room stopped his massage.</li>
            <li>Ok; but not a great clipper.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately we have used older models from Wahl that have worked great for exactly what we needed but these seem weak and much less powerful than other similar models.  </li>
            <li>it consumes a lot of electricity, the battery is always low in it.&lt;br /&gt;it is never sharp enough, and always get stucked by hair.</li>
            <li>It comes with different size guards to adjust the hair length and keep you from pinching loose skin in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>anyone spend a little more money and get something else with your hard earned money.</li>

            <li> This product is flimsy, loud and vibrates so much that my hand got annoyed with me.</li>
            <li> Have been travelling non-stop for the last two years, living out of a single backpack.  </li>
            <li> They are better than the larger models - quieter, less scary for the patients, and they do not have to be plugged in which</li>
            <li> Came with a dead battery in it, and then when I replaced it with a new one it died and in less than 10 uses of just general beard/side burns trimming.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted for minor hair trimming!</li>
            <li> DOES NOT LIVE UP TO EXPECTATIONS .</li>
            <li> I read a few reviews saying that the motor was not strong enough to cut through thick hair and the battery would die quickly.</li>
            <li> On the third attempt, it completely failed, apparently with an internal open circuit.  </li>
            <li> I would save my money and spend the little extra bucks to get the rechargable one.</li>
            <li> Not much here.</li>
            <li> Pity that I paid Amazon.com almost TWENTY-TWO DOLLARS for it.</li>
            <li> Work as expected.  </li>
            <li> as battery quickly dies, cutting efficiency is out the window.</li>
            <li> I used it for a year and a half.</li>
            <li> It has a very hard time going through my tiny Yorkie&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s from china as usual.</li>
            <li> the cordless trimmer is small and lightweight.  </li>
            <li> I should explain that the reason I purchased these was for work - I am a veterinarian and we use these to shake small patches of hair but they never work on thick hair coats.  </li>
            <li> I bought another for stepdad, who&#x27;s had 2 strokes, overweight and not coordinating well lately.  </li>
            <li> battery life sucks.</li>
            <li> My husband cuts his hair at least once a week.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing waste of money.</li>
            <li> Lousy.</li>
            <li> I have a terrible time keeping it running, I changed out the battery a few times thinking that would helpâ€¦ didnâ€™t.</li>
            <li> This died after just a couple of uses, very disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the product info enough and didn&#x27;t realize that this wasn&#x27;t a rechargeable clipper.  The product works fine, but if you are looking for a rechargeable battery this one isn&#x27;t it.  I would save my money and spend the little extra bucks to get the rechargable one.</li>

After turning the razor on, I was a little concerned that this would be true. Fortunately, I was able to personally buzz my 3 inches of hair without any problem. It worked pretty slick especially since I am used to using a corded razor.</li>
            <li> Came with a dead battery in it, and then when I replaced it with a new one it died and in less than 10 uses of just general beard/side burns trimming.</li>
            <li> Even for a mini clipper it&#x27;s kind of weak. It has a very hard time going through my tiny Yorkie&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> It worked great on the first go around.  On the second, it hiccuped and after changing the battery, then back to the original it ran.  On the third attempt, it completely failed, apparently with an internal open circuit.  I returned it and will replace it with another choice.</li>
            <li> The clippers broke after the second use. Very disappointing waste of money.</li>
            <li> Ok; but not a great clipper.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as other Wahl cordless trimmers I&#x27;ve used but these still get the job done.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for myself.  I am a licensed cosmetologist and recommend wahl.  I needed something reliable and that&#x27;s wahl.  I bought another for stepdad, who&#x27;s had 2 strokes, overweight and not coordinating well lately.  This helps him manuever overhead without cord hanging in his face and does the job splendidly.  He was very pleased.</li>
            <li> very easy to use.  not quite. have to tolerate noise. in addition, strong vibration during working. cant feel my arm if continually use more than 10 mins</li>
            <li> Not much here. But for the money, it works. I&#x27;ll upgrade tho. Way too many&lt;br /&gt;Doodads! Less gimmick more power.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful little clipper.  I use it for trimming the bottom of haircuts and the neck to clean up after a haircut.  The battery lasts a long time and it works very well.  Good buy for the money.</li>
            <li> Stopped working exactly after the return time frame had expired. ðŸ˜¡</li>
            <li> Seems very cheap, loud.  Have to replace batteries often.  Would not recommend this product.  I bought one from Rite Aid over 10 years ago and it seems much more solid and reliable than this one.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to help with child haircut.  Product worked for 2 haircuts, then a week later for a touch up, would&#x27;t work--changed batter, still doesn&#x27;t work.  Not impressed--waste of money</li>
            <li> it works and is cheap, what more could you ask for? Of course don&#x27;t open up a barber shop with these, but there great for trimming and touch-ups (which is what they are designed to do)</li>
            <li> So loud that the client in the next spa room stopped his massage. Uses battery power very fast and gets clogged and slows down working, even stops working from getting hair in blades. never had this issue in 15 years using trimmers in a salon.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a gift for my father as we all cut each others hair and needed a smaller clipper for closer areas. It performs well and is very reliable.</li>
            <li> is very well described and the product meets customer specifications no complaints. everything works normally and has passed the tests of continuous use</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut as good as I thought</li>
            <li> I just used this touch up trimmer  and its is very loud. Now I am stuck with it  because I was able it use it right away.</li>
            <li> This trimmer was exactly what we were looking for! Cordless and has a nice amount of power to trim hair. It arrived exactly as stated!</li>
            <li> Cheap product, excellent for beard use (not for the head), you need powerful battery (the kind of rechargeables), ideal for camping or several days trekking. I used it for a year and a half. Mine works well but not always powers on in the first attemp, I have to keep moving the switch until it starts. Very happy with it anyway.</li>
            <li> love these things  i can cut my dads hair who is wheel chair bound anytime anywhere  dont have to worry about cords.</li>
            <li> WE USED IT ALL THE TIME</li>
            <li> It says WHAL trimmer and I thought its made in the USA, but it wasn&#x27;t. it&#x27;s from china as usual.</li>
            <li> A complete piece of junk. Used three times, for about 3-4 minutes each time, and it stopped working.</li>
            <li> small (really) but very handy. it works on batteries what makes it pretty portable. blades and covers are of good quality.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice little ten dollar trimmer. Pity that I paid Amazon.com almost TWENTY-TWO DOLLARS for it. Yes, it IS CORDLESS...it requires a \\&quot;AA\\&quot; battery! (Yes, had I read the fine print, I would have known this but for TWENTY-TWO DOLLARS, you would kind of expect a RECHARGEABLE, model, especially considering that there are numerous rechargeable trimmers starting at around fifteen dollars.) CAVEAT EMPTOR! I will NOT trust Amazon.com again as far as reasonableness of price is concerned.</li>
            <li> This died after just a couple of uses, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this.  Took a locally purchased white-with-blue-grip version overseas four years ago.  Have been travelling non-stop for the last two years, living out of a single backpack.  This guy has travelled around the world with me as my weekly / bi-weekly hair trimmers.  Still going strong; the micro bottle of oil will last that long. Paired with my Apple rechargeable AA batteries, this has been an incredibly travel-friendly addition to my ruck - light, effective, efficient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using trimmers for the past 20 years and never realy loved any of the cordless units I\\&quot;ve owned but I love this one. Even though it&#x27;s battery operated its suprisingly strong and for traveling this one is the top choice. I would give it 5 stars but I need to play with the batteries to get it to work sometimes.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money, cheap plastic all the way around, should have returned it but it was easier just to buy something else.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this Trimmer to anyone spend a little more money and get something else with your hard earned money.</li>
            <li> Great and Easy to use when grooming my dogs.</li>
            <li> Great for trimming sensitive areas!</li>
            <li> This battery powered trimmer met my expectations.  I was only looking for a device that I could easily trim my facial hair and not have to worry about losing a charger.  It trims my beard well and has not yet begun to pull the hairs (instead of trim).  I can&#x27;t consistently remember to clean my facial hair trimmer, so I can&#x27;t justify spending a lot on a trimmer.  This was cheap enough that I won&#x27;t worry when I have to throw it away to get a new one.  At the moment I would consider getting the same trimmer again when this one has officially died.</li>
            <li> This is an inexpensive way to groom yourself. I use it on by sideburns, nose and ears. It does the job.</li>
            <li> bought this to keep my neck, beard, and sideburns trimmed. It runs on a AA battery and I thought it would be great to keep in the medicine cabinet. I have a terrible time keeping it running, I changed out the battery a few times thinking that would helpâ€¦ didnâ€™t. When it does run, it doesnâ€™t run fast enough to actually cut the hair. It was a waste of money for me, thought Wahl was a good brand, either its not or I got a dud.</li>
            <li> This is just the ticket for quick touch ups</li>
            <li> battery life sucks. seems to be about one or two uses before battery starts dying. as battery quickly dies, cutting efficiency is out the window. should have plug in option, to use with or w/out battery power</li>
            <li> Got for my father to replace his rechargeable that died.  Wanted it to use between trips to get a haircut to trim up side burns and neck.  Liked the fact that it was lighter than his old one.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT LIVE UP TO EXPECTATIONS . It cuts OK however other whal products better performance. Good but not great.</li>
            <li> the cordless trimmer is small and lightweight.  It trims close when needed and very easy to use, store, travel with.</li>
            <li> The clippers work great for trims and touchups. Multiple uses will require you to clean out the clipper for hair. The only downside is that it can eat up battery life. In order to avoid wasting my batteries, I just take the battery out every time I use it. The battery doesn&#x27;t last if you leave it in. For the price I bought it for, I really don&#x27;t mind doing that.</li>
            <li> Good for a fast neck trim but not strong enough to cut hair with .. I do like the battery powered though</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers originally just for body trimming, but after seeing how well they worked I used them to cut my head hair too. They worked great for it as well.</li>
            <li> My husband cuts his hair at least once a week. This was a problem when traveling because he insisted on lugging around the full sized version with all its clips, which often took the place of my pillow in the carry-on:(&lt;br /&gt;This mini version comes with all of the clip lengths and is much more space-savvy, allowing for us both to be happy travelers.</li>
            <li> This product is flimsy, loud and vibrates so much that my hand got annoyed with me. I tried going near my dog with it and he practically shuttered with fear! lol Save yourself time and hassle and get yourself a slightly more expensive model. for another $10 you can get a MUCH better quality trimmer. WAHL makes some great products, but unfortunately, this bargain basement model just isn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
            <li> I should explain that the reason I purchased these was for work - I am a veterinarian and we use these to shake small patches of hair but they never work on thick hair coats.  They are better than the larger models - quieter, less scary for the patients, and they do not have to be plugged in which is a big plus but we often abandon them for the bigger more powerful clippers.  Unfortunately we have used older models from Wahl that have worked great for exactly what we needed but these seem weak and much less powerful than other similar models.  I will probably purchase something different in the future.</li>
            <li> I have had it for more than a year and i dont think I will complain any time soon. Good job.</li>
            <li> Does a good job of trimming around the tree and over the boulders.. We all know what you&#x27;re going to use it for. It comes with different size guards to adjust the hair length and keep you from pinching loose skin in sensitive areas. Like where you are going to be trimming.</li>
            <li> Lousy. It quit soon after I got it. I guess it was too cheap.</li>
            <li> Work as expected.  It can cut hair as good as the larger plug in models.  Amazon did great in getting me this item the next day.</li>
            <li> Ordered them and with in a month the batteries died</li>
            <li> Very well made. Came quickly and does the job well. I wanted it for triming the sides of my haircuts and its works very well for this. It just the right size. Price was more then reasonable.</li>
            <li> excellent, i like it!!</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast got it in 2 days! Wasn&#x27;t expecting that and the clippers are great works wonderfully would recommend to everyone!!</li>
            <li> Really handy for cleaning up around below beards.  Also the nape of the neck between haircuts.</li>
            <li> works good so far. I do wish it did not have so much plastic in it, but for the price I paid I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted for minor hair trimming!</li>
            <li> it consumes a lot of electricity, the battery is always low in it.&lt;br /&gt;it is never sharp enough, and always get stucked by hair. I can&#x27;t believe that it is full of hair!&lt;br /&gt;if you have access to wall plug-in, never buy one powered by batteries.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do well with longer hair on my Goldendoodle. I use it for the private areas of the dogs and cats.</li>
            <li> The clippers work as well you could expect for the price. They are a little loud but effective with the required AA battery. I like that the clippers include a variety of spacers, that match their larger clippers, to cut hair a specified length.</li>
            <li> Does what it should!  Glad we picked this one AND only uses 1 battery compared to the other one I had.</li>
