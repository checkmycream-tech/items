            <li> Happy to have found it. I hear it was a discontinued color. It is  a favorite.</li>
            <li> I used to love this color and the other Blushing Berry color.. They suited my skin tone perfectly and looked natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I noticed two side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I apply this color over my base lip moisturizer or coconut oil on my lips.. Even then, it dries and chaps my lips sooo badly..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I was using these for over a year, then recently realized that whenever i apply them, i get a nausea feeling, drowsy.. Some times even head ache if the day is hot enough.. It&#x27;s the chemicals in it.. I wont be using this lipstick again...</li>
            <li> This is my staple lipstick for when I do not wear eye make up.  It is not too pink and not reddish, just perfect, and really stays.</li>
            <li> This is my aunt&#x27;s favorite color and she could not find it locally.  So I ordered a few from Amazon and surprised her.  This is the original product and arrived in record time.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Exactly want I wanted, was thrilled to find it, my favorite lipstick. That&#x27;s why I ordered 5 from different sellers. the last seller even included a very nice hand written note. Also the price was perfect.</li>
            <li> Thank you so very much ~ I&#x27;ve been looking for this lipstick and only found it here.&lt;br /&gt;I was so happy to open it up when it came in the mail so quickly&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Again!&lt;br /&gt;April</li>
            <li> The product was a discontinued color, just what I wanted and very inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;but price was bumped up as I ended up paying individually for each lipstick to be shipped&lt;br /&gt;when I bought a bulk amount.  However, I was happy to find it and still cheaper than if I had to have&lt;br /&gt;paid full price for the lipstick in a store.</li>
            <li> I could not find this lipscolour anywhere and I have been searching for over a year.  Thanks for making the search finally end in a very competent and pleasing manner.</li>
            <li> I love the color and consistency of the lipstick.</li>
            <li> Product arrived before we realized it was due.  QUICK.  My wife said that her worry was that buying lipstick on line that it may have dried.  However, when she checked it, she threw out her existing tubes saying this was much fresher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for keeping my wife happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bill</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t fine anywhere,Glad you had this.</li>
            <li> I love the color, feel and smell of this lipstick.  I wish it was available in&lt;br /&gt;stores and am glad I could order it economically online.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;oreal lipstick is perfect--great colors!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice color and stays on for a long time.  A good moisturizer for my dry lips living in the high desert of Northern Nevada.</li>
            <li> Hard to find. Happy day!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find this color anywhere.  It is exactly as it was promised.  No problems at all.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I wanted and in a very timely manner.  I am very satisfied with my order from Amazon.  Thank you, I will certainly come again.</li>

            <li> Great (discontinued) product.  Color is true.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick.  I had been buying it at CVS, but they stopped carrying it and I was bummed!  Thanks Amazon - you have everything!  The lipstick color is a lovely shade of pink - not too light, not too dark.  One of the best things about it is that it lasts for hours.  I apply it in the morning and after lunch. It&#x27;s moist and light and feels good on the lips. I love it - been using it for years!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the color and the lipstick but wonder why it does not display the L&#x27;Oreal label anywhere on it.  I was surprised at how inexpensive it was.  Is it really L&#x27;Oreal?</li>
