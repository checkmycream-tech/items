            <li> THANK YOU FOR THE FAST DELIVERY!  I LOVE THE SMELL OF THIS LOTION AND PERFUME!  THANK YOU FOR THE DISCOUNT COUPON! WILL ORDER AGAIN!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom for her birthday.  It was just what she wanted and she was pleased.  She gets lots of compliments whenever she wears this fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is a gift for someone and I didn&#x27;t want to go to the mall, so thank you for your prompt, FAST delivery.  It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The product was just as it was advertised on line and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and how it mixes with my body chemistry!  I wear it all the time, like everyday!  Oh I will order more...</li>
            <li> Thanks for the good deal. This is one of my favorite scents because it is light, sweet and longer lasting!</li>
            <li> My sister loves this perfume and has a difficult time finding it where she lives. So, this gift set was perfect for her.  It did arrive with the box a bit dented and everything else in the shipping container with it smelled like perfume for a bit.  It was a great gift and my sister loved it, so that is all that really matters.</li>
            <li> Long lasting. A little goes a long way.  Expect plenty of compliments when wearing this fragrance. The body cream is just as divine..</li>
            <li> was more expensive this time</li>
            <li> This Wing&#x27;s set was an especially good value.  It also happens to be my wife&#x27;s favorite which made it all that more attractive a buy.  The product was delivered quickly and was well packaged.</li>
            <li> The Wings in the Box is for my lady that has Wings, My Angel. When she puts this one she brings out the devil in me. I guess she gives me my Wings, but mine just happen to be accompanied by a set of horns as well. Go Figure!</li>
            <li> My wife has always loved wings by Giorgio nd recently it has been hard to find until I googled it and found it on amazon.com.  The deal was even better than she expected and the price was great.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is incredible. The compliments are endless. Everyone loves my wifes cologne. She is always saying how a young woman asks about it.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and the lotion was a plus. Awesome deal and fast delivery! That&#x27;s the way, uh uh, I like it uh uh!</li>
            <li> I have worn this off and on over the years and this was a great deal.  I was happy to see it on Amazon.  I will definitely buy again.  Wish I understood how to describe a fragrance.  So suffice it to say, I like Wings a tad better than Beautiful which is about the best way I can describe it. :-) The lotion is non greasy.  Very nice.</li>
            <li> I tried this perfume for the first time and it is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I like to try new fragrances ever so often. I prefer when the fragrance is light and does not interfer with my sinus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great fragrance, try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andrea&lt;br /&gt;Jamaica</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this same fragrance for years....and I will continue to do so because it is perfect for me: not heavy, light enough not to be offensive, yet w/a lovely fragrance that I like and my husband loves:)  The two (perfume and lotion) go together like bread and butter....can&#x27;t have one without the other.  Lotion on first, then spray....what a wonderful combination that floats along with you as you go.  You will be amazed at the compliments you&#x27;ll receive---&amp;#34;what is that you are wearing?....it is beautiful!!!&amp;#34;  Then they want to know where I purchased &amp;#34;Wings&amp;#34;....of course---AMAZON!!!  Enjoy!!!</li>
            <li> Wish lotion was sold separately. Otherwise product is great.</li>
