            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen it on her yet, but I&#x27;m sure it will be beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li>is pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Wish I could tell you more.</li>
            <li>It was a lovely day and she was beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It also looks better with a fuller thicker head of hair.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure someone else would adore it for their wedding dress - a reasonably priced good quality item.</li>
            <li>and we could not bend to fit better.</li>
            <li>I bought this tiara because I loved the simple style, liked the reviews and wanted to wear it in my wedding.</li>
            <li>The reason why I didn&#x27;t rate it a 5 stars is because it didn&#x27;t fit correctly on my wife&#x27;s head.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a headband or tiara to match my wedding veil that had pearl accents, an absolute beautiful piece that throws in just enough sparkle without overdoing it which is kinda perfect since I&#x27;m going with simple but beautiful, recomend for the bride that wants the glam on a tight budget.</li>
            <li>is someting special for a weeding girl.</li>
            <li>This creates a very noticeable gap between the beads and the top wire.</li>
            <li>It is very pretty to wear for any women or girl to wear for a special occasion,</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s still very pretty</li>
            <li>It is very pretty.</li>
            <li>great for a little girl or a bride thats not to fancy.</li>
            <li>It comes in a beautiful round box!</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a nice product.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Made kind of big</li>
            <li>It has just the right amount of sparkle and elegance that I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Such a much, much better deal than what I saw in bridal stores.  </li>
            <li>The tiara is comfortable to be worn for 3 to 5 hours but later on it can be a pain.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well made.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much</li>
            <li>it was comfortable enough to wear all day.</li>
            <li>but I worry if I bend it too much it may break on me.</li>
            <li>The quality of the bead/pearl embellishments are not as high as appears in the picture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty but quite simple</li>
            <li>Arrived on time, was a little odd shaped but easy to bend into the right shape for your head.</li>
            <li>You need to have a big round head for this to fit.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for and it&#x27;s extremely durable.</li>
            <li>Just enough sparkle and class to complete your look.</li>
            <li>So to wrap up; I would use this tiara for a fun night out, Halloween costume, any event in which quality is not important.</li>
            <li>Very sparkly, not very comfortable.</li>

            <li> love the sparkle, nice really nice --- I know it says Wedding Tiara, but I love just wearing it every day... I love the sparkle in my hair...</li>
            <li> I bought this tiara to wear with my wedding veil but decided to style my hair differently so I did not use it.  It is very pretty to wear for any women or girl to wear for a special occasion,</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, was a little odd shaped but easy to bend into the right shape for your head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty but quite simple and it&#x27;s my mistake that I didn&#x27;t fully read the detail information. But it serves the purpose for which it was intendended. thank you.</li>
            <li> The bridal tiara headband was beautiful.  The reason why I didn&#x27;t rate it a 5 stars is because it didn&#x27;t fit correctly on my wife&#x27;s head.  It was to big and we could not bend to fit better.</li>
            <li> Perfect bling for my second wedding!!!!</li>
            <li> Very pretty, sturdy and great for the price.  Sparkles nicely and seems to be well made.  It was delivered in a timely manner and was nicely packaged.  I will be wearing this with my wedding dress.  I got a second one as a back up just in case this one didn&#x27;t last all day (I feared it may be cheaply made), but when it arrived it was very, very nice and I won&#x27;t need a second &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34; tiara.</li>
            <li> I bought this tiara because I loved the simple style, liked the reviews and wanted to wear it in my wedding. After receiving it I was very disappointed. If you look at the picture you will notice pieces of wire going diagonal in the center. On these pieces of wire there are beads. It looks very nice in the picture. The picture has 3 beads on each diagonal but the tiara only had 2! This creates a very noticeable gap between the beads and the top wire. So to wrap up; I would use this tiara for a fun night out, Halloween costume, any event in which quality is not important. You get what you pay for. However, for my wedding I want a tiara doesn&#x27;t look like a Halloween costume piece.</li>
            <li> Beautiful headband for a wedding or prom.  Just enough sparkle and class to complete your look.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this for my sister and she was very impressed and happy with it. This wedding tiara can be used at a wedding or it can be used to just have a pretend wedding play. My sister has performed tons of plays with this tiara and it still looks in great shape. The tiara is comfortable to be worn for 3 to 5 hours but later on it can be a pain.</li>
            <li> Its beautiful, just like the picture... I recommend this product to everyone! It comes in a beautiful round box! Im very happy with my tiara.</li>
            <li> The beads move up and down on the criss-cross wire weaving through the two headband frames (not fixed in place) which I personally don&#x27;t like. The quality of the bead/pearl embellishments are not as high as appears in the picture. However, it&#x27;s still very pretty and I&#x27;m sure someone else would adore it for their wedding dress - a reasonably priced good quality item.</li>
            <li> It has just the right amount of sparkle and elegance that I was looking for. I didn&#x27;t want anything over the top fancy. It&#x27;s very well made. I&#x27;m using this for my beach wedding and it&#x27;s perfect. :)</li>
            <li> This is perfect!  Such a much, much better deal than what I saw in bridal stores.  It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for and it&#x27;s extremely durable.</li>
            <li> Seemed cheap in package but looked great on bride!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a headband or tiara to match my wedding veil that had pearl accents, an absolute beautiful piece that throws in just enough sparkle without overdoing it which is kinda perfect since I&#x27;m going with simple but beautiful, recomend for the bride that wants the glam on a tight budget.</li>
            <li> Lovely- perfect for the price</li>
            <li> I will be wearing this headband for my wedding up do in my hair. It will work perfectly!!! Thanks so much</li>
            <li> It is very pretty. it was comfortable enough to wear all day.I got lots of compliments. great for a little girl or a bride thats not to fancy.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my daughters wedding and it will go well with her dress. I haven&#x27;t seen it on her yet, but I&#x27;m sure it will be beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;She is pleased with it. Wish I could tell you more. Good price for this item. Check the ones at the Bridal stores! Outrageous</li>
            <li> You need to have a big round head for this to fit.  It won&#x27;t bend to mold to a smaller oblong head.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for our 20th anniversary along with several other items I could dress my Queen up with. It was a lovely day and she was beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;This tiara completed the ensemble perfectly.</li>
            <li> When I opened this up, I was a bit disappointed. The pearls are a bit tiny and not so noticeable as I had hoped. The headband as other reviewers mentioned is flexible but I worry if I bend it too much it may break on me. It also looks better with a fuller thicker head of hair. I&#x27;m planning on curling my hair for my wedding and wearing this. Hopefully it will still work.</li>
            <li> is good for my sister. this item is nice, and recomend buy them. is someting special for a weeding girl.</li>
            <li> My daughter was absolutely beautiful wearing this at her wedding.  Thank you for such a nice product. Very pleased consumer :)</li>
            <li> Very sparkly, not very comfortable. Worth the price. Made kind of big it seems.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed. The picture in ad is deceiving pearls and crystals are very very tiny. It does not look good.</li>
