            <li>I tried covering up the smell with the original Versace and even that didn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li>This has been my preferred cologne for a few years and finding a bottle that I don&#x27;t have to be nervous about getting taken away by TSA is great.</li>
            <li>and i thought wow this must be too strong</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>- Thanks!</li>
            <li>My first bottle smelled and looked exactly like the ones I saw at the store.  </li>
            <li>Comparing this bottle to the original Versace, the liquid was a lighter blue hue compared to the original Versace.</li>
            <li>and I have been waiting to buy that for somebody and finally did:)</li>
            <li>it is one of my favorite colognes and i used daily</li>

            <li>The fragrance was far from fragrant, rather it was pretty rancid.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not hard to miss.  </li>
            <li>I first smelled it several years ago on a guy at work</li>
            <li>I got this one for travel and is basically the same smell and strength as my large bottle, not diluted or anything</li>
            <li>This smells just like the Versace cologne from a department store because it&#x27;s the same and as well it&#x27;s real Versace cologne.</li>
            <li>The original Versace is on the left, and the bootleg is on the right.  </li>
            <li>This suspected refilled bottle does not last anywhere near as long as the same item from a department store.</li>

            <li> I guess it&#x27;s a hit or miss when ordering these bottles, but based on reviews, looks like its close to a 10% chance of getting the bootleg version.</li>
            <li> I have the largest bottle at home and hate taking it with me when I travel.  </li>

            <li> Subtle scent that last all day.  Christmas gift to husband ... He really liked and he is really picky.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this product.</li>
            <li> - A as presented,&lt;br /&gt;  - Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have the largest bottle at home and hate taking it with me when I travel.  Too big and too heavy.  I got this one for travel and is basically the same smell and strength as my large bottle, not diluted or anything, it&#x27;s legit.  I will def buy again once it runs out.   *********Update  9/20/16 *********       I ordered this bottle again and it came from another seller.  This second bottle was a 100% bootlegged version.  My first bottle smelled and looked exactly like the ones I saw at the store.  This bottle however is just a straight up joke, and vendor should be held accountable for selling illegal products.  Comparing this bottle to the original Versace, the liquid was a lighter blue hue compared to the original Versace. The fragrance was far from fragrant, rather it was pretty rancid.  I tried covering up the smell with the original Versace and even that didn&#x27;t help.  If that doesn&#x27;t convince you, just go ahead and look at the Medusa logo.  The original Versace is on the left, and the bootleg is on the right.  Just take a look at the detail comparison- it&#x27;s not hard to miss.  I guess it&#x27;s a hit or miss when ordering these bottles, but based on reviews, looks like its close to a 10% chance of getting the bootleg version.</li>
            <li> I am a lesbain and I bought this just last week for my GF. I first smelled it several years ago on a guy at work and I commented to him about it and asked what it was and I have been waiting to buy that for somebody and finally did:)) Smells amazing on both men and women.</li>
            <li> This has been my preferred cologne for a few years and finding a bottle that I don&#x27;t have to be nervous about getting taken away by TSA is great. Perfect travel size.</li>

            <li> it is one of my favorite colognes and i used daily and i get a lot of compliments when i wear</li>
            <li> I have the Versace Man Eau Fraiche and this has a nice scent too.</li>
            <li> This smells just like the Versace cologne from a department store because it&#x27;s the same and as well it&#x27;s real Versace cologne. My girlfriend can&#x27;t stop complimenting me she loves it and so does my friends and family. Very good product,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  a Satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I got this for Christmas and the first time I wore it out and the first person I saw immediately complimented me on it and she said she smelt it as soon as i walked in and i thought wow this must be too strong and she said it was not overwhelming at all</li>
