            <li>I have curly hair and have tried everything out there, but this has be the best product for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I use it with the fructis curl gel and it works perfect.  </li>
            <li>This is the best product I have ever used for hair.</li>
            <li>Best product for curly hair!!</li>
            <li>It is the best!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for taking the humidity frizz out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>Its the best at curly , fuzzy hair .</li>
            <li>Wonderful product.</li>
            <li>It is just perfect.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li>Great for the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have never found anything that has worked as well at a great price</li>
            <li>Great product for individuals with curly hair.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product if you suffer from the frizzies.  </li>
            <li>Gives it great control and a really nice look.  </li>
            <li>loved the pricing for a 6 pack.</li>
            <li>And when I do wear cologne, I don&#x27;t want my hair fragrance to clash with my nice cologne.</li>
            <li>so I am thrilled to find it here.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found this to be just as good, and often better, for my curly hair.</li>
            <li>Nice product.  </li>
            <li>hope that more people are able to persuade garnier to carry this again!</li>
            <li>Of course, getting good hold with something as light as cream is a bit of an art form, but this is by far the best and easiest</li>
            <li>I like this product because it does not harden, it gives your hair a nice textured, natural look with very good hold.</li>
            <li>I am writing this review because I want the company to know some people love it</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find it at the store anymore, so I was glad to find it here.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find this anymore in stores, but I love it.</li>
            <li>Hope I use all this up .... :)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s mostly women who have used this product.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t imagine why Garnier Fructis would get rid of this product, and I&#x27;m hoping against hope that the outcry from so many satisfied customers might change their mind.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I am able to purchase it through this seller.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love my hair</li>
            <li>and I love Garnier.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my curly hair mostly in place, and subdues any frizzy elements.</li>
            <li>As many others have noted in reviews both on this site and on Garnier Fructis&#x27;s, this product has been discontinued, and that&#x27;s a huge shame.</li>
            <li>If you are into eating organic / healthy, and are interested in sustainability, this is a nice step in the right direction by Garnier.</li>
            <li>Did not sufficiently smooth my curly/wavy/frizzy (3A-3C) hair.  </li>
            <li>Such a great product...  </li>
            <li>whether i have short hair or put my hair in a fohawk, this is my favorite product!!</li>
            <li>I have fine, curly hair…not sure if this is a rare hair type or not, but I just don’t love Garnier Fructis Style Pure Clean Smoothing Cream on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff for a guy with long gray hair.  </li>
            <li>And the price is right!</li>
            <li>This year I also had the opportunity to \\&quot;test\\&quot; the product in the tropics when I traveled to Central America, and it continues to be the best product I have ever used (for this specific purpose, and for my hair type).</li>
            <li>I began using this product when I lived in the Great Lakes region, and then moved back to the Gulf Coast where humidity is high and rainy days have been plentiful.</li>
            <li>But, thanks again, and it came really quick!</li>
            <li>I thought it was worth giving it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;For an inexpensive more natural choice for frizzy hair</li>
            <li>I do love those natural ingredients though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last year and it&#x27;s proved to be great in taming my natural curls, when I&#x27;m leave my hear curly or straighten it.</li>
            <li>Pure Clean Smoothing Cream is a 98% natural leave-in styling cream that promises light weight smoothing, frizz control.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;She says it&#x27;s the BEST product for her hair - natural wave to her hair that can tend to be a tad &amp;#34;wick-wack&amp;#34; and then hard to style.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weight down my hair and it holds pretty good.</li>
            <li>Those who have tried everything out there, and have never come close to this know exactly what I am talking about.</li>
            <li>have to say it does work pretty well at smoothing and calming frizziness.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>Its perfect for my medium-length, thick, wavy, male hair.  </li>
            <li>This product is not heavy and controls her hair for a more natural &amp;#34;fluff &amp; go&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t turn into powdery flakes like most gels and it provides shiny, loose curls, not frizz.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much of a fragrance to it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very lightweight and</li>
            <li>THanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of putting it all through my hair, and it made my roots look very greasy.  </li>
            <li>But this product makes my hair smooth all year long.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I don&#x27;t like my hair smelling like some sweet synthetic fruit, or for the smell of my hair to warn people at work that I am in the vicinity.</li>
            <li>The product does not deserve all the negative reviews - I suppose those people just want a certain kind of look.</li>
            <li>One more thing, I recently got a haircut and my stylist said that there was a lot of build-up on my hair and had to use a clarifying shampoo…since my last hair cut nothing has changed, but the addition of Garnier Fructis&#x27; Smoothing Cream.  </li>
            <li>The icing on the cake is that it&#x27;s a naturally derived product !!</li>
            <li>Better than anything else I tried so of course it&#x27;s not available in stores anymore.</li>
            <li>Got several years worth.</li>
            <li>kind of like a thick conditioner.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m letting my hair grow out this works much better than the stiff hair gel.</li>
            <li>I try to save the heavier waxes and pomades for special occasions since they seem harsher on the hair and are much harder to wash out.</li>
            <li>I purchased it because I normally like Garnier products and with this one being natural and quite inexpensive</li>
            <li>Just a light slightly waxy smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It helps to keep the &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34; down when I put her hair in a ponytail, but doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or look flaky like so many similar products.</li>
            <li>It is mostly natural.</li>
            <li>early 90s hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light product with firm hold.</li>
            <li>(meaning the individual hair strands are very thin/fine, but I have lots of them).</li>
            <li>I like that fact that it is a natural product.  </li>
            <li>product is the only thing that works really well with my hair.</li>
            <li>I am almost 40 years old and have tried nearly every product on the market for frizz and soft control over the past twenty years - including cheap stuff, salon brands, and high-end boutique lines.</li>
            <li>I have smooth ringlet curls all year round!</li>
            <li>I have naturally long wavy hair and this smoothing cream is light and never weighs my hair down.  </li>
            <li>it is that I prefer to wash my hair only every two days since it&#x27;s already pretty dry</li>
            <li>caucasian hair which is fine but thick</li>
            <li>It tames my hair without making it look wet or sticky (you have to figure out just how much to use).</li>
            <li>but that is only natural, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>This product helps my soft curls stay as curls instead of totally firzzing away as the day goes on.  </li>
            <li>I usually jump around because I am not satisfied, but I love this!</li>
            <li>My hair has pretty tight curls and gets frizzy in the summer.  </li>
            <li>My hair is wavy/curly and very thick, although the individual hairs are normal or somewhat fine (not coarse).</li>
            <li>It takes about a quarter sized amount of this white thick cream to smooth my shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair too much, just enough to work for me.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair too much, just enough to work for me.</li>
            <li> I have long curl hair that I let dry naturally.  </li>
            <li> My daughter is not able to find this in the large city she lives in, so tipped me off with her &amp;#34;wish list&amp;#34; for Christmas as to how she now orders it from Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn’t leave my hair feeling too weighed down, but at the same time I don’t really think it’s making a difference one way or the other.  </li>
            <li> In the meantime, I&#x27;ve bought up a few of these 6-packs to try to last me a while until I can find something new.</li>
            <li> The hair hardens and I can either keep it slick and shiny looking or after a few hours run my fingers through my hair to give it more of a natural look with hardly ANY deviation from the form I put it</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I&#x27;m a man with short hair, and for years I&#x27;ve been using various creams to style it.</li>
            <li> It does not leave a residue, as advertised, and it holds all day long and manages frizz.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly on long wavy hair in the Florida humidity.</li>
            <li> not much is needed.</li>
            <li> Before I started getting it from Amazon, I tried a few different products from the store and just cant find anything close to it.</li>
            <li> and this is another one of those one day only products that become stiff and sticky after about 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> Use a little, it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is one of the very few products I actually finished and repurchased.</li>
            <li> for less than $20 makes them less than $3.50 a single tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t put a product like this in my hair, I either look like I have fly-away 70s hippy hair or big late eighties</li>
            <li> It can be reapplied and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not my everyday choice in smoothing products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it to: control frizz, lightly tame body and shape without feeling heavy or like I have sticky products in my hair, and which stands up to humidity and sun.</li>

            <li> I have curly hair and have tried everything out there, but this has be the best product for my hair.  My hair has pretty tight curls and gets frizzy in the summer.  But this product makes my hair smooth all year long.  I use it with the fructis curl gel and it works perfect.  I have smooth ringlet curls all year round!</li>
            <li> Thank you! I thought my hair would have to suffer, but you saved me! I don&#x27;t understand why they stopped making it, everyone I know loves it. But, thanks again, and it came really quick!</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used for hair. I am writing this review because I want the company to know some people love it (so they keep making it), and I want you to buy it (so the company keeps making it). 1. It has no fragrance. Personally, I don&#x27;t like my hair smelling like some sweet synthetic fruit, or for the smell of my hair to warn people at work that I am in the vicinity. And when I do wear cologne, I don&#x27;t want my hair fragrance to clash with my nice cologne. 2. It is mostly natural. If you are into eating organic / healthy, and are interested in sustainability, this is a nice step in the right direction by Garnier. 3. It works. Use a little, it goes a long way. It does not leave a residue, as advertised, and it holds all day long and manages frizz. I like this product because it does not harden, it gives your hair a nice textured, natural look with very good hold. If you like your hair to look and feel like a helmut, or if you are trying to spike your hair, then this product is not for you. The product does not deserve all the negative reviews - I suppose those people just want a certain kind of look.</li>
            <li> Great for the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6 for less than $20 makes them less than $3.50 a single tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in stores you them for over $6 each.</li>
            <li> Best product for curly hair!!</li>
            <li> Those who have tried everything out there, and have never come close to this know exactly what I am talking about. It is the best!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for taking the humidity frizz out of my hair.  It&#x27;s not sold int he stores anymore so I am thrilled to find it here.</li>
            <li> Garnier Syle Pure Clean Smoothing Cream is a 98% natural leave-in styling cream that promises light weight smoothing, frizz control.  I purchased it because I normally like Garnier products and with this one being natural and quite inexpensive I thought it was worth giving it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say it does work pretty well at smoothing and calming frizziness.  It takes about a quarter sized amount of this white thick cream to smooth my shoulder length hair.  It doesn&#x27;t have much of a fragrance to it.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it is that I prefer to wash my hair only every two days since it&#x27;s already pretty dry and this is another one of those one day only products that become stiff and sticky after about 24 hours.  I kept the product and use it when I know I&#x27;ll be washing my hair the following day but it&#x27;s not my everyday choice in smoothing products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For an inexpensive more natural choice for frizzy hair I say go ahead and give it a try.</li>
            <li> I cant believe this product is not in any stores . Its the best at curly , fuzzy hair . I have never found anything that has worked as well at a great price</li>
            <li> My wife introduced me to this. Better than anything else I tried so of course it&#x27;s not available in stores anymore. Got several years worth.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughter&#x27;s hair.  I couldn&#x27;t find it in any of the local stores and couldn&#x27;t do without it.  It helps to keep the &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34; down when I put her hair in a ponytail, but doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or look flaky like so many similar products.</li>
            <li> Did not sufficiently smooth my curly/wavy/frizzy (3A-3C) hair.  I do love those natural ingredients though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought several comparable creams from beauty salons for up to $25 a bottle. I&#x27;ve found this to be just as good, and often better, for my curly hair. If I don&#x27;t put a product like this in my hair, I either look like I have fly-away 70s hippy hair or big late eighties early 90s hair. It tames my hair without making it look wet or sticky (you have to figure out just how much to use). It doesn&#x27;t have a sticky &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; ingredient in it like mousse or gel, it&#x27;s just a smoothing cream as it says...kind of like a thick conditioner. My hair is wavy/curly and very thick, although the individual hairs are normal or somewhat fine (not coarse). It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair too much, just enough to work for me. And the price is right! I couldn&#x27;t find it at the store anymore, so I was glad to find it here.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. I can&#x27;t find this anymore in stores, but I love it. Works perfectly on long wavy hair in the Florida humidity. Hope I use all this up .... :)</li>
            <li> Great stuff for a guy with long gray hair.  Gives it great control and a really nice look.  Not flighty like Michio Kaku.  They require a minimum number of words here, so here are some creamy words: actinopterygian, sarcopterygian, teleostomi, and chondryichthyes.</li>
            <li> This is one of the very few products I actually finished and repurchased. I usually jump around because I am not satisfied, but I love this! Really sad they&#x27;ve discontinued this. I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;ll do when it&#x27;s all gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very lightweight and not much is needed. It can be reapplied and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down. I can go several days without washing my hair and this product allows me to do that (I just reapply as needed). There&#x27;s no florally/fruity scent. Just a light slightly waxy smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that more people are able to persuade garnier to carry this again!</li>
            <li> As many others have noted in reviews both on this site and on Garnier Fructis&#x27;s, this product has been discontinued, and that&#x27;s a huge shame. It&#x27;s a light product with firm hold. I&#x27;ve never found anything else quite like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get the impression it&#x27;s mostly women who have used this product. On the other hand, I&#x27;m a man with short hair, and for years I&#x27;ve been using various creams to style it. I try to save the heavier waxes and pomades for special occasions since they seem harsher on the hair and are much harder to wash out. Of course, getting good hold with something as light as cream is a bit of an art form, but this is by far the best and easiest I&#x27;ve ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine why Garnier Fructis would get rid of this product, and I&#x27;m hoping against hope that the outcry from so many satisfied customers might change their mind. It probably won&#x27;t, but here&#x27;s my contribution to the effort. In the meantime, I&#x27;ve bought up a few of these 6-packs to try to last me a while until I can find something new.</li>
            <li> I have evenly curly (type 3A) caucasian hair which is fine but thick (meaning the individual hair strands are very thin/fine, but I have lots of them). I am almost 40 years old and have tried nearly every product on the market for frizz and soft control over the past twenty years - including cheap stuff, salon brands, and high-end boutique lines. This is the ONE product which has ever fully worked to do specifically what I want it to: control frizz, lightly tame body and shape without feeling heavy or like I have sticky products in my hair, and which stands up to humidity and sun. I began using this product when I lived in the Great Lakes region, and then moved back to the Gulf Coast where humidity is high and rainy days have been plentiful. It worked just as well here as it did up north. This year I also had the opportunity to \\&quot;test\\&quot; the product in the tropics when I traveled to Central America, and it continues to be the best product I have ever used (for this specific purpose, and for my hair type). The icing on the cake is that it&#x27;s a naturally derived product !! I am sad that I can no longer find it in my local stores and am planning to stock up online for fear that it is being discontinued.</li>
            <li> I like that fact that it is a natural product.  I actually works to keep frizz from creeping into you hair style throughou the day.  Great product for individuals with curly hair.  A little smoothing cream, crunch, and hair spray and your on your way!</li>
            <li> I cannot find this product in stores anywhere anymore.&lt;br /&gt;This product is the only thing that works really well with my hair. I&#x27;m glad I am able to purchase it through this seller. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m letting my hair grow out this works much better than the stiff hair gel. I does tend to leave some white streaks though if not massaged in thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have naturally long wavy hair and this smoothing cream is light and never weighs my hair down.  I just use about a dime size portion and WHA-LAA.  It is just perfect.  I love my hair and I love Garnier.  THanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have fine, curly hair…not sure if this is a rare hair type or not, but I just don’t love Garnier Fructis Style Pure Clean Smoothing Cream on my hair.  The consistency may be a bit too thick for my hair type.  It doesn’t leave my hair feeling too weighed down, but at the same time I don’t really think it’s making a difference one way or the other.  Obviously, if you are going to buy a smoothing cream you do want there to be some improvement or you could have saved the $7.  One more thing, I recently got a haircut and my stylist said that there was a lot of build-up on my hair and had to use a clarifying shampoo…since my last hair cut nothing has changed, but the addition of Garnier Fructis&#x27; Smoothing Cream.  With that being said, I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  I have long, thick wavy hair.  You seriously only need a tiny bit, JUST FOR THE ENDS!  I made the mistake of putting it all through my hair, and it made my roots look very greasy.  Just rub into the ends, and it made my split ends blend-.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you suffer from the frizzies.  It doesn&#x27;t turn into powdery flakes like most gels and it provides shiny, loose curls, not frizz.</li>
            <li> whether i have short hair or put my hair in a fohawk, this is my favorite product!! It doesn&#x27;t weight down my hair and it holds pretty good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last year and it&#x27;s proved to be great in taming my natural curls, when I&#x27;m leave my hear curly or straighten it.</li>
            <li> This does not leave my hair hard like gels or sprays. It keeps my curly hair mostly in place, and subdues any frizzy elements. It may leave hair feeling a bit greasy the next day (not the day of) but that is only natural, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I use this for that retro Mad Men look. It&#x27;s the best. It holds and it allows you to comb through your hair which is key.</li>
            <li> Such a great product...  Its a shame its discontinued though.  Its perfect for my medium-length, thick, wavy, male hair.  I put about a quarter-sized amount in my hair after its been towel-dried after a shower and form as needed.  The hair hardens and I can either keep it slick and shiny looking or after a few hours run my fingers through my hair to give it more of a natural look with hardly ANY deviation from the form I put it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its going to be a shame when I cant find this product anymore.  Before I started getting it from Amazon, I tried a few different products from the store and just cant find anything close to it.</li>
            <li> My daughter is not able to find this in the large city she lives in, so tipped me off with her &amp;#34;wish list&amp;#34; for Christmas as to how she now orders it from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She says it&#x27;s the BEST product for her hair - natural wave to her hair that can tend to be a tad &amp;#34;wick-wack&amp;#34; and then hard to style. This product is not heavy and controls her hair for a more natural &amp;#34;fluff &amp; go&amp;#34; style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the pricing for a 6 pack.</li>
            <li> I have long curl hair that I let dry naturally.  This product helps my soft curls stay as curls instead of totally firzzing away as the day goes on.  Doesn&#x27;t need attention either like a gel needs crimping or something when it dries.  Wash, apply and go!</li>
