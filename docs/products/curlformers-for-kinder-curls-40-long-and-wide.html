    <ol>
            <li>I thought it would be perfect for curling my 7 year-old daughter&#x27;s hair (heretofore known as Teagan).  </li>
            <li>Each curl was perfect...</li>
            <li>I thought she looked beautiful!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a perfect product!</li>
            <li>and they work great!  </li>
            <li>a wonderful alternative to rollers</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful!!</li>
            <li>they give uniform, perfect curls.</li>
            <li>This product is awesome.  </li>
            <li>Great invention!</li>
            <li>Curled my hair in PERFECT curls in 2 HOURS!</li>
            <li>and I had perfect curls in 2 hours.</li>
            <li>As a parent, the curlformers are great!  </li>
            <li>They still look awesome!  </li>
            <li>I bought these curlers and played around with them and they look AWESOME!</li>
            <li>I took them out and had perfect curls - no kinks!</li>
            <li>I am really impressed and will recommend.   </li>
            <li>My daughter used them also and had wonderful results.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect solution.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, the hair is not set perfectly and when I pull in the rod with the attached hair, I feel it yanking at my hair</li>
            <li>So many compliments on my hair!!!</li>
            <li>But I then re-read the directions and we were good to go!</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Also i tried a set during the day and even after waiting 2 hours i didnt get as great results that i got when i slept with them.  </li>
            <li>Bottom line: they take practice, but produce great results if you can tolerate sleeping in them.</li>
            <li>Setting lotion did nothing for me but conditioner and aloe vera or flaxseed gel was great.</li>
            <li>LOL.</li>
            <li>great product tho...</li>
            <li>I am so  happy</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t argue with the results because it makes great curls</li>
            <li>Here is my review: I LOVE THEM!!</li>
            <li>Very nice product.</li>
            <li>This product is a great way to get healthy (no heat!)</li>
            <li>They were very easy to put in!</li>
            <li>I would also recommend using Proclaim Setting Lotion and investing in a good set of jaw clips to help in sectioning off your hair.</li>
            <li>Sallys has a really good return policy and you have 90 days to return.</li>
            <li>Loved the way it looked.</li>
            <li>maybe see which is a good setting lotion.</li>
            <li>WE LOVED THEM.</li>
            <li>Also she loved moving her head all around with them in to feel them bounce and move in her hair.</li>
            <li>My hair came out beautifully, however, I have not figured out how to maintain the curly style for more than 1 day.</li>
            <li>Love the product!</li>
            <li>But even my first set looked great and stayed curly until i took a shower that night!  </li>
            <li>i love them!</li>
            <li>love them though!</li>
            <li>LOVE!</li>
            <li>Love the Curlformers!  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off using bobby pins to curl your hair!</li>
            <li>LOVE THEM!</li>
            <li>first set came out awesome.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>also amazing... light-weight, no stickiness, nice hold) .</li>
            <li>Teagan was just thrilled with her \\&quot;Taylor Swift\\&quot; hair.    </li>
            <li>She also said she liked the colors.  </li>
            <li>You get nice curls.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These really are wonderful.  </li>
            <li>These really work best when you sleep in them.  </li>
            <li>I did link two curls together for some of the longer ones (but ran out and couldn&#x27;t do my whole hair) and it worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li>The best way to get perfect tight curls without heat!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, super easy and great end result!</li>
            <li>I have curly kinky hair and this product is the best with my new growth and still chemically relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>I bought these about a year ago and they are very easy to use.</li>
            <li>and they were the perfect soft bouncy curls that I have always wanted-and no damage done to my hair!  </li>
            <li>Each curler gripped nicely at the top</li>
            <li>Okay, i dont own this \\&quot;salon kit\\&quot;</li>
            <li>These curlers have made her natural hair look wonderful.</li>
            <li>It is by far the easiest way to get perfect spiral curls from root to tip.</li>
            <li>These are so easy, don&#x27;t hurt and my curls last...for days!</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;Curls, however, are very pretty and based on the fact that this type of curl forming doesn&#x27;t involve any chemicals or hair damage, it&#x27;s a great invention for sure.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The curlers do produce very nice curls very easily, but at first it&#x27;s tricky.</li>
            <li>first day was great.</li>
            <li>The results are worthy of 5 stars though!!</li>
            <li>They were easy and the curls were amazing.</li>
            <li>Make sure that all of the hair you&#x27;re pulling through is within the loop of the hook.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I figured out one more trick.</li>
            <li>I love mine and use them twice a week.</li>
            <li>so 2 more packs of 6 should</li>
            <li>its not as comfortable as sleeping with nothing in your hair, but these things are made of woven plastic, NO WIRE!</li>
            <li>They are better than rollers.</li>
            <li>Just straighten the curlformer, pinch the top, and slide it off.  </li>
            <li>you are putting them in, it will go in a lot better if you twist the hair at the head and then feed it through the twist part.</li>
            <li>they did turn out to be more like Shirley Temple curls than anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>I will practice more and post an update if I figure a trick.&lt;br /&gt;Sleeping</li>
            <li>Try them out - you&#x27;ll probably love them.</li>
            <li>The spirals are just adorable.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair and I love that it curls without heat.  </li>
            <li>plan on using this more and more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>I sectioned my hair in 2 halves (bottom and top)</li>
            <li>I watched a video on you tube before I did it just to make sure I was doing it correctly.</li>
            <li>Unless of course you are able to sleep in these things, but I am just not someone who can sleep with anything connected to my head (except an eye mask) or else it interrupts my sleep ....</li>
            <li>so I purchased two more packs.</li>
            <li>I sectioned into fours and tried to be sure 10 was my max for each section.</li>
            <li>I may pick up another add-on pack just so I won&#x27;t have to keep thinking about how many I have left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But that gets better with practice.</li>
            <li>LOVE THEM</li>
            <li>LOVE THEM</li>
            <li>I went to Sally&#x27;s but Amazon had the better deal.</li>
            <li>It makes okay curls.</li>
            <li>I tried these out on my bangs and decided it would be a great look on my whole head</li>
            <li>I sure can&#x27;t use the curlers without the hook.</li>
            <li>and I think that the more I do it, the faster, more efficient, and routine it will be.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no telling how many hairs I lost trying to yank the hair through the rollers</li>
            <li>These rollers are fabulous!</li>
            <li>This helped a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Other than my issues with the hook, the curls came out adorable.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to get this product.</li>
            <li>Curlformers are a must have for anyone thats looking for a great curling option that will last more then two minutes  :)  Enjoy!</li>
            <li>These are great tools for natural hair.</li>
            <li>Make sure you free your hair from the rubber end before trying to remove.</li>
            <li>When i used curlformers, i&#x27;d get the best curls and it would last for a long time, my hair looked beautiful and i&#x27;d get compliments.</li>
            <li>they are kind of fun to put in your hair not a hassle like rollers and barrel curlers etc.</li>
            <li>Threading the hook through the curler was so easy that I had</li>
            <li>The curlformers are easy to use but do take some getting used to.  </li>
            <li>They were extremely easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Taking them out is just as easy as putting them in.  </li>
            <li>These are so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to put in.</li>
            <li>I did them on my own hair first</li>
            <li>I was previously using the curling iron on her in the mornings of the competitions to make sure she had perfect and full curls</li>
            <li>if you stick to the recommended 2cm sections you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>The instructions and videos make it sound so easy.  </li>
            <li>The curlformers themselves work fine</li>
            <li>Quick swoop and snap motion and voila!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like this or not, but after checking out the other positive reviews, I decided to give it a shot...and this is amazing!!!  </li>
            <li>I put them in the night before after she showers put these in, put her to bed and in the morning she has great curls that last all day.</li>
            <li>the effort each evening, they aren&#x27;t that comfortable to sleep on, and the possibility that they would fall in the morning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, not at all comfortable to sleep with.</li>
            <li>and she threw a fit.</li>
            <li>A lot of fun to use , and a lovely curl it makes</li>
            <li>but honestly if you put too much hair in, it snags.  </li>
            <li>spirals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will need to purchase one or two more packs to be sure I don&#x27;t run out or have to stuff too much hair into one curler.  </li>
            <li>All that said, it&#x27;s very worth it.</li>
            <li>my daughter has fine, hard-to-keep-a-curl hair and we are at day 2 with a full head of curls.</li>
            <li>The first day very curly, day two good curls and bouncy, day three plenty of body.</li>
            <li>I got this product for my daughter and she was so excited.</li>
            <li>Just learning curves I won&#x27;t have to repeat and were totally worth the results!</li>
            <li>all they are a great product just need to dry</li>
            <li>I love the silky curls that I get with Curlformers and love how close it gets to the roots of my natural 4a hair texture.</li>
            <li>and they work wonderful in creating big , lush curls.</li>
            <li>I use them at night &amp; sleep with them in, which is far from comfortable but in the morning they are dry &amp; my curls are perfect.</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t have the hook just right on your hair it will tangle in already curly hair, so if it gets off as you start to pull it hurts like the dickens!</li>
            <li>I have been super excited to try these out...</li>
            <li>Once I take the curlers out, my hair is soft, silky, nicely curled in a spiral.  </li>
            <li>and she had no problem sleeping on them and thought they were really cool looking while they were in her hair.  </li>
            <li>I was able to use the kit for my whole head, and I have a lot a hair.</li>
            <li>The rollers are short; my hair sticks out a good 3 or 4 inches on the ends.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been able to do a pretty good roller set with wire mesh rollers, but what intrigued me was the ability to dry faster because the hair is not wrapped on itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are pretty easy to take out</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Quick drying.</li>
            <li>Basically, I want to marry these (ok, maybe not, but I love them just the same).</li>
            <li>This is what I did and much more economical than buying a whole kit that costs $70</li>
            <li>Because the tubes are mesh my hair dries really quickly</li>
            <li>My hair was SUPER curly.</li>
            <li>It was really easy to use, and I got the hang of it really</li>
            <li>Other than that, amazing!</li>
            <li>My hair is extremely straight and fine, but there&#x27;s a lot of it.</li>
            <li>If you pull it straight from your head, it pulls through smoothly every time.</li>
            <li>Success in the morning with a blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>But curlformers provide a fun, no-heat way to curl and stretch out your hair.</li>
            <li>Curlformers are worth every dime.</li>
            <li>worth every penny</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the hair loss,</li>
            <li>These are a lot of fun to use.</li>
            <li>I like the Curlformers so much that, personally, I&#x27;ll forget about the yanking and hope that as I get more experience I&#x27;ll be able to avoid it</li>
            <li>I would say worth it,</li>
            <li>She was right.  </li>
            <li>And I was right.</li>
            <li>is going to have curlers that won&#x27;t even be right for your hair.</li>
            <li>and I felt like I was going to yank the hook right through my hair, chopping off the ends.  </li>
            <li>So these rollers are awesome, I ended up getting the salon kit, but I should have gotten the extra long and wide b/c my hair was hanging out of many of the rollers, which could explain my frizzy ends.  </li>
            <li>However the curls do look amazing and stay in for a very long time.    </li>
            <li>Teagan said that it wasn&#x27;t exactly comfortable to sleep on, but they were much better than the pink sponge rollers I have used on her before.  </li>
            <li>and I have beautiful curls to last all day long.  </li>
            <li>The next morning, I removed the curl formers to find soft, gorgeous, well-defined</li>
            <li>No, I&#x27;m not paid to say any of this, but ladies-if you want soft, cute spiral curls-I highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;d like to try those for nice loose</li>
            <li>The little rubber ends are what provides good grip and keeps the roller close to the root, BUT</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more time consuming than a quick blow dry in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I did have to make sure each curler bounced up into a spiral because some had a tendancy to kink in the middle.      </li>
            <li>After many, many times of using them (and several packs purchased one at a time), I&#x27;ve finally settled on using 52 Curlformers on my head.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d definitely recommend :]</li>
            <li>At first I just kept trying</li>
            <li>So be aware to twist to avoid tangles and pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do them after the bath when her hair is pretty damp</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li>They lasted A LOT longer than curls made with a hot iron.</li>
            <li>My first time using them</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lost some curls to frizz after the first shower I took.</li>
            <li>I would recommend them to anyone who needs to have their hair curled and who wants the easiest way!</li>
            <li>It worked pretty well on the thinner shorter strands of hair</li>
            <li>So, first thing is that these take some practice.</li>
            <li>My daughter has very fine hair and no curl would ever stay for too long, but</li>
            <li>I ended up getting up at 5am and taking them out, but this actually turned out to be good because the curls had fallen out just enough by the time I woke up.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought maybe I was trying too much hair, but it would happen no matter what.  </li>
            <li>You have to be aware of how much hair you grab.</li>
            <li>I say they were much easier to use just because I didn&#x27;t have to wrap her hair around the roller, making sure the ends were flat</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to straighten, but definitely not \\&quot;wash-and-go\\&quot; hair.</li>
            <li>Now I have learned to use several smoothing products first (detangler, smoothing cream, and then a light spray gel).  </li>
            <li>I plan on using it on my little sister when I get home-since it is painless and has a super cute outcome!&lt;br</li>
            <li>However I still think it&#x27;s best to get the EXTRA long and Wide ones if you plan on growing out your hair.</li>
            <li>and of course if you have layers you may want to purchase more than one size so you have the proper size for all your layers.&lt;br /&gt;Overall its an awesome product, my only real complaint is with the hook.</li>
            <li>So far I have only used these on my three year old daughter, but I love them already!  </li>
            <li>I think this product is amazing not only because it works, but also because its simple to use.</li>
            <li>I thread it through the curler and it stays secure until I physically take the curler out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>and if you put to much hair per curler</li>
            <li>It makes it so much easier to pull the hair through the mesh tube.</li>
            <li>I can either have it really curly or just wavy with volume.  </li>
            <li>so I ended up not getting the set, but 3 sets of extra-long and wide ones, just to be sure.  </li>
            <li>If you pay attention to how you&#x27;re applying the roller, you can push it close to your scalp to grip the root, which will give you straight roots</li>
            <li>Only available through Sallys.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>She said they aren&#x27;t really comfy</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s her choice if she wants the curls in before bed.  </li>
            <li>I washed my hair (which is straight and very</li>
            <li>It got very stuck for every curl</li>
            <li>It really does get easier each time you use them.    </li>
            <li>They can be used with a blow dryer, but really there is no comparison with the results.  </li>
            <li>My hair is 4a/3c and very dense.</li>
            <li>I absolutely cannot sleep in these things</li>
            <li>I waited to read reviews and waiting until my birthday to let someone else buy it for me as I couldn&#x27;t justify spending this much on myself for hair supplies.</li>
            <li>realized I was using too much hair per section.</li>
            <li>I really like these things.</li>
            <li>I really really wanted to try them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and maybe I can get another one or two days with my hair straight in a bun.</li>
            <li>VERY</li>
            <li>All I would say is make sure you don&#x27;t put to much hair per curler or it gets stuck half way through</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the curlformers twice, and each time the result was pretty, soft curls.</li>
            <li>The very first time, my curls had gaps, because after pulling the hook out the former just didn&#x27;t want to fall back to it&#x27;s original shape.</li>
            <li>These dry for the most part over night, though you may need to do a quick blow dry in the morning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a style that I could definitely invest in for up to a full two weeks wear.</li>
            <li>have long (between my shoulder blades when straightened) natural hair (mostly 3A, my texture varies) and even as a wet set it still produced smooth bouncy curls.</li>
            <li>ends were slightly frizzy, but I think that&#x27;s more user error.  </li>
            <li>very durible and built to last so definetly worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Considering the price of these I shouldn&#x27;t have to complain about the quality of the main component.</li>
            <li>I have super long straight hair and when using a curling iron</li>
            <li>about 1:45 under a hooded dryer on high.</li>
            <li>She loves it and highly recommends it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this kit to all.</li>
            <li>I could not believe how natural the curls looked!!</li>
            <li>It works good if you start at the bottom, use a comb with the long pointy end and section of a little at a time while keeping the rest of the hair tied up in a pony tail.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty long hair and was concerned to get the right curl-formers to fit my length, since I read that they might be not long enough.</li>
            <li>It was designed to \\&quot;hold on\\&quot; when released, so trying to pull the hair through when it&#x27;s closed will prevent the hair from sliding through smoothly.</li>
            <li>which surprised me, so you dont have to worry about deforming them, they are very durable.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used these, I really wanted to take them back.  </li>
            <li>The next morning, I pulled each curler out and they slid right off.  </li>
            <li>it takes me about 12 minutes, and that is right off the bat, no practice necessary.  </li>
            <li>straighten my hair once a week because it&#x27;s the only way to get right to my roots and add a lot of shine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Right now it seems like they will last about two days</li>
            <li>She has Medium length hair that is poker straight, baby fine and super thin.</li>
            <li>I already bought new curly from my neighborhood sallies.</li>
            <li>Cut the time of curling hair in half and are really easy to use.  </li>
            <li>(I have to mention that I can only do my hair while it&#x27;s wet, but I think that has more to do with my hair than with the curlformers.</li>
            <li>even though i can get all my hair curled with them, the more hair you have in the hook, the harder it is to pull it through the former.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how I can possibly agree with the reviews that say it&#x27;s painless or super easy.</li>
            <li>As many other reviewers have said, there&#x27;s definitely a learning curve.</li>
            <li>The first two times I don&#x27;t think I let them sit enough.</li>
            <li>First of all, I read the tutorial that came with it, watched various videos on how to do it</li>
            <li>natural looking curls!</li>
            <li>There is a learning curve to them (especially if you don&#x27;t read the directions as you are putting them in), the first one I put in my daugher&#x27;s hair (age 9) pulled her hair.</li>
            <li>It arrived earlier than advertised and was exactly what it purported to be.</li>
            <li>but I actually was able to use them back to back!!</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>My 5 year old is in competitive cheer and theses worked wonders!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because you need to stick with small sections of hair, get more of these than you think you will need.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll elaborate on what other reviewers have recommended and add that it&#x27;s important to twist the section of the hair down by the root in the same direction as the curlformer you&#x27;re about to put in.</li>
            <li>I pre dry my hair, thread it through,  blow dry for about 3-4 minutes and leave them on for about 10 minutes more.</li>
            <li>I am able to curl larger pieces which cuts down on time and then separate the curls after the curlforms come out.  </li>
            <li>I tried to get them to relax but all that happened was a huge fro and a mess.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t curl nearly as well as my old rollers, though!</li>
            <li>For my tight coils running a rattail comb over each section help smooth it out.</li>
            <li>Once you get the technique down, it&#x27;s actually fun!</li>
            <li>I put them in her hair wet with a little hairspray and they were nice and bouncy.</li>
            <li>A couple of tips: when you&#x27;ve loaded the hook and are ready to pull it through, squeeze the rubber end near the scalp to open it.</li>
            <li>I am transitioning from chemically processed hair to natural hair and this is my go to product.  </li>
            <li>my teen said everyone raved over her hair at school (even though straight hair is the \\&quot;in\\&quot; style these days).</li>
            <li>Just have to say that my 4 yr old LOVES the curls from her curlformers.  </li>
            <li>and i have 3c/4a natural hair.</li>
            <li>Because there is no heat, the curls don&#x27;t last the whole day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They&#x27;re so much easier to use than traditional plastic rollers</li>
            <li>The curls look so natural and stay all day.</li>
            <li>I decided to try these because nothing else had worked well or lasted long not even hot rollers or \\&quot;sleeping\\&quot; in foam rollers.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my 4 year old cheerleader.</li>
            <li>I used the whole starter pack except for the short curlers PLUS the two packs I bought.</li>
            <li>and I wanted some versatility with my style that was pretty, heatless, and stretched my hair out well.</li>
            <li>My daughter is growing her hair naturally.  </li>
            <li>I tried them in my 6 year old&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>perhaps I will try next time with a breif blow dry on a cool setting.</li>
            <li>The long &amp; wide worked fine for my 2 inches below the shoulder hair...</li>
            <li>There are actually more options on the company&#x27;s website and I purchased the extra long &amp; wide set.</li>
            <li>All things considered, this is a decent product; it&#x27;s relatively inexpensive, and it sort of gets the job done.</li>
            <li>We saw all the older girls with them in at her last competition.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you purchase the correct size because when my friend used my long &amp; wide with her looong hair, her ends petruded out leaving them straight while the rest was curled, she needs the extra long ones.</li>
            <li>aside from the price difference, the product can work as described as long as you keep certain things in mind.</li>
            <li>Bought as a small gift for my wife, it has been a huge hit.</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical about them at first, but the sales girl at the store said that they were really popular and they work really well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to do it dry, but the hair flies around too much</li>
            <li>She has fine hair, natural curl but uneven curl and definitely not natural spirals like these curlformers create.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In terms of cons, you can&#x27;t really tell when they&#x27;re dry since the hair is inside the roller.</li>
            <li>Second, If you have super thick hair like I do you should wait until it has air dried most of the way and THEN put them in.</li>
            <li>its too bad because these made great curls, sigh.</li>
            <li>I only bought about 16 formers in total (2 packs of 8), and i would recommended buying at least three packs,</li>
            <li>Putting them in is relatively easy, though it takes a few tries to get used to the quirks of the hook and formers.</li>
            <li>It takes a few tries to get how to use it, but once you know, it goes pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>I am African American with natural hair</li>
            <li>I was skeptical as I have tried numerous products in the past to achieve long lasting perfect curls.</li>
            <li>, I purchased the LONG &amp; WIDE pack (containing 8) &amp; LONG &amp; EXTRA WIDE (containing 4) pack at my local Sally Beauty Salon for about $12/each.</li>
            <li>I mean they are a little strange just because I have never seen anything like this, but after the first section of hair it was easy peasy.  </li>
            <li>At first, I bought 3 packs of the long and wide, so I had 24 total.</li>
            <li>The mouth of the tubes wear out easy, I have only done it three times and the grip is weak already.</li>
            <li>My Hair: pretty thin, straight and shoulder length ... will not curl for anything.  </li>
            <li>they need to be left on over night to dry completely.  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I thought it would be perfect for curling my 7 year-old daughter&#x27;s hair (heretofore known as Teagan).  </li>
            <li> Each curl was perfect...</li>
            <li> I thought she looked beautiful!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a perfect product!</li>
            <li> and they work great!  </li>
            <li> a wonderful alternative to rollers</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful!!</li>
            <li> they give uniform, perfect curls.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.  </li>
            <li> Great invention!</li>
            <li> Curled my hair in PERFECT curls in 2 HOURS!</li>
            <li> and I had perfect curls in 2 hours.</li>
            <li> As a parent, the curlformers are great!  </li>
            <li> They still look awesome!  </li>
            <li> I bought these curlers and played around with them and they look AWESOME!</li>
            <li> I took them out and had perfect curls - no kinks!</li>
            <li> I am really impressed and will recommend.   </li>
            <li> My daughter used them also and had wonderful results.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect solution.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, the hair is not set perfectly and when I pull in the rod with the attached hair, I feel it yanking at my hair</li>
            <li> So many compliments on my hair!!!</li>
            <li> But I then re-read the directions and we were good to go!</li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> Also i tried a set during the day and even after waiting 2 hours i didnt get as great results that i got when i slept with them.  </li>
            <li> Bottom line: they take practice, but produce great results if you can tolerate sleeping in them.</li>
            <li> Setting lotion did nothing for me but conditioner and aloe vera or flaxseed gel was great.</li>
            <li> LOL.</li>
            <li> great product tho...</li>
            <li> I am so  happy</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t argue with the results because it makes great curls</li>
            <li> Here is my review: I LOVE THEM!!</li>
            <li> Very nice product.</li>
            <li> This product is a great way to get healthy (no heat!)</li>
            <li> They were very easy to put in!</li>
            <li> I would also recommend using Proclaim Setting Lotion and investing in a good set of jaw clips to help in sectioning off your hair.</li>
            <li> Sallys has a really good return policy and you have 90 days to return.</li>
            <li> Loved the way it looked.</li>
            <li> maybe see which is a good setting lotion.</li>
            <li> WE LOVED THEM.</li>
            <li> Also she loved moving her head all around with them in to feel them bounce and move in her hair.</li>
            <li> My hair came out beautifully, however, I have not figured out how to maintain the curly style for more than 1 day.</li>
            <li> Love the product!</li>
            <li> But even my first set looked great and stayed curly until i took a shower that night!  </li>
            <li> i love them!</li>
            <li> love them though!</li>
            <li> LOVE!</li>
            <li> Love the Curlformers!  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off using bobby pins to curl your hair!</li>
            <li> LOVE THEM!</li>
            <li> first set came out awesome.</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> also amazing... light-weight, no stickiness, nice hold) .</li>
            <li> Teagan was just thrilled with her \\&quot;Taylor Swift\\&quot; hair.    </li>
            <li> She also said she liked the colors.  </li>
            <li> You get nice curls.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These really are wonderful.  </li>
            <li> These really work best when you sleep in them.  </li>
            <li> I did link two curls together for some of the longer ones (but ran out and couldn&#x27;t do my whole hair) and it worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li> The best way to get perfect tight curls without heat!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, super easy and great end result!</li>
            <li> I have curly kinky hair and this product is the best with my new growth and still chemically relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> I bought these about a year ago and they are very easy to use.</li>
            <li> and they were the perfect soft bouncy curls that I have always wanted-and no damage done to my hair!  </li>
            <li> Each curler gripped nicely at the top</li>
            <li> Okay, i dont own this \\&quot;salon kit\\&quot;</li>
            <li> These curlers have made her natural hair look wonderful.</li>
            <li> It is by far the easiest way to get perfect spiral curls from root to tip.</li>
            <li> These are so easy, don&#x27;t hurt and my curls last...for days!</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;Curls, however, are very pretty and based on the fact that this type of curl forming doesn&#x27;t involve any chemicals or hair damage, it&#x27;s a great invention for sure.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The curlers do produce very nice curls very easily, but at first it&#x27;s tricky.</li>
            <li> first day was great.</li>
            <li> The results are worthy of 5 stars though!!</li>
            <li> They were easy and the curls were amazing.</li>
            <li> Make sure that all of the hair you&#x27;re pulling through is within the loop of the hook.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I figured out one more trick.</li>
            <li> I love mine and use them twice a week.</li>
            <li> so 2 more packs of 6 should</li>
            <li> its not as comfortable as sleeping with nothing in your hair, but these things are made of woven plastic, NO WIRE!</li>
            <li> They are better than rollers.</li>
            <li> Just straighten the curlformer, pinch the top, and slide it off.  </li>
            <li> you are putting them in, it will go in a lot better if you twist the hair at the head and then feed it through the twist part.</li>
            <li> they did turn out to be more like Shirley Temple curls than anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> I will practice more and post an update if I figure a trick.&lt;br /&gt;Sleeping</li>
            <li> Try them out - you&#x27;ll probably love them.</li>
            <li> The spirals are just adorable.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair and I love that it curls without heat.  </li>
            <li> plan on using this more and more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I sectioned my hair in 2 halves (bottom and top)</li>
            <li> I watched a video on you tube before I did it just to make sure I was doing it correctly.</li>
            <li> Unless of course you are able to sleep in these things, but I am just not someone who can sleep with anything connected to my head (except an eye mask) or else it interrupts my sleep ....</li>
            <li> so I purchased two more packs.</li>
            <li> I sectioned into fours and tried to be sure 10 was my max for each section.</li>
            <li> I may pick up another add-on pack just so I won&#x27;t have to keep thinking about how many I have left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But that gets better with practice.</li>
            <li> LOVE THEM</li>
            <li> LOVE THEM</li>
            <li> I went to Sally&#x27;s but Amazon had the better deal.</li>
            <li> It makes okay curls.</li>
            <li> I tried these out on my bangs and decided it would be a great look on my whole head</li>
            <li> I sure can&#x27;t use the curlers without the hook.</li>
            <li> and I think that the more I do it, the faster, more efficient, and routine it will be.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no telling how many hairs I lost trying to yank the hair through the rollers</li>
            <li> These rollers are fabulous!</li>
            <li> This helped a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Other than my issues with the hook, the curls came out adorable.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this product.</li>
            <li> Curlformers are a must have for anyone thats looking for a great curling option that will last more then two minutes  :)  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> These are great tools for natural hair.</li>
            <li> Make sure you free your hair from the rubber end before trying to remove.</li>
            <li> When i used curlformers, i&#x27;d get the best curls and it would last for a long time, my hair looked beautiful and i&#x27;d get compliments.</li>
            <li> they are kind of fun to put in your hair not a hassle like rollers and barrel curlers etc.</li>
            <li> Threading the hook through the curler was so easy that I had</li>
            <li> The curlformers are easy to use but do take some getting used to.  </li>
            <li> They were extremely easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Taking them out is just as easy as putting them in.  </li>
            <li> These are so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to put in.</li>
            <li> I did them on my own hair first</li>
            <li> I was previously using the curling iron on her in the mornings of the competitions to make sure she had perfect and full curls</li>
            <li> if you stick to the recommended 2cm sections you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> The instructions and videos make it sound so easy.  </li>
            <li> The curlformers themselves work fine</li>
            <li> Quick swoop and snap motion and voila!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like this or not, but after checking out the other positive reviews, I decided to give it a shot...and this is amazing!!!  </li>
            <li> I put them in the night before after she showers put these in, put her to bed and in the morning she has great curls that last all day.</li>
            <li> the effort each evening, they aren&#x27;t that comfortable to sleep on, and the possibility that they would fall in the morning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, not at all comfortable to sleep with.</li>
            <li> and she threw a fit.</li>
            <li> A lot of fun to use , and a lovely curl it makes</li>
            <li> but honestly if you put too much hair in, it snags.  </li>
            <li> spirals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will need to purchase one or two more packs to be sure I don&#x27;t run out or have to stuff too much hair into one curler.  </li>
            <li> All that said, it&#x27;s very worth it.</li>
            <li> my daughter has fine, hard-to-keep-a-curl hair and we are at day 2 with a full head of curls.</li>
            <li> The first day very curly, day two good curls and bouncy, day three plenty of body.</li>
            <li> I got this product for my daughter and she was so excited.</li>
            <li> Just learning curves I won&#x27;t have to repeat and were totally worth the results!</li>
            <li> all they are a great product just need to dry</li>
            <li> I love the silky curls that I get with Curlformers and love how close it gets to the roots of my natural 4a hair texture.</li>
            <li> and they work wonderful in creating big , lush curls.</li>
            <li> I use them at night &amp; sleep with them in, which is far from comfortable but in the morning they are dry &amp; my curls are perfect.</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t have the hook just right on your hair it will tangle in already curly hair, so if it gets off as you start to pull it hurts like the dickens!</li>
            <li> I have been super excited to try these out...</li>
            <li> Once I take the curlers out, my hair is soft, silky, nicely curled in a spiral.  </li>
            <li> and she had no problem sleeping on them and thought they were really cool looking while they were in her hair.  </li>
            <li> I was able to use the kit for my whole head, and I have a lot a hair.</li>
            <li> The rollers are short; my hair sticks out a good 3 or 4 inches on the ends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been able to do a pretty good roller set with wire mesh rollers, but what intrigued me was the ability to dry faster because the hair is not wrapped on itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are pretty easy to take out</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Quick drying.</li>
            <li> Basically, I want to marry these (ok, maybe not, but I love them just the same).</li>
            <li> This is what I did and much more economical than buying a whole kit that costs $70</li>
            <li> Because the tubes are mesh my hair dries really quickly</li>
            <li> My hair was SUPER curly.</li>
            <li> It was really easy to use, and I got the hang of it really</li>
            <li> Other than that, amazing!</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely straight and fine, but there&#x27;s a lot of it.</li>
            <li> If you pull it straight from your head, it pulls through smoothly every time.</li>
            <li> Success in the morning with a blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> But curlformers provide a fun, no-heat way to curl and stretch out your hair.</li>
            <li> Curlformers are worth every dime.</li>
            <li> worth every penny</li>
            <li> It is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the hair loss,</li>
            <li> These are a lot of fun to use.</li>
            <li> I like the Curlformers so much that, personally, I&#x27;ll forget about the yanking and hope that as I get more experience I&#x27;ll be able to avoid it</li>
            <li> I would say worth it,</li>
            <li> She was right.  </li>
            <li> And I was right.</li>
            <li> is going to have curlers that won&#x27;t even be right for your hair.</li>
            <li> and I felt like I was going to yank the hook right through my hair, chopping off the ends.  </li>
            <li> So these rollers are awesome, I ended up getting the salon kit, but I should have gotten the extra long and wide b/c my hair was hanging out of many of the rollers, which could explain my frizzy ends.  </li>
            <li> However the curls do look amazing and stay in for a very long time.    </li>
            <li> Teagan said that it wasn&#x27;t exactly comfortable to sleep on, but they were much better than the pink sponge rollers I have used on her before.  </li>
            <li> and I have beautiful curls to last all day long.  </li>
            <li> The next morning, I removed the curl formers to find soft, gorgeous, well-defined</li>
            <li> No, I&#x27;m not paid to say any of this, but ladies-if you want soft, cute spiral curls-I highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;d like to try those for nice loose</li>
            <li> The little rubber ends are what provides good grip and keeps the roller close to the root, BUT</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more time consuming than a quick blow dry in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I did have to make sure each curler bounced up into a spiral because some had a tendancy to kink in the middle.      </li>
            <li> After many, many times of using them (and several packs purchased one at a time), I&#x27;ve finally settled on using 52 Curlformers on my head.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d definitely recommend :]</li>
            <li> At first I just kept trying</li>
            <li> So be aware to twist to avoid tangles and pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do them after the bath when her hair is pretty damp</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li> They lasted A LOT longer than curls made with a hot iron.</li>
            <li> My first time using them</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lost some curls to frizz after the first shower I took.</li>
            <li> I would recommend them to anyone who needs to have their hair curled and who wants the easiest way!</li>
            <li> It worked pretty well on the thinner shorter strands of hair</li>
            <li> So, first thing is that these take some practice.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very fine hair and no curl would ever stay for too long, but</li>
            <li> I ended up getting up at 5am and taking them out, but this actually turned out to be good because the curls had fallen out just enough by the time I woke up.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought maybe I was trying too much hair, but it would happen no matter what.  </li>
            <li> You have to be aware of how much hair you grab.</li>
            <li> I say they were much easier to use just because I didn&#x27;t have to wrap her hair around the roller, making sure the ends were flat</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to straighten, but definitely not \\&quot;wash-and-go\\&quot; hair.</li>
            <li> Now I have learned to use several smoothing products first (detangler, smoothing cream, and then a light spray gel).  </li>
            <li> I plan on using it on my little sister when I get home-since it is painless and has a super cute outcome!&lt;br</li>
            <li> However I still think it&#x27;s best to get the EXTRA long and Wide ones if you plan on growing out your hair.</li>
            <li> and of course if you have layers you may want to purchase more than one size so you have the proper size for all your layers.&lt;br /&gt;Overall its an awesome product, my only real complaint is with the hook.</li>
            <li> So far I have only used these on my three year old daughter, but I love them already!  </li>
            <li> I think this product is amazing not only because it works, but also because its simple to use.</li>
            <li> I thread it through the curler and it stays secure until I physically take the curler out of my hair.  </li>
            <li> and if you put to much hair per curler</li>
            <li> It makes it so much easier to pull the hair through the mesh tube.</li>
            <li> I can either have it really curly or just wavy with volume.  </li>
            <li> so I ended up not getting the set, but 3 sets of extra-long and wide ones, just to be sure.  </li>
            <li> If you pay attention to how you&#x27;re applying the roller, you can push it close to your scalp to grip the root, which will give you straight roots</li>
            <li> Only available through Sallys.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> She said they aren&#x27;t really comfy</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s her choice if she wants the curls in before bed.  </li>
            <li> I washed my hair (which is straight and very</li>
            <li> It got very stuck for every curl</li>
            <li> It really does get easier each time you use them.    </li>
            <li> They can be used with a blow dryer, but really there is no comparison with the results.  </li>
            <li> My hair is 4a/3c and very dense.</li>
            <li> I absolutely cannot sleep in these things</li>
            <li> I waited to read reviews and waiting until my birthday to let someone else buy it for me as I couldn&#x27;t justify spending this much on myself for hair supplies.</li>
            <li> realized I was using too much hair per section.</li>
            <li> I really like these things.</li>
            <li> I really really wanted to try them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and maybe I can get another one or two days with my hair straight in a bun.</li>
            <li> VERY</li>
            <li> All I would say is make sure you don&#x27;t put to much hair per curler or it gets stuck half way through</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the curlformers twice, and each time the result was pretty, soft curls.</li>
            <li> The very first time, my curls had gaps, because after pulling the hook out the former just didn&#x27;t want to fall back to it&#x27;s original shape.</li>
            <li> These dry for the most part over night, though you may need to do a quick blow dry in the morning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a style that I could definitely invest in for up to a full two weeks wear.</li>
            <li> have long (between my shoulder blades when straightened) natural hair (mostly 3A, my texture varies) and even as a wet set it still produced smooth bouncy curls.</li>
            <li> ends were slightly frizzy, but I think that&#x27;s more user error.  </li>
            <li> very durible and built to last so definetly worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Considering the price of these I shouldn&#x27;t have to complain about the quality of the main component.</li>
            <li> I have super long straight hair and when using a curling iron</li>
            <li> about 1:45 under a hooded dryer on high.</li>
            <li> She loves it and highly recommends it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this kit to all.</li>
            <li> I could not believe how natural the curls looked!!</li>
            <li> It works good if you start at the bottom, use a comb with the long pointy end and section of a little at a time while keeping the rest of the hair tied up in a pony tail.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty long hair and was concerned to get the right curl-formers to fit my length, since I read that they might be not long enough.</li>
            <li> It was designed to \\&quot;hold on\\&quot; when released, so trying to pull the hair through when it&#x27;s closed will prevent the hair from sliding through smoothly.</li>
            <li> which surprised me, so you dont have to worry about deforming them, they are very durable.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used these, I really wanted to take them back.  </li>
            <li> The next morning, I pulled each curler out and they slid right off.  </li>
            <li> it takes me about 12 minutes, and that is right off the bat, no practice necessary.  </li>
            <li> straighten my hair once a week because it&#x27;s the only way to get right to my roots and add a lot of shine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Right now it seems like they will last about two days</li>
            <li> She has Medium length hair that is poker straight, baby fine and super thin.</li>
            <li> I already bought new curly from my neighborhood sallies.</li>
            <li> Cut the time of curling hair in half and are really easy to use.  </li>
            <li> (I have to mention that I can only do my hair while it&#x27;s wet, but I think that has more to do with my hair than with the curlformers.</li>
            <li> even though i can get all my hair curled with them, the more hair you have in the hook, the harder it is to pull it through the former.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I can possibly agree with the reviews that say it&#x27;s painless or super easy.</li>
            <li> As many other reviewers have said, there&#x27;s definitely a learning curve.</li>
            <li> The first two times I don&#x27;t think I let them sit enough.</li>
            <li> First of all, I read the tutorial that came with it, watched various videos on how to do it</li>
            <li> natural looking curls!</li>
            <li> There is a learning curve to them (especially if you don&#x27;t read the directions as you are putting them in), the first one I put in my daugher&#x27;s hair (age 9) pulled her hair.</li>
            <li> It arrived earlier than advertised and was exactly what it purported to be.</li>
            <li> but I actually was able to use them back to back!!</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> My 5 year old is in competitive cheer and theses worked wonders!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because you need to stick with small sections of hair, get more of these than you think you will need.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll elaborate on what other reviewers have recommended and add that it&#x27;s important to twist the section of the hair down by the root in the same direction as the curlformer you&#x27;re about to put in.</li>
            <li> I pre dry my hair, thread it through,  blow dry for about 3-4 minutes and leave them on for about 10 minutes more.</li>
            <li> I am able to curl larger pieces which cuts down on time and then separate the curls after the curlforms come out.  </li>
            <li> I tried to get them to relax but all that happened was a huge fro and a mess.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t curl nearly as well as my old rollers, though!</li>
            <li> For my tight coils running a rattail comb over each section help smooth it out.</li>
            <li> Once you get the technique down, it&#x27;s actually fun!</li>
            <li> I put them in her hair wet with a little hairspray and they were nice and bouncy.</li>
            <li> A couple of tips: when you&#x27;ve loaded the hook and are ready to pull it through, squeeze the rubber end near the scalp to open it.</li>
            <li> I am transitioning from chemically processed hair to natural hair and this is my go to product.  </li>
            <li> my teen said everyone raved over her hair at school (even though straight hair is the \\&quot;in\\&quot; style these days).</li>
            <li> Just have to say that my 4 yr old LOVES the curls from her curlformers.  </li>
            <li> and i have 3c/4a natural hair.</li>
            <li> Because there is no heat, the curls don&#x27;t last the whole day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They&#x27;re so much easier to use than traditional plastic rollers</li>
            <li> The curls look so natural and stay all day.</li>
            <li> I decided to try these because nothing else had worked well or lasted long not even hot rollers or \\&quot;sleeping\\&quot; in foam rollers.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my 4 year old cheerleader.</li>
            <li> I used the whole starter pack except for the short curlers PLUS the two packs I bought.</li>
            <li> and I wanted some versatility with my style that was pretty, heatless, and stretched my hair out well.</li>
            <li> My daughter is growing her hair naturally.  </li>
            <li> I tried them in my 6 year old&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> perhaps I will try next time with a breif blow dry on a cool setting.</li>
            <li> The long &amp; wide worked fine for my 2 inches below the shoulder hair...</li>
            <li> There are actually more options on the company&#x27;s website and I purchased the extra long &amp; wide set.</li>
            <li> All things considered, this is a decent product; it&#x27;s relatively inexpensive, and it sort of gets the job done.</li>
            <li> We saw all the older girls with them in at her last competition.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you purchase the correct size because when my friend used my long &amp; wide with her looong hair, her ends petruded out leaving them straight while the rest was curled, she needs the extra long ones.</li>
            <li> aside from the price difference, the product can work as described as long as you keep certain things in mind.</li>
            <li> Bought as a small gift for my wife, it has been a huge hit.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about them at first, but the sales girl at the store said that they were really popular and they work really well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to do it dry, but the hair flies around too much</li>
            <li> She has fine hair, natural curl but uneven curl and definitely not natural spirals like these curlformers create.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In terms of cons, you can&#x27;t really tell when they&#x27;re dry since the hair is inside the roller.</li>
            <li> Second, If you have super thick hair like I do you should wait until it has air dried most of the way and THEN put them in.</li>
            <li> its too bad because these made great curls, sigh.</li>
            <li> I only bought about 16 formers in total (2 packs of 8), and i would recommended buying at least three packs,</li>
            <li> Putting them in is relatively easy, though it takes a few tries to get used to the quirks of the hook and formers.</li>
            <li> It takes a few tries to get how to use it, but once you know, it goes pretty fast.  </li>
            <li> I am African American with natural hair</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as I have tried numerous products in the past to achieve long lasting perfect curls.</li>
            <li> , I purchased the LONG &amp; WIDE pack (containing 8) &amp; LONG &amp; EXTRA WIDE (containing 4) pack at my local Sally Beauty Salon for about $12/each.</li>
            <li> I mean they are a little strange just because I have never seen anything like this, but after the first section of hair it was easy peasy.  </li>
            <li> At first, I bought 3 packs of the long and wide, so I had 24 total.</li>
            <li> The mouth of the tubes wear out easy, I have only done it three times and the grip is weak already.</li>
            <li> My Hair: pretty thin, straight and shoulder length ... will not curl for anything.  </li>
            <li> they need to be left on over night to dry completely.  </li>
            <li> I think I will buy the knock offs and compare and revise this review at a later date and speak about how long each last.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for some curlers that will hold tight my natural 4b african american textured hair.  </li>
            <li> so, no flat iron is needed to tame new growth.  </li>
            <li> I have always used 1/2 inch barrel curling irons in the past, but I had to use a TON of hair spray, not to mention that it took forever, and my arm would get really</li>
            <li> I initially purchase 4 of the long and wides which come 6 to a pack.  </li>
            <li> For those with longer hair, the \\&quot;short and wide\\&quot; rollers may not be long enough.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I just bought another set, but this time around I went for the extra long.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it matters if the rollers are too long, but it does matter if they are too short.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t an issue though, I just pulled down a little further from the root to accommodate or left it alone if it wasn&#x27;t sticking out too much.</li>
            <li> I use 2 packs of the short and wide on the hair near the nape of my neck, and 4 packs of the long and wide on the rest of my head.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old daughter let me do it half way through</li>
            <li> I have been natural for about a year and a half now</li>
            <li> just saw on the curl former website that they sell a long, extra wide curler.  </li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t put too much hair in each curler, which means you need at least 20 for your head.</li>
            <li> The price is really not that significantly different I have to say.</li>
            <li> to Long Haired Girls-</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re doing a wet set, give yourself enough drying time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you just grab and yank, especially when wet, it grabs and yanks your hair too.</li>
            <li> If you go on the website they suggest people with long hair can put two rollers together.  </li>
            <li> so I probably wont have that problem for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I ended up buying the salon kit because I bought two packages of the pink and orange ones individually.</li>
            <li> I did her entire head with these in about 20-30 minutes and the only reason it took that long is because she was being a fidgety little thing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First I bought a couple packs and a hook: a long and wide and a extra long and wide.</li>
            <li> Your hair MUST be completely dry before removing the curler.</li>
            <li> My hair takes FOREVER to dry...</li>
            <li> , it was no more uncomfortable than any other curlers (the key to them not \\&quot;pulling\\&quot; is to make sure they are away from the scalp about an inch</li>
            <li> thing is to try them on my extremely thin, stick straight hair and see how they turn out!</li>
            <li> starter kit was long enough for my hair although a couple pieces poked out of the end a little.</li>
            <li> My main complaint is that my curls still frizz, I think because as I pull my hair through the curlformer it rubs the opposite direction of the cuticle and causes all my little whispies to stand up.  </li>
            <li> but it does take some practice, especially when working the odd spots on your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They will probably come down in price once other companies start making them, but for now I think this is the only company.  </li>
            <li> I did use a setting lotion and sat under the dryer a little before finally sleeping in them, which wasn&#x27;t that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While my hair is wet and curly with a setting lotion on it</li>
            <li> (I believe the pink ones go counterclockwise and the orange ones go clockwise.)</li>
            <li> I had to buy a few extra packets to handle all of my hair, plus</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pink and orange color</li>
            <li> I simply wet my hair, and put in leave in conditioner in it to \\&quot;prepare\\&quot; my hair.  </li>
            <li> We sprayed her wet hair with ION anti-frizz solutions</li>
            <li> I bought the short and narrow ones for her since she has her hair pulled into a pony tail.</li>
            <li> The next shower I took killed the rest of my curls.</li>
            <li> and since I set my Curlformers on wet hair, I run the risk of breakage through that manipulation.</li>
            <li> and your hair is still close to sopping wet.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair but was still surprised it took so</li>
            <li> Only wish they were less $$ to begin with!</li>
            <li> I even ended up having to curl half my hair with a curling iron because I used such small pieces I didn&#x27;t have enough curlformers.  </li>
            <li> I used these with dry hair, slight spray with a setting mist, and then insert curlformer.</li>
            <li> each section is fairly thin and the curlers are plastic mesh, allowing for decent air-flow, but the point was to curl her hair without heat.      </li>
            <li> Curlformers allow for big curls or tight curls just add as much or as little hair to get the desired curl.  </li>
            <li> They work extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but i did buy some packs from sally&#x27;s the other day</li>
            <li> My daughter is biracial (half black, half white) and she has extremely curly hair already (3c/4a hair)</li>
            <li> I wash my hair, section it and thread it through the curlformers without any other hair product.</li>
            <li> The other girls on her team bought them also to try them out.</li>
            <li> You definitely need to stick with small sections of hair.</li>
            <li> Eventually I ended up accidentally breaking one hook, and taping up the other to avoid that from happening.</li>
            <li> so they  have a little bit of room to contract as they dry).</li>
            <li> Also, it takes a lot of effort to put them in, and you have to be very careful to not rush and damage your hair.</li>
            <li> Go to your local Sally Beauty Supply and you can purchase the hook and two sets of curlformers for less than $30!!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not comfortable to sleep in, but if your event is in the evening, you can do your hair in the morning and let them dry all day.</li>
            <li> When I took them out in the morning wow such curl, sadly it was not the curl I was looking for.</li>
            <li> What I did: I washed my hair and threw on a quarter size amount of curl lotion and blow dried my hair until it was about 90% dry.</li>
            <li> I used a setting lotion, blow dried to damp, then let set for 1.5 hours and used a blow dryer to dry.</li>
            <li> I leave them in for a few hours and check one to see if it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> they take a little practice, but not much.  </li>
            <li> but I recommend letting your hair air dry or blow dry it at least 50% to speed up the process.</li>
            <li> I pulled so hard on one of them one time that I ended up messing up my back.</li>
            <li> I could only sleep in one position comfortably and woke up with horrible neck and back pain.  </li>
            <li> I will say that there is a bit of a learning curve to using them and if you&#x27;re not good at doing your own hair already, you&#x27;ll probably just get frustrated.</li>
            <li> but it pulled a lot of little hairs and was very frustrating to use unless you&#x27;ve got pretty nimble</li>
            <li> I realized that sometimes I was slightly turning the hook as I pulled it out.</li>
            <li> I sat under my bonnet dryer for half an hour then went to sleep in the curl formers.  </li>
            <li> If you join Sally Beauty club for $5, you can get these for $5 off .. plus seach for a coupon and you will get them for less.</li>
            <li> I learned I had to use less than the recommended out of hair</li>
            <li> and it took less time than curling.</li>
            <li> I found that it worked easier when I used less hair per section.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the procces, the grey stick broke in half from yanking so hard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING to curl my hard to curl, long hair.</li>
            <li> I add a small amount of product to my wet hair put these in my hair</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly hair</li>
            <li> My hair is long and medium thick.</li>
            <li> It took about 30 min for me to do my medium thick long hair.</li>
            <li> tight are the curls depends on the dampness before threading the hair.  </li>
            <li> It is super painful so if you have little kids don&#x27;t get it</li>
            <li> Not worth it!  </li>
            <li> if you fail to have complete control of the hair inside the hook, you will be pulling it out of your head trying to pull it through!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put too much hair through a curler because it&#x27;ll give you an awkward wave as opposed to a tight curl.</li>
            <li> Not comfortable at all.</li>
            <li> Once you do a few you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I put mouse on my damp hair after I showered and then I kept the rollers on until my hair dried.</li>
            <li> she was crying about it.</li>
            <li> but it felt like quite a few.</li>
            <li> I found these almost impossible to put in the first time.</li>
            <li> It is too difficult to tell when your hair is dry, even if you blow dry like 4 times and leave them in for 2 hours they still may be damp.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY uncomfortable to sleep on, because they are really sturdy, so I&#x27;ll use a hair dryer from now on.  </li>
            <li> There are not enough bad words to describe the sheer hatred I have for this product.  </li>
            <li> we&#x27;re talking full-grown woman&#x27;s hair on a little girl!  </li>
            <li> Just use a setting lotion or gel and have wet hair (duh!).</li>
            <li> I recently cut it but when it was long they were impossible.</li>
            <li> Learned that lesson after sacrificing a small lock of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m just not sure I&#x27;ve got the patience to keep using them.</li>
            <li> I did get the curls but because my hair has been color treated heavily, when I pulled my hair through the tight little curler with that hook, I had a pile of broken hair on the bathroom floor!  </li>
            <li> But I have to tell you something I learned the hard way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Why would they make them so hard to detach?</li>
            <li> At $13 a bag I should have at least 20 instead of 8.</li>
            <li> I did make the mistake of trying to make the section too thick...</li>
            <li> I ended up needing 4 bags for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got thick hair and this is a pain to do.</li>
            <li> It pulls your hair through a thick plastic piece.</li>
            <li> She tried fixing her hair at night but couldn&#x27;t sleep on the curlers because they kept getting twisted and tangling with each other.  </li>
            <li> They are only very uncomfortable to sleep in and they pull your hair when they are taken off, but, then again, beauty is pain.</li>
            <li> It was a little difficult to figure out how to pull my hair through some of the curlers.</li>
            <li> I bought this expensive little set of rollers after contemplating for over a year.</li>
            <li> Her hair is very thick and she has a LOT of it...</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re made of hard plastic and make you feel like you&#x27;re sleeping on twisted barbed wired.  </li>
            <li> I hate this product, waste of money and waste of time.</li>
            <li> (I hate that kink you get at the end if you aren&#x27;t careful).    </li>
            <li> This is the worst pain my 11 year old daughter ever felt....</li>
            <li> Each curler is a mesh tube that has been flattened and permanently twisted into a spiral curl.  </li>
            <li> Like the rest of you, I was skeptical about spending $70 on rollers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Expensive.</li>
            <li> However sleeping in them is extremely uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I do have to say that the girls do complain of them being uncomfortable to sleep in, though.</li>
            <li> They are also extremely uncomfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li> These curlers are difficult to use at home.</li>
            <li> and it was SO uncomfortable to sleep in.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re going to be sorry!</li>
            <li> I DONT SUGGEST DOING THIS, AS THEY ARE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE TO SLEEP IN.</li>
            <li> These are IMPOSSIBLE to sleep in, also.</li>
            <li> but the hooks that come with them are IMPOSSIBLE to detach.</li>
            <li> the curl turns out bad in the morning also.</li>
            <li> It hurt so bad.</li>
            <li> A number of the reviewers reported that it was painful to pull the hair through the curler.</li>
            <li> Which is REALLY painful.  </li>
            <li> Kinda disappointed</li>
            <li> I sectioned off her hair and started from the base of her neck forward.  </li>
            <li> However, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these for people who hate dealing with their hair.</li>
            <li> : the hook is crap.</li>
            <li> These things are impossible to sleep on!</li>
            <li> Hurts soooo bad!</li>
            <li> This was a disappointment!!!</li>

            <li> Very nice product. My hair came out beautifully, however, I have not figured out how to maintain the curly style for more than 1 day.</li>
            <li> A number of the reviewers reported that it was painful to pull the hair through the curler. If the hair is not positioned correctly in the hook, it will get tangled in the hook and that not only hurts, but will damage your hair ... Which kinda defeats the purpose. A couple of tips: when you&#x27;ve loaded the hook and are ready to pull it through, squeeze the rubber end near the scalp to open it. It was designed to \\&quot;hold on\\&quot; when released, so trying to pull the hair through when it&#x27;s closed will prevent the hair from sliding through smoothly. Secondly, if it doesn&#x27;t pull through effortlessly, STOP and push the curler back up the rod of the hook and start the curl over. Make sure that all of the hair you&#x27;re pulling through is within the loop of the hook. Any hair that is coming out the hook opening will snag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I figured out one more trick. I realized that sometimes I was slightly turning the hook as I pulled it out. You have to pull the hook without ANY twisting. Otherwise it gets tangled in your hair. If you pull it straight from your head, it pulls through smoothly every time.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit at Sally&#x27;s for the same price as advertised here on Amazon.  I thought it would be perfect for curling my 7 year-old daughter&#x27;s hair (heretofore known as Teagan).  Her hair is very thick and she has a LOT of it...we&#x27;re talking full-grown woman&#x27;s hair on a little girl!  It also has quite a bit of wave to it.    Each curler is a mesh tube that has been flattened and permanently twisted into a spiral curl.  The hook comes in two pieces and must be assembled by snapping them together.  The premise is that you hook a section of hair and then guide it through the curler.  Once you let go, the curler snaps back into a spiral shape, curling the hair without heat.    So we washed her hair and then combed some curl creme through it.  I sectioned off her hair and started from the base of her neck forward.  Threading the hook through the curler was so easy that I had Teagan do it while I sectioned off her hair.  I did make the mistake of trying to make the section too thick...all that does is pull her hair and make her yell...if you stick to the recommended 2cm sections you&#x27;ll be fine.Each curler gripped nicely at the top and I did have to make sure each curler bounced up into a spiral because some had a tendancy to kink in the middle.      The next morning, I pulled each curler out and they slid right off.  Each curl was perfect...Teagan was just thrilled with her \\&quot;Taylor Swift\\&quot; hair.    I could have used a blow dryer on her hair if I wanted to speed up the process...each section is fairly thin and the curlers are plastic mesh, allowing for decent air-flow, but the point was to curl her hair without heat.      Teagan said that it wasn&#x27;t exactly comfortable to sleep on, but they were much better than the pink sponge rollers I have used on her before.  She also said she liked the colors.  I say they were much easier to use just because I didn&#x27;t have to wrap her hair around the roller, making sure the ends were flat (I hate that kink you get at the end if you aren&#x27;t careful).    In the end, Teagan and I give this product two-thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for some curlers that will hold tight my natural 4b african american textured hair.  This product WORKS!!!  It takes a few tries to get how to use it, but once you know, it goes pretty fast.  While my hair is wet and curly with a setting lotion on it I thread it through the curler and it stays secure until I physically take the curler out of my hair.  It&#x27;s VERY uncomfortable to sleep on, because they are really sturdy, so I&#x27;ll use a hair dryer from now on.  Once I take the curlers out, my hair is soft, silky, nicely curled in a spiral.  Your hair MUST be completely dry before removing the curler.</li>
            <li> I bought these about a year ago and they are very easy to use. My daughter has very fine hair and no curl would ever stay for too long, but these work! I put them in the night before after she showers put these in, put her to bed and in the morning she has great curls that last all day. All I would say is make sure you don&#x27;t put to much hair per curler or it gets stuck half way through and if you put to much hair per curler the curl turns out bad in the morning also. Over all I give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I bought mine at Sally&#x27;s, and I bought them in installations. Ultimately, it would have been cheaper if I&#x27;d just purchased the starter kit all at once. It&#x27;s really difficult to figure out how many you&#x27;ll need for your hair. My hair is extremely straight and fine, but there&#x27;s a lot of it. At first, I bought 3 packs of the long and wide, so I had 24 total. I figured that would be plenty. After many, many times of using them (and several packs purchased one at a time), I&#x27;ve finally settled on using 52 Curlformers on my head. I use 2 packs of the short and wide on the hair near the nape of my neck, and 4 packs of the long and wide on the rest of my head. My recommendation is to buy the starter pack and see if it&#x27;s going to be enough. As many other reviewers have said, there&#x27;s definitely a learning curve. I&#x27;ll elaborate on what other reviewers have recommended and add that it&#x27;s important to twist the section of the hair down by the root in the same direction as the curlformer you&#x27;re about to put in. (I believe the pink ones go counterclockwise and the orange ones go clockwise.) It makes it so much easier to pull the hair through the mesh tube. Once I figured that out, it made such a difference in the ease and speed with which I can do my hair. (I have to mention that I can only do my hair while it&#x27;s wet, but I think that has more to do with my hair than with the curlformers. I&#x27;ve tried to do it dry, but the hair flies around too much and I can&#x27;t section it properly.) I would also recommend using Proclaim Setting Lotion and investing in a good set of jaw clips to help in sectioning off your hair. They&#x27;re not comfortable to sleep in, but if your event is in the evening, you can do your hair in the morning and let them dry all day. All that said, it&#x27;s very worth it. I love mine and use them twice a week.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product for my Granddaughter.  She tried fixing her hair at night but couldn&#x27;t sleep on the curlers because they kept getting twisted and tangling with each other.  Success in the morning with a blow dryer.  I thought she looked beautiful!</li>
            <li> Great product.  I have super long straight hair and when using a curling iron the curl falls out almost as soon as I hit the door. I add a small amount of product to my wet hair put these in my hair sleep overnight or blowdry and I have beautiful curls to last all day long.  The curlformers are easy to use but do take some getting used to.  Curlformers allow for big curls or tight curls just add as much or as little hair to get the desired curl.  Curlformers are a must have for anyone thats looking for a great curling option that will last more then two minutes  :)  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I purchased the curl formers from Sally Beauty Supply.  I was a little skeptical about them at first, but the sales girl at the store said that they were really popular and they work really well.  She was right.  They work extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed my hair, deep conditioned it and used a setting lotion before applying the curl formers.  I sat under my bonnet dryer for half an hour then went to sleep in the curl formers.  The next morning, I removed the curl formers to find soft, gorgeous, well-defined spirals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will need to purchase one or two more packs to be sure I don&#x27;t run out or have to stuff too much hair into one curler.  I initially purchase 4 of the long and wides which come 6 to a pack.  I have long, thick, curly hair so 2 more packs of 6 should do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just saw on the curl former website that they sell a long, extra wide curler.  I think I&#x27;d like to try those for nice loose curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a perfect product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the curlformers twice, and each time the result was pretty, soft curls. I had to buy a few extra packets to handle all of my hair, plus the short curlformers that came with the salon kit were too short. The only reason I did not give this product five stars is because the curls only last a day, maybe two, for me. Also, it takes a lot of effort to put them in, and you have to be very careful to not rush and damage your hair. But curlformers provide a fun, no-heat way to curl and stretch out your hair. Love the product!</li>
            <li> Okay, i dont own this \\&quot;salon kit\\&quot; but i did buy some packs from sally&#x27;s the other day and they work great!  I put them on at night after I run mousse through my hair, then put them all in a hair cap so i can sleep in them  obviously its not as comfortable as sleeping with nothing in your hair, but these things are made of woven plastic, NO WIRE! which surprised me, so you dont have to worry about deforming them, they are very durable.  Putting them in is relatively easy, though it takes a few tries to get used to the quirks of the hook and formers. But even my first set looked great and stayed curly until i took a shower that night!  I only bought about 16 formers in total (2 packs of 8), and i would recommended buying at least three packs, even though i can get all my hair curled with them, the more hair you have in the hook, the harder it is to pull it through the former.  Also i tried a set during the day and even after waiting 2 hours i didnt get as great results that i got when i slept with them.  a wonderful alternative to rollers, I&#x27;d definitely recommend :]</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful!! I am transitioning from chemically processed hair to natural hair and this is my go to product.  I have curly kinky hair and this product is the best with my new growth and still chemically relaxed hair. You get nice curls.  They last. the curlformers can be aplied close to the root so, no flat iron is needed to tame new growth.  Sleeping on them take some getting used too. They are better than rollers. Curlformers are worth every dime. Having said that I only gave it four stars only because of the price..</li>
            <li> So far I have only used these on my three year old daughter, but I love them already!  My daughter is biracial (half black, half white) and she has extremely curly hair already (3c/4a hair) and we wanted to try these out for a formal hairstyle for a wedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We washed her hair and then I applied a leave in conditioner, moisturizer, and curl cream and separated her hair into about 1 inch sections.  They were extremely easy to use.  I mean they are a little strange just because I have never seen anything like this, but after the first section of hair it was easy peasy.  I did her entire head with these in about 20-30 minutes and the only reason it took that long is because she was being a fidgety little thing.  She did not complain about it pulling her hair or hurting at all.  We kept them in overnight and she had no problem sleeping on them and thought they were really cool looking while they were in her hair.  Taking them out is just as easy as putting them in.  Just straighten the curlformer, pinch the top, and slide it off.  Simple!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her ends were slightly frizzy, but I think that&#x27;s more user error.  I didn&#x27;t put enough curl cream on her ends.  So I am going to try them again and make sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next thing is to try them on my extremely thin, stick straight hair and see how they turn out!</li>
            <li> they take a little practice, but not much.  you can&#x27;t put too much hair in each curler, which means you need at least 20 for your head. they need to be left on over night to dry completely.  they give uniform, perfect curls. my teen said everyone raved over her hair at school (even though straight hair is the \\&quot;in\\&quot; style these days). i love them! worth every penny</li>
            <li> So i saw these and I wanted to try them out. I didn&#x27;t want to wait to order them online so I got mine at a store, but I feel the need to share my thoughts with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have attempted to put them in two times before I am currently wearing them and hoping that they work this time. The first two times I don&#x27;t think I let them sit enough. But I have to tell you something I learned the hard way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you are putting them in, it will go in a lot better if you twist the hair at the head and then feed it through the twist part. You just have to be coordinated with your hands. But this way your hair doesn&#x27;t get tangled and pulls through with ease. At first I just kept trying and I ended up getting tangled and as a result I believe I lost a lot of hair. So be aware to twist to avoid tangles and pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I took them out, after letting them sit for 4.5 hours. Some of them were still damp and didn&#x27;t stay, thank goodness for curling irons. they did turn out to be more like Shirley Temple curls than anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all they are a great product just need to dry longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally found the time to put these in and actually slept with them over night. When I took them out in the morning wow such curl, sadly it was not the curl I was looking for. They literally were Shirley Temple curls. I tried to get them to relax but all that happened was a huge fro and a mess. I am going to leave the rating at a 4 because yes they do work, just not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I bought this product along with the wand to get the hair in the curlformer. My hair is long and medium thick. I bought the longest curlformer there is and my hair stuck out the bottom. First of all, I read the tutorial that came with it, watched various videos on how to do it and I still could not get my hair in the thing without pulling on my skull. It hurt so bad. In the procces, the grey stick broke in half from yanking so hard. After I went through the pain of getting them on my head, I slept with them on. Most uncomfortable night of sleep ever. I woke up, took them out and there were no curls. The end of my hair was frizzy and destroyed. I hate this product, waste of money and waste of time.</li>
            <li> These are so easy to use.  it takes me about 12 minutes, and that is right off the bat, no practice necessary.  The curls are great.&lt;br /&gt;How tight are the curls depends on the dampness before threading the hair.  I can either have it really curly or just wavy with volume.  I pre dry my hair, thread it through,  blow dry for about 3-4 minutes and leave them on for about 10 minutes more. Then I pull them off and comb through with my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;These really are wonderful.  They will probably come down in price once other companies start making them, but for now I think this is the only company.  It is well worth the price.  So many compliments on my hair!!!</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews I didn&#x27;t buy it here, but headed over to local Sally&#x27;s at the suggestion of another reviewer. The price is really not that significantly different I have to say. But once I was there I committed myself to getting it. I have pretty long hair and was concerned to get the right curl-formers to fit my length, since I read that they might be not long enough. My hair is about mid-back length so I ended up not getting the set, but 3 sets of extra-long and wide ones, just to be sure.  And I was right. This length accommodated my length and would work even for a bit longer hair. It&#x27;s pink and orange color ones.&lt;br /&gt;The curlers do produce very nice curls very easily, but at first it&#x27;s tricky. You do have to practice. The very first time, my curls had gaps, because after pulling the hook out the former just didn&#x27;t want to fall back to it&#x27;s original shape. I don&#x27;t know why. Is there a trick to it? Do you have to twist the hook in some way while pulling it out? I will practice more and post an update if I figure a trick.&lt;br /&gt;Sleeping with them is a challenge too. Not comfortable at all. But it&#x27;s optional, so I am not going to go into it.&lt;br /&gt;Curls, however, are very pretty and based on the fact that this type of curl forming doesn&#x27;t involve any chemicals or hair damage, it&#x27;s a great invention for sure.</li>
            <li> Like the rest of you, I was skeptical about spending $70 on rollers. I&#x27;ve always been able to do a pretty good roller set with wire mesh rollers, but what intrigued me was the ability to dry faster because the hair is not wrapped on itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair: 4a/b/c hair (lots of different textures), but texturized. It&#x27;s easy to straighten, but definitely not \\&quot;wash-and-go\\&quot; hair. Shoulder length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I straighten my hair once a week because it&#x27;s the only way to get right to my roots and add a lot of shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Though there is a learning curve, by your second go around you&#x27;ll have the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;- If you pay attention to how you&#x27;re applying the roller, you can push it close to your scalp to grip the root, which will give you straight roots (recommended).&lt;br /&gt;- I was able to use the kit for my whole head, and I have a lot a hair. However, I did use EVERY last roller. For those with longer hair, the \\&quot;short and wide\\&quot; rollers may not be long enough.&lt;br /&gt;- Possible to sleep in&lt;br /&gt;- Quick drying. My hair takes FOREVER to dry...about 1:45 under a hooded dryer on high. These dry for the most part over night, though you may need to do a quick blow dry in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;- Option to sit under the hooded dryer as well&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to put in. Takes between 30-45 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Expensive. Bottom line.&lt;br /&gt;- Only available through Sallys.&lt;br /&gt;- Though you can sleep in them, they&#x27;re relatively uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I say get them. Sallys has a really good return policy and you have 90 days to return. Try them out - you&#x27;ll probably love them. However, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these for people who hate dealing with their hair. It&#x27;s more time consuming than a quick blow dry in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love them though!</li>
            <li> Just have to say that my 4 yr old LOVES the curls from her curlformers.  I do them after the bath when her hair is pretty damp or I use a spray bottle and spray until damp.  It works good if you start at the bottom, use a comb with the long pointy end and section of a little at a time while keeping the rest of the hair tied up in a pony tail.  She sleeps in them.  She said they aren&#x27;t really comfy but it&#x27;s her choice if she wants the curls in before bed.  I&#x27;m not going to do it in the morning (not enough time).  We&#x27;ve only had them for 3 nights and she wanted them in all three (although last night I said no) so we&#x27;re onto our 2nd night.  The spirals are just adorable.  Hers lasted all day.  She has fine hair, natural curl but uneven curl and definitely not natural spirals like these curlformers create.  LOVE!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.  I use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair and I love that it curls without heat.  Great invention!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this product. Something that would allow me to style without heat. It was a little difficult to figure out how to pull my hair through some of the curlers. I left quite a bit of hair behind.&lt;br /&gt;The first day was great. Loved the way it looked. The second day I let humidity get to it before I could style and it fell apart.&lt;br /&gt;I decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the hair loss, the effort each evening, they aren&#x27;t that comfortable to sleep on, and the possibility that they would fall in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is relaxed but still kinky. I might work perfectly on a different style of hair.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like this or not, but after checking out the other positive reviews, I decided to give it a shot...and this is amazing!!!  I have always used 1/2 inch barrel curling irons in the past, but I had to use a TON of hair spray, not to mention that it took forever, and my arm would get really tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this in last night, and decided to give it a try-and I was amazed!  I simply wet my hair, and put in leave in conditioner in it to \\&quot;prepare\\&quot; my hair.  Then, I took the loop thing, and put it on the hook,  then simply pulled my hair through.  It was really easy to use, and I got the hang of it really quick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I woke up this morning, I just pulled all of them out and they were the perfect soft bouncy curls that I have always wanted-and no damage done to my hair!  No, I&#x27;m not paid to say any of this, but ladies-if you want soft, cute spiral curls-I highly recommend it!  I plan on using it on my little sister when I get home-since it is painless and has a super cute outcome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have already gotten tons of compliments today on my hair, and def. plan on using this more and more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Curlformers!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hannah</li>
            <li> I did get the curls but because my hair has been color treated heavily, when I pulled my hair through the tight little curler with that hook, I had a pile of broken hair on the bathroom floor!  Also, not at all comfortable to sleep with.</li>
            <li> I really love curlformers, but unfortunately, they made my hair fall out.  I am african american and i have 3c/4a natural hair. When i used curlformers, i&#x27;d get the best curls and it would last for a long time, my hair looked beautiful and i&#x27;d get compliments. it might have to do w/ the setting lotion i used, i used Lottabody and i diluted it with water in a spray bottle. yes, but i lost a lot of hair, it was noticeable every time i decided to start using my curlformers again.  just beware and maybe see which is a good setting lotion. its too bad because these made great curls, sigh.</li>
            <li> My Hair: pretty thin, straight and shoulder length ... will not curl for anything.  This Product: Curled my hair in PERFECT curls in 2 HOURS! I am literally amazed with how well this product works.  What I did: I washed my hair and threw on a quarter size amount of curl lotion and blow dried my hair until it was about 90% dry. I sectioned my hair in 2 halves (bottom and top) I randomly put these curlformers all along the bottom and then on the top. They were very easy to put in! I watched a video on you tube before I did it just to make sure I was doing it correctly. You basically just slide the hook through the curlformer and then pull your hair through, simple! I did my thing for about 2 hours and then took them out. I could not believe how natural the curls looked!! Especially since I CANNOT get my hair to curl no matter what I do.  I should say I did not actually buy this kit, I purchased the LONG &amp; WIDE pack (containing 8) &amp; LONG &amp; EXTRA WIDE (containing 4) pack at my local Sally Beauty Salon for about $12/each. I think this product is amazing not only because it works, but also because its simple to use. It took me about 10 minutes to put them in and I had perfect curls in 2 hours. I&#x27;m going to try only waiting 1 hour next time and see how that works out. I know some people put these in when their hair is damp/wet but I recommend letting your hair air dry or blow dry it at least 50% to speed up the process. Unless of course you are able to sleep in these things, but I am just not someone who can sleep with anything connected to my head (except an eye mask) or else it interrupts my sleep .... and I CANNOT have that ;)  This product is a great way to get healthy (no heat!) natural looking curls! I definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li> I read every review I could get my hands on before investing $$ on these. Here is my review: I LOVE THEM!! There is a learning curve to them (especially if you don&#x27;t read the directions as you are putting them in), the first one I put in my daugher&#x27;s hair (age 9) pulled her hair. But I then re-read the directions and we were good to go! We sprayed her wet hair with ION anti-frizz solutions Gel Styling Mist (recommended by the Sally Beauty store clerk - also amazing... light-weight, no stickiness, nice hold) . Once you do a few you get the hang of it. I do not understand the reviews that say the curls dont hold.. my daughter has fine, hard-to-keep-a-curl hair and we are at day 2 with a full head of curls. Just use a setting lotion or gel and have wet hair (duh!). Basically, I want to marry these (ok, maybe not, but I love them just the same). Oh! Also, she did sleep in them, it was no more uncomfortable than any other curlers (the key to them not \\&quot;pulling\\&quot; is to make sure they are away from the scalp about an inch so they  have a little bit of room to contract as they dry). If you join Sally Beauty club for $5, you can get these for $5 off .. plus seach for a coupon and you will get them for less. Only wish they were less $$ to begin with!</li>
            <li> There is no need to spend $70 purchasing this salon kit. Go to your local Sally Beauty Supply and you can purchase the hook and two sets of curlformers for less than $30!! This is what I did and much more economical than buying a whole kit that costs $70 is going to have curlers that won&#x27;t even be right for your hair.</li>
            <li> The first time I used these, I really wanted to take them back.  I washed my hair (which is straight and very fine)and put in some mousse, and then attempted to pull my hair through the curlformers.  It got very stuck for every curl and I felt like I was going to yank the hook right through my hair, chopping off the ends.  At first I thought maybe I was trying too much hair, but it would happen no matter what.  I even ended up having to curl half my hair with a curling iron because I used such small pieces I didn&#x27;t have enough curlformers.  Now I have learned to use several smoothing products first (detangler, smoothing cream, and then a light spray gel).  It really does get easier each time you use them.    These really work best when you sleep in them.  They can be used with a blow dryer, but really there is no comparison with the results.  It is too difficult to tell when your hair is dry, even if you blow dry like 4 times and leave them in for 2 hours they still may be damp.  However sleeping in them is extremely uncomfortable.  I ended up getting up at 5am and taking them out, but this actually turned out to be good because the curls had fallen out just enough by the time I woke up.  They feel like I am sleeping on a pillowcase of pipes or tubes, because they hold their shape.    My main complaint is that my curls still frizz, I think because as I pull my hair through the curlformer it rubs the opposite direction of the cuticle and causes all my little whispies to stand up.  However the curls do look amazing and stay in for a very long time.    Bottom line: they take practice, but produce great results if you can tolerate sleeping in them.</li>
            <li> Love the Curlformers!  As a parent, the curlformers are great!  Cut the time of curling hair in half and are really easy to use.  The salon kit also provided enough pieces to do both of my girls&#x27; hair at the same time.  I am able to curl larger pieces which cuts down on time and then separate the curls after the curlforms come out.  They still look awesome!  I do have to say that the girls do complain of them being uncomfortable to sleep in, though.</li>
            <li> Bought as a small gift for my wife, it has been a huge hit. She loves it and highly recommends it. It arrived earlier than advertised and was exactly what it purported to be.</li>
            <li> You have to figure out how to make these work for your type of hair. My hair is 4a/3c and very dense. I found these almost impossible to put in the first time. I learned I had to use less than the recommended out of hair so I purchased two more packs. Also play with products. Setting lotion did nothing for me but conditioner and aloe vera or flaxseed gel was great. For my tight coils running a rattail comb over each section help smooth it out. I absolutely cannot sleep in these things so I sit under the dryer for about 1 hour 45 minutes. Also the short one is the package were too short for my hair but I actually was able to use them back to back!!</li>
            <li> I bought these curlers and played around with them and they look AWESOME! It looks like you used a curling iron, but without the damaging heat irons do to hair. They are only very uncomfortable to sleep in and they pull your hair when they are taken off, but, then again, beauty is pain.</li>
            <li> I got this product for my daughter and she was so excited. She loves the curlers. She is African American and has decided that she was not using anymore straightening products or chemicals on her hair. These curlers have made her natural hair look wonderful.</li>
            <li> All things considered, this is a decent product; it&#x27;s relatively inexpensive, and it sort of gets the job done. It doesn&#x27;t curl nearly as well as my old rollers, though! Because there is no heat, the curls don&#x27;t last the whole day. These are IMPOSSIBLE to sleep in, also. If you want your curls to last, you basically have to use all 40; it&#x27;s like sleeping in the iron maiden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note to Long Haired Girls- DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. The rollers are short; my hair sticks out a good 3 or 4 inches on the ends. This is made for girls with pixie cuts.</li>
            <li> These things are impossible to sleep on! They&#x27;re made of hard plastic and make you feel like you&#x27;re sleeping on twisted barbed wired.  I could only sleep in one position comfortably and woke up with horrible neck and back pain.  Not worth it!  You&#x27;re better off using bobby pins to curl your hair!</li>
            <li> I bought the starter kit from Sally&#x27;s last night and wow! It is by far the easiest way to get perfect spiral curls from root to tip. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments all day today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long (between my shoulder blades when straightened) natural hair (mostly 3A, my texture varies) and even as a wet set it still produced smooth bouncy curls. I did use a setting lotion and sat under the dryer a little before finally sleeping in them, which wasn&#x27;t that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re so much easier to use than traditional plastic rollers but it does take some practice, especially when working the odd spots on your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The starter kit was long enough for my hair although a couple pieces poked out of the end a little. Wasn&#x27;t an issue though, I just pulled down a little further from the root to accommodate or left it alone if it wasn&#x27;t sticking out too much. The 40 rods plus 6 shorts in the kit are plenty if you plan well. I sectioned into fours and tried to be sure 10 was my max for each section. I may pick up another add-on pack just so I won&#x27;t have to keep thinking about how many I have left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of cons, you can&#x27;t really tell when they&#x27;re dry since the hair is inside the roller. So if you&#x27;re doing a wet set, give yourself enough drying time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, OUCH! if you don&#x27;t have the hook just right on your hair it will tangle in already curly hair, so if it gets off as you start to pull it hurts like the dickens! But that gets better with practice. Once you get the technique down, it&#x27;s actually fun! The swoosh snap was like \\&quot;Yay! I got it!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, take care when pulling them out. The little rubber ends are what provides good grip and keeps the roller close to the root, BUT if you just grab and yank, especially when wet, it grabs and yanks your hair too. Learned that lesson after sacrificing a small lock of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT don&#x27;t let that scare you. Just learning curves I won&#x27;t have to repeat and were totally worth the results! LOVE THEM LOVE THEM LOVE THEM!</li>
            <li> I had seen this product in a local beauty supply store over a year ago. I was skeptical as I have tried numerous products in the past to achieve long lasting perfect curls. I waited to read reviews and waiting until my birthday to let someone else buy it for me as I couldn&#x27;t justify spending this much on myself for hair supplies. There are actually more options on the company&#x27;s website and I purchased the extra long &amp; wide set. It arrived in just 2 days!!! I will say that there is a bit of a learning curve to using them and if you&#x27;re not good at doing your own hair already, you&#x27;ll probably just get frustrated. It took about 30 min for me to do my medium thick long hair. I used a setting lotion, blow dried to damp, then let set for 1.5 hours and used a blow dryer to dry. I took them out and had perfect curls - no kinks! They lasted A LOT longer than curls made with a hot iron. I am really impressed and will recommend.   The only reason I gave 4 stars is because of the price and the level of difficulty to put them in. The results are worthy of 5 stars though!!</li>
            <li> These are a lot of fun to use. I do wish they had some that work for longer (below bra strap length) hair though...</li>
            <li> There are not enough bad words to describe the sheer hatred I have for this product.  The instructions and videos make it sound so easy.  It isn&#x27;t.  The next thing I will do with these curlers is set them on fire</li>
            <li> I used these as soon as I got them. They were easy and the curls were amazing.My daughter used them also and had wonderful results. The curls look so natural and stay all day. I highly recommend this kit to all.</li>
            <li> The best way to get perfect tight curls without heat! Putting them in takes practice. My first time using them I kept tugging on my hair trying to pull the hook through then realized I was using too much hair per section. If you don&#x27;t put them in correctly you will have a gap in the curlformer instead of it snapping back to its shape. Opening the curlformer at the scalp while you pull it through will help it go through easier. I use them at night &amp; sleep with them in, which is far from comfortable but in the morning they are dry &amp; my curls are perfect. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the curlformers is the price. At $13 a bag I should have at least 20 instead of 8. I ended up needing 4 bags for my thick hair. Other than that, amazing! Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING to curl my hard to curl, long hair. I decided to try these because nothing else had worked well or lasted long not even hot rollers or \\&quot;sleeping\\&quot; in foam rollers. These are so easy, don&#x27;t hurt and my curls last...for days! My husband couldn&#x27;t believe it! I wash my hair, section it and thread it through the curlformers without any other hair product. Fifteen minutes, twenty tops and I&#x27;m done. Because the tubes are mesh my hair dries really quickly and I don&#x27;t have to sleep in them! I leave them in for a few hours and check one to see if it&#x27;s dry. The first day very curly, day two good curls and bouncy, day three plenty of body. I went to Sally&#x27;s but Amazon had the better deal. Bonus, I don&#x27;t lose a bunch of hair taking these out like with velcro rollers!</li>
            <li> I really like these things. they are kind of fun to put in your hair not a hassle like rollers and barrel curlers etc. Quick swoop and snap motion and voila! Sometimes your hair does get stuck while trying to insert the curlformer, than you have to reverse the stick back thru and try it again. You have to take it in at a specific angle. And I learned that twisting it like a lot of \\&quot;you-tubers\\&quot; suggested only heightens your chance of getting it caught. I used these with dry hair, slight spray with a setting mist, and then insert curlformer. I did however leave it on all night. I DONT SUGGEST DOING THIS, AS THEY ARE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE TO SLEEP IN. I woke up multiple times &#x27;cuz my hair kept getting tugged. I dont know about you but I like my sleep~! perhaps I will try next time with a breif blow dry on a cool setting. My hair was SUPER curly. like Iwas born with curly hair-curly...like taylor swift curly....that I didnt know what to do with it LOL. great product tho...very durible and built to last so definetly worth the investment.</li>
            <li> This was a disappointment!!! My curls lasted no longer than 5 minutes after I ran my fingers through it. I put mouse on my damp hair after I showered and then I kept the rollers on until my hair dried. Do not buy this</li>
            <li> This is the worst pain my 11 year old daughter ever felt....she was crying about it.My 4 year old daughter let me do it half way through and she threw a fit.It makes okay curls.It is super painful so if you have little kids don&#x27;t get it</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my 4 year old cheerleader. We saw all the older girls with them in at her last competition. She kept telling me she wanted them. She has Medium length hair that is poker straight, baby fine and super thin. I was previously using the curling iron on her in the mornings of the competitions to make sure she had perfect and full curls this took me an hour. I tried these and let me say... WE LOVED THEM. They did not hurt her at all  and it took less time than curling. I bought the short and narrow ones for her since she has her hair pulled into a pony tail. She did not flinch once when I pulled them out either. These make her hair look like it was curled with a curling iron. I put them in her hair wet with a little hairspray and they were nice and bouncy. Also she loved moving her head all around with them in to feel them bounce and move in her hair. I am so  happy I tried these. The other girls on her team bought them also to try them out.</li>
            <li> I bought this expensive little set of rollers after contemplating for over a year. I really really wanted to try them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I bought a couple packs and a hook: a long and wide and a extra long and wide. I tried these out on my bangs and decided it would be a great look on my whole head so I sprang for the starter kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first set came out awesome. I used the whole starter pack except for the short curlers PLUS the two packs I bought. I have thick hair but was still surprised it took so many.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lost some curls to frizz after the first shower I took. I retouched those with a curling iron and was back in business. The next shower I took killed the rest of my curls. Kinda disappointed but I think that&#x27;s just how my hair behaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caution: the hook is crap. I broke both of mine trying to take them apart to put them away. Considering the price of these I shouldn&#x27;t have to complain about the quality of the main component. I sure can&#x27;t use the curlers without the hook.</li>
            <li> I have been natural for about a year and a half now and I wanted some versatility with my style that was pretty, heatless, and stretched my hair out well. This is the perfect solution. I love the silky curls that I get with Curlformers and love how close it gets to the roots of my natural 4a hair texture. This is a style that I could definitely invest in for up to a full two weeks wear. My only drawback with the product is in the efficiency of setting the curls. Sometimes, the hair is not set perfectly and when I pull in the rod with the attached hair, I feel it yanking at my hair and since I set my Curlformers on wet hair, I run the risk of breakage through that manipulation. Otherwise, it is a simple process and I think that the more I do it, the faster, more efficient, and routine it will be.  I like the Curlformers so much that, personally, I&#x27;ll forget about the yanking and hope that as I get more experience I&#x27;ll be able to avoid it and someday when my hair grows longer, I&#x27;ll invest in the Extra-Long Curlformers.</li>
            <li> So these rollers are awesome, I ended up getting the salon kit, but I should have gotten the extra long and wide b/c my hair was hanging out of many of the rollers, which could explain my frizzy ends.  Right now it seems like they will last about two days and maybe I can get another one or two days with my hair straight in a bun. I did link two curls together for some of the longer ones (but ran out and couldn&#x27;t do my whole hair) and it worked perfectly.  If you go on the website they suggest people with long hair can put two rollers together.  I am about to cut my hair anyway so I probably wont have that problem for a long time.  However I still think it&#x27;s best to get the EXTRA long and Wide ones if you plan on growing out your hair. I just bought another set, but this time around I went for the extra long. I don&#x27;t think it matters if the rollers are too long, but it does matter if they are too short.  I am African American with natural hair and this I think will prevent me from straightening my hair in the winter. Yes they are pricey I would say worth it, but I don&#x27;t know about the durability.  I see that amazon sells the knock offs on here too, but I was too scared to buy those because I didn&#x27;t know if they were made the same.  I think I will buy the knock offs and compare and revise this review at a later date and speak about how long each last.  But for now, thumbs up for the kit!</li>
            <li> My daughter is growing her hair naturally.  SHe will be going away to college in the fall. These are great tools for natural hair.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old is in competitive cheer and theses worked wonders! I would recommend them to anyone who needs to have their hair curled and who wants the easiest way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I can possibly agree with the reviews that say it&#x27;s painless or super easy. I&#x27;ve got thick hair and this is a pain to do. I recently cut it but when it was long they were impossible. It pulls your hair through a thick plastic piece. There&#x27;s no telling how many hairs I lost trying to yank the hair through the rollers but it felt like quite a few. You can&#x27;t argue with the results because it makes great curls but it pulled a lot of little hairs and was very frustrating to use unless you&#x27;ve got pretty nimble fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;::Update::&lt;br /&gt;They are pretty easy to take out but I&#x27;ve noticed that it didn&#x27;t seem to curl every strand that well. Don&#x27;t put too much hair through a curler because it&#x27;ll give you an awkward wave as opposed to a tight curl. It worked pretty well on the thinner shorter strands of hair but I think I already had to use two packages. In order to get the curl I want I&#x27;d probably have to use three and I&#x27;m just not sure I&#x27;ve got the patience to keep using them. They are also extremely uncomfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li> These curlers are difficult to use at home. There are tricks to it. You MUST twist the hair at the scalp and you must get EVERY hair in the hook while the hook is face UP.. if you fail to have complete control of the hair inside the hook, you will be pulling it out of your head trying to pull it through! You have to be aware of how much hair you grab. If you grab a 2\\&quot;-3\\&quot; chunk of hair for a 1\\&quot; curler? You&#x27;re going to be sorry! These rollers are fabulous! You just have to understand them</li>
            <li> I have been super excited to try these out...I did them on my own hair first and it was SO uncomfortable to sleep in.  I tried them in my 6 year old&#x27;s hair but I had to take them out of her hair because she could not sleep in them.  They made my hair look like it use to when my moom would put sponge curlers in.  They do work though......</li>
            <li> I like them ,yet I don&#x27;t like them. I have naturally curly hair and they work wonderful in creating big , lush curls. I don&#x27;t like that there are short ones in the pack ( about 6 short ones) this required me to buy extra since my hair is not short. The mouth of the tubes wear out easy, I have only done it three times and the grip is weak already.</li>
            <li> The curlformers themselves work fine but the hooks that come with them are IMPOSSIBLE to detach. I pulled so hard on one of them one time that I ended up messing up my back. Hurts soooo bad! I don&#x27;t know if it was just my set of hooks or what but they do not come apart. Can&#x27;t keep them in the bag with the formers because they are too big once together. Why would they make them so hard to detach? Even my husband can&#x27;t undo them.</li>
            <li> A lot of fun to use , and a lovely curl it makes</li>
            <li> I tried to send this back, not because of the product but because the box was ripped open and when I requested a return label, I found out that the seller wanted me to pay for the shipping and handling which adds up to approx. $17.00 so I just put the box on my closet shelf.  I already bought new curly from my neighborhood sallies.</li>
            <li> So, first thing is that these take some practice. You definitely need to stick with small sections of hair. If you don&#x27;t, it the formers won&#x27;t go back into a curl ones you remove the wand. Second, If you have super thick hair like I do you should wait until it has air dried most of the way and THEN put them in. Otherwise you go to take them out and your hair is still close to sopping wet. No bueno.&lt;br /&gt;Third, take care when removing them. Make sure you free your hair from the rubber end before trying to remove. I forgot a couple of times. OUCH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because you need to stick with small sections of hair, get more of these than you think you will need. I ended up buying the salon kit because I bought two packages of the pink and orange ones individually. I only got about 1/3 of the way through my hair with those - and that&#x27;s being generous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, super easy and great end result! I love this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this product from the actual Curlformers website which actually sells it for $10 less.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway aside from the price difference, the product can work as described as long as you keep certain things in mind. Even though it says &amp;#34;for wider curls place a larger section of hair in the curler&amp;#34; but honestly if you put too much hair in, it snags.  Which is REALLY painful.  I found that it worked easier when I used less hair per section.&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that started to irk the heck out of me was that the hook continued to get snagged on the mesh of the curlformer. So here I was trying to pull my hair through and the hook was stuck. VERY frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;Another matter of frustration occurred when I would try to pull the hook out and the hook would come apart leaving my hair tangled in the upper portion. This happened a lot! Eventually I ended up accidentally breaking one hook, and taping up the other to avoid that from happening. This helped a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Other than my issues with the hook, the curls came out adorable. Just make sure you purchase the correct size because when my friend used my long &amp; wide with her looong hair, her ends petruded out leaving them straight while the rest was curled, she needs the extra long ones. The long &amp; wide worked fine for my 2 inches below the shoulder hair...and of course if you have layers you may want to purchase more than one size so you have the proper size for all your layers.&lt;br /&gt;Overall its an awesome product, my only real complaint is with the hook. They definitely need to make it sturdier.</li>
