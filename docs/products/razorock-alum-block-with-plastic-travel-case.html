            <li>Excellent, what more can you say about RazoRock Alum Block.  </li>
            <li>What makes it distinctive for me is the fact that it is of excellent quality and its large size moves it to the excellent value category as well.  </li>
            <li>However the handy case is great for keeping it safe and the size of the block is perfect for applying to my face after shaves.</li>

            <li>It is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Light and great for scrapes and nicks.</li>
            <li>It is amazing at how alum works to eliminate razor burn.</li>
            <li>All the reviews that say it leaves your face, smooth taught and happy are correct.</li>
            <li>Nice locking travel case.  </li>
            <li>Nice sized block.</li>
            <li>I also like the handy travel</li>
            <li>Nice case.</li>
            <li>Effective astringent/stypic.</li>
            <li>travel case is nice, but don&#x27;t keep it in there between uses.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I bought it because it came in a plastic case.</li>
            <li>Good product, love the compact case and over all...</li>
            <li>The case is also nice.</li>
            <li>great product and service a unique combination</li>
            <li>Both have a great fragrance, give a close clean shave.</li>
            <li>Wow, I was really impressed....</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m impressed</li>
            <li>This is a much better quality and the plastic case is nice.</li>
            <li>Great alum block, easy to use and just the right size.</li>
            <li>I find the sting appealing when I slide the block over my cuts.</li>
            <li>make sure you rinse it or wipe it off after the use.</li>
            <li>My face it works better than a styptic pencil and is easier to hold and use.</li>
            <li>Will get many shaves from.</li>
            <li>Very well packaged added a duct tape handle to it and the product works great.</li>
            <li>alum itself is refreshing to use after shaving with my DE razor.  </li>
            <li>I am trying another brand to see if that works better.</li>
            <li>would recommend it for most shaving cuts</li>
            <li>Glad I bought this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Reputable shaving brand</li>
            <li>It also fit nicely into the travel case.</li>
            <li>Love the case that came with the block.</li>
            <li>RazoRock Alum Block does the job just as well and for a much better price.  </li>
            <li>I bought several to see which was the best alum block to stop bleeding cuts and this one is the winner.</li>
            <li>Great price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Great service fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Alum Blocks... :-)</li>
            <li>It stops the bleeding on most nicks and cuts, but a couple times I had to use a styptic pencil in addition to this.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>I love the way it tightens the face after a shave.</li>
            <li>Quite possible the best shaving purchase I&#x27;ve made in years.</li>
            <li>Love this, makes my skin smoother.</li>
            <li>I love cleaning my face with it after a shave.  </li>
            <li>Gives a nice quick burn and keeps my face from getting too oily.  </li>
            <li>product works fine stings when put on but does stop bleeding on most knicks .</li>
            <li>The alum block I originally wanted to order is no longer carried on this site, so this looked to be the next best</li>
            <li>Great for that unexpected nick.  </li>
            <li>My best addition to my wet shaving supplies.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m not in the mood for a scent, I just use this with some Nivea Sensitive Balm, and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li>Very mild sting on legs or face after shave.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommended purchase.</li>
            <li>Nice little alum block at a great price, and the travel case keeps it safe and sound.</li>
            <li>It works just fine....</li>
            <li>I travel a fair bit and the container is realy handy to keep the block secure and dry.</li>
            <li>And my skin felt fantastically smooth after!&lt;br</li>
            <li>the alum goes on smooth, without tingling or stinging</li>
            <li>The price is fantastic for what you get.  </li>
            <li>This alum block started out as a great value and initially, I had no problem giving it a 5 star review.  </li>
            <li>Overall great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>This Alum Block works fantastic.</li>
            <li>Compared to other alum blocks on the market, this was a good value and it came with a nice protective case.  </li>
            <li>I have been wet shaving now for many months and it is an amazing experience!</li>
            <li>Purchased in the past, good product, good Company.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth, cool, a not on fire....</li>
            <li>However; after the first use and times there after...you will wonder why it took this many years.</li>
            <li>Also a great way to keep a grip on a wet face</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s true for every alum block.</li>
            <li>While I have been getting a good shave with my DE razor and Italian shave cream, my after shave balm just didn&#x27;t fully help my face recover from the irritation.</li>
            <li>I never did think this would be a use full item,So I put off buying one for years.</li>
            <li>The product was sent via USPS shipping free but was worth</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it should do, helps close up your facial pores after shaving irration and comes in a nice box suitable for travel.</li>
            <li>Good case and solid alum block.</li>
            <li>Fast forward one more month after that and crystalline holes quickly began to develop in it overnight.  </li>
            <li>Great addition to my wet shaving experience!</li>
            <li>This was the best deal offered as it is larger in size and the lowest cost of all the same offerings.</li>
            <li>Most alum blocks are just loose and this has a nice handy dandy case to go back into.</li>
            <li>DE razor for the first time in 50 years!</li>
            <li>Great little product.</li>
            <li>it will STING LIKE A MOFO if you have some little cuts LOL</li>
            <li>but it comes in a great little plastic container.  </li>
            <li>Razorock block works very well after a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>OK, I was reluctant to purchase this, since I was old fashioned and like the splash liquid (Aftershave).</li>
            <li>wow, cooling, all rashes, nicks, cuts are no longer bleeding or irritating, but the most impressive thing about this alum block is, I o longer use a post shave lotion.</li>
            <li>The travel size has the handy holding part, but otherwise, the same alum.</li>
            <li>I prefer the cream for traveling, only because it fit in my luggage better.</li>
            <li>It broke apart and crumbled...not useful any longer.</li>
            <li>In the future, I&#x27;ll stick with Bloc Osma for alum and RazoRock for their incredible shaving soaps which I can&#x27;t recommend highly enough.</li>
            <li>and that handy case it comes in is such a plus!</li>
            <li>Nice solid piece of Alum .</li>
            <li>was right in thinking</li>
            <li>The price is just right</li>
            <li>I put a small dab in my palm and use my brush (Badger) to whip up  a great lather.</li>
            <li>The first was a Major label and for lots more money.  </li>
            <li>In addition to the Alum block it comes with a handy travel case so you can dry it off and place it in the case and leave it.</li>
            <li>Like all the other razorock product, they seem to be the best at delivering high quality and low prices.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using Alum Block.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it suppose to.&lt;br /&gt;Tells you where you went too close to skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter if you are using a straight razor or a de safety razor YOU NEED THIS!</li>
            <li>Honestly, this is an alum block for use after wet shaving.  </li>
            <li>is my first alum block</li>
            <li>This is my first experience using alum.</li>
            <li>I used it once after a cartridge shave, and now with my first DE razor (Feather AS-D2).</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and a tough beard, so even on the best shave, I&#x27;ll have some level of irritation.</li>
            <li>Keeps my face looking clean, clear, and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>I find that using the dry block with a wet face is more effective now.</li>
            <li>but it is such good quality that this one should last me quite a while.</li>
            <li>An Alum Block is pretty much an Alum Block</li>
            <li>had ordered the RazoRock Alum Block that looks like a large chap-stick for my husband and son and they both like that</li>
            <li>Cracks and fairly large air bubbles became visible under the surface.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad this is out there, especially since I am new to DE.</li>
            <li>I have used similar products with much success and this one will go to my son and be replaced in my shaving supplies quickly.</li>
            <li>Delivered fast.</li>
            <li>Does its job, reasonably priced, plastic case.</li>
            <li>Wrapped very well.  </li>
            <li>The plastic travel case is very convenient.  </li>
            <li>it works very well.</li>
            <li>Yes it stings but that is the whole point of using Alum Block.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Ever since then it started degrading REALLY</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>The plastic case is very helpful also and</li>
            <li>For me, that is about as much of a rave review that an item like his could receive.</li>
            <li>I really like the travel case to store it in.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this RAZOROCK Alum block!</li>
            <li>Thanks  Ray</li>
            <li>, you can really feel if you have shaved an area to close.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is a must for those who like to shave with safety razors or straight razors.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think much of this product.</li>
            <li>This particular block was the best price per unit weight, and it arrived VERY quickly with just the standard shipping (only a few days later).</li>
            <li>Good solid product shouldn&#x27;t fall apart like other brands.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper in price and more product than the other brands.</li>
            <li>Sharp, fractured shards would scratch my face after a 3 pass shave as more chunks would crumble off into the sink with each use.  </li>
            <li>I had originally used a different brand, but the travel case keeps the alum from crystallizing in the medicine cabinet...</li>
            <li>The quality seemed every bit as good as other brands for a fraction of the price, it&#x27;s several times larger than most and the travel case that comes with is very solid.  </li>
            <li>: When you first take it out of the box hold it under running water and rub your hands on it to smooth out any sharp edges it may have.</li>
            <li>It effectively eliminates small cuts and razor burn.  </li>
            <li>This is a larger block than the RazoRock travel size, and that one has lasted more than a year for me with daily use</li>
            <li>The main reason I selected this product was for the case, I didn&#x27;t want to have my alum just sitting out in the open.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wet shaving is one of those things that people have strong opinions regarding THEIR blade...cream.....</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality alum block at a value price.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Great deal for high quality alum.</li>
            <li>If I had known about the awesomeness of shaving alum when I first started shaving I would have been saved a lot of discomfort and embarrassment caused by severe razor burn followed by a major breakout.</li>
            <li>well worth it when you figure you can pay this same price or a little more for one without a plastic case.  </li>
            <li>This block worked well for about two months, then a hole developed and the whole block started to disintegrate.</li>
            <li>A few weeks more</li>
            <li>This unit, with the rounded edges is much smoother and appears more solid than my other brand.</li>
            <li>Potassium alum is the professional barber way to finish a shave, I highly recommend the razorock alum block with the travel case and I highly recommend razorock as a brand.  </li>
            <li>if you shave with a new safety razor you should try it&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am new to DE shaving.  </li>
            <li>If this hole hadn&#x27;t developed, I expect it would have lasted a few more months.</li>
            <li>This definitely tightens my skin after a shave and is best used after rinsing with cold water.</li>
            <li>Some blocks are tiny (like 45 grams tiny), but this one is a full size 90 grams.  </li>
            <li>No more itching with bumps on the neck and sides of the mouth were I am most sensitive.</li>
            <li>Leaves a slight unique tingling sensation on your face, but feels one you get use to it.</li>
            <li>Does what it is supposed to do, reduces the bleeding after the inevitable wiggle of the straight razor.</li>
            <li>At 56 years old, I have been shaving for 40 years.</li>
            <li>Still lasting much longer than a Bloc Asma brand block.</li>
            <li>I love the Green And the Red.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s big enough to hold on to, the edges are nice and round</li>
            <li>The size and the price should sell the RazoRock all by itself but they don&#x27;t stop there, the block comes with a cool little travel case.</li>
            <li>I use it daily and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I used the RazoRock Alum Block as my first attempt at blocking after a DE wet shave.</li>
            <li>first I kept it in the case but that seemed age it prematurely (made it rough)</li>
            <li>does cause a bit of a sting on your face when you first apply it because of the raw skin created from close shaving, but it goes away fast.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other alum blocks and paid more for less.</li>
            <li>Works very well after a shave to close up any very minor razor cuts or let you know where you may have room for improvement in your technique.  </li>
            <li>Usually alum block will last me a entire year or more.</li>
            <li>and it was barely usable.</li>
            <li>(I think that stops the center from dissolving as fast).</li>
            <li>I took up traditional wet shaving 6 weeks or so ago, and I didn&#x27;t have the alum block for the first couple of shaves.</li>
            <li>I make sure to dry it with a towel after use, and have a few layers of paper towel at the bottom (and leave the case open on my shelf) to let any extra moisture evaporate from the bar to prevent it from falling apart.</li>
            <li>Obviously dry it a little prior to storage in the plastic case and you&#x27;ll have a wonderfully smooth block of alum for your shaves.</li>
            <li>I rubbed my face with it the first time I used my DE razor trying to stop all the little nicks</li>
            <li>I had one small nick and it stopped the bleeding right away.</li>
            <li>After about a month a whole half of the block basically dissolved in my hand - it just turned to dust.</li>
            <li>Which crumbled, I ended up throwing out the rest of the block because due to its new size it was unusable.  </li>

            <li> Excellent, what more can you say about RazoRock Alum Block.  </li>
            <li> What makes it distinctive for me is the fact that it is of excellent quality and its large size moves it to the excellent value category as well.  </li>
            <li> However the handy case is great for keeping it safe and the size of the block is perfect for applying to my face after shaves.</li>
            <li> It is not designed to hold up, but on the bright side, now I have about 50 &amp;#34;Travel-Size&amp;#34;</li>

            <li> Good value, good packaging, block is nice size &amp; form.</li>
            <li> looked at many alum blocks but for the money and with the plastic case GREAT VALUE!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the Alum block and its post shave qualities.</li>
            <li> but this has a nice case for travel and a good shape.</li>
            <li> Love the way it stops the bleeding!  </li>
            <li> Glad I got this one!</li>
            <li> It is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Light and great for scrapes and nicks.</li>
            <li> It is amazing at how alum works to eliminate razor burn.</li>
            <li> All the reviews that say it leaves your face, smooth taught and happy are correct.</li>
            <li> Nice locking travel case.  </li>
            <li> Nice sized block.</li>
            <li> I also like the handy travel</li>
            <li> Nice case.</li>
            <li> Effective astringent/stypic.</li>
            <li> travel case is nice, but don&#x27;t keep it in there between uses.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I bought it because it came in a plastic case.</li>
            <li> Good product, love the compact case and over all...</li>
            <li> The case is also nice.</li>
            <li> great product and service a unique combination</li>
            <li> Both have a great fragrance, give a close clean shave.</li>
            <li> Wow, I was really impressed....</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m impressed</li>
            <li> This is a much better quality and the plastic case is nice.</li>
            <li> Great alum block, easy to use and just the right size.</li>
            <li> I find the sting appealing when I slide the block over my cuts.</li>
            <li> make sure you rinse it or wipe it off after the use.</li>
            <li> My face it works better than a styptic pencil and is easier to hold and use.</li>
            <li> Will get many shaves from.</li>
            <li> Very well packaged added a duct tape handle to it and the product works great.</li>
            <li> alum itself is refreshing to use after shaving with my DE razor.  </li>
            <li> I am trying another brand to see if that works better.</li>
            <li> would recommend it for most shaving cuts</li>
            <li> Glad I bought this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Reputable shaving brand</li>
            <li> It also fit nicely into the travel case.</li>
            <li> Love the case that came with the block.</li>
            <li> RazoRock Alum Block does the job just as well and for a much better price.  </li>
            <li> I bought several to see which was the best alum block to stop bleeding cuts and this one is the winner.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Great service fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Alum Blocks... :-)</li>
            <li> It stops the bleeding on most nicks and cuts, but a couple times I had to use a styptic pencil in addition to this.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> I love the way it tightens the face after a shave.</li>
            <li> Quite possible the best shaving purchase I&#x27;ve made in years.</li>
            <li> Love this, makes my skin smoother.</li>
            <li> I love cleaning my face with it after a shave.  </li>
            <li> Gives a nice quick burn and keeps my face from getting too oily.  </li>
            <li> product works fine stings when put on but does stop bleeding on most knicks .</li>
            <li> The alum block I originally wanted to order is no longer carried on this site, so this looked to be the next best</li>
            <li> Great for that unexpected nick.  </li>
            <li> My best addition to my wet shaving supplies.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m not in the mood for a scent, I just use this with some Nivea Sensitive Balm, and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li> Very mild sting on legs or face after shave.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommended purchase.</li>
            <li> Nice little alum block at a great price, and the travel case keeps it safe and sound.</li>
            <li> It works just fine....</li>
            <li> I travel a fair bit and the container is realy handy to keep the block secure and dry.</li>
            <li> And my skin felt fantastically smooth after!&lt;br</li>
            <li> the alum goes on smooth, without tingling or stinging</li>
            <li> The price is fantastic for what you get.  </li>
            <li> This alum block started out as a great value and initially, I had no problem giving it a 5 star review.  </li>
            <li> Overall great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> This Alum Block works fantastic.</li>
            <li> Compared to other alum blocks on the market, this was a good value and it came with a nice protective case.  </li>
            <li> I have been wet shaving now for many months and it is an amazing experience!</li>
            <li> Purchased in the past, good product, good Company.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth, cool, a not on fire....</li>
            <li> However; after the first use and times there after...you will wonder why it took this many years.</li>
            <li> Also a great way to keep a grip on a wet face</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s true for every alum block.</li>
            <li> While I have been getting a good shave with my DE razor and Italian shave cream, my after shave balm just didn&#x27;t fully help my face recover from the irritation.</li>
            <li> I never did think this would be a use full item,So I put off buying one for years.</li>
            <li> The product was sent via USPS shipping free but was worth</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it should do, helps close up your facial pores after shaving irration and comes in a nice box suitable for travel.</li>
            <li> Good case and solid alum block.</li>
            <li> Fast forward one more month after that and crystalline holes quickly began to develop in it overnight.  </li>
            <li> Great addition to my wet shaving experience!</li>
            <li> This was the best deal offered as it is larger in size and the lowest cost of all the same offerings.</li>
            <li> Most alum blocks are just loose and this has a nice handy dandy case to go back into.</li>
            <li> DE razor for the first time in 50 years!</li>
            <li> Great little product.</li>
            <li> it will STING LIKE A MOFO if you have some little cuts LOL</li>
            <li> but it comes in a great little plastic container.  </li>
            <li> Razorock block works very well after a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> OK, I was reluctant to purchase this, since I was old fashioned and like the splash liquid (Aftershave).</li>
            <li> wow, cooling, all rashes, nicks, cuts are no longer bleeding or irritating, but the most impressive thing about this alum block is, I o longer use a post shave lotion.</li>
            <li> The travel size has the handy holding part, but otherwise, the same alum.</li>
            <li> I prefer the cream for traveling, only because it fit in my luggage better.</li>
            <li> It broke apart and crumbled...not useful any longer.</li>
            <li> In the future, I&#x27;ll stick with Bloc Osma for alum and RazoRock for their incredible shaving soaps which I can&#x27;t recommend highly enough.</li>
            <li> and that handy case it comes in is such a plus!</li>
            <li> Nice solid piece of Alum .</li>
            <li> was right in thinking</li>
            <li> The price is just right</li>
            <li> I put a small dab in my palm and use my brush (Badger) to whip up  a great lather.</li>
            <li> The first was a Major label and for lots more money.  </li>
            <li> In addition to the Alum block it comes with a handy travel case so you can dry it off and place it in the case and leave it.</li>
            <li> Like all the other razorock product, they seem to be the best at delivering high quality and low prices.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time using Alum Block.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it suppose to.&lt;br /&gt;Tells you where you went too close to skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter if you are using a straight razor or a de safety razor YOU NEED THIS!</li>
            <li> Honestly, this is an alum block for use after wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> is my first alum block</li>
            <li> This is my first experience using alum.</li>
            <li> I used it once after a cartridge shave, and now with my first DE razor (Feather AS-D2).</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and a tough beard, so even on the best shave, I&#x27;ll have some level of irritation.</li>
            <li> Keeps my face looking clean, clear, and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> I find that using the dry block with a wet face is more effective now.</li>
            <li> but it is such good quality that this one should last me quite a while.</li>
            <li> An Alum Block is pretty much an Alum Block</li>
            <li> had ordered the RazoRock Alum Block that looks like a large chap-stick for my husband and son and they both like that</li>
            <li> Cracks and fairly large air bubbles became visible under the surface.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad this is out there, especially since I am new to DE.</li>
            <li> I have used similar products with much success and this one will go to my son and be replaced in my shaving supplies quickly.</li>
            <li> Delivered fast.</li>
            <li> Does its job, reasonably priced, plastic case.</li>
            <li> Wrapped very well.  </li>
            <li> The plastic travel case is very convenient.  </li>
            <li> it works very well.</li>
            <li> Yes it stings but that is the whole point of using Alum Block.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Ever since then it started degrading REALLY</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> The plastic case is very helpful also and</li>
            <li> For me, that is about as much of a rave review that an item like his could receive.</li>
            <li> I really like the travel case to store it in.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this RAZOROCK Alum block!</li>
            <li> Thanks  Ray</li>
            <li> , you can really feel if you have shaved an area to close.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is a must for those who like to shave with safety razors or straight razors.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think much of this product.</li>
            <li> This particular block was the best price per unit weight, and it arrived VERY quickly with just the standard shipping (only a few days later).</li>
            <li> Good solid product shouldn&#x27;t fall apart like other brands.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper in price and more product than the other brands.</li>
            <li> Sharp, fractured shards would scratch my face after a 3 pass shave as more chunks would crumble off into the sink with each use.  </li>
            <li> I had originally used a different brand, but the travel case keeps the alum from crystallizing in the medicine cabinet...</li>
            <li> The quality seemed every bit as good as other brands for a fraction of the price, it&#x27;s several times larger than most and the travel case that comes with is very solid.  </li>
            <li> : When you first take it out of the box hold it under running water and rub your hands on it to smooth out any sharp edges it may have.</li>
            <li> It effectively eliminates small cuts and razor burn.  </li>
            <li> This is a larger block than the RazoRock travel size, and that one has lasted more than a year for me with daily use</li>
            <li> The main reason I selected this product was for the case, I didn&#x27;t want to have my alum just sitting out in the open.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wet shaving is one of those things that people have strong opinions regarding THEIR blade...cream.....</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality alum block at a value price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Great deal for high quality alum.</li>
            <li> If I had known about the awesomeness of shaving alum when I first started shaving I would have been saved a lot of discomfort and embarrassment caused by severe razor burn followed by a major breakout.</li>
            <li> well worth it when you figure you can pay this same price or a little more for one without a plastic case.  </li>
            <li> This block worked well for about two months, then a hole developed and the whole block started to disintegrate.</li>
            <li> A few weeks more</li>
            <li> This unit, with the rounded edges is much smoother and appears more solid than my other brand.</li>
            <li> Potassium alum is the professional barber way to finish a shave, I highly recommend the razorock alum block with the travel case and I highly recommend razorock as a brand.  </li>
            <li> if you shave with a new safety razor you should try it&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am new to DE shaving.  </li>
            <li> If this hole hadn&#x27;t developed, I expect it would have lasted a few more months.</li>
            <li> This definitely tightens my skin after a shave and is best used after rinsing with cold water.</li>
            <li> Some blocks are tiny (like 45 grams tiny), but this one is a full size 90 grams.  </li>
            <li> No more itching with bumps on the neck and sides of the mouth were I am most sensitive.</li>
            <li> Leaves a slight unique tingling sensation on your face, but feels one you get use to it.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do, reduces the bleeding after the inevitable wiggle of the straight razor.</li>
            <li> At 56 years old, I have been shaving for 40 years.</li>
            <li> Still lasting much longer than a Bloc Asma brand block.</li>
            <li> I love the Green And the Red.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big enough to hold on to, the edges are nice and round</li>
            <li> The size and the price should sell the RazoRock all by itself but they don&#x27;t stop there, the block comes with a cool little travel case.</li>
            <li> I use it daily and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I used the RazoRock Alum Block as my first attempt at blocking after a DE wet shave.</li>
            <li> first I kept it in the case but that seemed age it prematurely (made it rough)</li>
            <li> does cause a bit of a sting on your face when you first apply it because of the raw skin created from close shaving, but it goes away fast.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other alum blocks and paid more for less.</li>
            <li> Works very well after a shave to close up any very minor razor cuts or let you know where you may have room for improvement in your technique.  </li>
            <li> Usually alum block will last me a entire year or more.</li>
            <li> and it was barely usable.</li>
            <li> (I think that stops the center from dissolving as fast).</li>
            <li> I took up traditional wet shaving 6 weeks or so ago, and I didn&#x27;t have the alum block for the first couple of shaves.</li>
            <li> I make sure to dry it with a towel after use, and have a few layers of paper towel at the bottom (and leave the case open on my shelf) to let any extra moisture evaporate from the bar to prevent it from falling apart.</li>
            <li> Obviously dry it a little prior to storage in the plastic case and you&#x27;ll have a wonderfully smooth block of alum for your shaves.</li>
            <li> I rubbed my face with it the first time I used my DE razor trying to stop all the little nicks</li>
            <li> I had one small nick and it stopped the bleeding right away.</li>
            <li> After about a month a whole half of the block basically dissolved in my hand - it just turned to dust.</li>
            <li> Which crumbled, I ended up throwing out the rest of the block because due to its new size it was unusable.  </li>
            <li> As the block started to wear down, the inner core became exposed; the result was that the core was more crystalline than I expected, and it became a very messy experience.</li>
            <li> I have tried other soaps and creams, but my personal choice so far will always  be Proraso.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have gotten in the habit over the years to lay my styptic pencil flat on my face after shaving.</li>
            <li> It lasts long and price per pound there is no equal in cost.</li>
            <li> This should last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> If you buy this product, take extra care to keep it dry.</li>
            <li> But this one comes with a convenient case for travel to pop it into the toilet kit.  </li>
            <li> It works well to stop most bleeding or at least slow it drastically.</li>
            <li> This block soothed the burn, and sealed off a minor nick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who has made the switch to traditional wet shaving, and everyone should make that switch.</li>
            <li> , 2 stops any minor irritation I get on my chin and neck.</li>
            <li> Must have accessory for a proper wet shave.</li>
            <li> If you wet shave you need to only try it one time and you will never shave with out it.</li>
            <li> Only thing is i think i should have got the stick because i dropped it and it chipped about 1/6 of the block from the edge.. not a problem though because i just got it wet and sanded it.</li>
            <li> As the outer solid block began to melt away with use, it exposed a very loosely pack crystalline core.  </li>
            <li> I expected a solid alum block all the way through.  </li>
            <li> But it does everything I expected it to and at a low price.</li>
            <li> I will go back to the Bloc Osma Alum Block, which when it wears down it remains a solid piece of Alum.</li>
            <li> Rinse your face after shaving while your face is still wet rub on shaved area rinse block off dry and put back in container rinse face off and pat dry and apply after shave or balm.</li>
            <li> Same as every other alum block.</li>
            <li> If you are use to the small pencil then it might take a little getting use to it when you first see it.</li>
            <li> and I could only shave every other day.  </li>
            <li> /close the pores and let my face air dry.</li>
            <li> Keeps it dry and protected.</li>
            <li> I glide it over my face and neck and allow it to dry.</li>
            <li> One suggestion though... make you dry the alum before putting it in the case or the lifespan will be reduced.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my face like alcohol aftershaves do over time.</li>
            <li> I will not live without this one....</li>
            <li> It should sooth and heal any minor nicks or cuts and a block half this size should last for years.  </li>
            <li> Asked my dermatologist about it, and he said there are no secondary negative effects, people been using it for centuries.</li>
            <li> It has completely taken care of the razor burn and any small nick that I might have.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a solid piece or made from compressed pieces because it dissolved unevenly in the center and ultimately broke into two pieces.  </li>
            <li> served no purpose because items were loose inside the box.</li>
            <li> The other small pieces were pretty much wasted.</li>
            <li> and although it was half the size, it proved to be twice the quality as it lasted for several years without any issues.</li>
            <li> I never really had much of a post shave routine before, I usually just did a hot rinse followed by a cold rinse to open</li>
            <li> Has a slight sting nothing to bad makes your face feel alot better after does not leave white residue or have any scent.</li>
            <li> Unwrapped the alum block from the plastic in the case to find large pieces were broken off.  </li>
            <li> and I still have a little left.</li>
            <li> Dropped on the counter bad broke in many pieces</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to the Osma brand alum, which lasted a whole year until I carelessly dropped it on the tile</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> However, this is definitely the missing piece in my shaving regimen.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s all I expected</li>
            <li> With wet shaving, alum is a must.</li>
            <li> A must have for wet shavers.</li>
            <li> It is now rough as sandpaper and unusable.</li>
            <li> I suspect it remained wet after usage and the water may have caused the hole to develop.</li>
            <li> the extra few days wait.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an alum block so not much to say there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been careful with the product, drying it and storing it in the case after each use.</li>
            <li> Arrived in one piece which is a problem from the last few that I have ordered.  </li>
            <li> Used for wet shaving, works as an alum block should.</li>
            <li> This item arrived three days ago, well before expected.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to everyone who is wet shaving.</li>
            <li> Not a strong burn, but enough to let you know.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 4-5 times/week for over 7 months over my entire face after each shave, and there&#x27;s still at least 1/2 the block remaining, so it lasts long.  </li>
            <li> I use cold water on my face first, then i took the bar and ran it through the running cold water a few times and applied it right on my face and neck!!!</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m tempted to try some of the brand&#x27;s other products.</li>
            <li> Works like every other alum block and lasts longer.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;the size as the other brand.  </li>
            <li> There is no comparison to other alum blocks .</li>
            <li> They seem to produce a quality product that was not in pieces like some other alum companies.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s continuing to disintegrate causing it to have very rough spots.  </li>
            <li> I think it never fully dried even though i wiped it on a dry towel before storing.  </li>
            <li> I felt the little tingling and kept rubbing it on, wow are you serious???</li>
            <li> Not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I started wet shaving a few weeks ago after years of using an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> I just dont know what to do when the rock breaks down</li>
            <li> I now store it on my razor/brush stand (mine has a shelf to it) and no more issues since it can air dry fully.    </li>
            <li> what that black thing.</li>
            <li> and it broke in half.  </li>
            <li> I have been reading and exploring the shaving subject.  </li>
            <li> I now have about half of the block that is still useable.</li>
            <li> I do a hot water rinse, cold water rinse, then I take the alum block</li>
            <li> After shaving, I rinse with hot water and rub the razorock on my face, then I rinse with cold water and do it again.  </li>
            <li> The small sharp edges will hurt like hell if you rub them on your face instead of knocking them down with you hands.</li>
            <li> when holding the skin tight is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Block powders a little in transit</li>
            <li> Other brands sell you a small square that chips and falls apart BUT</li>
            <li> Comes is a neat little travel case.  </li>
            <li> where did you get a little too close, or not close enough.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> The plastic travel case was broken and the alun block pulverized the plastic bubble inside de big (1x6) box</li>
            <li> even though I dried it with a towel after each use.  </li>
            <li> This alum block works as it should - soothing irritated skin, closing small weepers, and improving your shaving technique by revealing areas on your face that may have been scraped up</li>
            <li> No burning and the three small weepers quit bleeding immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> No more fuzzy blocks with chips or breaks.</li>
            <li> Smells horrible as a deodorant- better off without anything</li>
            <li> Not much more to say.</li>
            <li> The alum bar that this one is replacing has the sharp corners and sides of a brick and, as the bar melts with use, those edges can be irritating.</li>
            <li> As an aftershave astringent it worked well until it broke in half, the sharp edges from the break make it difficult to use on my face.</li>
            <li> Old school method for dealing with annoying nicks &amp; cuts from wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> I mean.. its alum..</li>
            <li> , cold water runs over it, then I rub it on my wet face for 60 seconds, I leave it on while I rinse my omega boar hair shaving cream brush, about 60 seconds</li>
            <li> For those of you on the fence, the way to use this is to rub it over the shaved areas while your face is still wet after rinsing off shaving cream, leave it on for 30-60 seconds, &amp; then rinse off with cold water.  </li>
            <li> Only slightly disappointed.</li>
            <li> SuPerb....sssshh it&#x27;s a secret.</li>
            <li> I was wrong, issues slowed not stopped.</li>
            <li> , then I cold water rinse the alum off my face..</li>
            <li> I ran it under cold water and rubbed it on my legs after shaving with&lt;br</li>
            <li> It burns like crazy, but does the trick for nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> I run mine under cold water while the sink is draining and use it</li>
            <li> This closes your pores close from the combination of alum &amp; from the cold water.  </li>
            <li> Cold rinse after shave, then rub alum block all over face.</li>
            <li> Then cold rinse face again.  </li>
            <li> Its freaking scary!</li>
            <li> Buy it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> Horrible!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Lasted about a year. And the case can be reused with the next Alum Block (if that one doesn&#x27;t already have a case...).</li>
            <li> Same as every other alum block. Don&#x27;t drop it, or it will break. But that&#x27;s true for every alum block. Works as expected.</li>
            <li> I started using this product after getting ingrown hair after shaving. This product cleared up my skin and haven&#x27;t had an ingrown hair since. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> good post shave treatment before aftershave balm</li>
            <li> OK, I was reluctant to purchase this, since I was old fashioned and like the splash liquid (Aftershave). So I went ahead and branched out and tried this RazoRock! Wow, I was really impressed....It actually performed like it said it would! I felt the little tingling and kept rubbing it on, wow are you serious??? I rubbed my face with it the first time I used my DE razor trying to stop all the little nicks.... I use cold water on my face first, then i took the bar and ran it through the running cold water a few times and applied it right on my face and neck!!! I will not live without this one.... I&#x27;m glad this is out there, especially since I am new to DE. (I also use this when I use my regular razor as well.)</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Delivered fast. No experience w/anything  else, but works well &amp;has held up for a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do, reduces the bleeding after the inevitable wiggle of the straight razor. I turn to it once or twice a month (that is when I know I need to re-hone my razor).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used an alum block before, so I can&#x27;t compare this product to others. However, this is definitely the missing piece in my shaving regimen. I have very sensitive skin, and a tough beard, so even on the best shave, I&#x27;ll have some level of irritation. This block soothed the burn, and sealed off a minor nick. And my skin felt fantastically smooth after!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine shaving without it, now.</li>
            <li> At 56 years old, I have been shaving for 40 years. Let me say that after shaving with a double edge razor, 3 passes, north to south, south to Roth then east to west I do a hot water rinse, cold water rinse, then I take the alum block, cold water runs over it, then I rub it on my wet face for 60 seconds, I leave it on while I rinse my omega boar hair shaving cream brush, about 60 seconds, then I cold water rinse the alum off my face..wow, cooling, all rashes, nicks, cuts are no longer bleeding or irritating, but the most impressive thing about this alum block is, I o longer use a post shave lotion. My skin feels smooth, cool, a not on fire....I like this product...a lot</li>
            <li> Shipped quick and works great!</li>
            <li> This alum block works as it should - soothing irritated skin, closing small weepers, and improving your shaving technique by revealing areas on your face that may have been scraped up a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the alum goes on smooth, without tingling or stinging, that means you have shaved your face well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered mine on a Friday night, and it was in my shave den by Tuesday afternoon using regular USPS delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who has made the switch to traditional wet shaving, and everyone should make that switch.</li>
            <li> One block arrived chipped, but still usable. Only slightly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great product. Good price.Will last a very long time. If you have not used an alum block give it a try.</li>
            <li> Great alum block, easy to use and just the right size.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price. Works as underarm and foot deodorant, bacteria just doesn&#x27;t grow. Asked my dermatologist about it, and he said there are no secondary negative effects, people been using it for centuries. Ladies watch out, use under arms after shaving stings like hell. Very mild sting on legs or face after shave. Good for guys or gals.</li>
            <li> Defective packaging. The plastic travel case was broken and the alun block pulverized the plastic bubble inside de big (1x6) box served no purpose because items were loose inside the box. So dissapointed that no future purchases will be placed by me.</li>
            <li> Does its job, reasonably priced, plastic case. That&#x27;s all I expected and it&#x27;s what I got.</li>
            <li> Great block.  Good size.  Wrapped very well.  Nice locking travel case.  I will buy this again but it is such good quality that this one should last me quite a while.</li>
            <li> Nice sized block. Plastic case is a bonus. Tightens and tones skin. Let&#x27;s you know where you need to improve on your shaving technique.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice and quality alum block.  The price is fantastic for what you get.  The plastic travel case is very convenient.  Works very well after a shave to close up any very minor razor cuts or let you know where you may have room for improvement in your technique.  I will keep this on hand from now on.</li>
            <li> Does it do anything?  I guess it works but I can&#x27;t tell.  I guess it&#x27;s like the undercoating on a car.</li>
            <li> A great block does its intended job well and even a great value !</li>
            <li> Great little product. Be warned... it will STING LIKE A MOFO if you have some little cuts LOL</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an Alum block. You rub it on your face after shaving as an astringent and to help tighten up your skin after the abuse it has just taken during the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: When you first take it out of the box hold it under running water and rub your hands on it to smooth out any sharp edges it may have. The small sharp edges will hurt like hell if you rub them on your face instead of knocking them down with you hands.</li>
            <li> Works great and a great price. However, I&#x27;d give this 3.5 stars because the block is starting to chip after 10 uses. I moisten the block under running water. I find that using the dry block with a wet face is more effective now.</li>
            <li> Old school method for dealing with annoying nicks &amp; cuts from wet shaving.  Also a great way to keep a grip on a wet face when holding the skin tight is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and you can use it as an antiperspirant in a pinch as well.</li>
            <li> The alum block I originally wanted to order is no longer carried on this site, so this looked to be the next best thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does what it advertises, stops bleeding and heals cuts. I find the sting appealing when I slide the block over my cuts.</li>
            <li> The RazoRock Alum Block with Plastic Case is just what I needed for the pesky weepers&lt;br /&gt;one gets from shaving. I ran it under cold water and rubbed it on my legs after shaving with&lt;br /&gt;a DE razor for the first time in 50 years! No burning and the three small weepers quit bleeding immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I had ordered the RazoRock Alum Block that looks like a large chap-stick for my husband and son and they both like that size.&lt;br /&gt;I was right in thinking this was the perfect size for my legs. I also like the handy travel case.&lt;br /&gt;This product is not just for men. Ladies need this too! ~ Mrs. B.</li>
            <li> If you are use to the small pencil then it might take a little getting use to it when you first see it. However; after the first use and times there after...you will wonder why it took this many years. It works just fine....make sure you rinse it or wipe it off after the use.</li>
            <li> I have gotten in the habit over the years to lay my styptic pencil flat on my face after shaving. Does a couple of things. 1 closes the pores, 2 stops any minor irritation I get on my chin and neck. 3 stops any bleeding I may have. Well RazoRock Alum Block is the best out there. Not only does it last about 8 to 10 months for me but I have 2 of them. 1 for my face only and 1 for my underarms and around my feet. It kills odor instantly and I don&#x27;t have to spend all the money on a deodorant because it is one or neutralizes any underarm odor I have for the entire day until I shower it off. My feet it has stopped tennis shoe odor, and athletes feet by doing whatever it does on my feet as well. My face it works better than a styptic pencil and is easier to hold and use. It lasts long and price per pound there is no equal in cost. I use it daily and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> With wet shaving, alum is a must. This alum is perfect for home use and travel. The case is VERY handy for home as well a suitcase. Alum blocks don&#x27;t like to be dropped and the case keeps the alum protected. A must have for wet shavers.</li>
            <li> Good solid product shouldn&#x27;t fall apart like other brands. Will get many shaves from.</li>
            <li> SuPerb....sssshh it&#x27;s a secret.</li>
            <li> I started wet shaving a few weeks ago after years of using an electric razor.  While I have been getting a good shave with my DE razor and Italian shave cream, my after shave balm just didn&#x27;t fully help my face recover from the irritation. Now that I have added the RazoRock alum to the routine, my skin feels great. I wish I had made this purchase earlier.  Compared to other alum blocks on the market, this was a good value and it came with a nice protective case.  So far I&#x27;m impressed and now I&#x27;m tempted to try some of the brand&#x27;s other products.</li>
            <li> Very well packaged added a duct tape handle to it and the product works great.</li>
            <li> Feels great post shave!</li>
            <li> This is a larger block than the RazoRock travel size, and that one has lasted more than a year for me with daily use and I still have a little left. This one should take me into the future. Nice case. The travel size has the handy holding part, but otherwise, the same alum.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have discovered this stuff earlier in my life.  It is amazing.  It effectively eliminates small cuts and razor burn.  I follow it up with Captains Choice Bay Rum Cat O Nine Tails.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Effective astringent/stypic.</li>
            <li> Must have accessory for a proper wet shave. Gives your skin a great tight/smooth feeling, and provides for a&lt;br /&gt;nice antiseptic finish to your shave. Also, a great training product for beginner shavers as it will let you know&lt;br /&gt;where you need to work on your technique. Not a strong burn, but enough to let you know.</li>
            <li> I prefer the cream for traveling, only because it fit in my luggage better. I put a small dab in my palm and use my brush (Badger) to whip up  a great lather. I use the Proraso tubs at home. I find that Proraso is the best for IMHO. I love the Green And the Red. Both have a great fragrance, give a close clean shave. I have tried other soaps and creams, but my personal choice so far will always  be Proraso.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add this to  you shaving kit it works very well.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Block powders a little in transit but it comes in a great little plastic container.  I travel a fair bit and the container is realy handy to keep the block secure and dry.</li>
            <li> Great alum block!  The main reason I selected this product was for the case, I didn&#x27;t want to have my alum just sitting out in the open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The alum itself is refreshing to use after shaving with my DE razor.  Keeps my face looking clean, clear, and refreshed.  Strongly recommended purchase.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Alum Block. Great product. Does exactly what it suppose to.&lt;br /&gt;Tells you where you went too close to skin. Yes it stings but that is the whole point of using Alum Block.&lt;br /&gt;Also works great for nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> Looks like this after couple of months of use. It is now rough as sandpaper and unusable. Plus I have no idea what that black thing. Its freaking scary!</li>
            <li> This block worked well for about two months, then a hole developed and the whole block started to disintegrate. It broke apart and crumbled...not useful any longer. If this hole hadn&#x27;t developed, I expect it would have lasted a few more months. I suspect it remained wet after usage and the water may have caused the hole to develop. I am trying another brand to see if that works better. If you buy this product, take extra care to keep it dry.</li>
            <li> I never did think this would be a use full item,So I put off buying one for years. If you wet shave you need to only try it one time and you will never shave with out it.</li>
            <li> Works like every other alum block and lasts longer.  travel case is nice, but don&#x27;t keep it in there between uses.  I was storing mine in there between shaves at home and the one end started to disintegrate.  I think it never fully dried even though i wiped it on a dry towel before storing.  I now store it on my razor/brush stand (mine has a shelf to it) and no more issues since it can air dry fully.    Update: I was wrong, issues slowed not stopped. It&#x27;s continuing to disintegrate causing it to have very rough spots.  Pieces fall off of it as i try to rub it on my face. Still lasting much longer than a Bloc Asma brand block. Just wish it wasn&#x27;t turning into alum gravel....</li>
            <li> product works fine stings when put on but does stop bleeding on most knicks . would recommend it for most shaving cuts</li>
            <li> Horrible!!! It crumbl after 2 weeks of use</li>
            <li> This worked well for but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a solid piece or made from compressed pieces because it dissolved unevenly in the center and ultimately broke into two pieces.  As an aftershave astringent it worked well until it broke in half, the sharp edges from the break make it difficult to use on my face.</li>
            <li> RazoRock&#x27;s shaving soaps are absolutely superb and sell for a bargain.  So when I needed a replacement alum block, I went with the same trusty brand. This alum block started out as a great value and initially, I had no problem giving it a 5 star review.  The quality seemed every bit as good as other brands for a fraction of the price, it&#x27;s several times larger than most and the travel case that comes with is very solid.  It was everything that I&#x27;ve come to expect from RazoRock - superior quality and value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to a month later.  Cracks and fairly large air bubbles became visible under the surface.  Fast forward one more month after that and crystalline holes quickly began to develop in it overnight.  A few weeks more and it was barely usable. Sharp, fractured shards would scratch my face after a 3 pass shave as more chunks would crumble off into the sink with each use.  An alum block should be the icing on the cake after a close shave.  It should sooth and heal any minor nicks or cuts and a block half this size should last for years.  In that regard, I would argue that this renders RazoRock&#x27;s alum block counterproductive to its purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last alum block I used was Bloc Osma and although it was half the size, it proved to be twice the quality as it lasted for several years without any issues. In the future, I&#x27;ll stick with Bloc Osma for alum and RazoRock for their incredible shaving soaps which I can&#x27;t recommend highly enough.</li>
            <li> I use this every day...No complaints.  Glad I bought this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I have had this for about 7 months now and it&#x27;s running low.  It was doing great until I dropped it and it broke in half.  Ever since then it started degrading REALLY fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does cause a bit of a sting on your face when you first apply it because of the raw skin created from close shaving, but it goes away fast.  After shaving, I rinse with hot water and rub the razorock on my face, then I rinse with cold water and do it again.  Before using this, shaving would wear out my face and I could only shave every other day.  On the off days, I would have to use an electric shaver or else my face would break out.  This has eliminated that problem.  I now shave every day with a razor.</li>
            <li> This was the best deal offered as it is larger in size and the lowest cost of all the same offerings. The product was sent via USPS shipping free but was worth the extra few days wait. I have used similar products with much success and this one will go to my son and be replaced in my shaving supplies quickly. The alum block seals up and stops any irritation from a close shave and provides feedback on one&#x27;s shave. It also serves as a great underarm deodorant.</li>
            <li> I have been wet shaving now for many months and it is an amazing experience! I never really had much of a post shave routine before, I usually just did a hot rinse followed by a cold rinse to open/close the pores and let my face air dry. My brother then turned me on to using an Alum Block for my post shave routine and its AWESOME! This block is great for giving you feedback on how well you shaved and if you went to deep in some spots and not deep enough in others. It helps seal all cuts you may have and leaves your skin feeling great! The RazoRock Alum Block is totally a MUST HAVE! for anyone! It doesn&#x27;t matter if you are using a straight razor or a de safety razor YOU NEED THIS! The price is just right and that handy case it comes in is such a plus! Most alum blocks are just loose and this has a nice handy dandy case to go back into. Thank You RazoRock!</li>
            <li> The item arrived in a very short time.  The Alum Block is perfect for my needs.  Great for traveling.  Works very well.  Great for that unexpected nick.  The block in a box fits perfectly in my dopp kit.</li>
            <li> Alum either works for you or it doesn&#x27;t. If it does, then this will work on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Includes storage case&lt;br /&gt;+ Weight to price ratio is excellent. One of the cheapest around.&lt;br /&gt;+ Reputable shaving brand</li>
            <li> I took up traditional wet shaving 6 weeks or so ago, and I didn&#x27;t have the alum block for the first couple of shaves. Let me tell you, it makes the difference. Softens the skin, seals up any nicks, very refreshing (like Junior Mints!) For the quantity, this is a great price. The plastic case is very helpful also and well worth it when you figure you can pay this same price or a little more for one without a plastic case.  Go for it!</li>
            <li> Honestly, this is an alum block for use after wet shaving.  What makes it distinctive for me is the fact that it is of excellent quality and its large size moves it to the excellent value category as well.  And the plastic case is a well received touch.  For me, that is about as much of a rave review that an item like his could receive.</li>
            <li> Nice piece of rock and a case too!!!</li>
            <li> Good value, good packaging, block is nice size &amp; form. After shopping around before purchase, I found this to be a good buy.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it should do, helps close up your facial pores after shaving irration and comes in a nice box suitable for travel.</li>
            <li> Great stuff fill the burn like my Pop use to say.</li>
            <li> My best addition to my wet shaving supplies. Works great and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Nice little alum block at a great price, and the travel case keeps it safe and sound.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an alum block so not much to say there. However the handy case is great for keeping it safe and the size of the block is perfect for applying to my face after shaves. Would recommend to anyone looking for an alum block that will last years.</li>
            <li> There are lots of Alum blocks out there but this one is very nice. The size is perfect and the weight and thickness is very good. It should last for months and months. I really like the travel case to store it in. Keeps it dry and protected. The alum block is very strong and works perfectly. I use it after I shower and before my pores close. I glide it over my face and neck and allow it to dry. It has completely taken care of the razor burn and any small nick that I might have. It is a must have for any double edge shaving guy!!!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this RAZOROCK Alum block!</li>
            <li> I left a review earlier but it did not post&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;great product if you use a double edge razor&lt;br /&gt;really a must have&lt;br /&gt;also good for my grandson all the bumps and scrapes&lt;br /&gt;stop&#x27;s the bleeding&lt;br /&gt;great service here in 2 days, great price&lt;br /&gt;even if you shave with a new safety razor you should try it&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ll order from them again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other alum blocks and paid more for less. Other brands sell you a small square that chips and falls apart BUT not RazoRock! Wet shaving is one of those things that people have strong opinions regarding THEIR blade...cream.....after shave. But using an alum block on their face after the shave to stop the nicks goes without argument. This should be everyone&#x27;s block. The size and the price should sell the RazoRock all by itself but they don&#x27;t stop there, the block comes with a cool little travel case. No more fuzzy blocks with chips or breaks. This is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derek Blenkarn</li>
            <li> Purchased in the past, good product, good Company.  Thanks  Ray</li>
            <li> Five stars for the travel case. Two stars for the Alum Block. As the block started to wear down, the inner core became exposed; the result was that the core was more crystalline than I expected, and it became a very messy experience. Ultimately, I tossed it. I will go back to the Bloc Osma Alum Block, which when it wears down it remains a solid piece of Alum. It also fit nicely into the travel case.</li>
            <li> Smells horrible as a deodorant- better off without anything</li>
            <li> This is a must have for every shave cave and travel kit! Works great. Stops the burn and heals nicks! I&#x27;m sold on RazoRock!!</li>
            <li> Excellent, what more can you say about RazoRock Alum Block.  Works great, you can really feel if you have shaved an area to close.  Its a great complement after a perfect shave. I use it after every shave on a weekly basis. You cant beat the size and price you get from RazoRock.  Much cheaper in price and more product than the other brands. In addition to the Alum block it comes with a handy travel case so you can dry it off and place it in the case and leave it. Overall great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m displeased with this product. After about a month a whole half of the block basically dissolved in my hand - it just turned to dust. I&#x27;ve been careful with the product, drying it and storing it in the case after each use. I can only conclude that it wasn&#x27;t packed together well during manufacture. I&#x27;m going back to the Osma brand alum, which lasted a whole year until I carelessly dropped it on the tile and it shattered.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality alum block at a value price.  Like all the other razorock product, they seem to be the best at delivering high quality and low prices.  Comes is a neat little travel case.  One suggestion though... make you dry the alum before putting it in the case or the lifespan will be reduced.  These blocks seem to last well over a year with daily use.  Potassium alum is the professional barber way to finish a shave, I highly recommend the razorock alum block with the travel case and I highly recommend razorock as a brand.  A+ all the way.</li>
            <li> Great Product!  Arrived in one piece which is a problem from the last few that I have ordered.  This stuff is a must for those who like to shave with safety razors or straight razors.  It burns like crazy, but does the trick for nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> Use this after you shave, whether or not you nicked yourself. I run mine under cold water while the sink is draining and use it (I think that stops the center from dissolving as fast). I&#x27;ve tried using it as a deodorant, but it began to give me a rash, so stopped that (YMMV though). I had originally used a different brand, but the travel case keeps the alum from crystallizing in the medicine cabinet...</li>
            <li> Love the way it stops the bleeding!  Glad I got this one!</li>
            <li> Used for wet shaving, works as an alum block should. It&#x27;s big enough to hold on to, the edges are nice and round so it glides over my face well. Honestly, I bought it because it came in a plastic case. I&#x27;d do it again.</li>
            <li> I mean.. its alum.. its all the same but razorock delivers obviously.. great product and a wetshavers staple. Only thing is i think i should have got the stick because i dropped it and it chipped about 1/6 of the block from the edge.. not a problem though because i just got it wet and sanded it. In the end i lost some because of this but it was MY fault. would still recommend. Especially because of the case</li>
            <li> Love the case that came with the block. Now I have a place to store it when I travel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a potassium alum block. It works. It&#x27;s cheap. Case is not flimsy. Not much more to say.</li>
            <li> Nice solid piece of Alum . I also like that it comes in a case. This should last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Best alum block I&#x27;ve used. Isn&#x27;t a compressed block of cheaper parts and comes in a wonderful travel/storage case so someone can&#x27;t mistake it for a block of soap anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great deal for high quality alum. Obviously dry it a little prior to storage in the plastic case and you&#x27;ll have a wonderfully smooth block of alum for your shaves.</li>
            <li> This is my second Alum Block i have used.  The first was a Major label and for lots more money.  Not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;This RazoRock Alum Block does the job just as well and for a much better price.  Oh did I mention that it is twice&lt;br /&gt;the size as the other brand.  Very Nice.</li>
            <li> Best of the alum shaving blocks. Good case and solid alum block. I bought several to see which was the best alum block to stop bleeding cuts and this one is the winner.There is no comparison to other alum blocks . This one came perfectly finished on all sides with a taper. The case is perfect as well. This came from the Phillippines. They seem to produce a quality product that was not in pieces like some other alum companies. This is the only Alum bar I will ever be buying.</li>
            <li> Perfect for backing. Light and great for scrapes and nicks. I use it as a deodorant and rub on my feet to kill bacteria.</li>
            <li> I used the RazoRock Alum Block as my first attempt at blocking after a DE wet shave. This definitely tightens my skin after a shave and is best used after rinsing with cold water. My face feels better after use -- quality product at a good price!</li>
            <li> Great price, fast delivery. This Alum Block works fantastic. I had one small nick and it stopped the bleeding right away. Leaves a slight unique tingling sensation on your face, but feels one you get use to it. Great product. Wish I bought this years ago. AAA+++</li>
            <li> Razorock block works very well after a smooth shave. It heals nicks cuts and burns wouldn&#x27;t shave with out it thank you razorock. Great service fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Works well very nice after shaving. A must-have If you have never use one before I would recommend it it makes the nicks stop waiting close the pores in your face</li>
            <li> This alum block is just the best. RazoRock is the best</li>
            <li> I am new to DE shaving.  I have been reading and exploring the shaving subject.  I have used an alum block and it works well as an antiseptic and stopping any nicks.&lt;br /&gt;I looked at many alum blocks but for the money and with the plastic case GREAT VALUE!!&lt;br /&gt;I also ordered this on Wednesday and it was delivered on the following Monday&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product and the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both great product and service a unique combination&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BN</li>
            <li> Works as advertised! Great addition to my wet shaving experience!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve have being the RazoRock Alum block for about 6 months now.  As the outer solid block began to melt away with use, it exposed a very loosely pack crystalline core.  Which crumbled, I ended up throwing out the rest of the block because due to its new size it was unusable.  I expected a solid alum block all the way through.  Usually alum block will last me a entire year or more.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this might be the best aftershave I&#x27;ve ever used. Gives a great burn as it tightens up your pores. When I&#x27;m not in the mood for a scent, I just use this with some Nivea Sensitive Balm, and my skin feels great. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my face like alcohol aftershaves do over time.</li>
            <li> Perfect finishing to a great shave. Closes up pores, seals/heals nicks and cuts and stops bleeding - If you get any.&lt;br /&gt;I use it after every shave, gives great feedback - where did you get a little too close, or not close enough.&lt;br /&gt;Just a hint, don&#x27;t drop it in the sink... It is not designed to hold up, but on the bright side, now I have about 50 &amp;#34;Travel-Size&amp;#34; Alum Blocks... :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 4-5 times/week for over 7 months over my entire face after each shave, and there&#x27;s still at least 1/2 the block remaining, so it lasts long.  Gives a nice quick burn and keeps my face from getting too oily.  It stops the bleeding on most nicks and cuts, but a couple times I had to use a styptic pencil in addition to this.&lt;br /&gt;At first I kept it in the case but that seemed age it prematurely (made it rough) even though I dried it with a towel after each use.  So I bought a plastic spiked soapbar holder at Target for 99 cents and that remedied the problem.&lt;br /&gt;This is my first alum block so I don&#x27;t know how it stacks up to others.  But it does everything I expected it to and at a low price.</li>
            <li> Alum works to close pores after a shave, and this alum works great.  For those of you on the fence, the way to use this is to rub it over the shaved areas while your face is still wet after rinsing off shaving cream, leave it on for 30-60 seconds, &amp; then rinse off with cold water.  This closes your pores close from the combination of alum &amp; from the cold water.  Some blocks are tiny (like 45 grams tiny), but this one is a full size 90 grams.  Buy it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> Good product, love the compact case and over all... Very pleased with the Alum block and its post shave qualities.</li>
            <li> Good quality - very good value.</li>
            <li> Today is 2/13/15. This item arrived three days ago, well before expected. I like the case it comes in but I especially like the rounded edges on the bar. The alum bar that this one is replacing has the sharp corners and sides of a brick and, as the bar melts with use, those edges can be irritating. This unit, with the rounded edges is much smoother and appears more solid than my other brand. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think much of this product. Got it because of the great reviews. Unwrapped the alum block from the plastic in the case to find large pieces were broken off.  I now have about half of the block that is still useable. The other small pieces were pretty much wasted.</li>
            <li> I love the way it tightens the face after a shave. A great post shave product. I give it 5 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> An Alum Block is an Alum Block. An Alum Block is a great after shave. Cold rinse after shave, then rub alum block all over face. Pause. Then cold rinse face again.  But this one comes with a convenient case for travel to pop it into the toilet kit.  RazoRock is a good brand.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience using alum. I used it once after a cartridge shave, and now with my first DE razor (Feather AS-D2). It is amazing at how alum works to eliminate razor burn. No more itching with bumps on the neck and sides of the mouth were I am most sensitive. They should sell this stuff in all the stores with shaving supplies. If I had known about the awesomeness of shaving alum when I first started shaving I would have been saved a lot of discomfort and embarrassment caused by severe razor burn followed by a major breakout. It works well to stop most bleeding or at least slow it drastically. This particular block was the best price per unit weight, and it arrived VERY quickly with just the standard shipping (only a few days later). The case is also nice. I make sure to dry it with a towel after use, and have a few layers of paper towel at the bottom (and leave the case open on my shelf) to let any extra moisture evaporate from the bar to prevent it from falling apart.</li>
            <li> Quite possible the best shaving purchase I&#x27;ve made in years. All the reviews that say it leaves your face, smooth taught and happy are correct. I just bought another - it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> I have used this 4 times and it works well I was using the club man sticks. This is a much better quality and the plastic case is nice. Rinse your face after shaving while your face is still wet rub on shaved area rinse block off dry and put back in container rinse face off and pat dry and apply after shave or balm. Has a slight sting nothing to bad makes your face feel alot better after does not leave white residue or have any scent.</li>
            <li> Dropped on the counter bad broke in many pieces</li>
            <li> Love this, makes my skin smoother. Would recommend to everyone who is wet shaving.</li>
            <li> Its a good product.  I love cleaning my face with it after a shave.  I just dont know what to do when the rock breaks down</li>
            <li> An Alum Block is pretty much an Alum Block but this has a nice case for travel and a good shape. Price was fair as well.</li>
