            <li>I love how it moisturizes my skin!</li>
            <li>I would prefer a thicker and more lubricating product... and one that I didn&#x27;t have to hold my nose while using!</li>
            <li>So I came to Amazon to try and find a better deal! ...</li>
            <li>The shave cream smells great and it is so light on the skin.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>Prevents any irritation and leaves my skin nice and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>As to the smell, I tried the Acai Grapefruit fragrance, and was wonderful; very sweet-tart and invigorating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes me skin feel amazing and so much more moisturized.</li>
            <li>This was OK but nothing amazing.</li>

            <li>I fell in love with whish shave cream when a sample of it came in my Birchbox monthly subscription.</li>

            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this shave cream, will never use anything else.</li>
            <li>not too long after searching the brand did I find the product and at a great deal!!</li>
            <li>The price is fantastic and it is such a great product!</li>
            <li>It goes on like a dream and makes shaving so easy.</li>
            <li>Not only is this a great shave cream it smells FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>Scent/description confusion aside, the product is substantively the same and is wonderful; I never thought shave cream could be great, much less better than</li>
            <li>It is a very good choice for people with dry skin.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff for shaving pits and legs, and my husband uses it on his face; makes it so nice and soft!  </li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin, and smells pretty, too!</li>
            <li>It does not clog your blade either which is a huge plus too...</li>
            <li>This cream is smooth and my skin does not itch afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Feels fantastic.</li>
            <li>So smooth and mousturized</li>
            <li>do think this helped in terms of providing a close, fairly smooth shave.</li>
            <li>, it leaves my legs so smooth</li>
            <li>My new favorite thing!  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product I love it so much!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great shave cream and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>It rinses off the razor cleanly.  </li>
            <li>I knew right away upon using it that I wanted to get a full size bottle!</li>
            <li>It smells like vomit and there is nothing special about how it works.</li>
            <li>Super moisturizing.</li>
            <li>and this smells exactly like blueberry muffin batter!  </li>
            <li>I checked Birchbox website first and it was $20!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>but it will be nice while it lasts and I can indulge for an occasional \\&quot;treat\\&quot; buy now and then.</li>
            <li>Completely worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Soft and smooth and very feminine.</li>
            <li>(But really Amazon, bring us the grapefruit scent.</li>
            <li>This does not bother me too much, but I can see why others would not like it.</li>
            <li>the plus side my whole bathroom smelt like grapefruit.</li>
            <li>This stuff is better to my underarms than is any other shaving cream.</li>
            <li>It was very expensive to order through them, so I was extremely happy to find it on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin very soft and I get a very close shave.</li>
            <li>Putting aside the glorious scent the cream did a better than average job!  </li>
            <li>It is very creamy and leaves your skin soft.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally use shaving cream but after receiving a sample of this I may just have to change my ways.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s worth the extra cleaning time.</li>
            <li>: This is not foamy and is pretty see-through, so you cannot visually determine which areas you have shaved and which you haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>unlike most shaving cremes this one was extremely hard to wash off my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i had to use an old toothbrush and scrub the stuff out of it.</li>
            <li>My legs were soft afterwards, though I did also use a body</li>
            <li>So a full size bottle should last much longer than a typical drugstore can of shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Iâ€™m not sure I would spend $20 for shave cream EXCEPT it smells like blueberries which will make me order more once I run out of my current shave cream.</li>
            <li>I cringed at paying $20 for shaving cream, but you do only need a little and your legs feel buttery smooth.  </li>
            <li>the $2 Barbasol can that I stole from my husband (which is fantastic), and this really changes the game!</li>
            <li>Husband loves it, leaves your skin soft and it does dry it up.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> the $2 Barbasol can that I stole from my husband (which is fantastic), and this really changes the game!</li>
            <li> Husband loves it, leaves your skin soft and it does dry it up.</li>
            <li> Tough to clean out of razor and leaves film on bath tub,</li>
            <li> Also, because the cream is so moisturizing, it is very heavy and thick once it gets picked up by the razor, so you may need to rinse your razor a bit more often.</li>
            <li> An extra bonus, it doesn&#x27;t ruin your razors like other non-foaming shaving creams can.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the reasons why it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like foams do.</li>
            <li> A little of this product goes a very long way, and you will probably need only a very small fraction of what you normally use.</li>
            <li> This is NOT the acai grapefruit, even though the acai grapefruit also has a pink label.</li>
            <li> It is on the expensive side but my small sample lasted me a couple of weeks, so the full size bottle should last a few months.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Little goes along way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Water, Stearic Acid, Myristic Acid, Squalane, Glycerin, Potassium Hydroxide, Organic Coconut Oil, Glycol Distearate, Fragrance, Organic Jojoba Seed Oil, Organic Pomegranate Oil, Organic Green Tea Leaf Extract, Organic Shea Butter Fruit, Phenoxyethanol, Tetrahydroxypropyl Ethylenediamine, Ethylhexyl (Octyl) Palmitate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopherol, Limonene.</li>
            <li> So, it was vindicating to see that at least some other people agree: it smelled like vomit to me!</li>
            <li> i tried to apply it dry and it was extremely thin</li>
            <li> Usually I am tempted by samples</li>
            <li> I was squeezing out the last drop of my sample because I was sad to see it go.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any artificial dyes since my skin is sometimes sensitive.</li>
            <li> The only shaving cream I have ever used that doesn&#x27;t require me to run out of the shower and immediately put lotion on due to the horrible dry itchy feeling I typically get after shaving.</li>
            <li> (I used it on my lower legs), it can be hard to see.</li>
            <li> i barley got done with 1/4 of my leg and decided that was enough it is too oily and unpleasant.</li>
            <li> after applying it i washed my hands and it left the most annoying and disgusting texture on my hands.</li>
            <li> bumps hardly ever show up now!</li>
            <li> This product was very thick and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> the shave creme was extremely thin.</li>
            <li> I hated the clumpy foam that was left behind, and my legs were never as moistened afterwards, as promised.  </li>
            <li> Iâ€™m slightly obsessed with blueberry muffins</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this stuff.</li>
            <li> but I had to look here and on the Birchbox website to see if I&#x27;m crazy</li>
            <li> Please note that while this does contain some plant oils and extracts, it also contains artificial fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and/or got a bad sample.</li>
            <li> My bath water doesn&#x27;t have nasty clumps of foam.  </li>
            <li> it was literally the worst shaving creme i have ever used!</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t foam terribly well, so when you spread it out over the area to be shaved</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This cream is smooth and my skin does not itch afterwards.  Lovely!</li>
            <li> Iâ€™m slightly obsessed with blueberry muffins and this smells exactly like blueberry muffin batter!  I absolutely love the scent.  Love.  Love.  Love it!  Putting aside the glorious scent the cream did a better than average job!  Iâ€™m not sure I would spend $20 for shave cream EXCEPT it smells like blueberries which will make me order more once I run out of my current shave cream.</li>
            <li> I gave up on shaving cream years ago... I received this in a birch box sample and I love it!!! Great price!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for shaving pits and legs, and my husband uses it on his face; makes it so nice and soft!  Happy wife, happy life!</li>
            <li> The only shaving cream I have ever used that doesn&#x27;t require me to run out of the shower and immediately put lotion on due to the horrible dry itchy feeling I typically get after shaving.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Soft and smooth and very feminine. I love this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally use shaving cream but after receiving a sample of this I may just have to change my ways. It makes me skin feel amazing and so much more moisturized. The wonderful smell is a bonus. It is on the expensive side but my small sample lasted me a couple of weeks, so the full size bottle should last a few months.</li>
            <li> My new favorite thing!  Just ordered another bottle to make sure I&#x27;m never without it.</li>
            <li> I love how it moisturizes my skin!</li>
            <li> I love this this shave cream. It gives you the closest shave ever. And still 2 days later still no stubble!</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this stuff. If I could give it six stars, I would. It&#x27;s a great shave cream and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. Feels fantastic. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Got this stuff in my Birchbox and knew I had to buy the full size version!!!! It goes on like a dream and makes shaving so easy.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this and fell in love with it.  I have never tried a shaving cream like it.  I cringed at paying $20 for shaving cream, but you do only need a little and your legs feel buttery smooth.  Not sure I can afford to consistently buy it, but it will be nice while it lasts and I can indulge for an occasional \\&quot;treat\\&quot; buy now and then.</li>
            <li> I have to disagree with all the five star reviews. I received a sample in this month&#x27;s Birch Box. It smells like vomit and there is nothing special about how it works. $3 regular shave cream/foam works just as well. Usually I am tempted by samples but I just used this one up and tossed it.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way! Great for sensitive skin, and smells pretty, too! This stuff is better to my underarms than is any other shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Best shaving cream in the market</li>
            <li> This a wonderful product will definitely buy again!!!</li>
            <li> It was what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  Smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I gave up traditional shaving cream decades ago. I hated the clumpy foam that was left behind, and my legs were never as moistened afterwards, as promised.  A sample of this...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it every time since. My legs are actually left moisturized.  My bath water doesn&#x27;t have nasty clumps of foam.  And my razor actually slides over my legs to get at the hair.  I wish I&#x27;d had this stuff decades ago! Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews but I had to look here and on the Birchbox website to see if I&#x27;m crazy and/or got a bad sample. So, it was vindicating to see that at least some other people agree: it smelled like vomit to me! Also, it doesn&#x27;t lather at all. I guess that&#x27;s a plus if you like to see what you&#x27;re shaving, but it felt like shaving after rubbing my legs with a bar of soap. I would prefer a thicker and more lubricating product... and one that I didn&#x27;t have to hold my nose while using!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with whish shave cream when a sample of it came in my Birchbox monthly subscription. I knew right away upon using it that I wanted to get a full size bottle! I checked Birchbox website first and it was $20! So I came to Amazon to try and find a better deal! ...not too long after searching the brand did I find the product and at a great deal!! The price is fantastic and it is such a great product! The shave cream smells great and it is so light on the skin. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or leave any residue. It does not clog your blade either which is a huge plus too...you can get a lot more strokes in before you have to rinse the blade off. And the after shower feeling is the best! So smooth and mousturized I don&#x27;t even need to put lotion on. I have used it under my armpits too and works great! I will continue to use this product I love it so much!</li>
            <li> The best shaving cream out there; I swear by it.  Prevents any irritation and leaves my skin nice and moisturized.  You only need one or two pumps per leg.  An extra bonus, it doesn&#x27;t ruin your razors like other non-foaming shaving creams can.  It rinses off the razor cleanly.  I will never use anything else.  Completely worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, it does NOT foam or lather and it&#x27;s not supposed to.  This is one of the reasons why it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like foams do.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! bumps hardly ever show up now!</li>
            <li> I received a sample for the acai grapefruit scent in my Birchbox and, upon seeing that it was $8 here instead of $20, I bought 3 of these babies. This is NOT the acai grapefruit, even though the acai grapefruit also has a pink label. It is pomegranate. Don&#x27;t be like me--read the description! I had read it, but I thought &amp;#34;pomegranate oil&amp;#34; was just one of the ingredients...not the entire scent. I did a search through Amazon and the acai grapefruit isn&#x27;t offered at all. Scent/description confusion aside, the product is substantively the same and is wonderful; I never thought shave cream could be great, much less better than the $2 Barbasol can that I stole from my husband (which is fantastic), and this really changes the game! I was squeezing out the last drop of my sample because I was sad to see it go. GET THIS PRODUCT. (But really Amazon, bring us the grapefruit scent. Please.)</li>
            <li> This left a grimy residue on my skin. I dont recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great non toxic way to shave.  Husband loves it, leaves your skin soft and it does dry it up. Love it</li>
            <li> Love this shaving cream. Leaves my skin very soft and I get a very close shave. Tough to clean out of razor and leaves film on bath tub, but I think it&#x27;s worth the extra cleaning time.</li>
            <li> I love this product. The only reason for the 4 stars is because when I received it, it appeared as if there was damage done during delivery. The bottle was covered in the product.</li>
            <li> Purchased several of these.  My daughter loves it.  She had received a sample of Whish in a package for a cosmetic club she belongs to and really loved it.  It was very expensive to order through them, so I was extremely happy to find it on Amazon!  It is very creamy and leaves your skin soft.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Pros: This product was very thick and moisturizing. It is a very good choice for people with dry skin. A little of this product goes a very long way, and you will probably need only a very small fraction of what you normally use. So a full size bottle should last much longer than a typical drugstore can of shaving cream. As to the smell, I tried the Acai Grapefruit fragrance, and was wonderful; very sweet-tart and invigorating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: This is not foamy and is pretty see-through, so you cannot visually determine which areas you have shaved and which you haven&#x27;t. This does not bother me too much, but I can see why others would not like it. Also, because the cream is so moisturizing, it is very heavy and thick once it gets picked up by the razor, so you may need to rinse your razor a bit more often.</li>
            <li> Love this shave cream, will never use anything else. Little goes along way. Super moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Not only is this a great shave cream it smells FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> it was literally the worst shaving creme i have ever used! i tried to apply it dry and it was extremely thin then i tried with a bit of water and it was a bit easier to apply. after applying it i washed my hands and it left the most annoying and disgusting texture on my hands. in the areas where i applied this shave cream the shave creme was extremely thin. while shaving i washed off my razor and the shave creme started to clump up in my razor and would not come out. i had to use an old toothbrush and scrub the stuff out of it. i barley got done with 1/4 of my leg and decided that was enough it is too oily and unpleasant. unlike most shaving cremes this one was extremely hard to wash off my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;on the plus side my whole bathroom smelt like grapefruit.</li>
            <li> This was OK but nothing amazing. I did like the smell (fruity) and I appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any artificial dyes since my skin is sometimes sensitive. Please note that while this does contain some plant oils and extracts, it also contains artificial fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When distributed from the container, it has an airy texture. However, it doesn&#x27;t foam terribly well, so when you spread it out over the area to be shaved (I used it on my lower legs), it can be hard to see. (I could feel it, though, if I ran my finger over my legs.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think this helped in terms of providing a close, fairly smooth shave. My legs were soft afterwards, though I did also use a body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the ingredients since I didn&#x27;t see them on the product page:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, Stearic Acid, Myristic Acid, Squalane, Glycerin, Potassium Hydroxide, Organic Coconut Oil, Glycol Distearate, Fragrance, Organic Jojoba Seed Oil, Organic Pomegranate Oil, Organic Green Tea Leaf Extract, Organic Shea Butter Fruit, Phenoxyethanol, Tetrahydroxypropyl Ethylenediamine, Ethylhexyl (Octyl) Palmitate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopherol, Limonene.</li>
            <li> amazing greatest shaving cream ever, it leaves my legs so smooth and it smells great. I will never use anything else again</li>
