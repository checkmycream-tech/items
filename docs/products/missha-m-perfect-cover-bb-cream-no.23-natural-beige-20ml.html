    <ol>
            <li>Perfect for a teenager.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look flawless and I like the texture.</li>
            <li>I was very happy because i thought I;d have to wait longer since its from s korea.     </li>
            <li>However this color suits my skin perfectly.</li>
            <li>too see which ones you like the best.</li>
            <li>But, as soon as a rubbed it in it blended in with my skin tone perfectly.</li>
            <li>This covered flawlessly.</li>
            <li>This is awesome!</li>
            <li>The color matches perfectly to my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking this #23 will be perfect for winter, and maybe I&#x27;ll get around to getting a #25 for the summer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s brilliant!</li>
            <li>but it turned out to be great!</li>
            <li>Altough it wasnt my correct skin color, it blends  perfectly.</li>
            <li>I found that Benefit Beauty Balm works best for me after I stopped using this one.</li>
            <li>and it smoothed my skin wonderfully!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve read in the reviews that the best BB creams come from Korea.</li>
            <li>I have to admit, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>So, this worked for me perfectly.</li>
            <li>Perfect shade for me</li>
            <li>and it was the perfect size to try it out</li>
            <li>The tone and shade matches me PERFECTLY which was also awesome.</li>
            <li>I heard good things about the Missha Perfect Cover (from Bubzbeauty,</li>
            <li>The finish is great and it wears well over the day.</li>
            <li>This item is great, it matches my skin tone</li>
            <li>It also smells really nice, and the best part is that this BB cream stays put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product has great coverage without feeling to cake-y, but the downfall to this product is that it smells like you&#x27;re putting a layer of perfume all over your face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another great feature is, it doesn&#x27;t cake.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great alternative to any foundation I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>This BB cream is very nice.</li>
            <li>i think im going to look around for more bb cream to see which one i like the best.</li>
            <li>I love this product and the color is just perfect for the color of my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin feels great with a good cover.</li>
            <li>texture is great and coverage is amazing but even at no. 23</li>
            <li>but the cover is good.</li>
            <li>The date on the box says it was manufactured in 2012, but the seller said the expiration date is good until August this year.</li>
            <li>Got this as a gift for my friend, she loved it.</li>
            <li>It says it&#x27;s good for your skin</li>
            <li>Wonderful ingredients, good skin care properties, but only for the very fair folk, even in Caucasian skin tones!  </li>
            <li>This BB cream is not bad, but I wasn&#x27;t really impressed with it.</li>
            <li>If you want something that will make your face flawless then you should look around for more bb creams that has a better coverage.</li>
            <li>The fresh effect is the best thing</li>
            <li>Anyway, it has a very pleasant mild smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I made that decision because now I use it every day!</li>
            <li>I got so many compliments today!</li>
            <li>I went into Google and typed in &amp;#34;best BB creams for oily skin&amp;#34; and this was in the top 3!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>The product itself is amazing.</li>
            <li>I bought this after wanting to try bb creams because of the amazing skin the girls who wear them have and I do not regret it at all.</li>
            <li>I liked that it had an olive tone to it</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase it after read many good reviews about it.</li>
            <li>The best part is that it&#x27;s VERY affordable.</li>
            <li>Gives my face a nice even look.</li>
            <li>I brought this on, kind of mistake.</li>
            <li>is perfect , for oily skin is excellent ..leaves a fresh, natural finish, lasts all day ..</li>
            <li>Nice cream.</li>
            <li>The delivery was quick &amp; the price was great.  </li>
            <li>Light, yet good coverage and no streaking.</li>
            <li>perfect for my acne prone sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It don&#x27;t even cover as well as the very cheap BB cream.</li>
            <li>Oh and It came with a free sample of another of Missha&#x27;s BB creams so thats always a plus :) Cute packaging too!     </li>
            <li>I love Missha BB cream</li>
            <li>After using this product for about a week, I&#x27;ve found it is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad that I bought this product.</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly and blends amazingly to my skin.</li>
            <li>i think it&#x27;s an okay producte.</li>
            <li>i will be buying more bb creams just test out the bb creams</li>
            <li>I Love this bb cream</li>
            <li>I used this BB cream and it covered all that, evened out my tone, minimized my redness, and gave me a healthy looking glow.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more ASAP</li>
            <li>I thought most BB creams were supposed to make your skin radiant and newer looking, but this one serves more as a foundation/sunscreen for oily skin.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat the price and, believe it or not, one tube has lasted me more than a month.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Just try and make sure you try and find your shade.</li>
            <li>I love love love this BB cream.</li>
            <li>I love this for makeup.</li>
            <li>For someone who has blotchy skin, as I do, with lingering scars from teenage acne, this is a wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>I have just started using it, and haven&#x27;t formed a decision yet as to whether or not I like the actual product, but as I said, service was excellent.</li>
            <li>I like the texture better than the foundations I have been using.</li>
            <li>I love this product, but this color was too gray for my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>and I love it because I didn&#x27;t look so cakey.</li>
            <li>The color is ashy-grey, but blends ok.</li>
            <li>My missha bb cream came way earlier than it was supposed to, which was awesome.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t break me out but gives a nice clean and healthy look.</li>
            <li>just wanted something with light coverage, suitable for oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Best face product I&#x27;ve bought in a long time.</li>
            <li>Not old makeup; not knock off; and the seller was great with extras and packaging!</li>
            <li>first, I loved this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really perfect for someone who would need a tinted moisterizer, but wants something with more benefits, or someone who wants light coverage.</li>
            <li>I got this because I&#x27;d heard a lot of good and great things about it, and I also love it, but I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the slightly chalky look I get on my face after I apply it.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s easy to apply and not thick and gives good coverage and coverage is build able.</li>
            <li>I wanted a buildable foundation that was easy to apply.</li>
            <li>So easy to apply, blends well, and is buildable.</li>
            <li>The item was received very quickly.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong but bearable.</li>
            <li>Seems to have pretty good color, unlike many BB creams which can be funny tones.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product at first.  </li>
            <li>It does not change the texture of my skin which is great for me because I already take good care of my skin and need very little coverage for redness.</li>
            <li>I liked the color and consistency of this cream and the positive reviews inspired me to purchase it.</li>
            <li>It was a bit light for my skin</li>
            <li>But I like using it for the sunscreen, And it covers light scars on my face.</li>
            <li>bought this for me but color was too light</li>
            <li>I like to think I am a moderately light colored person</li>
            <li>but this product was too light for me.</li>
            <li>I have light-medium skin and have been using a light self-tanner</li>
            <li>it was still too light for my olive medium skin tone</li>
            <li>I set it with a mineral powder which really helps to evenly cover everything for a nice powder finish.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>Golden beige was better for my skin.</li>
            <li>The product is creamy, and light weight which is always a plus.</li>
            <li>My primary issue is thatI am allergic to some ingredient in the item.</li>
            <li>Being fair, I used this cream one more time to double check that it caused skin irritation.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The color, Natural Beige, was a good match for my skin.</li>
            <li>:) Btw, I&#x27;m half-asain and am about a NC25 right now during summer.</li>
            <li>Very nice consistency, have to use a small amount, this is too light for me, makes the skin look smooth, and helps with discolorations, but have to mix it with darker foundations, this seems to be the problem with most oriental bb creams !  </li>
            <li>If you have pink undertones and very fair skin get a different shade, but it has good medium coverage without feeling or looking caked on for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m soooooo excited to use it</li>
            <li>When I first put the product on I thought it looked a bit darker, more gray than my skin.</li>
            <li>It is a resonable price &amp; covers great &amp; lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>because when I get it out of the tube and put it on my face, it appears significantly lighter than my skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot lighter than the original</li>
            <li>Be aware though that because its slightly more coverage, that it can get a bit oily towards the end of the day.</li>
            <li>It really softens up your face and makes it more whiter be sure to get your color right.</li>
            <li>Its not the exact perfect match in comparison to the Banila Co&#x27;s Be Touched Yellow Beige, which was discontinued, but I guess its as good as it gets until I keep trying other brands.</li>
            <li>so I am not an easy match right now.</li>
            <li>For comparison, my skin tone is around W4 from loreal true match foundation.</li>
            <li>I much prefer Shills Magic BB cream as it lasts longer.</li>
            <li>Authentic product, ships fast</li>
            <li>Drier than I was expecting but not bad.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s not a bad BB cream, it&#x27;s not something I would buy again.</li>
            <li>I was very excited this got to me fast because I was dying to try it.</li>
            <li>I do have to blot with a powder during the day, but this gives great coverage compared to some of the other BB creams that I&#x27;ve used (Stila, Lancome, Clinque).</li>
            <li>I wet my finger and put a dab on top of that to enable the product to spread more easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper than most decent foundations</li>
            <li>Of course I&#x27;ll always keep searching for a better BB cream, but this one definitely makes it onto my recommendations list :)</li>
            <li>It should be good for 12 months once it is opened, but because mine was made so long ago</li>
            <li>This BB cream is not very thin or light coverage, though, I would say it is light to medium coverage.</li>
            <li>I use sephora&#x27;s face primer under to control my oily skin, and I stay matte the whole day after I apply light powder.</li>
            <li>I have light olive skin and No. 23 matched me very well.</li>
            <li>and it is important to choose from a seller that you know carries the real</li>
            <li>I still wear concealer for my eyes, but I no longer wear foundation because I love the natural look it gives me.</li>
            <li>This bb cream has pretty good coverage, but the downside is that it&#x27;s kinda dry if you use it by itself.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also not as creamy (very watery based) and it does not hold coverage as well like the original.</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say anything about my wrinkles they are still there, mayby they will go in time but for right now there they are.</li>
            <li>only reason I gave this only 3 stars is because I found a better BB Cream from Maybelline, which is much cheaper, easier to find, sold at most drug store chains, and covers my skin and hydrates even better.</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad but for the first two days i had a headache when i first wore this producte</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t down to pay over $35 for a cream, and I wanted something that was going to control my oil better than most.</li>
            <li>It lasted me a whole year!</li>
            <li>At first i got scared beacuse</li>
            <li>This was the first bb cream that i bought so</li>
            <li>it has until this year, so just be aware of the date.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wondering if #25 would&#x27;ve been better, but I have this for now, and I definitely use it.</li>
            <li>Glad I finally did though!</li>
            <li>This was the real deal!</li>
            <li>No fake labels.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The BB Cream covered all of it pretty well, without making me look like I was wearing a ton of makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is awesome but beware of the fake stuff.</li>
            <li>This is the first BB cream I tried.</li>
            <li>The cover is close to medium but on the slightly heavier side so its great if you&#x27;re looking for a little more.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s an okay product and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>I am fair and tend to be pink, and have a few small spots of discoloration beginning, and this was perfect.  </li>
            <li>It have a funny smell, and applied very oily.</li>
            <li>now i don&#x27;t really notice the smell.</li>
            <li>It covers the face very well.</li>
            <li>I cleansed my face and left it product free for a couple of days and the irritation went away.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>So, I don&#x27;t know if really evens the tone out</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is the real thing.</li>
            <li>I have used the real thing and this cream is too liquidy.</li>
            <li>&quot; and I don&#x27;t think I gotten the real stuff.</li>
            <li>the real stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle I recieved does not look like these in the video below.</li>
            <li>like the quality of the cream, but the color does come off a bit gray straight from the tube.</li>
            <li>Moreover, it has a high SPF of 42!</li>
            <li>and i really like it.</li>
            <li>This product has a bit more coverage than other BB creams, but still not as much as a foundation.  </li>
            <li>in all, I think it&#x27;s a great product, especially for teenage girls like me who want something quick and easy to cover up some small and kinda big things around your face.</li>
            <li>Other than the expiration date, and the mangled packaging, everything seemed ok for her.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say I&#x27;ve only had it for a short time, It seems ok.</li>
            <li>but I can live with it!</li>
            <li>Might be less of a beige, and more of a grayish peach.  </li>
            <li>For undereyes, it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li>I used one layer over my face and then another layer over my problem areas which are mainly my cheeks.</li>
            <li>I am in love and I will purchase the larger size next time.</li>
            <li>This time, I only put it on one cheek and sure enough, another breakout that swelled up.</li>
            <li>Heads up for older skin....</li>
            <li>It can be drying on older skin and don&#x27;t use around the eyes.</li>
            <li>The coverage was decent.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Plus I got a little cute note along with it.</li>
            <li>The coverage its really good, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Normally, I would not leave the house without foundation, concealer, and powder to cover all that up.</li>
            <li>And I have normal skin.</li>
            <li>The seller was very generous to send me a second one because the first tube I got looked opened/used or someone had tampered with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It does not dry out my skin, and left a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>#23 blends quite well on me without looking super grey or unnatural, and</li>
            <li>Originally I was dejected to see that the expected shipping date was a month away after I purchased the product with no option of expedited shipping.</li>
            <li>it is from korea and i live in NJ.</li>
            <li>for the product, you have to be pretty pale skinned, even for an Asian to be able to use this without looking like a ghost.  </li>
            <li>I usually put it on like moisturizer and let it sit for a few and it oxidizes so beautiful.</li>
            <li>This is my first foundation cream thing and for my oily/combination skin with some mild acne it works well to even out the little bumps here and there.</li>
            <li>The cover overall is okay not too much but not too little</li>
            <li>so it didn&#x27;t take much of it to achieve a full covereage effect which is odd because I didn&#x27;t think a BB cream could do that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m soo surprised it got here wayyyy before the estimated delivery date!</li>
            <li>I think the price is good, the only negative thing is it does not last all day, probably more like half a day</li>
            <li>, I have a pretty nice tan in the summer and don&#x27;t know why i would want to whiten my skin...sounds creepy</li>
            <li>I am 45, and covering imperfections is becoming harder and harder as I get older.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to think of something negative to say since I sound like a raving maniac, but I really can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I tried using it itself heavily AND lightly - still didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I also have quite a bit of post-acne discoloration as well as some old acne scars.</li>
            <li>Now, I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin at all, I would stay far away from this...</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I bought the natural beige.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a sucker for it &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>It arrived directly from Seoul, South Korea.</li>
            <li>The problem for me was that it doesn&#x27;t really soak into my skin, and starts melting off by mid day.</li>
            <li>I will definately be placing an order for the 50 ml version of this BB Cream next week once I&#x27;ve tried this one out for a few more days.</li>
            <li>but it doesnt Long too much</li>
            <li>So as this is my first experience with BB creams I&#x27;ve not much to write.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin, but nothing too extreme.</li>
            <li>I do not use a whole lot, just enough to cover some blemishes and red spots on my face.</li>
            <li>cuz I can pretty much smell that in the next few hours after I put makeup on.</li>
            <li>I never get acne, so this reaction took me majorly off guard.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t speak for other features of this cream like brightening or evenning out the tone because my skin color is pretty even.</li>
            <li>It goes on a little odd at first, resembling watered down clay, but within a few seconds it absorbs and you&#x27;re left with a beautiful, natural looking complexion.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to say my skin gets pretty dark during the summer</li>
            <li>I read and watched a lot of reviews before buying a sample of this product thinking it would be better for my t-zone oily skin in summer, but it ended up breaking me out pretty bad, left more of an unpleasant &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; rather then a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;, and has a really strong gray undertone.</li>
            <li>I would say this color BB cream is very close to what other cosmetic companies call \\&quot;buff.\\</li>
            <li>Well, I was not disappointed in the least.</li>
            <li>had been looking for a BB cream for a few months and did a little research on the internet and found that most people say that Korean BB cream is the way to go, so I ordered this one.</li>
            <li>I also have dry skin, so it is difficult to find a product that offers good coverage that doesn&#x27;t end up looking dry and</li>
            <li>And personally I wish it spread easier, if you aren&#x27;t careful its easy to apply too thickly.</li>
            <li>had so much hope for this, it just fell a little short of my expectations.</li>

            <li> too see which ones you like the best.</li>
            <li> But, as soon as a rubbed it in it blended in with my skin tone perfectly.</li>
            <li> This covered flawlessly.</li>
            <li> This is awesome!</li>
            <li> The color matches perfectly to my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking this #23 will be perfect for winter, and maybe I&#x27;ll get around to getting a #25 for the summer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s brilliant!</li>
            <li> but it turned out to be great!</li>
            <li> Altough it wasnt my correct skin color, it blends  perfectly.</li>
            <li> I found that Benefit Beauty Balm works best for me after I stopped using this one.</li>
            <li> and it smoothed my skin wonderfully!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve read in the reviews that the best BB creams come from Korea.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> So, this worked for me perfectly.</li>
            <li> Perfect shade for me</li>
            <li> and it was the perfect size to try it out</li>
            <li> The tone and shade matches me PERFECTLY which was also awesome.</li>
            <li> I heard good things about the Missha Perfect Cover (from Bubzbeauty,</li>
            <li> The finish is great and it wears well over the day.</li>
            <li> This item is great, it matches my skin tone</li>
            <li> It also smells really nice, and the best part is that this BB cream stays put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product has great coverage without feeling to cake-y, but the downfall to this product is that it smells like you&#x27;re putting a layer of perfume all over your face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another great feature is, it doesn&#x27;t cake.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great alternative to any foundation I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is very nice.</li>
            <li> i think im going to look around for more bb cream to see which one i like the best.</li>
            <li> I love this product and the color is just perfect for the color of my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin feels great with a good cover.</li>
            <li> texture is great and coverage is amazing but even at no. 23</li>
            <li> but the cover is good.</li>
            <li> The date on the box says it was manufactured in 2012, but the seller said the expiration date is good until August this year.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my friend, she loved it.</li>
            <li> It says it&#x27;s good for your skin</li>
            <li> Wonderful ingredients, good skin care properties, but only for the very fair folk, even in Caucasian skin tones!  </li>
            <li> This BB cream is not bad, but I wasn&#x27;t really impressed with it.</li>
            <li> If you want something that will make your face flawless then you should look around for more bb creams that has a better coverage.</li>
            <li> The fresh effect is the best thing</li>
            <li> Anyway, it has a very pleasant mild smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I made that decision because now I use it every day!</li>
            <li> I got so many compliments today!</li>
            <li> I went into Google and typed in &amp;#34;best BB creams for oily skin&amp;#34; and this was in the top 3!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> The product itself is amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought this after wanting to try bb creams because of the amazing skin the girls who wear them have and I do not regret it at all.</li>
            <li> I liked that it had an olive tone to it</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase it after read many good reviews about it.</li>
            <li> The best part is that it&#x27;s VERY affordable.</li>
            <li> Gives my face a nice even look.</li>
            <li> I brought this on, kind of mistake.</li>
            <li> is perfect , for oily skin is excellent ..leaves a fresh, natural finish, lasts all day ..</li>
            <li> Nice cream.</li>
            <li> The delivery was quick &amp; the price was great.  </li>
            <li> Light, yet good coverage and no streaking.</li>
            <li> perfect for my acne prone sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It don&#x27;t even cover as well as the very cheap BB cream.</li>
            <li> Oh and It came with a free sample of another of Missha&#x27;s BB creams so thats always a plus :) Cute packaging too!     </li>
            <li> I love Missha BB cream</li>
            <li> After using this product for about a week, I&#x27;ve found it is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad that I bought this product.</li>
            <li> It glides on smoothly and blends amazingly to my skin.</li>
            <li> i think it&#x27;s an okay producte.</li>
            <li> i will be buying more bb creams just test out the bb creams</li>
            <li> I Love this bb cream</li>
            <li> I used this BB cream and it covered all that, evened out my tone, minimized my redness, and gave me a healthy looking glow.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more ASAP</li>
            <li> I thought most BB creams were supposed to make your skin radiant and newer looking, but this one serves more as a foundation/sunscreen for oily skin.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price and, believe it or not, one tube has lasted me more than a month.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Just try and make sure you try and find your shade.</li>
            <li> I love love love this BB cream.</li>
            <li> I love this for makeup.</li>
            <li> For someone who has blotchy skin, as I do, with lingering scars from teenage acne, this is a wonderful product.  </li>
            <li> I have just started using it, and haven&#x27;t formed a decision yet as to whether or not I like the actual product, but as I said, service was excellent.</li>
            <li> I like the texture better than the foundations I have been using.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but this color was too gray for my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> and I love it because I didn&#x27;t look so cakey.</li>
            <li> The color is ashy-grey, but blends ok.</li>
            <li> My missha bb cream came way earlier than it was supposed to, which was awesome.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t break me out but gives a nice clean and healthy look.</li>
            <li> just wanted something with light coverage, suitable for oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Best face product I&#x27;ve bought in a long time.</li>
            <li> Not old makeup; not knock off; and the seller was great with extras and packaging!</li>
            <li> first, I loved this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really perfect for someone who would need a tinted moisterizer, but wants something with more benefits, or someone who wants light coverage.</li>
            <li> I got this because I&#x27;d heard a lot of good and great things about it, and I also love it, but I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the slightly chalky look I get on my face after I apply it.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s easy to apply and not thick and gives good coverage and coverage is build able.</li>
            <li> I wanted a buildable foundation that was easy to apply.</li>
            <li> So easy to apply, blends well, and is buildable.</li>
            <li> The item was received very quickly.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong but bearable.</li>
            <li> Seems to have pretty good color, unlike many BB creams which can be funny tones.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product at first.  </li>
            <li> It does not change the texture of my skin which is great for me because I already take good care of my skin and need very little coverage for redness.</li>
            <li> I liked the color and consistency of this cream and the positive reviews inspired me to purchase it.</li>
            <li> It was a bit light for my skin</li>
            <li> But I like using it for the sunscreen, And it covers light scars on my face.</li>
            <li> bought this for me but color was too light</li>
            <li> I like to think I am a moderately light colored person</li>
            <li> but this product was too light for me.</li>
            <li> I have light-medium skin and have been using a light self-tanner</li>
            <li> it was still too light for my olive medium skin tone</li>
            <li> I set it with a mineral powder which really helps to evenly cover everything for a nice powder finish.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> Golden beige was better for my skin.</li>
            <li> The product is creamy, and light weight which is always a plus.</li>
            <li> My primary issue is thatI am allergic to some ingredient in the item.</li>
            <li> Being fair, I used this cream one more time to double check that it caused skin irritation.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The color, Natural Beige, was a good match for my skin.</li>
            <li> :) Btw, I&#x27;m half-asain and am about a NC25 right now during summer.</li>
            <li> Very nice consistency, have to use a small amount, this is too light for me, makes the skin look smooth, and helps with discolorations, but have to mix it with darker foundations, this seems to be the problem with most oriental bb creams !  </li>
            <li> If you have pink undertones and very fair skin get a different shade, but it has good medium coverage without feeling or looking caked on for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m soooooo excited to use it</li>
            <li> When I first put the product on I thought it looked a bit darker, more gray than my skin.</li>
            <li> It is a resonable price &amp; covers great &amp; lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> because when I get it out of the tube and put it on my face, it appears significantly lighter than my skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot lighter than the original</li>
            <li> Be aware though that because its slightly more coverage, that it can get a bit oily towards the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It really softens up your face and makes it more whiter be sure to get your color right.</li>
            <li> Its not the exact perfect match in comparison to the Banila Co&#x27;s Be Touched Yellow Beige, which was discontinued, but I guess its as good as it gets until I keep trying other brands.</li>
            <li> so I am not an easy match right now.</li>
            <li> For comparison, my skin tone is around W4 from loreal true match foundation.</li>
            <li> I much prefer Shills Magic BB cream as it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Authentic product, ships fast</li>
            <li> Drier than I was expecting but not bad.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s not a bad BB cream, it&#x27;s not something I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I was very excited this got to me fast because I was dying to try it.</li>
            <li> I do have to blot with a powder during the day, but this gives great coverage compared to some of the other BB creams that I&#x27;ve used (Stila, Lancome, Clinque).</li>
            <li> I wet my finger and put a dab on top of that to enable the product to spread more easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper than most decent foundations</li>
            <li> Of course I&#x27;ll always keep searching for a better BB cream, but this one definitely makes it onto my recommendations list :)</li>
            <li> It should be good for 12 months once it is opened, but because mine was made so long ago</li>
            <li> This BB cream is not very thin or light coverage, though, I would say it is light to medium coverage.</li>
            <li> I use sephora&#x27;s face primer under to control my oily skin, and I stay matte the whole day after I apply light powder.</li>
            <li> I have light olive skin and No. 23 matched me very well.</li>
            <li> and it is important to choose from a seller that you know carries the real</li>
            <li> I still wear concealer for my eyes, but I no longer wear foundation because I love the natural look it gives me.</li>
            <li> This bb cream has pretty good coverage, but the downside is that it&#x27;s kinda dry if you use it by itself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not as creamy (very watery based) and it does not hold coverage as well like the original.</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say anything about my wrinkles they are still there, mayby they will go in time but for right now there they are.</li>
            <li> only reason I gave this only 3 stars is because I found a better BB Cream from Maybelline, which is much cheaper, easier to find, sold at most drug store chains, and covers my skin and hydrates even better.</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad but for the first two days i had a headache when i first wore this producte</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t down to pay over $35 for a cream, and I wanted something that was going to control my oil better than most.</li>
            <li> It lasted me a whole year!</li>
            <li> At first i got scared beacuse</li>
            <li> This was the first bb cream that i bought so</li>
            <li> it has until this year, so just be aware of the date.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if #25 would&#x27;ve been better, but I have this for now, and I definitely use it.</li>
            <li> Glad I finally did though!</li>
            <li> This was the real deal!</li>
            <li> No fake labels.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The BB Cream covered all of it pretty well, without making me look like I was wearing a ton of makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is awesome but beware of the fake stuff.</li>
            <li> This is the first BB cream I tried.</li>
            <li> The cover is close to medium but on the slightly heavier side so its great if you&#x27;re looking for a little more.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s an okay product and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I am fair and tend to be pink, and have a few small spots of discoloration beginning, and this was perfect.  </li>
            <li> It have a funny smell, and applied very oily.</li>
            <li> now i don&#x27;t really notice the smell.</li>
            <li> It covers the face very well.</li>
            <li> I cleansed my face and left it product free for a couple of days and the irritation went away.</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> So, I don&#x27;t know if really evens the tone out</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the real thing.</li>
            <li> I have used the real thing and this cream is too liquidy.</li>
            <li> &quot; and I don&#x27;t think I gotten the real stuff.</li>
            <li> the real stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle I recieved does not look like these in the video below.</li>
            <li> like the quality of the cream, but the color does come off a bit gray straight from the tube.</li>
            <li> Moreover, it has a high SPF of 42!</li>
            <li> and i really like it.</li>
            <li> This product has a bit more coverage than other BB creams, but still not as much as a foundation.  </li>
            <li> in all, I think it&#x27;s a great product, especially for teenage girls like me who want something quick and easy to cover up some small and kinda big things around your face.</li>
            <li> Other than the expiration date, and the mangled packaging, everything seemed ok for her.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say I&#x27;ve only had it for a short time, It seems ok.</li>
            <li> but I can live with it!</li>
            <li> Might be less of a beige, and more of a grayish peach.  </li>
            <li> For undereyes, it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li> I used one layer over my face and then another layer over my problem areas which are mainly my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I am in love and I will purchase the larger size next time.</li>
            <li> This time, I only put it on one cheek and sure enough, another breakout that swelled up.</li>
            <li> Heads up for older skin....</li>
            <li> It can be drying on older skin and don&#x27;t use around the eyes.</li>
            <li> The coverage was decent.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Plus I got a little cute note along with it.</li>
            <li> The coverage its really good, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Normally, I would not leave the house without foundation, concealer, and powder to cover all that up.</li>
            <li> And I have normal skin.</li>
            <li> The seller was very generous to send me a second one because the first tube I got looked opened/used or someone had tampered with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does not dry out my skin, and left a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> #23 blends quite well on me without looking super grey or unnatural, and</li>
            <li> Originally I was dejected to see that the expected shipping date was a month away after I purchased the product with no option of expedited shipping.</li>
            <li> it is from korea and i live in NJ.</li>
            <li> for the product, you have to be pretty pale skinned, even for an Asian to be able to use this without looking like a ghost.  </li>
            <li> I usually put it on like moisturizer and let it sit for a few and it oxidizes so beautiful.</li>
            <li> This is my first foundation cream thing and for my oily/combination skin with some mild acne it works well to even out the little bumps here and there.</li>
            <li> The cover overall is okay not too much but not too little</li>
            <li> so it didn&#x27;t take much of it to achieve a full covereage effect which is odd because I didn&#x27;t think a BB cream could do that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m soo surprised it got here wayyyy before the estimated delivery date!</li>
            <li> I think the price is good, the only negative thing is it does not last all day, probably more like half a day</li>
            <li> , I have a pretty nice tan in the summer and don&#x27;t know why i would want to whiten my skin...sounds creepy</li>
            <li> I am 45, and covering imperfections is becoming harder and harder as I get older.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to think of something negative to say since I sound like a raving maniac, but I really can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I tried using it itself heavily AND lightly - still didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I also have quite a bit of post-acne discoloration as well as some old acne scars.</li>
            <li> Now, I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin at all, I would stay far away from this...</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I bought the natural beige.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for it &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> It arrived directly from Seoul, South Korea.</li>
            <li> The problem for me was that it doesn&#x27;t really soak into my skin, and starts melting off by mid day.</li>
            <li> I will definately be placing an order for the 50 ml version of this BB Cream next week once I&#x27;ve tried this one out for a few more days.</li>
            <li> but it doesnt Long too much</li>
            <li> So as this is my first experience with BB creams I&#x27;ve not much to write.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin, but nothing too extreme.</li>
            <li> I do not use a whole lot, just enough to cover some blemishes and red spots on my face.</li>
            <li> cuz I can pretty much smell that in the next few hours after I put makeup on.</li>
            <li> I never get acne, so this reaction took me majorly off guard.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t speak for other features of this cream like brightening or evenning out the tone because my skin color is pretty even.</li>
            <li> It goes on a little odd at first, resembling watered down clay, but within a few seconds it absorbs and you&#x27;re left with a beautiful, natural looking complexion.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to say my skin gets pretty dark during the summer</li>
            <li> I read and watched a lot of reviews before buying a sample of this product thinking it would be better for my t-zone oily skin in summer, but it ended up breaking me out pretty bad, left more of an unpleasant &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; rather then a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;, and has a really strong gray undertone.</li>
            <li> I would say this color BB cream is very close to what other cosmetic companies call \\&quot;buff.\\</li>
            <li> Well, I was not disappointed in the least.</li>
            <li> had been looking for a BB cream for a few months and did a little research on the internet and found that most people say that Korean BB cream is the way to go, so I ordered this one.</li>
            <li> I also have dry skin, so it is difficult to find a product that offers good coverage that doesn&#x27;t end up looking dry and</li>
            <li> And personally I wish it spread easier, if you aren&#x27;t careful its easy to apply too thickly.</li>
            <li> had so much hope for this, it just fell a little short of my expectations.</li>
            <li> Out of the tube it has a slight cast of grey, but it does blend very well.</li>
            <li> I bought this way back and still using it, it last so long</li>
            <li> It gave me a large painful pimple on my forehead that went away very quickly after I stopped using this BB cream.</li>
            <li> I gave this a 4 because I have not used the product long enough but will update once I do.</li>
            <li> But seeing as how I can wear it during the hot summer without feeling like it&#x27;s too thick for my combination skin, I&#x27;d say this one&#x27;s a winner.</li>
            <li> only two weeks after I ordered it, WAY earlier than the expected time.    </li>
            <li> I do not really have wrinkles yet, but am starting to get lines around my eyes and a tightness above my lips.</li>
            <li> It does a relatively good job covering imperfections, although it is not a replacement for concealer or base if you have any big flaws.  </li>
            <li> I was wary of buying this bb cream because I heard it was of light color, while I have tan skin.</li>
            <li> If it is manufacture date , how long is the shelf life. ?</li>
            <li> Shipping took a long time with today&#x27;s standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I went back to using my other makeup with no issue.</li>
            <li> The content is much smaller than other brands.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and other foundations used to become obvious after the oil on my nose</li>
            <li> After being disappointed with many BB creams ordered off Amazon, I decided to start buying them in smaller sizes (usually sample sizes just don&#x27;t do the trick, and I question whether the quality of the samples are the same quality of the actual product</li>
            <li> but I noticed that I needed less product than I used to need with foundation to cover my entire face.</li>
            <li> It made all parts of my skin very dry.</li>
            <li> What it did do was last all of 3 hours before peeling off in hundreds of little sheets.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> However I was extremely elated when it showed up on my doorstep</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended it to all my other friends.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer stated the expiration date was past, but my daughter still likes the product overall.  </li>
            <li> I have thrown out all of my other foundations and will use this exclusively.  </li>
            <li> Like the fact that it&#x27;s not greasy, It  stays on even when you get wet from rain, it does seem to make the dark spots lighter or gone while you have it on.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really prove that it&#x27;s fake unless you are a chemist so there is not much you can do about it.</li>
            <li> Beats the other brands hands down.</li>
            <li> A small portion can go a long way.</li>
            <li> but in neutrogena I am Nude 40 which is a teeny bit dark for me.     </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it doesn&#x27;t provide too dark of a coverage (for darker acne scars and whatnot).</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with it is the tube is SO SMALL!</li>
            <li> I also have one line in my forehead and a chicken pox scar from my childhood right between my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I tried mixing it with maybe a slightly darker foundation but that still didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It gave a grey cast to my face and was thick.</li>
            <li> I have very pale Caucasian skin with pink undertones.</li>
            <li> Its just a little greyer than suits me.</li>
            <li> I noticed that it still makes me a little shiny around my nose, which is the oiliest part of my face, but that just might be because I moisturize before I put on the BB cream.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed, as I was genuinely excited about this cream.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so small and not worth the price.</li>
            <li> However, I received it in less than two weeks!</li>
            <li> The only real complaint I had was that it made me break out.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately there isn&#x27;t a shade dark enough for my skin when it&#x27;s tanned, and my skin did get a shade or two darker in the past year or so.</li>
            <li> I have used foundations ever since I started wanting more coverage but over time I knew that wearing it almost everyday is horrible for my skin.</li>
            <li> So I usually combine this with another foundation.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it was supposed to do it</li>
            <li> At least, it did on me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been years since my skin had a negative reaction to any makeup product.</li>
            <li> I still use makeup with dyes and artificial stuff (some Clinique, Benefit, Sephora brand, Urban Decay, and some cheaper stuff like NYX, ELF,</li>
            <li> It felt like a thick greasy slime on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s just me but be warned!</li>
            <li> However, when I used it for the first time, my skin had a terrible reaction.</li>
            <li> Either it&#x27;s fake or I gotten a really bad mixed batch.</li>
            <li> this product is made for yellow base skin.  </li>
            <li> This created patches of broken out blister looking things on my chin, cheek and forehead.</li>
            <li> I purchased the 23 color for when I use fake tanner.</li>
            <li> this cancelled out the orange from the fake tan.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it wasn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I am a mac nc 20-30 depending on the season and it matched both for me as crazy as that sounds.</li>
            <li> Nothing bad to say.</li>
            <li> It was bad.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have bad skin</li>
            <li> and it made my skin very uncomfortable!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love Missha BB cream but this company tricked me with 20 ml when others are 50 ml and it is out of date.  I definitely WILL NOT order from them again.  SHAME ON YOU!!!</li>
            <li> This product has a bit more coverage than other BB creams, but still not as much as a foundation.  Seems to have pretty good color, unlike many BB creams which can be funny tones.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I heard rave reviews on it from youtube and blogs. I wanted a buildable foundation that was easy to apply. I was wary of buying this bb cream because I heard it was of light color, while I have tan skin. For comparison, my skin tone is around W4 from loreal true match foundation. After using this product for about a week, I&#x27;ve found it is fantastic! So easy to apply, blends well, and is buildable. I use it with no problems to conceal my break outs. For undereyes, it&#x27;s decent. Out of the tube it has a slight cast of grey, but it does blend very well. I use sephora&#x27;s face primer under to control my oily skin, and I stay matte the whole day after I apply light powder. It&#x27;s really perfect for someone who would need a tinted moisterizer, but wants something with more benefits, or someone who wants light coverage. Perfect for a teenager. For the price, I advice you test it out. It&#x27;s cheaper than most decent foundations</li>
            <li> The reason I did not like this product was because it gave me achme and it made my skin very uncomfortable! I also don&#x27;t like the way it smells....</li>
            <li> I have very pale Caucasian skin with pink undertones. I purchased the 23 color for when I use fake tanner. I liked that it had an olive tone to it b/c this cancelled out the orange from the fake tan. I would say this color BB cream is very close to what other cosmetic companies call \\&quot;buff.\\&quot; It did not oxidate, or turn orange, on me like it did with another reviewer.    What it did do was last all of 3 hours before peeling off in hundreds of little sheets. It made all parts of my skin very dry. I did not apply any primer and I set it with Palatang Theatrical Powder. I much prefer Shills Magic BB cream as it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> This bb cream has pretty good coverage, but the downside is that it&#x27;s kinda dry if you use it by itself. So I usually combine this with another foundation. Another things is all of Missha products have a scent, which bothers me sometime cuz I can pretty much smell that in the next few hours after I put makeup on. Overall, it&#x27;s an okay product and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Drier than I was expecting but not bad. The finish is great and it wears well over the day. Its just a little greyer than suits me. And personally I wish it spread easier, if you aren&#x27;t careful its easy to apply too thickly. This kills the skin-finish. Oh and it lasts FOREVER. At least, it did on me. It lasted me a whole year!</li>
            <li> this product is made for yellow base skin.  I love that it&#x27;s easy to apply and not thick and gives good coverage and coverage is build able.</li>
            <li> Ahhh* I&#x27;m soo surprised it got here wayyyy before the estimated delivery date! I literally screamed when I got this in the Mail today. It was a bit light for my skin but I can live with it! I&#x27;m soooooo excited to use it &amp; Plus I got a little cute note along with it.</li>
            <li> It have a funny smell, and applied very oily. But I like using it for the sunscreen, And it covers light scars on my face.</li>
            <li> bought this for me but color was too light so my daughter got it and she loves the coverage and stay power</li>
            <li> Originally I was dejected to see that the expected shipping date was a month away after I purchased the product with no option of expedited shipping. However I was extremely elated when it showed up on my doorstep only two weeks after I ordered it, WAY earlier than the expected time.    The product itself is amazing. I decided to purchase it after read many good reviews about it. I&#x27;m glad I made that decision because now I use it every day! It makes my skin look flawless and I like the texture. A small portion can go a long way. I&#x27;m really glad that I bought this product.</li>
            <li> The delivery was quick &amp; the price was great.  I bought this on a whim. My boyfriend is Asian and his sisters rave about BB creams.   It glides on smoothly and blends amazingly to my skin. I haven&#x27;t used my department store make up since getting Missha BB cream. I&#x27;ve recommended it to all my other friends.</li>
            <li> So I just received this today and My delivery estimate was from Aug 17-Sep7th! I was very happy because i thought I;d have to wait longer since its from s korea.     So as this is my first experience with BB creams I&#x27;ve not much to write. However this color suits my skin perfectly. I was afraid it wasn&#x27;t so I looked for the darker versions but could not find it on amazon and decided to give this a try since its only 20ml. I cannot tell you my NC since I haven&#x27;t used MAC powder in forever but in neutrogena I am Nude 40 which is a teeny bit dark for me.     I will definately be placing an order for the 50 ml version of this BB Cream next week once I&#x27;ve tried this one out for a few more days. Oh and It came with a free sample of another of Missha&#x27;s BB creams so thats always a plus :) Cute packaging too!     I gave this a 4 because I have not used the product long enough but will update once I do.</li>
            <li> The item was received very quickly. My concern is that it has a date on the bottom of the container which appears to be that the date has expired. I am assuming this is what it is.</li>
            <li> i think it&#x27;s an okay producte. The coverage dosen&#x27;t cover up everything but it does some cover up. It really softens up your face and makes it more whiter be sure to get your color right. At first i got scared beacuse when i took some on my finger the color was a darkish brown but once you put it on it blends out and whitens your face. If your looking for something just to cover up some things on your face then get this producte. If you want something that will make your face flawless then you should look around for more bb creams that has a better coverage. The smell is not bad but for the first two days i had a headache when i first wore this producte but i think you get used to it beacuse now i don&#x27;t really notice the smell. The cover overall is okay not too much but not too little i think im going to look around for more bb cream to see which one i like the best. This was the first bb cream that i bought so i will be buying more bb creams just test out the bb creams too see which ones you like the best.</li>
            <li> I Love this bb cream but it doesnt Long too much but the cover is good. The fresh effect is the best thing</li>
            <li> I have light olive skin and No. 23 matched me very well. I was worried because it comes out looking like it would be too gray for my skin, but it blended well! If you have pink undertones and very fair skin get a different shade, but it has good medium coverage without feeling or looking caked on for me. I still wear concealer for my eyes, but I no longer wear foundation because I love the natural look it gives me. The date on the box says it was manufactured in 2012, but the seller said the expiration date is good until August this year. It should be good for 12 months once it is opened, but because mine was made so long ago it has until this year, so just be aware of the date. I think the price is good, the only negative thing is it does not last all day, probably more like half a day but I still would recommend.</li>
            <li> I like to think I am a moderately light colored person but this product was too light for me. I tried mixing it with maybe a slightly darker foundation but that still didn&#x27;t work. I tried using it itself heavily AND lightly - still didn&#x27;t work. The bb cream also gives off a grayish tint? I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s just me but be warned! That could happen to you.</li>
            <li> I was very excited this got to me fast because I was dying to try it. Well, I was not disappointed in the least. I have light-medium skin and have been using a light self-tanner so I am not an easy match right now. When I first put the product on I thought it looked a bit darker, more gray than my skin. But, as soon as a rubbed it in it blended in with my skin tone perfectly. I also have quite a bit of post-acne discoloration as well as some old acne scars. Normally, I would not leave the house without foundation, concealer, and powder to cover all that up. Not today! I used this BB cream and it covered all that, evened out my tone, minimized my redness, and gave me a healthy looking glow. I used one layer over my face and then another layer over my problem areas which are mainly my cheeks. This covered flawlessly. I got so many compliments today! I work in a salon so we talk about makeup and such a lot. One of my coworkers asked what I was doing because I had supermodel skin. I will be ordering more ASAP so I don&#x27;t run out. I&#x27;m trying to think of something negative to say since I sound like a raving maniac, but I really can&#x27;t. This is awesome!</li>
            <li> I went into Google and typed in &amp;#34;best BB creams for oily skin&amp;#34; and this was in the top 3! The best part is that it&#x27;s VERY affordable. I wasn&#x27;t down to pay over $35 for a cream, and I wanted something that was going to control my oil better than most. I do have to blot with a powder during the day, but this gives great coverage compared to some of the other BB creams that I&#x27;ve used (Stila, Lancome, Clinque). The one thing I will say is that I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s improving my skin (at all). I thought most BB creams were supposed to make your skin radiant and newer looking, but this one serves more as a foundation/sunscreen for oily skin. I definitely recommend you try it. You can&#x27;t beat the price and, believe it or not, one tube has lasted me more than a month. I&#x27;m sold on this MISSHA BB Cream.</li>
            <li> texture is great and coverage is amazing but even at no. 23 it was still too light for my olive medium skin tone</li>
            <li> This item is great, it matches my skin tone just right. I do not use a whole lot, just enough to cover some blemishes and red spots on my face. I would buy this item again.</li>
            <li> I have used foundations ever since I started wanting more coverage but over time I knew that wearing it almost everyday is horrible for my skin. I bought this after wanting to try bb creams because of the amazing skin the girls who wear them have and I do not regret it at all. I usually put it on like moisturizer and let it sit for a few and it oxidizes so beautiful. I am a mac nc 20-30 depending on the season and it matched both for me as crazy as that sounds. I am in love and I will purchase the larger size next time. Nothing bad to say.</li>
            <li> Goes on silky and with ease. The color matches perfectly to my skin tone. Gives my face a nice even look.</li>
            <li> I love this product and the color is just perfect for the color of my skin. This is the second one I buy and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Unfortunately there isn&#x27;t a shade dark enough for my skin when it&#x27;s tanned, and my skin did get a shade or two darker in the past year or so.</li>
            <li> I got this because I&#x27;d heard a lot of good and great things about it, and I also love it, but I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the slightly chalky look I get on my face after I apply it. I&#x27;m wondering if #25 would&#x27;ve been better, but I have this for now, and I definitely use it. This is my first foundation cream thing and for my oily/combination skin with some mild acne it works well to even out the little bumps here and there. I use it kinda like a concealer I guess, since I just used it on my acne. I noticed that it still makes me a little shiny around my nose, which is the oiliest part of my face, but that just might be because I moisturize before I put on the BB cream. I set it with a mineral powder which really helps to evenly cover everything for a nice powder finish.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think it&#x27;s a great product, especially for teenage girls like me who want something quick and easy to cover up some small and kinda big things around your face. Just try and make sure you try and find your shade. I&#x27;m thinking this #23 will be perfect for winter, and maybe I&#x27;ll get around to getting a #25 for the summer. :) Btw, I&#x27;m half-asain and am about a NC25 right now during summer.</li>
            <li> It covers the face very well. It has a gray tint that covers my blemishes.</li>
            <li> I liked the color and consistency of this cream and the positive reviews inspired me to purchase it. However, when I used it for the first time, my skin had a terrible reaction. Now, I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin. It&#x27;s been years since my skin had a negative reaction to any makeup product. This created patches of broken out blister looking things on my chin, cheek and forehead. I never get acne, so this reaction took me majorly off guard. The patches ended up looking like welts and swelling up. It was bad. I cleansed my face and left it product free for a couple of days and the irritation went away. I went back to using my other makeup with no issue. Being fair, I used this cream one more time to double check that it caused skin irritation. This time, I only put it on one cheek and sure enough, another breakout that swelled up. So this is a no go for me. I am so disappointed, as I was genuinely excited about this cream. I don&#x27;t have reactions like this, so I know it is something in this cream, I just don&#x27;t know what the irritant is. And I have normal skin. If you have sensitive skin at all, I would stay far away from this...</li>
            <li> Light, yet good coverage and no streaking. Love it! Beats the other brands hands down. Will definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> Best face product I&#x27;ve bought in a long time. I don&#x27;t know what I would do without this. Heads up for older skin....you MUST use moisturizer under this. It can be drying on older skin and don&#x27;t use around the eyes.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my friend, she loved it.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer stated the expiration date was past, but my daughter still likes the product overall.  Other than the expiration date, and the mangled packaging, everything seemed ok for her.</li>
            <li> After being disappointed with many BB creams ordered off Amazon, I decided to start buying them in smaller sizes (usually sample sizes just don&#x27;t do the trick, and I question whether the quality of the samples are the same quality of the actual product anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I heard good things about the Missha Perfect Cover (from Bubzbeauty, oh haaay!) but I don&#x27;t know why I never got around to trying it. Glad I finally did though! I love love love this BB cream. #23 blends quite well on me without looking super grey or unnatural, and I&#x27;d like to say my skin gets pretty dark during the summer (I&#x27;m Asian). It also smells really nice, and the best part is that this BB cream stays put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it doesn&#x27;t provide too dark of a coverage (for darker acne scars and whatnot). But seeing as how I can wear it during the hot summer without feeling like it&#x27;s too thick for my combination skin, I&#x27;d say this one&#x27;s a winner. Of course I&#x27;ll always keep searching for a better BB cream, but this one definitely makes it onto my recommendations list :)</li>
            <li> Authentic product, ships fast even tho it is from korea and i live in NJ. My skin has improved in the month i have been using this Missha bb cream.</li>
            <li> I was watching the Dr. Oz show &amp; this cream was being recommended.  I ordered some immediately.  I have sensitive skin and I have tolerated the cream with nary a problem.  I wish I had gone a shade darker.  I bought the natural beige.  Need a medium shade.  I do like it.  A little goes a long ways. I wet my finger and put a dab on top of that to enable the product to spread more easily.</li>
            <li> I love this for makeup. It is a resonable price &amp; covers great &amp; lasts a long time. I use it all the time &amp; always reorder.</li>
            <li> For someone who has blotchy skin, as I do, with lingering scars from teenage acne, this is a wonderful product.  I have thrown out all of my other foundations and will use this exclusively.  It covers all of my flaws without looking like I&#x27;ve caked on foundation or mineral powder.  It goes on a little odd at first, resembling watered down clay, but within a few seconds it absorbs and you&#x27;re left with a beautiful, natural looking complexion.  I will never use another product again.  I just wish I had found this product 10 years ago.  It&#x27;s brilliant!</li>
            <li> So far, so good. The content is much smaller than other brands. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short time so I will report back later if I find issues.</li>
            <li> This was the real deal! No fake labels.  I was a little worried ( you always have to be! ) but it turned out to be great! Not old makeup; not knock off; and the seller was great with extras and packaging! I&#x27;m a sucker for it &#x3D;) Thanks!</li>
            <li> I really liked this product at first.  I am 45, and covering imperfections is becoming harder and harder as I get older.  I also have dry skin, so it is difficult to find a product that offers good coverage that doesn&#x27;t end up looking dry and cakey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I loved this. It does a relatively good job covering imperfections, although it is not a replacement for concealer or base if you have any big flaws.  It does not dry out my skin, and left a smooth finish. I suspect people with oily skin may not find it works as well for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color, Natural Beige, was a good match for my skin. I am fair and tend to be pink, and have a few small spots of discoloration beginning, and this was perfect.  It also made my skin look younger. I do not really have wrinkles yet, but am starting to get lines around my eyes and a tightness above my lips. I also have one line in my forehead and a chicken pox scar from my childhood right between my eyes.  The BB Cream covered all of it pretty well, without making me look like I was wearing a ton of makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave this only 3 stars is because I found a better BB Cream from Maybelline, which is much cheaper, easier to find, sold at most drug store chains, and covers my skin and hydrates even better.</li>
            <li> Very nice consistency, have to use a small amount, this is too light for me, makes the skin look smooth, and helps with discolorations, but have to mix it with darker foundations, this seems to be the problem with most oriental bb creams !  Wonderful ingredients, good skin care properties, but only for the very fair folk, even in Caucasian skin tones!  I can&#x27;t imagine what it would do to latina, or African American skin tones!</li>
            <li> I was told that this item would take several weeks to arrive, as It was shipping from Seoul, Korea. However, I received it in less than two weeks! I have just started using it, and haven&#x27;t formed a decision yet as to whether or not I like the actual product, but as I said, service was excellent.</li>
            <li> 2012-8-25 . production date , expiring date ? If it is manufacture date , how long is the shelf life. ? We have to treat is as expired . never buy again</li>
            <li> Altough it wasnt my correct skin color, it blends  perfectly. My skin feels great with a good cover. I really like it</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin, but nothing too extreme. I still use makeup with dyes and artificial stuff (some Clinique, Benefit, Sephora brand, Urban Decay, and some cheaper stuff like NYX, ELF, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been looking for a BB cream for a few months and did a little research on the internet and found that most people say that Korean BB cream is the way to go, so I ordered this one. The coverage its really good, a little goes a long way. The smell is strong but bearable. The only real complaint I had was that it made me break out. It gave me a large painful pimple on my forehead that went away very quickly after I stopped using this BB cream. It says it&#x27;s good for your skin but I think there MUST be some pore-clogging ingredient in it that just didn&#x27;t agree with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had so much hope for this, it just fell a little short of my expectations. I found that Benefit Beauty Balm works best for me after I stopped using this one.</li>
            <li> I brought this on, kind of mistake. It&#x27;s so small and not worth the price. They selling a sample size?</li>
            <li> This product has great coverage without feeling to cake-y, but the downfall to this product is that it smells like you&#x27;re putting a layer of perfume all over your face. That&#x27;s why I took off two stars.</li>
            <li> I used it over a mattifying moisturizer and primer and it smoothed my skin wonderfully! I like the texture better than the foundations I have been using. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try American BB cream but I&#x27;ve read in the reviews that the best BB creams come from Korea. So, I ordered this product to try. It arrived directly from Seoul, South Korea. I have to admit, it&#x27;s perfect. The size of the tube is a bit smaller than any standard foundation tube but I noticed that I needed less product than I used to need with foundation to cover my entire face. Anyway, it has a very pleasant mild smell. I think the color of the product adjusts to the color of my face. I am not sure if it was supposed to do it but it looks like that&#x27;s what it does because when I get it out of the tube and put it on my face, it appears significantly lighter than my skin but when I start speading it, the color matches my skin color.&lt;br /&gt;Another great feature is, it doesn&#x27;t cake. I have oily skin and other foundations used to become obvious after the oil on my nose and/or forehead started coming out. This BB cream just stays the same. Of course, my skin still gets oily, but I still can&#x27;t notice if there is anything at all on my face in terms of coverage.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak for other features of this cream like brightening or evenning out the tone because my skin color is pretty even. So, I don&#x27;t know if really evens the tone out or if it brightens because I just didn&#x27;t have a need for those features.&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted something with light coverage, suitable for oily acne prone skin. So, this worked for me perfectly. I will buy this again. It&#x27;s a great alternative to any foundation I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but this color was too gray for my skin tone.  Golden beige was better for my skin.</li>
            <li> Did not care for this b b. It gave a grey cast to my face and was thick. It felt like a thick greasy slime on my face. My acne flared up.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the real thing. I have used the real thing and this cream is too liquidy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say I&#x27;ve only had it for a short time, It seems ok. Like the fact that it&#x27;s not greasy, It  stays on even when you get wet from rain, it does seem to make the dark spots lighter or gone while you have it on. Can&#x27;t say anything about my wrinkles they are still there, mayby they will go in time but for right now there they are.</li>
            <li> Shipping took a long time with today&#x27;s standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product, you have to be pretty pale skinned, even for an Asian to be able to use this without looking like a ghost.  Might be less of a beige, and more of a grayish peach.  The coverage was decent.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is not bad, but I wasn&#x27;t really impressed with it. I don&#x27;t have bad skin so it didn&#x27;t take much of it to achieve a full covereage effect which is odd because I didn&#x27;t think a BB cream could do that. The product is creamy, and light weight which is always a plus. The problem for me was that it doesn&#x27;t really soak into my skin, and starts melting off by mid day. I tried using a primer and HD powder but neither product did the trick. Although it&#x27;s not a bad BB cream, it&#x27;s not something I would buy again.</li>
            <li> perfect for my acne prone sensitive skin. doesn&#x27;t break me out but gives a nice clean and healthy look. My sister recommended it and i have been hooked since.</li>
            <li> is perfect , for oily skin is excellent ..leaves a fresh, natural finish, lasts all day ..buy it again. without a doubt</li>
            <li> This product is awesome but beware of the fake stuff. There are lots of fakes out there and it is important to choose from a seller that you know carries the real product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered no.23 though the seller \\&quot;Think Pretty\\&quot; and I don&#x27;t think I gotten the real stuff. It&#x27;s a lot lighter than the original and it does not match my skin at all. It&#x27;s also not as creamy (very watery based) and it does not hold coverage as well like the original. It don&#x27;t even cover as well as the very cheap BB cream. Either it&#x27;s fake or I gotten a really bad mixed batch. You can&#x27;t really prove that it&#x27;s fake unless you are a chemist so there is not much you can do about it. I&#x27;m getting this item again through another seller or picking it up where I know it s the real stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle I recieved does not look like these in the video below. Here are tips on how to tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;DOv_NclidB0</li>
            <li> I read and watched a lot of reviews before buying a sample of this product thinking it would be better for my t-zone oily skin in summer, but it ended up breaking me out pretty bad, left more of an unpleasant &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; rather then a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;, and has a really strong gray undertone. I like the consistency of the product but just can&#x27;t use it, also don&#x27;t like the skin &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; claim on the box, I have a pretty nice tan in the summer and don&#x27;t know why i would want to whiten my skin...sounds creepy</li>
            <li> The seller was very generous to send me a second one because the first tube I got looked opened/used or someone had tampered with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the quality of the cream, but the color does come off a bit gray straight from the tube. A lot of people say to give it time to oxidize and it does lighten. The cover is close to medium but on the slightly heavier side so its great if you&#x27;re looking for a little more. Be aware though that because its slightly more coverage, that it can get a bit oily towards the end of the day. I have combination oily skin with yellow undertone, around NC25 so this was the closest matching shade they had. Its not the exact perfect match in comparison to the Banila Co&#x27;s Be Touched Yellow Beige, which was discontinued, but I guess its as good as it gets until I keep trying other brands.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is very nice. It doesn&#x27;t leave your face gray or chalky like some others. Nice cream. The only problem I have with it is the tube is SO SMALL! Don&#x27;t plan on using this all the time, it won&#x27;t last, teeny amount.</li>
            <li> Perfect shade for me and I love it because I didn&#x27;t look so cakey. Moreover, it has a high SPF of 42!</li>
            <li> This is the first BB cream I tried. The color is ashy-grey, but blends ok. My primary issue is thatI am allergic to some ingredient in the item. My eyes ran all day. Would return if i could.</li>
            <li> My missha bb cream came way earlier than it was supposed to, which was awesome. Opened it up and it was the perfect size to try it out (I ordered the 20ml). The tone and shade matches me PERFECTLY which was also awesome. It does not change the texture of my skin which is great for me because I already take good care of my skin and need very little coverage for redness. This BB cream is not very thin or light coverage, though, I would say it is light to medium coverage. I have replaced my foundation with this. Love it. Will def be buying the bigger size.</li>
            <li> I bought this way back and still using it, it last so long and i really like it. will buy again</li>
