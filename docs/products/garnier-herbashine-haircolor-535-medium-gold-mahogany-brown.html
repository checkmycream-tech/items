            <li>and it was just so perfect.</li>
            <li>This color covered it perfectly and added richness to my color that looks like it was done at a salon.</li>
            <li>This one provides a perfect cover and it lasts.</li>
            <li>Very happy.</li>

            <li>Amazing results in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Although it is a nice color, it didn&#x27;t have the color results that I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;P.S.</li>
            <li>it turns more medium gold, and this is the phase that I love the most because I have fair skin tone</li>
            <li>Excellent product and all natural</li>
            <li>The blond weave combined with this very rich, warm brown gives me a sun-streaked&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s stil safe as its in your color family, it just adds a richness that I haven&#x27;t found in over the counter brands.</li>

            <li>color is fantastic!</li>
            <li>It has rich color tones, a short processing time:10 Mins., as well as excellent coverage for stubborn gray hair.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, it lasts for almost one month.</li>
            <li>Great grey coverage and love</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would highly recommend to first time user or experienced.</li>
            <li>This seller is no longer available and the seller &#x27;C N SAVE&#x27; is fullfilled by amazon with &amp;#34;FREE SHIPPING&amp;#34; (for prime members),............................</li>
            <li>Quick &amp; easy.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply and very affordable.</li>
            <li>Like the other reviewer I don&#x27;t shampoo every day and after 3 weeks the color is still great, but no noticeable root difference.&lt;br /&gt;Sad</li>
            <li>The best part is that it fades beautifully, the dark doesn&#x27;t last too long, within 2 weeks</li>
            <li>And it was very pretty.</li>
            <li>Really like this colour hair colour and herbashine so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Its fast, easy and does the job.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite color I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>I love the depth and variety of the color after dying my hair with it--a rich brown with a reddish tint, especially when standing in the sunlight.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s not a big deal for many, but I don&#x27;t appreciate being deceived into thinking I get free shipping, when I&#x27;m actually paying more.</li>
            <li>I really, REALLY wish they would bring it back instead of having the Oilia kind now.</li>
            <li>I absolutely was blown away by this color!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it works with your hair and looks a bit different on everyone, but the tones all work together and blend.</li>
            <li>first time I bought this it wasn&#x27;t fullfilled by amazon (seller: champion liquidation)</li>
            <li>I put Herbashine on the crown first for 5 minutes and then gently pulled it through- only lightly touching the blond weave highlights</li>
            <li>colour much and this is exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li>It really is silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not everyone wants to use permanent color, especially when experimenting with different shades, and this product provided good coverage and left my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>so hopefully I&#x27;ll be able to find it online for a little while longer.</li>
            <li>very natural look.</li>
            <li>I have some grey ( only 5 - 10% ) but it covered that fine</li>
            <li>For the price, this hair color can give a very professional and soft look.</li>
            <li>Even Amazon only seems to have one reasonable supplier.</li>
            <li>Looks professionally done.</li>
            <li>original hair is medium brown, adding this color makes it dark brown with a red tint and people notices this immediately, I get a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li>Initially I started using it as I do not like my natural hair</li>
            <li>If red&#x27;s not your thing, no worries, because the red fades over a week or two, and then you&#x27;re left with a light brown-reddish hair (other people called me a red head</li>
            <li>I tried this color on a whim a few weeks ago, looking for a shade that would provide some richness and depth as an alternative to my standard medium golden brown.  </li>

            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;Since Garnier has phased it out, it will be a sad day when it is no longer available in the marketplace.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> to say Walmart no longer seem to carry this and no luck finding it in other stores either.  </li>
            <li> I will go up a shade or down a shade depending on season.  </li>

            <li> I was trying to fix a bad color job (at home) that another, more expensive brand had created (turned parts of my hair BLUE!!)  </li>
            <li> and I feel pale with dark brown.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this hair colour for a little over 4 years now</li>
            <li> If you have a plain brown color, try this one!</li>
            <li> And expensive and permanent color can really dry out</li>
            <li> So sad that they discontinued this product.</li>
            <li> I used this product today and now segments of my hair are PURPLE and some are a frightening shade of orange.</li>
            <li> At least put this color in another hair dye :(</li>
            <li> Very sad.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is impossible to get hold of in the Uk now</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> So sad that they discontinued this product. I remember I had never died my hair before and picked out this shade and it was just so perfect. Then I switched to another color and could never find this one again. I really, REALLY wish they would bring it back instead of having the Oilia kind now. I&#x27;ve tried it and it&#x27;s just not that good. At least put this color in another hair dye :(</li>
            <li> I am glad I had tried this color before reading the review!  I tried this color on a whim a few weeks ago, looking for a shade that would provide some richness and depth as an alternative to my standard medium golden brown.  I loved the reddish brown richness.  I put it on the roots for 15 minutes, but pull it through the ends for only the last 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely was blown away by this color! I was trying to fix a bad color job (at home) that another, more expensive brand had created (turned parts of my hair BLUE!!)  On a whim I decided to try to fix it myself one last time.. This color covered it perfectly and added richness to my color that looks like it was done at a salon. I love the fact that it works with your hair and looks a bit different on everyone, but the tones all work together and blend. You will end up looking like you spent hundreds on at a salon and hours getting highlights.   I&#x27;ve also found that it seemed to last a bit longer than 28 days but that may be becasue I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day, instead I use dry shampoo.  If you have a plain brown color, try this one! It&#x27;s stil safe as its in your color family, it just adds a richness that I haven&#x27;t found in over the counter brands.</li>
            <li> Avoid this color at all costs! It looks nothing like the color samples that are offered with the product. I used this product today and now segments of my hair are PURPLE and some are a frightening shade of orange. They should have never put this product out on the market.</li>
            <li> I have been using this hair colour for a little over 4 years now and I really love it. Initially I started using it as I do not like my natural hair colour much and this is exactly what I have been looking for. Now that I turned 35 I actually need to use some hair colour as I have some greyish hair at my temples. This one provides a perfect cover and it lasts. I am really sad Garnier discontinued this product and hope to be able to find something similar.</li>
            <li> I love this haircolor, and it&#x27;s semi-permanent so it doesn&#x27;t damage your hair. It leaves it healthier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My original hair is medium brown, adding this color makes it dark brown with a red tint and people notices this immediately, I get a lot of compliments. The best part is that it fades beautifully, the dark doesn&#x27;t last too long, within 2 weeks it turns more medium gold, and this is the phase that I love the most because I have fair skin tone and I feel pale with dark brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MINUS 1 STAR -- first time I bought this it wasn&#x27;t fullfilled by amazon (seller: champion liquidation) so I paid for shipping ~$4 and the product itself was $4 something, I bought 2 boxes for a TOTAL &#x3D; $12.82. This seller is no longer available and the seller &#x27;C N SAVE&#x27; is fullfilled by amazon with &amp;#34;FREE SHIPPING&amp;#34; (for prime members),............................ well it&#x27;s a LIE because the product now costs $8.50, if I buy 2 boxes I will pay Total of $17! I know it&#x27;s not a big deal for many, but I don&#x27;t appreciate being deceived into thinking I get free shipping, when I&#x27;m actually paying more. At this point I don&#x27;t know if I will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and all natural</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for years and have previously used this brand with no problems.... Until now. It only dyed my hair in patches. I will never purchase this again. Or atleast off amazon...</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 years. It has rich color tones, a short processing time:10 Mins., as well as excellent coverage for stubborn gray hair. Results: Shiny healthy - looking hair. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Since Garnier has phased it out, it will be a sad day when it is no longer available in the marketplace.&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried Nutriesse color # 535: Rum &amp; Coke, processing time: 20 mins. Although it is a nice color, it didn&#x27;t have the color results that I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Unfortunately for me, I haven&#x27;t found anything in their new Olia(sp?) product line that I am willing to try.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT, ITS SOO SHINY AND BEAUTIFUL</li>
            <li> Great color, durable and no-ammonia.  Easy to apply, it lasts for almost one month.</li>
            <li> Bought this on clearance at Walmart  on a whim. I have some grey ( only 5 - 10% ) but it covered that fine and I loved the shade. It warmed  my hair without being overly  red. I am naturally med - dark brown.  I  went for the  28 shampoo version  so that it would fade out and I wouldn&#x27;t  have to  deal with roots.  Like the other reviewer I don&#x27;t shampoo every day and after 3 weeks the color is still great, but no noticeable root difference.&lt;br /&gt;Sad to say Walmart no longer seem to carry this and no luck finding it in other stores either.  Even Amazon only seems to have one reasonable supplier. So while I would not hesitate to recommend it, I would also say  stock up while you can.</li>
            <li> Really like this colour hair colour and herbashine so easy to use. Unfortunately it is impossible to get hold of in the Uk now so will have to try another brand.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite color I&#x27;ve tried so far. I love the depth and variety of the color after dying my hair with it--a rich brown with a reddish tint, especially when standing in the sunlight. If red&#x27;s not your thing, no worries, because the red fades over a week or two, and then you&#x27;re left with a light brown-reddish hair (other people called me a red head but I didn&#x27;t think I was). I can never find this in the store anymore so hopefully I&#x27;ll be able to find it online for a little while longer.</li>
            <li> I tried many brands of hair color and this works excellently for me. Very easy to apply and very affordable.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, but Garnier has discontinued it.  Not everyone wants to use permanent color, especially when experimenting with different shades, and this product provided good coverage and left my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Great grey coverage and love this color!&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend to first time user or experienced. Quick &amp; easy.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Its fast, easy and does the job.  I will go up a shade or down a shade depending on season.  You can&#x27;t tell that I color my hair.  Since it is no longer in the stores I shop in I had to order it online.  Some of this line is being discontinued.  Very sad.</li>
            <li> Amazing results in 10 minutes. No dryness or hair damage. Items delivered on time.</li>
            <li> For the price, this hair color can give a very professional and soft look. I had professionally had my dark brown hair color-weaved with&lt;br /&gt;blond and strawberry blond. And it was very pretty. And expensive and permanent color can really dry out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was time for another color. My hair was that mousy brown with 50% grey on the crown. The blond streaks were still&lt;br /&gt;in the body of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I put Herbashine on the crown first for 5 minutes and then gently pulled it through- only lightly touching the blond weave highlights I still had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is fantastic! Looks professionally done. The blond weave combined with this very rich, warm brown gives me a sun-streaked&lt;br /&gt;and very natural look. And my hair is so soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word to the wise- the conditioner makes the shower floor slippery- so rinse it well. It really is silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would leave the crown color on for 10 minutes next time and then another 5 on the body. It covered about 80% of my grey but not&lt;br /&gt;all of it. Needed another 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the small amount of grey only adds to the natural look. Very happy.</li>
            <li> Best coverage I&#x27;ve found for non-permanent hair color and beautiful color.</li>
