            <li>Great product, kind of pricy.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.  </li>
            <li>This never flakes and does a good job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Try one to confirm my unquestionable integrity, then wise up and buy bulk to save money.</li>
            <li>It is the best smelling hair product I have right now!</li>
            <li>I have short hair and its perfect for texture and holds great!</li>
            <li>Great product even better price.</li>
            <li>Now to be fair they loved it and bought more.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with this product!</li>
            <li>The price at the store sure as heck did!  </li>
            <li>in fact it helps me style my hair and looks like I have more hair!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>I end up buying a lot of brands and end up spending more money!</li>
            <li>It has a strong hold and smells great in your hair.</li>
            <li>Great strong manipulator.  </li>
            <li>I have used it for 20 years and it works great on my fine hair to add volume.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, I was had my hair cut</li>
            <li>this stuff holds but conditions the hair and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Works amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try and post my own image.  </li>
            <li>I have always liked this product.</li>
            <li>She loves this product and says &amp;#34;it&#x27;s the best, it will stand your hair straight on end without making it sticky&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Smells nice too, for the ladies.</li>
            <li>and i liked the result.  </li>
            <li>I have been buying this product for years and have liked it.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price was by far the best and the product was delivered as promised and arrived in good condition.  </li>
            <li>It really is the perfect gel.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t retain any of the things that made the original product great.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair manageable and very easy to style.  </li>
            <li>It had a great smell and  just the right amount of hold and feel after going into my hair.</li>
            <li>It gave me great flexibility to put my hair in just the right place and kept it there all the way through the day.</li>
            <li>Gives you great control and keeps hair where you want it.&lt;br /&gt;I use other bed head products that are very good like their shampoo and conditoner.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered for a great price.</li>
            <li>but again I suggest using a very light touch.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff cheapest place to by it</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I wish they sold this product in bulk in 4oz jars or more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Manipulator for years and the consistency has never been like this container; it is soupy/watery instead of being more like a paste.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wondering if the replacement will be any better.</li>
            <li>Gives your hair more volume.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>My sons favorite product.</li>
            <li>Best price for the same product they sell in the salons.  </li>
            <li>While this would work for some, I found that Kendra products worked better.  </li>
            <li>will not use any more Bed Head products.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I love this product I think it is great!</li>
            <li>I love this product and will use it agin.</li>
            <li>I love that this doesnt leave your hair greasy feeling or looking.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>So glad to find it here.  </li>
            <li>Best stuff on the planet for short hair.</li>
            <li>so many others have said, this is not the product it used to be.</li>
            <li>eor would love it.</li>
            <li>Check the Redken website to make sure your getting the most up to</li>
            <li>AND: It does not perform as my favorite Manipulator used to.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best products to do different looks with your hair.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to reseal the container, evaporation is an issue.</li>
            <li>Been using this stuff for years and love it.</li>
            <li>I was trying to find this online for a better price</li>
            <li>but this is so much better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for over 10 years and has always been my favorite.  </li>
            <li>have turned many people on to it and everybody loves it.</li>
            <li>my favorite grooming product.</li>
            <li>Love the control, fullness, and consistency of this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it on my hair, holds my style.</li>
            <li>Love this for my hair - recommended by my hairstylist</li>
            <li>Love this stuff for my pixie haircut.</li>
            <li>hope this helps, this product kicks ass and is better than anything your stylist would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was always my favorite product.  </li>
            <li>(I contacted them to be sure).  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t be my go-to product any more, so</li>
            <li>As many have discovered, the formula for Bed Head Manipulator has been changed.  </li>
            <li>Not the original formula!</li>
            <li>Best if used when your hair is almost dry after a shower.</li>
            <li>but it is totally worth and it works for any kind of hair</li>
            <li>I love this stuff (the original formula).  </li>
            <li>I have tried other brands and found that bed head manipulator works the best for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So easy to use.</li>
            <li>I can easily adjust my hair into any form I want.</li>
            <li>It blends into your hands easily and keep your hair spiked up or textured the way you want it all day.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to use and did it&#x27;s job</li>
            <li>but not too strong</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used bed head before and loved it, guess it was a different kind.</li>
            <li>I am a man who styles my hair as a \\&quot;side-part\\&quot; gives excellent hold and retains volume which was a huge problem with other products</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s my normal strong yet soft with perfect hold</li>
            <li>Was very surprised and will def be ordering more for sure!</li>
            <li>I was introduced to this product by my hairdresser and love it, goes a long way and a great styling product</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this product gives it some body.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s wonderful and clean fragrant, but the paste has been made more \\&quot;soupy\\&quot; and water-downed, thus leaving a greasy look when applied to hair, and requiring far more of an amount to actually style and hold one&#x27;s hairstyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(experienced on two different tubs)...</li>
            <li>This product is great for short hair styles.</li>
            <li>I think this product is great especially if you have hair strands that are always sticking out.</li>
            <li>do you enjoy being lied</li>
            <li>Great product I guess, but not enough hold for me.</li>
            <li>you enjoy your cruise on the S.S. Failboat TIGI...</li>
            <li>I bought 6 of these to get free shipping</li>
            <li>If you look at the image it looks like a bottom tier is filled with the product</li>
            <li>This Bed Head product works great on my short hair style.</li>
            <li>looks natural.. smells good.  </li>
            <li>Great product, especially for like a punky, cool look.</li>
            <li>As for why they changed it, I&#x27;m sure it looked great on some finance guru&#x27;s resume  to water down some hair gunk for improving the bottom line.</li>
            <li>The gel delivered is nothing like this product normally appears and does not work effectively.</li>
            <li>This is NOT, repeat NOT the original formula.</li>
            <li>Great for Thick hair too, just use more!</li>
            <li>I am more interested now in keeping the scalp covered.  </li>
            <li>I used the original formula for over a decade.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m trying to find a suitable replacement and not having much luck.</li>
            <li>It is nothing like the original formula.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be looking elsewhere for a styling product from now on unless I hear Tigi has returned to the original formula.</li>
            <li>(sounds like that even included removing the familiar fragrance).</li>
            <li>My son is happy and I am happy too because I tried different product like wax or paste from other brands</li>
            <li>Love it, does a great job without being goopy and messy.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best product for hair that commands just a bit of hold, rinses out with water @ night and is totally pliable with just a drop of water after four hours.</li>
            <li>- it washes out clean every time, even with just water&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, it may be a good choice for others with similar allergy concerns.  </li>
            <li>I primarily use it around my edges to keep my hairdo looking sleek and fresh between bi-weekly salon visits.  </li>
            <li>Redkin 06 is good, but not the same.</li>
            <li>It Manipulating Gel for a fraction of the price, and it is much more like the old Bed Head product that I liked so much.</li>
            <li>And your hair will still looks good the next day.</li>
            <li>I loved the product until one time I bought it and it was different.</li>
            <li>this is NOT the same good product anymore.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t be called on anytime soon to hold a radical style in place but does a good job with my fairly short hair.</li>
            <li>It provides very good hold without making your hair stiff.  </li>
            <li>It came quickly in the mail through Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot more runny and takes a lot more to produce the same results.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff and the price is much better here than locally.</li>
            <li>My hair dresser introduced me to this product and works great for my thin hair and smells so nice and never sticky.</li>
            <li>I have been using Bed Head Manipulator for years and up until my most recent purchase I had been a satisfied customer.  </li>
            <li>When you open the box, its coconut smell greets you with a very smooth, not-so-sticky texture that applies easily onto your hair.</li>
            <li>I have men&#x27;s medium length fine straight hair.</li>
            <li>Great for those messy &amp;</li>
            <li>I use this everyday and it works great.  </li>
            <li>The newer is more of a pearly color vs the old which isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The old product was much better.  </li>
            <li>The Golden age of Bed head is at stake and they deserve their fate.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>the consumers made you a success, and now we are going to do the contrary.</li>
            <li>date packaging verifying that it is fresh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the price.  </li>
            <li>it is the misleading packaging that is clearly designed to make you think you&#x27;re getting more than you are.  </li>
            <li>If you didn&#x27;t like bed head before, perhaps it&#x27;s worth trying.  </li>
            <li>However, with my most recent purchase I was dismayed to discover that they&#x27;ve changed the formula significantly.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and the product is exactly as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>Tried other products to style hair, nothing is as good.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy it right away</li>
            <li>so I asked her what she used and ordered it right away.</li>
            <li>This product is great for fine, limp hair but just a TAD does the job!!!</li>
            <li>Overall, at best it just seems to be like most other products now instead of something different.  </li>
            <li>I purchased a two pack back in January and one was the old stuff (good) and</li>
            <li>You will go thougth the whole thing rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>I was so attached to the old product, I used it daily for years and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Very reasonable price</li>
            <li>but it does not take very much</li>
            <li>The price is fabulous considering it&#x27;s $18 or more at other stores.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Regardless this product is great for a few main reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>I have a short haircut, and it is the perfect product for people who have very little time or skill but who want a tousled and textured look.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was a HUGE fan of the old formulation.  </li>
            <li>Then I read the reviews and saw that its most likely not defective, but a formula change.</li>
            <li>I have short hair and this product is not working for me any more.  </li>
            <li>have tried many different types of hair gel and pastes.</li>
            <li>This product is even more watery than a similar product, Mastermind, made by this company.</li>
            <li>Works ok but different than it used to be.</li>
            <li>Takes my hair to a whole nother level!</li>
            <li>For some reason (and I&#x27;d love to know why), the product formula has totally changed.</li>
            <li>lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is fantastic and I get compliments on it rather frequently.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for more than ten years.</li>
            <li>The first item I received was all foamy and watery</li>
            <li>It reminded me of melted taffy, and it made your hair do EXACTLY</li>
            <li>the only reason this is called bed head manipulator is because they manipulated everyone into paying top dollar to smear their junk in their hair.</li>
            <li>I liked it, it is what expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for several years now, and still love it.  </li>
            <li>As with some products, sometimes it&#x27;s just a matter of getting used to using it differently, but so far I haven&#x27;t been able to get it to do what I want like I could with the original formula.  </li>
            <li>Okay, I read the reviews on this product and the disappointment others had experienced.  </li>
            <li>It was my favorite product, really the only one I used since 2004.</li>
            <li>do you feel positively about your hair smelling like lip smackers chapstick?</li>
            <li>It does do pretty well styling, in the Florida heat however, it really just melts in your hair.</li>
            <li>instead of being a taffy that i absolutely loved, it&#x27;s not more the consistency of that jet puffed marshmallow spread.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s amazing is that the price went up when the quality went down.</li>
            <li>I buy this particular product because it has the best &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; of any hair gel I have ever used, but this batch was fake and I had to immediately buy another one.  </li>
            <li>Bummer, as the other reviewers have pointed out, TIGI changed their formula (I&#x27;ve been using this to tame my fly away fine hair</li>
            <li>It is not really a gel, more like a very sticky cream (almost like glue or paste...or even cement!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for short hair and long hair.</li>
            <li>If you have static it works wonders on the ends of the hair to calm those flyaways down.  </li>
            <li>However, the old forumula works great and last a long time.  </li>
            <li>, I have tried this new formula more now, and I can definitely say I don&#x27;t like it and won&#x27;t be using it.  </li>
            <li>Amazon sent a new one right away</li>
            <li>it is that it&#x27;s easy to use, takes a small amount, washes off easily and isn&#x27;t too goopy on my hands or hair.  </li>
            <li>Use a little bit of water for a fresh look or a lot of water and it will harden like a handsome shell on your head.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for giving your hair that chunky, spiky, messy look without leaving a lot of extra residue.</li>
            <li>Like everyone else, I was very upset when they changed the formula.</li>
            <li>It also functions very well for its intended purpose.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>And it smells like coconut, which is light but obvious.</li>
            <li>Not much to say about the product cause I simply love it.</li>
            <li>The formula is very sticky so after applying it you have to wash your hands.</li>
            <li>It was very liquid, almost like water.</li>
            <li>It is very sticky and doesn&#x27;t have the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>without looking like there is too much junk in your hair</li>
            <li>It used to be really sticky</li>
            <li>I understand if Bed Head wants to change</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years now and it works really well.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference.  </li>
            <li>Do not use too much at one time</li>
            <li>The delivery cam in a timely fashion and for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>It is definitely not even kind of the same.  </li>
            <li>Best for comb overs or other styles that only require a loose hold that can be plyable.</li>
            <li>Whether they changed the formula to increase profit margins or to comply with regulations on new ingredients as they have suggested on the FB site, the truth remains that this is not at all like the old product and unfortunately is no longer worth using.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re still able to style your hair, it just doesn&#x27;t keep it up like other products.</li>
            <li>TIGI needs to bring back the original formula.</li>
            <li>I find it&#x27;s price much better through amazon then any other place.</li>
            <li>Not same as original product.  </li>
            <li>Most gels don&#x27;t cut the job for my \\&quot;messy\\&quot; look; they tend to leave an exuberant amount of flakes while only holding my hair up for...</li>
            <li>I am constantly trying new pomades and hair products just to see if anything stacks up (free samples) and nothing does.  </li>
            <li>I love this product it is amazing for your hair it is a little messy</li>
            <li>B0010NRXYM TIGI Bed Head A Hair Stick for Cool People 2.7 oz (.77 g)]] and Manipulator are my two go-to products daily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not worth $16 and is now $20 at most places.  </li>
            <li>I need a new hair product now!</li>
            <li>Although all of this sounds weird, it seems to work much better than hairspray, which leaves a film OVER the hair; Manipulator is WITHIN the hair, so you can do more with it.</li>
            <li>If you do, I&#x27;ll go back to being your loyal customer.</li>
            <li>is if it arrived busted and if it did that, as a Prime member I get mainly from Amazon and they take care of all issues like that</li>
            <li>I watched several videos in Youtube to make sure I am applying it properly, but had no luck.</li>
            <li>no longer uses their older formula.</li>
            <li>the top seamed screwed on tight.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>As other recent reviews have unconfirmed, TIGI decided to change the formula for their Manipulator product, and unfortunately NOT for the better.</li>
            <li>Never sticky, my hair always feels like normal hair.  </li>
            <li>Overall though, it&#x27;s a fun product to work with</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure it does not fit this case&lt;</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s great about this product is that it allows you to style your hair without giving you that hard crusty gel feel/look, and after it sets in and dries your hair feels dry.  </li>
            <li>Personally I thought that there was something wrong with my latest until until some quick research confirmed that the formula was changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are a guy and your hair is to short, there is no point, it isn&#x27;t strong enough to maintain any shape.  </li>
            <li>If you are expecting the original manipulator formula, get ready for a big shocker when you open this.  </li>
            <li>It works really well even with my fine hair, just use a little.  </li>
            <li>so my review is based on this new formula</li>
            <li>but comparing the new product.</li>
            <li>The new product has the viscosity of runny eggs.  </li>
            <li>The new formula is this sparkly, runny stuff with no hold like before.</li>
            <li>Do Not Buy the new formula.</li>
            <li>The new stuff is but a shadow of what it once was.  </li>
            <li>The new texture, smell and hold is not for me.  </li>
            <li>All of the people that thought they received counterfeit products in fact received the new formula.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;5 - at the end of the day, if I haven&#x27;t washed it out of my hair, it&#x27;s still smooth enough to run my hand through it, no residue comes off on your hands, and it dissipates enough through the day that you can go to bed with it still &#x27;in&#x27; and not damage your hair at all</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this manipulator does not weigh down my hair</li>
            <li>It dries very naturally though (not at all like glue or paste), and leaving a sort of fiber in your hair.</li>
            <li>Looked at same product at an ulta and its same as the original.</li>
            <li>good-bye old friend, i&#x27;ll miss you!</li>
            <li>The second jar was identical to the first.</li>
            <li>and, if this is really their &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; formula, it should at least come in a different kind of container so that it doesn&#x27;t spill every time it is opened.</li>
            <li>Had the exact same experience.</li>
            <li>and I only used a tiny bit on my ends or a little more to create more of a tousled vibe, now I&#x27;m not sure it really does much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do realize that a little bit goes a long way and you could easily put too much in your hair or concentrate too much in one</li>
            <li>I have two containers of the old formula, and one new container.  </li>
            <li>The new formula doesn&#x27;t smell, feel, or function NEARLY as well.</li>
            <li>If you buy this stuff, I think you&#x27;re taking a risk that it will be too old of stuff to live up to it</li>
            <li>I just hope TiGi will realize the error of their ways and go back to the old formula {;D}, but I doubt it will happen.</li>
            <li>Mess free and does not flake.</li>
            <li>For lack of a better word, this new formula truly sucks.</li>
            <li>I bought this product hoping to help me style my fine limp hair.  </li>
            <li>I wanted firm hold that lasts and have fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Holds well, but not stiff..</li>
            <li>Finally got smart and stopped paying $20 at CVS.</li>
            <li>My hair is thin and fine and this really doesn&#x27;t do much for it.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it is hard to find.</li>
            <li>is one of the items that a review is silly to do as I am happy with this product and would have no reason to not reorder in the same manner&lt;</li>
            <li>I never tried the old version of this</li>
            <li>I was surprised how runny this is.  </li>
            <li>Maybe ignorance is bliss, because I didn&#x27;t use the old product.</li>
            <li>He has naturally curly corse hair.</li>
            <li>, they need to return to the old formula.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a complete flop?&lt;br /&gt;Someone</li>
            <li>/&gt;Either way, your lac of communication and approach to the transition was a complete failure.&lt;br /&gt;Shame on you guys.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know enough about hair products to know what a reasonable alternative would be, so I bought some anyway.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think I will be using this much and will go back to buying it in a salon.</li>
            <li>Wow... Just when I needed one do I read that they have changed the formula...</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really notice too much of a difference between this jar that I recently purchased and the stuff I was buying several years ago.</li>
            <li>holds but allows for natural movement.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like butter and a melted glue stick had a baby, and then dressed that baby up like the old manipulator product, and then named it &amp;#34;manipulator&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>i guess the old formula just flew too close to the sun.</li>
            <li>It came fast and was still the same product as before.  </li>
            <li>It was either counterfeit (though it was in the true packaging), or the real product watered down or mixed with another weaker product.  </li>
            <li>nothing bad, fits well, good quality, nothing to complain about... recommended!</li>
            <li>Like other Tigi products, it can be a bit pricey for the amount you get, but the quality is worth it.</li>
            <li>My complaints are also now being taken more seriously.</li>
            <li>This latest purchase of 3 jars was not the same quality as product I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li>well, the second can was just the same as the first.  </li>
            <li>The new formula is thinner, smells much different, and doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It ruins my freshly styled hair and doesn&#x27;t do what it used to.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very sticky feeling but a little dab really will do you.</li>
            <li>I actually thought it was defective and wrote Amazon who is sending me a new jar.  </li>
            <li>The new one is too liquid and doesnt last.  </li>
            <li>lots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The older formula, which I purchased at a store with a big red bulls eye, was the consistency of soft taffy, with a coconut scent.  </li>
            <li>Do you know how distressful that is for a mother who has a teenage son who wants to be in the FORM all the time and constantly harasses you to buy this and that!  </li>
            <li>Not sure if it is original product or not.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a sundry or something I use in everyday life like light bulbs, toilet paper, cereal etc</li>
            <li>My hair stylist advised me to be careful of knock-offs on the Internet, and I am wondering if it is the real thing.</li>
            <li>Tigi, please, please, please bring the old formula back.</li>
            <li>Kneels everything in place and no wet look.  </li>
            <li>My hair also looks gross way quicker with this than the old bed head.  </li>
            <li>not only does it separate the hair and add volume and lift,  i have thinning hair and this makes it look like when i was young.</li>
            <li>my girl friend has started stealing it and won&#x27;t go back to her old products</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen my Magic game improve dramatically.</li>
            <li>mind you this stuff can retail for as high as $22 for a single jar when it&#x27;s not on sale.  </li>
            <li>It actually holds your hair up, and you barely need a fingertip&#x27;s amount to keep your hair fixed for the entire day.</li>
            <li>If your hair is getting to long, the weight of your hair will just fall down on its own naturally no more than an hour after styling it.  </li>
            <li>Shipping cost makes this nearly the same price as found in local supermarkets and drug stores.</li>
            <li>Rather than leaving your hair covered with white flakes, it leaves only a natural shine in the position you want your hair to be in.</li>
            <li>If I apply a little more, it weighs my hair down and lays it flat.</li>
            <li>I recently ordered two jars and when I opened the first one, half of it spilled out because it was so runny.</li>
            <li>Clearly they&#x27;ve &amp;#34;gone bad&amp;#34; perhaps from sitting on the shelf too long.</li>
            <li>Just dab a little on with a fingertip and smooth the hairs down with a 100% Boarshead Brush.  </li>
            <li>Also, I did more internet searching, and among other places, saw unhappy comments about the new formula on TIGI&#x27;s facebook page and even TIGI&#x27;s response that it was to meet new regulations</li>
            <li>It feels soft and nice when dry too---never greasy or waxy---and I can leave it in the next day without having the dirty feel to my hair</li>
            <li>Just a little dab, and lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li>After having the seller send me out another can of this product because the first one was old and previously opened (was only half full) and a weird different consistency as opposed to what it should have been-new, unopened, and normal consistency...</li>
            <li>I loved this product, too bad they change the recipe.</li>

            <li> Good stuff.  </li>
            <li> This never flakes and does a good job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Try one to confirm my unquestionable integrity, then wise up and buy bulk to save money.</li>
            <li> It is the best smelling hair product I have right now!</li>
            <li> I have short hair and its perfect for texture and holds great!</li>
            <li> Great product even better price.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and absolutely love it!</li>

            <li> I end up buying a lot of brands and end up spending more money!</li>
            <li> It has a strong hold and smells great in your hair.</li>
            <li> Great strong manipulator.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for 20 years and it works great on my fine hair to add volume.  </li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, I was had my hair cut</li>
            <li> this stuff holds but conditions the hair and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Works amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try and post my own image.  </li>
            <li> I have always liked this product.</li>
            <li> She loves this product and says &amp;#34;it&#x27;s the best, it will stand your hair straight on end without making it sticky&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Smells nice too, for the ladies.</li>
            <li> and i liked the result.  </li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for years and have liked it.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price was by far the best and the product was delivered as promised and arrived in good condition.  </li>
            <li> It really is the perfect gel.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t retain any of the things that made the original product great.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair manageable and very easy to style.  </li>
            <li> It had a great smell and  just the right amount of hold and feel after going into my hair.</li>
            <li> It gave me great flexibility to put my hair in just the right place and kept it there all the way through the day.</li>
            <li> Gives you great control and keeps hair where you want it.&lt;br /&gt;I use other bed head products that are very good like their shampoo and conditoner.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered for a great price.</li>
            <li> but again I suggest using a very light touch.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff cheapest place to by it</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I wish they sold this product in bulk in 4oz jars or more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Manipulator for years and the consistency has never been like this container; it is soupy/watery instead of being more like a paste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if the replacement will be any better.</li>
            <li> Gives your hair more volume.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for many years.  </li>
            <li> My sons favorite product.</li>
            <li> Best price for the same product they sell in the salons.  </li>
            <li> While this would work for some, I found that Kendra products worked better.  </li>
            <li> will not use any more Bed Head products.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I love this product I think it is great!</li>
            <li> I love this product and will use it agin.</li>
            <li> I love that this doesnt leave your hair greasy feeling or looking.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> So glad to find it here.  </li>
            <li> Best stuff on the planet for short hair.</li>
            <li> so many others have said, this is not the product it used to be.</li>
            <li> eor would love it.</li>
            <li> Check the Redken website to make sure your getting the most up to</li>
            <li> AND: It does not perform as my favorite Manipulator used to.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products to do different looks with your hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to reseal the container, evaporation is an issue.</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for years and love it.</li>
            <li> I was trying to find this online for a better price</li>
            <li> but this is so much better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over 10 years and has always been my favorite.  </li>
            <li> have turned many people on to it and everybody loves it.</li>
            <li> my favorite grooming product.</li>
            <li> Love the control, fullness, and consistency of this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it on my hair, holds my style.</li>
            <li> Love this for my hair - recommended by my hairstylist</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for my pixie haircut.</li>
            <li> hope this helps, this product kicks ass and is better than anything your stylist would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was always my favorite product.  </li>
            <li> (I contacted them to be sure).  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t be my go-to product any more, so</li>
            <li> As many have discovered, the formula for Bed Head Manipulator has been changed.  </li>
            <li> Not the original formula!</li>
            <li> Best if used when your hair is almost dry after a shower.</li>
            <li> but it is totally worth and it works for any kind of hair</li>
            <li> I love this stuff (the original formula).  </li>
            <li> I have tried other brands and found that bed head manipulator works the best for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So easy to use.</li>
            <li> I can easily adjust my hair into any form I want.</li>
            <li> It blends into your hands easily and keep your hair spiked up or textured the way you want it all day.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to use and did it&#x27;s job</li>
            <li> but not too strong</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used bed head before and loved it, guess it was a different kind.</li>
            <li> I am a man who styles my hair as a \\&quot;side-part\\&quot; gives excellent hold and retains volume which was a huge problem with other products</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s my normal strong yet soft with perfect hold</li>
            <li> Was very surprised and will def be ordering more for sure!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by my hairdresser and love it, goes a long way and a great styling product</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this product gives it some body.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s wonderful and clean fragrant, but the paste has been made more \\&quot;soupy\\&quot; and water-downed, thus leaving a greasy look when applied to hair, and requiring far more of an amount to actually style and hold one&#x27;s hairstyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (experienced on two different tubs)...</li>
            <li> This product is great for short hair styles.</li>
            <li> I think this product is great especially if you have hair strands that are always sticking out.</li>
            <li> do you enjoy being lied</li>
            <li> Great product I guess, but not enough hold for me.</li>
            <li> you enjoy your cruise on the S.S. Failboat TIGI...</li>
            <li> I bought 6 of these to get free shipping</li>
            <li> If you look at the image it looks like a bottom tier is filled with the product</li>
            <li> This Bed Head product works great on my short hair style.</li>
            <li> looks natural.. smells good.  </li>
            <li> Great product, especially for like a punky, cool look.</li>
            <li> As for why they changed it, I&#x27;m sure it looked great on some finance guru&#x27;s resume  to water down some hair gunk for improving the bottom line.</li>
            <li> The gel delivered is nothing like this product normally appears and does not work effectively.</li>
            <li> This is NOT, repeat NOT the original formula.</li>
            <li> Great for Thick hair too, just use more!</li>
            <li> I am more interested now in keeping the scalp covered.  </li>
            <li> I used the original formula for over a decade.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m trying to find a suitable replacement and not having much luck.</li>
            <li> It is nothing like the original formula.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be looking elsewhere for a styling product from now on unless I hear Tigi has returned to the original formula.</li>
            <li> (sounds like that even included removing the familiar fragrance).</li>
            <li> My son is happy and I am happy too because I tried different product like wax or paste from other brands</li>
            <li> Love it, does a great job without being goopy and messy.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best product for hair that commands just a bit of hold, rinses out with water @ night and is totally pliable with just a drop of water after four hours.</li>
            <li> - it washes out clean every time, even with just water&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, it may be a good choice for others with similar allergy concerns.  </li>
            <li> I primarily use it around my edges to keep my hairdo looking sleek and fresh between bi-weekly salon visits.  </li>
            <li> Redkin 06 is good, but not the same.</li>
            <li> It Manipulating Gel for a fraction of the price, and it is much more like the old Bed Head product that I liked so much.</li>
            <li> And your hair will still looks good the next day.</li>
            <li> I loved the product until one time I bought it and it was different.</li>
            <li> this is NOT the same good product anymore.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t be called on anytime soon to hold a radical style in place but does a good job with my fairly short hair.</li>
            <li> It provides very good hold without making your hair stiff.  </li>
            <li> It came quickly in the mail through Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot more runny and takes a lot more to produce the same results.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff and the price is much better here than locally.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser introduced me to this product and works great for my thin hair and smells so nice and never sticky.</li>
            <li> I have been using Bed Head Manipulator for years and up until my most recent purchase I had been a satisfied customer.  </li>
            <li> When you open the box, its coconut smell greets you with a very smooth, not-so-sticky texture that applies easily onto your hair.</li>
            <li> I have men&#x27;s medium length fine straight hair.</li>
            <li> Great for those messy &amp;</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and it works great.  </li>
            <li> The newer is more of a pearly color vs the old which isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The old product was much better.  </li>
            <li> The Golden age of Bed head is at stake and they deserve their fate.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> the consumers made you a success, and now we are going to do the contrary.</li>
            <li> date packaging verifying that it is fresh.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the price.  </li>
            <li> it is the misleading packaging that is clearly designed to make you think you&#x27;re getting more than you are.  </li>
            <li> If you didn&#x27;t like bed head before, perhaps it&#x27;s worth trying.  </li>
            <li> However, with my most recent purchase I was dismayed to discover that they&#x27;ve changed the formula significantly.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and the product is exactly as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> Tried other products to style hair, nothing is as good.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy it right away</li>
            <li> so I asked her what she used and ordered it right away.</li>
            <li> This product is great for fine, limp hair but just a TAD does the job!!!</li>
            <li> Overall, at best it just seems to be like most other products now instead of something different.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a two pack back in January and one was the old stuff (good) and</li>
            <li> You will go thougth the whole thing rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> I was so attached to the old product, I used it daily for years and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Very reasonable price</li>
            <li> but it does not take very much</li>
            <li> The price is fabulous considering it&#x27;s $18 or more at other stores.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Regardless this product is great for a few main reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> I have a short haircut, and it is the perfect product for people who have very little time or skill but who want a tousled and textured look.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a HUGE fan of the old formulation.  </li>
            <li> Then I read the reviews and saw that its most likely not defective, but a formula change.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and this product is not working for me any more.  </li>
            <li> have tried many different types of hair gel and pastes.</li>
            <li> This product is even more watery than a similar product, Mastermind, made by this company.</li>
            <li> Works ok but different than it used to be.</li>
            <li> Takes my hair to a whole nother level!</li>
            <li> For some reason (and I&#x27;d love to know why), the product formula has totally changed.</li>
            <li> lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is fantastic and I get compliments on it rather frequently.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for more than ten years.</li>
            <li> The first item I received was all foamy and watery</li>
            <li> It reminded me of melted taffy, and it made your hair do EXACTLY</li>
            <li> the only reason this is called bed head manipulator is because they manipulated everyone into paying top dollar to smear their junk in their hair.</li>
            <li> I liked it, it is what expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years now, and still love it.  </li>
            <li> As with some products, sometimes it&#x27;s just a matter of getting used to using it differently, but so far I haven&#x27;t been able to get it to do what I want like I could with the original formula.  </li>
            <li> Okay, I read the reviews on this product and the disappointment others had experienced.  </li>
            <li> It was my favorite product, really the only one I used since 2004.</li>
            <li> do you feel positively about your hair smelling like lip smackers chapstick?</li>
            <li> It does do pretty well styling, in the Florida heat however, it really just melts in your hair.</li>
            <li> instead of being a taffy that i absolutely loved, it&#x27;s not more the consistency of that jet puffed marshmallow spread.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s amazing is that the price went up when the quality went down.</li>
            <li> I buy this particular product because it has the best &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; of any hair gel I have ever used, but this batch was fake and I had to immediately buy another one.  </li>
            <li> Bummer, as the other reviewers have pointed out, TIGI changed their formula (I&#x27;ve been using this to tame my fly away fine hair</li>
            <li> It is not really a gel, more like a very sticky cream (almost like glue or paste...or even cement!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for short hair and long hair.</li>
            <li> If you have static it works wonders on the ends of the hair to calm those flyaways down.  </li>
            <li> However, the old forumula works great and last a long time.  </li>
            <li> , I have tried this new formula more now, and I can definitely say I don&#x27;t like it and won&#x27;t be using it.  </li>
            <li> Amazon sent a new one right away</li>
            <li> it is that it&#x27;s easy to use, takes a small amount, washes off easily and isn&#x27;t too goopy on my hands or hair.  </li>
            <li> Use a little bit of water for a fresh look or a lot of water and it will harden like a handsome shell on your head.  </li>
            <li> This product is great for giving your hair that chunky, spiky, messy look without leaving a lot of extra residue.</li>
            <li> Like everyone else, I was very upset when they changed the formula.</li>
            <li> It also functions very well for its intended purpose.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> And it smells like coconut, which is light but obvious.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about the product cause I simply love it.</li>
            <li> The formula is very sticky so after applying it you have to wash your hands.</li>
            <li> It was very liquid, almost like water.</li>
            <li> It is very sticky and doesn&#x27;t have the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> without looking like there is too much junk in your hair</li>
            <li> It used to be really sticky</li>
            <li> I understand if Bed Head wants to change</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years now and it works really well.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It really makes a difference.  </li>
            <li> Do not use too much at one time</li>
            <li> The delivery cam in a timely fashion and for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> It is definitely not even kind of the same.  </li>
            <li> Best for comb overs or other styles that only require a loose hold that can be plyable.</li>
            <li> Whether they changed the formula to increase profit margins or to comply with regulations on new ingredients as they have suggested on the FB site, the truth remains that this is not at all like the old product and unfortunately is no longer worth using.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re still able to style your hair, it just doesn&#x27;t keep it up like other products.</li>
            <li> TIGI needs to bring back the original formula.</li>
            <li> I find it&#x27;s price much better through amazon then any other place.</li>
            <li> Not same as original product.  </li>
            <li> Most gels don&#x27;t cut the job for my \\&quot;messy\\&quot; look; they tend to leave an exuberant amount of flakes while only holding my hair up for...</li>
            <li> I am constantly trying new pomades and hair products just to see if anything stacks up (free samples) and nothing does.  </li>
            <li> I love this product it is amazing for your hair it is a little messy</li>
            <li> B0010NRXYM TIGI Bed Head A Hair Stick for Cool People 2.7 oz (.77 g)]] and Manipulator are my two go-to products daily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth $16 and is now $20 at most places.  </li>
            <li> I need a new hair product now!</li>
            <li> Although all of this sounds weird, it seems to work much better than hairspray, which leaves a film OVER the hair; Manipulator is WITHIN the hair, so you can do more with it.</li>
            <li> If you do, I&#x27;ll go back to being your loyal customer.</li>
            <li> is if it arrived busted and if it did that, as a Prime member I get mainly from Amazon and they take care of all issues like that</li>
            <li> I watched several videos in Youtube to make sure I am applying it properly, but had no luck.</li>
            <li> no longer uses their older formula.</li>
            <li> the top seamed screwed on tight.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> As other recent reviews have unconfirmed, TIGI decided to change the formula for their Manipulator product, and unfortunately NOT for the better.</li>
            <li> Never sticky, my hair always feels like normal hair.  </li>
            <li> Overall though, it&#x27;s a fun product to work with</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure it does not fit this case&lt;</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s great about this product is that it allows you to style your hair without giving you that hard crusty gel feel/look, and after it sets in and dries your hair feels dry.  </li>
            <li> Personally I thought that there was something wrong with my latest until until some quick research confirmed that the formula was changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are a guy and your hair is to short, there is no point, it isn&#x27;t strong enough to maintain any shape.  </li>
            <li> If you are expecting the original manipulator formula, get ready for a big shocker when you open this.  </li>
            <li> It works really well even with my fine hair, just use a little.  </li>
            <li> so my review is based on this new formula</li>
            <li> but comparing the new product.</li>
            <li> The new product has the viscosity of runny eggs.  </li>
            <li> The new formula is this sparkly, runny stuff with no hold like before.</li>
            <li> Do Not Buy the new formula.</li>
            <li> The new stuff is but a shadow of what it once was.  </li>
            <li> The new texture, smell and hold is not for me.  </li>
            <li> All of the people that thought they received counterfeit products in fact received the new formula.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;5 - at the end of the day, if I haven&#x27;t washed it out of my hair, it&#x27;s still smooth enough to run my hand through it, no residue comes off on your hands, and it dissipates enough through the day that you can go to bed with it still &#x27;in&#x27; and not damage your hair at all</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this manipulator does not weigh down my hair</li>
            <li> It dries very naturally though (not at all like glue or paste), and leaving a sort of fiber in your hair.</li>
            <li> Looked at same product at an ulta and its same as the original.</li>
            <li> good-bye old friend, i&#x27;ll miss you!</li>
            <li> The second jar was identical to the first.</li>
            <li> and, if this is really their &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; formula, it should at least come in a different kind of container so that it doesn&#x27;t spill every time it is opened.</li>
            <li> Had the exact same experience.</li>
            <li> and I only used a tiny bit on my ends or a little more to create more of a tousled vibe, now I&#x27;m not sure it really does much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do realize that a little bit goes a long way and you could easily put too much in your hair or concentrate too much in one</li>
            <li> I have two containers of the old formula, and one new container.  </li>
            <li> The new formula doesn&#x27;t smell, feel, or function NEARLY as well.</li>
            <li> If you buy this stuff, I think you&#x27;re taking a risk that it will be too old of stuff to live up to it</li>
            <li> I just hope TiGi will realize the error of their ways and go back to the old formula {;D}, but I doubt it will happen.</li>
            <li> Mess free and does not flake.</li>
            <li> For lack of a better word, this new formula truly sucks.</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping to help me style my fine limp hair.  </li>
            <li> I wanted firm hold that lasts and have fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Holds well, but not stiff..</li>
            <li> Finally got smart and stopped paying $20 at CVS.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and fine and this really doesn&#x27;t do much for it.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it is hard to find.</li>
            <li> is one of the items that a review is silly to do as I am happy with this product and would have no reason to not reorder in the same manner&lt;</li>
            <li> I never tried the old version of this</li>
            <li> I was surprised how runny this is.  </li>
            <li> Maybe ignorance is bliss, because I didn&#x27;t use the old product.</li>
            <li> He has naturally curly corse hair.</li>
            <li> , they need to return to the old formula.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a complete flop?&lt;br /&gt;Someone</li>
            <li> /&gt;Either way, your lac of communication and approach to the transition was a complete failure.&lt;br /&gt;Shame on you guys.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know enough about hair products to know what a reasonable alternative would be, so I bought some anyway.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think I will be using this much and will go back to buying it in a salon.</li>
            <li> Wow... Just when I needed one do I read that they have changed the formula...</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really notice too much of a difference between this jar that I recently purchased and the stuff I was buying several years ago.</li>
            <li> holds but allows for natural movement.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like butter and a melted glue stick had a baby, and then dressed that baby up like the old manipulator product, and then named it &amp;#34;manipulator&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> i guess the old formula just flew too close to the sun.</li>
            <li> It came fast and was still the same product as before.  </li>
            <li> It was either counterfeit (though it was in the true packaging), or the real product watered down or mixed with another weaker product.  </li>
            <li> nothing bad, fits well, good quality, nothing to complain about... recommended!</li>
            <li> Like other Tigi products, it can be a bit pricey for the amount you get, but the quality is worth it.</li>
            <li> My complaints are also now being taken more seriously.</li>
            <li> This latest purchase of 3 jars was not the same quality as product I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li> well, the second can was just the same as the first.  </li>
            <li> The new formula is thinner, smells much different, and doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It ruins my freshly styled hair and doesn&#x27;t do what it used to.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very sticky feeling but a little dab really will do you.</li>
            <li> I actually thought it was defective and wrote Amazon who is sending me a new jar.  </li>
            <li> The new one is too liquid and doesnt last.  </li>
            <li> lots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The older formula, which I purchased at a store with a big red bulls eye, was the consistency of soft taffy, with a coconut scent.  </li>
            <li> Do you know how distressful that is for a mother who has a teenage son who wants to be in the FORM all the time and constantly harasses you to buy this and that!  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it is original product or not.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a sundry or something I use in everyday life like light bulbs, toilet paper, cereal etc</li>
            <li> My hair stylist advised me to be careful of knock-offs on the Internet, and I am wondering if it is the real thing.</li>
            <li> Tigi, please, please, please bring the old formula back.</li>
            <li> Kneels everything in place and no wet look.  </li>
            <li> My hair also looks gross way quicker with this than the old bed head.  </li>
            <li> not only does it separate the hair and add volume and lift,  i have thinning hair and this makes it look like when i was young.</li>
            <li> my girl friend has started stealing it and won&#x27;t go back to her old products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen my Magic game improve dramatically.</li>
            <li> mind you this stuff can retail for as high as $22 for a single jar when it&#x27;s not on sale.  </li>
            <li> It actually holds your hair up, and you barely need a fingertip&#x27;s amount to keep your hair fixed for the entire day.</li>
            <li> If your hair is getting to long, the weight of your hair will just fall down on its own naturally no more than an hour after styling it.  </li>
            <li> Shipping cost makes this nearly the same price as found in local supermarkets and drug stores.</li>
            <li> Rather than leaving your hair covered with white flakes, it leaves only a natural shine in the position you want your hair to be in.</li>
            <li> If I apply a little more, it weighs my hair down and lays it flat.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered two jars and when I opened the first one, half of it spilled out because it was so runny.</li>
            <li> Clearly they&#x27;ve &amp;#34;gone bad&amp;#34; perhaps from sitting on the shelf too long.</li>
            <li> Just dab a little on with a fingertip and smooth the hairs down with a 100% Boarshead Brush.  </li>
            <li> Also, I did more internet searching, and among other places, saw unhappy comments about the new formula on TIGI&#x27;s facebook page and even TIGI&#x27;s response that it was to meet new regulations</li>
            <li> It feels soft and nice when dry too---never greasy or waxy---and I can leave it in the next day without having the dirty feel to my hair</li>
            <li> Just a little dab, and lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li> After having the seller send me out another can of this product because the first one was old and previously opened (was only half full) and a weird different consistency as opposed to what it should have been-new, unopened, and normal consistency...</li>
            <li> I loved this product, too bad they change the recipe.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your hair stiff but holds really well.  </li>
            <li> I was totally blown away, it&#x27;s pretty much miracle putty, expensive miracle putty at that.  </li>
            <li> This is the type of product that you want to use SPARINGLY as it feels very tacky and a little truly goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Their description of the new product matched what I saw (pearly, less tacky).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and like always it works really well.</li>
            <li> I keep my hair short, around 2-3 inches long</li>
            <li> have it lay flat product.</li>
            <li> It is way overpriced when you buy it in stores at nearly $20 so to find here for almost half the price</li>
            <li> Last long too!!</li>
            <li> i have long curly hair and this works for me because it helps manage my hair without leaving it all sticky.</li>
            <li> It takes the place of a gel and it leaves the hair soft after it has dried.</li>
            <li> Nineteen days to deliver a jar of hair goop is T00 long.</li>
            <li> I have tries several brands of manipulator&#x27;s and</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and this product really makes my hair look either wild or tame....</li>
            <li> The current pomade is inferior to previous formula, in that it&#x27;s not only lost</li>
            <li> In other words, &amp;#34;deceptive advertising&amp;#34;.  The 2nd thing I don&#x27;t like abou</li>
            <li> dry hair &#x3D; fiber type look</li>
            <li> This product is expensive, but well worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> overpriced and average hold equals only &amp;#34;it&#x27;s okay&amp;#34; review.</li>
            <li> I would find that dishonest even if I did like the new formulation.  </li>
            <li> I do this maybe once a week, sometimes less, and it keeps my hair shiny and my nape silky and soft to the touch - not sticky or heavy product buildup either -</li>
            <li> One jar was deifinitely some old product as it was dried out a lot compared to the jars I&#x27;ve purchased previously.  </li>
            <li> I have short, silver/grey hair and recommend using a little at a time.  </li>
            <li> Used heavier you can actually spike hair, but I am long past that stage.  </li>
            <li> Use it with gel to give it a wet look</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent money on dozens of hair fixtures-</li>
            <li> be careful</li>
            <li> Just as expected...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really found of this product.  </li>
            <li> A little lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way to style your hair.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> You can touch your hair after it sets and it doesn&#x27;t get into your hands like some other products do.</li>
            <li> I should have read the other reviews before buying, they all say the formula was changed and now the product doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> Only started using this in the past couple of years.</li>
            <li> This product gives your hair body without looking and feeling sticky like some other products.</li>
            <li> Obviously defective and not sure if its authentically BedHead ....</li>
            <li> It did not have the same consistency as what I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> It does not work the way that other containers that I have purchased.</li>
            <li> I thought oh some other container broke and leaked all over this one</li>
            <li> Not like the usually tacky and matte color and texture that I&#x27;m used to seeing when I open my jar of hair product in the morning.</li>
            <li> The texture is now extremely runny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to begin trying other products</li>
            <li> Super unhappy about this change.</li>
            <li> Was excited to find TIGI Manipulator online, it was much cheaper than in the stores, but I was very disappointed...</li>
            <li> If you have thin, flat hair this stuff will change that instantly.  </li>
            <li> Other less expensive products did not work as well and weighted the hair down too much.</li>
            <li> No matter how bad a hair day, I use the manipulator from Bed Head and its fantastic.</li>
            <li> This small pack actually lasts a few months if used correctly.</li>
            <li> My hair has a messy look with Out being crunchy or having a wet look.</li>
            <li> Weighed my hair down, also.</li>
            <li> It looks watered down.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, keeps hair in place, not sticky, greasy or flakes.</li>
            <li> As a teenager I went through well over half a dozen brands hair gel products before finding out about Bed Head Manipulator.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything about the previous formula on this product as my hairdresser used this on my hair</li>
            <li> Searched Amazon and found it for half the price.</li>
            <li> The price here is about half what I was paying at the salon, and the product is identical.</li>
            <li> The product is not extraordinary.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s formula - in that case lesson learned for half the store price.  </li>
            <li> if I apply less, then it doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> seems a little watered down</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not familiar on the previous formula used.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy to weigh it down</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve noticed a few curious side effects, such as a sudden and inexplicable attraction to Elspeth, Christmas decorations, and Armadillos.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird they don&#x27;t mention that it&#x27;s a new formula anywhere.</li>
            <li> but just adds a little body.  </li>
            <li> After styling put a little on your finger tips and push hair in an upward direction against your scalp.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too runny</li>
            <li> Gets a little sticky...</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what prompted me to look on Amazon to see if I could buy it for less, which I did at about half the price!  </li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> WASTE of money.</li>
            <li> pomade is too grease and messy.</li>
            <li> Just do not apply a heavy amount...  </li>
            <li> and that is why it is heavily discounted.  </li>
            <li> I have heavy Indian hair and this stuff keeps it under control</li>
            <li> Waste of money on my part.  </li>
            <li> Just a little dab worked through gives hair a lift without feeling stiff or gooey and stays in place .</li>
            <li> I got it for half price from Amazon!</li>
            <li> Clearly the formula has changed and now it is glossy and very thin and runny.  </li>
            <li> really disappointed, but at least the online amazon price is so much cheaper than any local place carrying it.</li>
            <li> MAJOR FAIL by the marketing people at Bed Head.</li>
            <li> At first I thought I received a bad batch but, after reading the reviews here, it seems that the formula has been changed.</li>
            <li> I have been using it the past few days</li>
            <li> I recently jumped on a deal on E-Bay and got a mega set which came with 12 of these bad boys in a box for only $59 including shipping.  </li>
            <li> to say this product does nothing is a bit harsh, it does do something: weighs your hair down in a greasy, flat, sticky-icky, totally depressing fashion.</li>
            <li> and I so do hate change and the changers who promise a change for the better to make it far worse!!!</li>
            <li> Smells fruity but not overwhelming - scent fades after it sets.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice a difference between the &amp;#34;new formulation&amp;#34; and the product I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s runny as opposed to being the stiffer version that I recall from past purchases.  </li>
            <li> The container was wrapped in a small plastic bag to contain any leakage; there was none.</li>
            <li> This does not leave shine in your hair, which is usually something that I avoid.</li>
            <li> Small.</li>
            <li> and now it&#x27;s just runny goop, not sure I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> 2 oz might seem small, but mine has lasted me a couple months.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the problem is here.  </li>
            <li> I cannot even use it to shape my sideburns because it loses its shape within a few hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for the past fifteen years</li>
            <li> I have used it for the past two years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an entirely different product with the same name (which feels very, very wrong to me, almost like false advertising).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It may seem expensive, but you use very little each time, so the two ounce container lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I perceived as a gone bad product is really a new formula.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for years and it always was hard to fined.</li>
            <li> hard to beat this price also.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about the &amp;#34;new formulation&amp;#34; after reading all of the negative reviews here but it works well for me.</li>
            <li> This price online is at least manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick.</li>
            <li> This new formula is a runny, smelly mess that has little styling power and leaves my hair feeling tacky and nasty.</li>
            <li> way I use it is I put a very small amount on my fingers, and then rub my hands together.</li>
            <li> The new formula is crap to be blunt.  </li>
            <li> I was much less expensive than purchasing at a retail store.</li>
            <li> the one I just recently opened appears to be a formula change (bad stuff).  </li>
            <li> only way I would give a bad review</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no good anymore.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if Tigi changed the formula of this product or if it was affected negatively by heat or some such issue before delivery, but I am really disappointed with the product I received.</li>
            <li> I hate the white flakes you get with some, or the rock hard televangelist wife look with others.</li>
            <li> The consistancy is different. :(</li>
            <li> Not very happy at all!  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this product through Amazon for years but the last two orders have been very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Very thick.</li>
            <li> Also the lid is broken and it doesn&#x27;t close correctly.</li>
            <li> This is pearlescent and too thin.</li>
            <li> needs to get fired.... or you were forced to change it as you were using illegal ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was suppose to be a thin paste.</li>
            <li> It is no longer a paste, and it is so thin and runny it should be in a pour type container.  </li>
            <li> This was by far my worst product purchase from Amazon yet.  </li>
            <li> The gel either melted in transit or else the wrong gel was put in the container.  </li>
            <li> I was obsessed with this paste after my hairdresser would use it on my hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it seems like Tigi has changed the formula that they are using and the product no longer works as it used to.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a knock-off that I got by accident but sounds like I was wrong.</li>
            <li> The consistency was wrong and I assumed that Bed Head had changed their formula.</li>
            <li> but the reason I give them 1 star is because they didn&#x27;t indicate anywhere that this change happened on their packaging and of course I was stuck with a jar of this useless stuff.  </li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff but its so expensive in the stores.</li>
            <li> Doesnt do the job for me and am sad bed head</li>
            <li> AND it doesn&#x27;t give a nasty smell like other hair products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve requested a replacement, but Amazon requires me to return the defective used container, which is disappointing seeing as I paid about $10 for it.</li>
            <li> The smell drives girls crazy though.</li>
            <li> so maybe the risk isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> As a long-time user I was very disappointed to learn that Tigi had changed the formula.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible.</li>
            <li> this was runny and TERRIBLE.</li>
            <li> Disgusting.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just awful and doesn&#x27;t do a thing for my hair besides make it look greasy.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product and it is hard to find. A little lasts a long time. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased a two pack back in January and one was the old stuff (good) and the one I just recently opened appears to be a formula change (bad stuff).  The new formula is crap to be blunt.  It ruins my freshly styled hair and doesn&#x27;t do what it used to.  The newer is more of a pearly color vs the old which isn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m going to try and post my own image.  I actually thought it was defective and wrote Amazon who is sending me a new jar.  Then I read the reviews and saw that its most likely not defective, but a formula change.</li>
            <li> Love it, does a great job without being goopy and messy.  A bit pricey!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about 6 years now.  As a teenager I went through well over half a dozen brands hair gel products before finding out about Bed Head Manipulator.  I&#x27;d never heard of the Tigi brand, but gave it a shot.  I was totally blown away, it&#x27;s pretty much miracle putty, expensive miracle putty at that.  I&#x27;ve gotten it on sale for about $10, mind you this stuff can retail for as high as $22 for a single jar when it&#x27;s not on sale.  I now only buy this stuff online, saves you A LOT as opposed to buying it retail.  I recently jumped on a deal on E-Bay and got a mega set which came with 12 of these bad boys in a box for only $59 including shipping.  What&#x27;s great about this product is that it allows you to style your hair without giving you that hard crusty gel feel/look, and after it sets in and dries your hair feels dry.  It helps your hair maintain the shape/style you want without it looking blatantly obvious that you&#x27;re wearing gel.  The only downside to this stuff is that it only works for a specific length of hair.  If you are a guy and your hair is to short, there is no point, it isn&#x27;t strong enough to maintain any shape.  If your hair is getting to long, the weight of your hair will just fall down on its own naturally no more than an hour after styling it.  I keep my hair short, around 2-3 inches long and it works GREAT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 9 years or so. Like everyone else, I was very upset when they changed the formula. It worked so well before.  Now I have to add something else to it for the performance I like. What&#x27;s amazing is that the price went up when the quality went down. There is still nothing that works the same, so I keep buying it.  I just hope TiGi will realize the error of their ways and go back to the old formula {;D}, but I doubt it will happen. I also hope they do not stop manufacturing this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff cheapest place to by it</li>
            <li> The gel either melted in transit or else the wrong gel was put in the container.  The gel delivered is nothing like this product normally appears and does not work effectively.</li>
            <li> I never tried the old version of this so my review is based on this new formula and I&#x27;m but comparing the new product. I just cut my hair really short in a Bob and my hair dresser used this product on my hair. I didn&#x27;t buy it right away and my hair wasn&#x27;t cooperating so I asked her what she used and ordered it right away. I have been using it the past few days and I am happy I got it. My hair has a messy look with Out being crunchy or having a wet look. I am very happy with this product</li>
            <li> I love this product it is amazing for your hair it is a little messy but it is totally worth and it works for any kind of hair</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s good for short hair and long hair. Both myself and my wife use it. A+</li>
            <li> *****&lt;br /&gt;Bedhead Manipulator by Tigi is a unisex hair cream that can be used for styling, texturizing, and forming. It is not really a gel, more like a very sticky cream (almost like glue or paste...or even cement!) that is the consistency of honey. It dries very naturally though (not at all like glue or paste), and leaving a sort of fiber in your hair. Although all of this sounds weird, it seems to work much better than hairspray, which leaves a film OVER the hair; Manipulator is WITHIN the hair, so you can do more with it. It feels soft and nice when dry too---never greasy or waxy---and I can leave it in the next day without having the dirty feel to my hair that leaving the hairspray in does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way I use it is I put a very small amount on my fingers, and then rub my hands together. Next I apply it throughout my hair, but especially to the roots for lift. Lastly I twist and sort of \\&quot;tweak\\&quot; the ends of my hair to add texture. I have a short haircut, and it is the perfect product for people who have very little time or skill but who want a tousled and textured look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may seem expensive, but you use very little each time, so the two ounce container lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;*****</li>
            <li> Works great for any hair type.</li>
            <li> I have always liked this product. Works great to style my frizzy, curly hair or to straighten it. It came quickly in the mail through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I am a man who styles my hair as a \\&quot;side-part\\&quot; gives excellent hold and retains volume which was a huge problem with other products</li>
            <li> Works well but don&#x27;t travel on a plane with this, it will leak all over the place, the container does not seal well (experienced on two different tubs)...</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered for a great price.</li>
            <li> i have long curly hair and this works for me because it helps manage my hair without leaving it all sticky.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product through Amazon for years but the last two orders have been very disappointing.  Clearly the formula has changed and now it is glossy and very thin and runny.  I have short hair and this product is not working for me any more.  Guess I will have to find another product that works for my spikey hair.</li>
            <li> I have men&#x27;s medium length fine straight hair. If your hair texture is different YMMV.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many different types of hair gel and pastes. This one is one of the best.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0010NRXYM TIGI Bed Head A Hair Stick for Cool People 2.7 oz (.77 g)]] and Manipulator are my two go-to products daily. It has medium hold that is workable and doesn&#x27;t get sticky. You can touch your hair after it sets and it doesn&#x27;t get into your hands like some other products do. Water reactivates it if you need to reset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So easy to use. I take about an almond size and it&#x27;s all I need. Smells fruity but not overwhelming - scent fades after it sets.</li>
            <li> Not what I remember it being like. I should have read the other reviews before buying, they all say the formula was changed and now the product doesn&#x27;t work as well. Also the lid is broken and it doesn&#x27;t close correctly. Waste of money</li>
            <li> I was surprised how runny this is.  I have used this product before and it has never been like this.</li>
            <li> This is NOT, repeat NOT the original formula. It&#x27;s terrible. DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> She loves this product and says &amp;#34;it&#x27;s the best, it will stand your hair straight on end without making it sticky&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This product is great for short hair styles. Just a little dab worked through gives hair a lift without feeling stiff or gooey and stays in place . Great for those messy &amp;#34;just got out of bed&amp;#34; funky looks.</li>
            <li> I love Bed Head Manipulator!! Once I use it my hair stays in place even on windy days . I&#x27;ll never go without it.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way to style your hair.  I wish they sold this product in bulk in 4oz jars or more.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if Tigi changed the formula of this product or if it was affected negatively by heat or some such issue before delivery, but I am really disappointed with the product I received. I&#x27;ve used Manipulator for years and the consistency has never been like this container; it is soupy/watery instead of being more like a paste. This product is even more watery than a similar product, Mastermind, made by this company. I&#x27;ve requested a replacement, but Amazon requires me to return the defective used container, which is disappointing seeing as I paid about $10 for it. Of course, Amazon will cover the return shipping, but it&#x27;s still an inconvenience. I&#x27;m wondering if the replacement will be any better.</li>
            <li> Husband loves this for his hair the best hold but not too strong you can&#x27;t run your hands through it.</li>
            <li> Great product. I was concerned about the &amp;#34;new formulation&amp;#34; after reading all of the negative reviews here but it works well for me. I don&#x27;t notice a difference between the &amp;#34;new formulation&amp;#34; and the product I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping to help me style my fine limp hair.  It made me break out.  My face seemed to be greasy from my hair rubbing on my skin.  Did not work well at all for me.  Weighed my hair down, also. I did&#x27;nt care for the smell after it was on awhile.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product! I have short hair and its perfect for texture and holds great! And you can&#x27;t beat the price anywhere!</li>
            <li> Great product, especially for like a punky, cool look. it isnt like a greasy look at all, and you can mold your hair any way you want too.</li>
            <li> Great for men to get that spiked up just woke up look. Gives your hair more volume. I do feel that I need to shower it out anytime I&#x27;m going to be laying around the house for fear off it rubbing off on a pillow and getting on my skin.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for many years.  Family members with allergies to fragrances are not at all bothered by it.  So, it may be a good choice for others with similar allergy concerns.  It also functions very well for its intended purpose.</li>
            <li> Read all the reviews here, and it seems like there could be a mass protest outside BedHead HQ about changing the manipulator. Maybe ignorance is bliss, because I didn&#x27;t use the old product. Only started using this in the past couple of years. I like it, and every time I try a cheaper option, I go back to this. Just a little dab, and lasts the whole day. I hate the white flakes you get with some, or the rock hard televangelist wife look with others. This is perfect for me. Smells nice too, for the ladies.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for spiking and holding my style without drying or flaking.  The price is fabulous considering it&#x27;s $18 or more at other stores.</li>
            <li> Works ok but different than it used to be. Looked at same product at an ulta and its same as the original. This is pearlescent and too thin.</li>
            <li> This is the type of product that you want to use SPARINGLY as it feels very tacky and a little truly goes a long way. I primarily use it around my edges to keep my hairdo looking sleek and fresh between bi-weekly salon visits.  Just dab a little on with a fingertip and smooth the hairs down with a 100% Boarshead Brush.  I do this maybe once a week, sometimes less, and it keeps my hair shiny and my nape silky and soft to the touch - not sticky or heavy product buildup either - but again I suggest using a very light touch.</li>
            <li> My sons favorite product. He has naturally curly corse hair.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair manageable and very easy to style.  Not greasy but adds shine to your hair.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> I have used this styling product for years!  It works really well even with my fine hair, just use a little.  Great for Thick hair too, just use more!</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t look or feel the same.  It&#x27;s runny as opposed to being the stiffer version that I recall from past purchases.  I thought maybe it was heat related, but I keep it in a drawer in a room that is air conditioned.  My hair stylist advised me to be careful of knock-offs on the Internet, and I am wondering if it is the real thing.</li>
            <li> I hope the product that I ordered isn&#x27;t a knock off because it was way below what I pay for it at my hair dresser.</li>
            <li> I have two containers of the old formula, and one new container.  There&#x27;s a big difference in the lots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The older formula, which I purchased at a store with a big red bulls eye, was the consistency of soft taffy, with a coconut scent.  The new product has the viscosity of runny eggs.  I know I didn&#x27;t leave it out in the sun.  It looks watered down.  I suppose it needs to be stored upright, so I won&#x27;t use it for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old product was much better.  When you think of the term &amp;#34;Manipulator&amp;#34; you think of something related to the word &amp;#34;Malleable&amp;#34;. Products such as a clay, or Play Dough come to mind, not under cooked tapioca.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, they need to return to the old formula.  As for why they changed it, I&#x27;m sure it looked great on some finance guru&#x27;s resume  to water down some hair gunk for improving the bottom line.</li>
            <li> This is the best gel for my hair.  Not too heavy to weigh it down but just adds a little body.  Used heavier you can actually spike hair, but I am long past that stage.  I am more interested now in keeping the scalp covered.  And it smells like coconut, which is light but obvious.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about the product cause I simply love it. Shipping and Handling was . Use it with gel to give it a wet look</li>
            <li> Best price for the same product they sell in the salons.  If the formula has changed, I haven&#x27;t noticed.  The price at the store sure as heck did!  It&#x27;s almost twice what it was a year ago.  This price online is at least manageable.</li>
            <li> I have short, silver/grey hair and recommend using a little at a time.  This product gives your hair body without looking and feeling sticky like some other products.</li>
            <li> Just a great product. Lasts forever.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Takes my hair to a whole nother level! I will continue to purchase this product This stuff till they stop making it!</li>
            <li> great hair product to style your hair. ever since I used this never wanted anything else. does not flake or make your hair hard/stiff. recommend everyone to get and price is great!!!</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t the same product that it use to be a couple of years ago.  seems a little watered down</li>
            <li> I wanted firm hold that lasts and have fine hair.  While this would work for some, I found that Kendra products worked better.  Shipping cost makes this nearly the same price as found in local supermarkets and drug stores.</li>
            <li> If you have thin, flat hair this stuff will change that instantly.  After styling put a little on your finger tips and push hair in an upward direction against your scalp.  Your hair will pop to life.  Hair spray it and go!!  If you have static it works wonders on the ends of the hair to calm those flyaways down.  Get some...STAT!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item from retail outlets for years and know the quality to expect- this was runny and TERRIBLE. WASTE of money.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything about the previous formula on this product as my hairdresser used this on my hair and i liked the result.  I&#x27;m not familiar on the previous formula used. Checked the price at Utla which is much higher as usual.  Searched Amazon and found it for half the price.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  It provides very good hold without making your hair stiff.  It works well for all hair lengths.  I would give it 5 stars if not for the fact that it does make your hair somewhat sticky.</li>
            <li> I used the original formula for over a decade.  It was wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I will not use any more Bed Head products.  This new formula is a runny, smelly mess that has little styling power and leaves my hair feeling tacky and nasty.</li>
            <li> I was buying the manipulator at my salon until I saw that it was offered here. The price here is about half what I was paying at the salon, and the product is identical. It is wrapped to prevent any leakage and arrived in excellent condition. It arrived quickly and the product is exactly as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;If you like a good hair paste at a fair price, this is the place to go.</li>
            <li> The Golden age of Bed head is at stake and they deserve their fate.&lt;br /&gt;You changed the &amp;#34;Manipulator&amp;#34; formula and it&#x27;s a complete flop?&lt;br /&gt;Someone needs to get fired.... or you were forced to change it as you were using illegal ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Either way, your lac of communication and approach to the transition was a complete failure.&lt;br /&gt;Shame on you guys.&lt;br /&gt;We the consumers made you a success, and now we are going to do the contrary.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too runny</li>
            <li> product is murky and seal not correct on lid of jar. Obviously defective and not sure if its authentically BedHead ....WARNING</li>
            <li> This small pack actually lasts a few months if used correctly. Best for comb overs or other styles that only require a loose hold that can be plyable. Mess free and does not flake. Best if used when your hair is almost dry after a shower.</li>
            <li> I think this product is great especially if you have hair strands that are always sticking out. The formula is very sticky so after applying it you have to wash your hands. It takes the place of a gel and it leaves the hair soft after it has dried.Overall, I love this product I think it is great!</li>
            <li> I used Bed Head Manipulator for over 10 years. I loved the stuff. It had a great smell and  just the right amount of hold and feel after going into my hair. For some reason (and I&#x27;d love to know why), the product formula has totally changed. The new formula doesn&#x27;t smell, feel, or function NEARLY as well. This is a total bummer. I thought I had my hair product figured out for life! Now I&#x27;m trying to find a suitable replacement and not having much luck. Tigi, please, please, please bring the old formula back. If you do, I&#x27;ll go back to being your loyal customer. Until then I&#x27;ll be buying someone else&#x27;s product!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, I was had my hair cut so I could put it in a fax hawk and a friend recommended this product. It gave me great flexibility to put my hair in just the right place and kept it there all the way through the day. I love this product and will use it agin.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look good. I can easily adjust my hair into any form I want. AND it doesn&#x27;t give a nasty smell like other hair products. Last long too!!</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for years and have liked it. This latest purchase of 3 jars was not the same quality as product I have bought in the past. It was very liquid, almost like water. It did not have the same consistency as what I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer, mine came and was pearly/milky in appearance and didn&#x27;t have the tackiness of the same thing I have purchased in the salon or at Target...Amazon was great about the return, though - no issues at all!</li>
            <li> This was suppose to be a thin paste. It is too watery. It does not work the way that other containers that I have purchased. I was told that Tigi changed the formula and now the quality is not to the same.</li>
            <li> Great product. Kneels everything in place and no wet look.  Was very surprised and will def be ordering more for sure!</li>
            <li> Bed Head is the best manipulator!  I have used it for 20 years and it works great on my fine hair to add volume.  Never sticky, my hair always feels like normal hair.  Amazon&#x27;s price was by far the best and the product was delivered as promised and arrived in good condition.  The container was wrapped in a small plastic bag to contain any leakage; there was none.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this manipulator does not weigh down my hair in fact it helps me style my hair and looks like I have more hair! Great product!</li>
            <li> it gets the job done, but i don&#x27;t know if i will stay with it.  overpriced and average hold equals only &amp;#34;it&#x27;s okay&amp;#34; review.</li>
            <li> Okay, I read the reviews on this product and the disappointment others had experienced.  I don&#x27;t know enough about hair products to know what a reasonable alternative would be, so I bought some anyway.  It is definitely not even kind of the same.  It&#x27;s a lot more runny and takes a lot more to produce the same results.  My hair also looks gross way quicker with this than the old bed head.  really disappointed, but at least the online amazon price is so much cheaper than any local place carrying it.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by my hairdresser and love it, goes a long way and a great styling product</li>
            <li> The formula for manipulator has changed.  It is nothing like the original formula.  If you are expecting the original manipulator formula, get ready for a big shocker when you open this.  If they are going to change a formula so drastically, just rename it as something else.  The new formula is this sparkly, runny stuff with no hold like before.</li>
            <li> it is not the quality I was used to in this product. It is very sticky and doesn&#x27;t have the fragrance.  Don&#x27;t think I will be using this much and will go back to buying it in a salon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 10 years. It was my favorite product, really the only one I used since 2004. However, with my most recent purchase I was dismayed to discover that they&#x27;ve changed the formula significantly. It&#x27;s an entirely different product with the same name (which feels very, very wrong to me, almost like false advertising). The new formula is thinner, smells much different, and doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this change, Tigi has lost a 10-years-loyal customer. I&#x27;ll be looking elsewhere for a styling product from now on unless I hear Tigi has returned to the original formula.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and the price is much better here than locally.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser introduced me to this product and works great for my thin hair and smells so nice and never sticky.</li>
            <li> Wow... Just when I needed one do I read that they have changed the formula... I have been using it for 10 plus years and now have to ditch this...and I so do hate change and the changers who promise a change for the better to make it far worse!!!</li>
            <li> Great product, have used it for years.  I have really thick hair and this product really makes my hair look either wild or tame....</li>
            <li> I cant use anything else.  I love this stuff (the original formula).  The new one is too liquid and doesnt last.  You will go thougth the whole thing rather quickly.  However, the old forumula works great and last a long time.  You dont need a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is fantastic and I get compliments on it rather frequently.  I love that this doesnt leave your hair greasy feeling or looking.  And a big one....NO flaking!  :)</li>
            <li> A great hair jelly for a good price!</li>
            <li> There seem to be a lot of haters but I don&#x27;t really notice too much of a difference between this jar that I recently purchased and the stuff I was buying several years ago. I like the product.</li>
            <li> my son loves this product</li>
            <li> Bought it from a salon for twice the price!!!!  So glad to find it here.  Will reorder again.  Best stuff on the planet for short hair.</li>
            <li> I loved this product, too bad they change the recipe. I found an alternate.</li>
            <li> pomade is too grease and messy. this stuff holds but conditions the hair and smells amazing. holds but allows for natural movement.</li>
            <li> do you like it when your tresses look like a melting dali painting? do you feel positively about your hair smelling like lip smackers chapstick? do you enjoy being lied to?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;then this is the product for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as so many others have said, this is not the product it used to be. it&#x27;s like butter and a melted glue stick had a baby, and then dressed that baby up like the old manipulator product, and then named it &amp;#34;manipulator&amp;#34;. i feel like charlie brown when lucy pulls the football away. to say this product does nothing is a bit harsh, it does do something: weighs your hair down in a greasy, flat, sticky-icky, totally depressing fashion. eor would love it. i guess the old formula just flew too close to the sun. good-bye old friend, i&#x27;ll miss you!</li>
            <li> Great product even better price.</li>
            <li> I was obsessed with this paste after my hairdresser would use it on my hair. It smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Do realize that a little bit goes a long way and you could easily put too much in your hair or concentrate too much in one area.&lt;br /&gt;It is buildable, so you can create a solid style that won&#x27;t budge easily.&lt;br /&gt;But this also worked when I just wanted to run my fingers through my hair and create a styled bed head look.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t re-purchase this item in the future, I&#x27;ve found a go-to product &amp;#34;fiber.&amp;#34; The consistency of this product is similar to conditioner. It does do pretty well styling, in the Florida heat however, it really just melts in your hair. You&#x27;re still able to style your hair, it just doesn&#x27;t keep it up like other products. This does not leave shine in your hair, which is usually something that I avoid. Overall though, it&#x27;s a fun product to work with and it smell swell.</li>
            <li> After having the seller send me out another can of this product because the first one was old and previously opened (was only half full) and a weird different consistency as opposed to what it should have been-new, unopened, and normal consistency...well, the second can was just the same as the first.  I have been buying this product for 8 years and never seen it look and move like what they sent me.  I would beware of this sellers stock of this item.</li>
            <li> Disgusting. The formula has changed and it is not the same product that I have bought for years. Will never buy again.</li>
            <li> Small. but hold well....  Just do not apply a heavy amount...  Gets a little sticky...</li>
            <li> Got this wrapped in a sandwich bag to prevent the leaking goop from compromising the shipment box.  Opening up the bag the top seamed screwed on tight.  I thought oh some other container broke and leaked all over this one and that is why it is heavily discounted.  No problem, I&#x27;ll wash it off and take the discount.  Then I opened it...  It was watery, rusted inside, and looked weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;March 2, 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to update this review.  This product is no longer what it use to be.  What I perceived as a gone bad product is really a new formula.  It&#x27;s just not the same and doesn&#x27;t work for me.  The girl who cuts my hair recommended Redken Rewind 06.  Works great and is sold here on Amazon.  Check the Redken website to make sure your getting the most up to date packaging verifying that it is fresh.</li>
            <li> They changed the formula. It is now &#x27;pearly&#x27; looking and has a totally different consistency and smell. AND: It does not perform as my favorite Manipulator used to. Do Not Buy the new formula. You will end up returning it, as I did. Now I have to shop for a similar product. Redkin 06 is good, but not the same. Boo TIGI for ruining what was an amazing product!</li>
            <li> holds great.  looks natural.. smells good.  this product holds well. without looking like there is too much junk in your hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tigi Bed Heat Manipulator for 5 years! It&#x27;s great. It makes my hair look like the day after washing, without looking greasy or overly crunchy. Unfortunately, it seems like Tigi has changed the formula that they are using and the product no longer works as it used to. The smell, look, and hold of the product is different. I would NOT recommend this newer formula.</li>
            <li> I have been using Bed Head Manipulator for years and up until my most recent purchase I had been a satisfied customer.  Tigi changed the product and did not give any indication on the packaging.  I would find that dishonest even if I did like the new formulation.  And I don&#x27;t.  It doesn&#x27;t retain any of the things that made the original product great.  I&#x27;m now looking for an alternative.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products to do different looks with your hair. It doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, keeps hair in place, not sticky, greasy or flakes. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product works great just as it was advertised. I would not hesitate to recommend this product to any one who is considering purchasing one.</li>
            <li> I will continued to buy this on line. I have used this for years and it always was hard to fined.</li>
            <li> Had shoulder length hair for years &amp; years, now for the last six or seven years have short to medium short, spiky hair. This is by far the best product for hair that commands just a bit of hold, rinses out with water @ night and is totally pliable with just a drop of water after four hours.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  No matter how bad a hair day, I use the manipulator from Bed Head and its fantastic. Tried other products to style hair, nothing is as good.  its a gooey miracle!</li>
            <li> I have heavy Indian hair and this stuff keeps it under control</li>
            <li> Bummer, as the other reviewers have pointed out, TIGI changed their formula (I&#x27;ve been using this to tame my fly away fine hair ends for probably a decade) and now it&#x27;s just runny goop, not sure I&#x27;d buy it again. It used to be really sticky and I only used a tiny bit on my ends or a little more to create more of a tousled vibe, now I&#x27;m not sure it really does much. It&#x27;s weird they don&#x27;t mention that it&#x27;s a new formula anywhere. Why, Tony and Guy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone know of a good replacement? I need a new hair product now!</li>
            <li> What can I say, it&#x27;s hair product and I knew what I was getting. The smell drives girls crazy though. Never mind Lynx, or Axe...this stuff is very attractive to women!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for more than ten years. I recently ordered two jars and when I opened the first one, half of it spilled out because it was so runny. The consistency is totally different. At first I thought I received a bad batch but, after reading the reviews here, it seems that the formula has been changed. The second jar was identical to the first. I don&#x27;t like it at all and, if this is really their &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; formula, it should at least come in a different kind of container so that it doesn&#x27;t spill every time it is opened. I tried Garnier Fructis Style Move It Manipulating Gel for a fraction of the price, and it is much more like the old Bed Head product that I liked so much. I will not buy Bed Head Manipulator again.</li>
            <li> Great product I guess, but not enough hold for me. I spike my hair. I&#x27;ve used bed head before and loved it, guess it was a different kind.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Perfect for flyaways!</li>
            <li> My hair is thick. Very thick. Most gels don&#x27;t cut the job for my \\&quot;messy\\&quot; look; they tend to leave an exuberant amount of flakes while only holding my hair up for... what, 30 minutes? 45 at best?&lt;br /&gt;The manipulator differs immensely in this regard. When you open the box, its coconut smell greets you with a very smooth, not-so-sticky texture that applies easily onto your hair. It actually holds your hair up, and you barely need a fingertip&#x27;s amount to keep your hair fixed for the entire day. If you actually like white gel/mousse flakes in your hair, then this cream isn&#x27;t for you. Rather than leaving your hair covered with white flakes, it leaves only a natural shine in the position you want your hair to be in. I&#x27;ve spent money on dozens of hair fixtures- I have to admit, this one was the best, followed closely by the SexyShortHair product line.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend you try a bottle. 2 oz might seem small, but mine has lasted me a couple months.</li>
            <li> Great product, kind of pricy.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price</li>
            <li> Great stuff, holds well and looks matte not glossy.  Does feel gunky/greesy, so your GF might not like that.  Be sure to reseal the container, evaporation is an issue.</li>
            <li> I will not be ordering from Deals for Beauty again. Nineteen days to deliver a jar of hair goop is T00 long. The lid was dented. The product is not extraordinary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Bed Head Manipulator before.so it isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; to me. It&#x27;s excellent..Holds well, but not stiff..I&#x27;d reccomend this type of product toanyone with short hair..that needs a spiky look.</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for years and love it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product but it does not take very much be careful</li>
            <li> Not sure what the problem is here.  I&#x27;ve purchased this product at the store, and what came from Amazon is NOT the same consistency.  Leaves my hair greasy looking and does NOT hold the style.  Waste of money on my part.  Unless, of course, the brand has changed it&#x27;s formula - in that case lesson learned for half the store price.  Either way, going into the trash!</li>
            <li> As a canned response to a requested review, I state this:&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the items that a review is silly to do as I am happy with this product and would have no reason to not reorder in the same manner&lt;br /&gt;It is a sundry or something I use in everyday life like light bulbs, toilet paper, cereal etc&lt;br /&gt;the only way I would give a bad review is if it arrived busted and if it did that, as a Prime member I get mainly from Amazon and they take care of all issues like that so I&#x27;m sure it does not fit this case&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product it works very good</li>
            <li> The first item I received was all foamy and watery but I contacted Amazon to let them know it was either counterfeit or just a factory error. Amazon sent a new one right away and it&#x27;s my normal strong yet soft with perfect hold whether you want spiked hair, volume, or have it lay flat product. It really is the perfect gel. And your hair will still looks good the next day.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years, and when I received this order, I couldn&#x27;t believe I had ordered the same stuff as before.  It is no longer a paste, and it is so thin and runny it should be in a pour type container.  You can&#x27;t even get it out with your fingers.  I searched online to see if others were having the same issue with this product, and yes, they were.  I won&#x27;t ever buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and absolutely love it! I was much less expensive than purchasing at a retail store.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product for spiked hair. Gives you great control and keeps hair where you want it.&lt;br /&gt;I use other bed head products that are very good like their shampoo and conditoner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and like always it works really well. It is way overpriced when you buy it in stores at nearly $20 so to find here for almost half the price is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this product gives it some body.  Makes it easier to work with my hair and keeps it in place when I&#x27;m finished.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I totally agree with Nate. Had the exact same experience. I loved the product until one time I bought it and it was different. I thought it was a knock-off that I got by accident but sounds like I was wrong. I could see and feel the difference. It&#x27;s like they are trying to make a buck by whipping air into the product like &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; cream cheese  this is NOT the same good product anymore.</li>
            <li> I was trying to find this online for a better price and I got it!  TIGI products are awesome!  I&#x27;ve been using them for years I just did not know it it would work men.  My son is happy and I am happy too because I tried different product like wax or paste from other brands and he did not like it. My point is when will I arrive at a product he likes  I end up buying a lot of brands and end up spending more money! Then he liked it! Do you know how distressful that is for a mother who has a teenage son who wants to be in the FORM all the time and constantly harasses you to buy this and that!  Happy mother!</li>
            <li> male here. only thing i use. only use to keep my short hair from getting frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have tries several brands of manipulator&#x27;s and TIGI Bed Head works the best for me. I always come back.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff.  It&#x27;s definitely worth the price.  It lasts all day, doesn&#x27;t leave a flaky residue as the day goes on,  and it smells SO good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using products for 15 years.  10 years or so ago I used got to be glued but this is so much better.  I&#x27;ve been using Bed Head Manipulator for 5 years or so and it works great.</li>
            <li> As other recent reviews have unconfirmed, TIGI decided to change the formula for their Manipulator product, and unfortunately NOT for the better. The current pomade is inferior to previous formula, in that it&#x27;s not only lost it&#x27;s wonderful and clean fragrant, but the paste has been made more \\&quot;soupy\\&quot; and water-downed, thus leaving a greasy look when applied to hair, and requiring far more of an amount to actually style and hold one&#x27;s hairstyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product exclusively for over 12 years, I&#x27;ve decided to move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you enjoy your cruise on the S.S. Failboat TIGI...</li>
            <li> Was excited to find TIGI Manipulator online, it was much cheaper than in the stores, but I was very disappointed...it is not the same stuff...Not very happy at all!  The texture is different and doesn&#x27;t work as well.  Wanting to return...</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Great value.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product on line for years and this time when I received it, it was not at all the same product! The consistency was wrong and I assumed that Bed Head had changed their formula. When I bought some in the store I discovered that the formula hadn&#x27;t changed; I&#x27;d been duped! By the time I had discovered the discrepancy, I had almost finished the can or I would have returned it. I will be more wary in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over 10 years and has always been my favorite.  With the recent change in the formulation it&#x27;s nothing like it was before.  I understand if Bed Head wants to change it&#x27;s formula for environmental reasons but the reason I give them 1 star is because they didn&#x27;t indicate anywhere that this change happened on their packaging and of course I was stuck with a jar of this useless stuff.  Anytime a company makes a change of this magnitude it should be mentioned somewhere on the packaging.  MAJOR FAIL by the marketing people at Bed Head.</li>
            <li> When I found out that this was the the preferred coiffure cream of one Brian Kibler, I immediately bought some for myself. I&#x27;ve seen my Magic game improve dramatically. My complaints are also now being taken more seriously. However, I&#x27;ve noticed a few curious side effects, such as a sudden and inexplicable attraction to Elspeth, Christmas decorations, and Armadillos.</li>
            <li> I was a HUGE fan of the old formulation.  It reminded me of melted taffy, and it made your hair do EXACTLY what you wanted (for messier looks).  The new stuff is but a shadow of what it once was.  TIGI needs to bring back the original formula.</li>
            <li> I bought 6 of these to get free shipping but they were watery when I opened them. Clearly they&#x27;ve &amp;#34;gone bad&amp;#34; perhaps from sitting on the shelf too long. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years now and it works really well.  It doesn&#x27;t make your hair stiff but holds really well.  I&#x27;d recommend getting this product from amazon as it&#x27;s a lot cheaper here.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and I got it for half price from Amazon! It gives my hair the texture I wanted. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff but its so expensive in the stores. Found a great deal here would buy again.</li>
            <li> It came fast and was still the same product as before.  People have said its not the same, but it still does the job.  hard to beat this price also.</li>
            <li> I like this product as it defines individual strands of hair. I just use my fingers with a tiny bit of this on my finger and pull it through some strands to reduce frizzy, blow-around pieces and to define the strands. It really makes a difference.  Putting too much on would make my hair too heavy, but this product does not do that, if used sparingly.  Other less expensive products did not work as well and weighted the hair down too much.</li>
            <li> Just as expected...I lovethis stuff!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have very short boyish pixie hair. My hair is thin and fine and this really doesn&#x27;t do much for it. I can&#x27;t do any type of spiky or funky style with it and it doesn&#x27;t keep my hair up at all. If I apply a little more, it weighs my hair down and lays it flat. if I apply less, then it doesn&#x27;t do anything. I watched several videos in Youtube to make sure I am applying it properly, but had no luck. I cannot even use it to shape my sideburns because it loses its shape within a few hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for the past fifteen years and I keep using it.  I find it&#x27;s price much better through amazon then any other place.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and like it a lot. It does hold the style well and not need hair spray.</li>
            <li> not only does it separate the hair and add volume and lift,  i have thinning hair and this makes it look like when i was young. also gives you one extra day before shampoos on those hurried days. have turned many people on to it and everybody loves it. my favorite grooming product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really found of this product.  It doesn&#x27;t work well with my hair and I don&#x27;t like what happens when my hair gets rained on with it.  I&#x27;ve giving what&#x27;s left of mine on to a friend.  Now to be fair they loved it and bought more.  So like every product, it&#x27;s great for some but not for others.</li>
            <li> Love the control, fullness, and consistency of this stuff.  Having tried a lot of different products like this, I keep coming back to Manipulator.</li>
            <li> For lack of a better word, this new formula truly sucks. It performs like a totally different product. I was so attached to the old product, I used it daily for years and loved it.  Super unhappy about this change.</li>
            <li> This product is great for fine, limp hair but just a TAD does the job!!! Do not use too much at one time</li>
            <li> Not the original formula! Too goopy.</li>
            <li> Changed formula. It&#x27;s no good anymore.</li>
            <li> Keeps hair in place.  A bit to sticky for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for a while now.  What I like abou it is that it&#x27;s easy to use, takes a small amount, washes off easily and isn&#x27;t too goopy on my hands or hair.  What I don&#x27;t like about it is the misleading packaging that is clearly designed to make you think you&#x27;re getting more than you are.  If you look at the image it looks like a bottom tier is filled with the product but that is just colored plastic.  In other words, &amp;#34;deceptive advertising&amp;#34;.  The 2nd thing I don&#x27;t like abou it is that the price increases almost every time I go to buy it at local hair shops.  It&#x27;s not worth $16 and is now $20 at most places.  That&#x27;s what prompted me to look on Amazon to see if I could buy it for less, which I did at about half the price!  I bought two and this may be the last time I buy it.  One jar was deifinitely some old product as it was dried out a lot compared to the jars I&#x27;ve purchased previously.  If you buy this stuff, I think you&#x27;re taking a risk that it will be too old of stuff to live up to it&#x27;s &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; standard, but then it was relatively inexpensive on Amazon so maybe the risk isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!!  Definitely would order again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and years. I like the product, but I always buy it from my salon. These were sort of milky and shiny/pearly looking. Not like the usually tacky and matte color and texture that I&#x27;m used to seeing when I open my jar of hair product in the morning.</li>
            <li> This was by far my worst product purchase from Amazon yet.  I have been using this product for years and this is the first time I&#x27;ve had a batch that was inconsistent with the dozens I&#x27;ve bought in the past.  It was either counterfeit (though it was in the true packaging), or the real product watered down or mixed with another weaker product.  I buy this particular product because it has the best &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; of any hair gel I have ever used, but this batch was fake and I had to immediately buy another one.  I will never order from this supplier again and I would advise that no one else order from them either.</li>
            <li> the product has changed. instead of being a taffy that i absolutely loved, it&#x27;s not more the consistency of that jet puffed marshmallow spread. it&#x27;s just awful and doesn&#x27;t do a thing for my hair besides make it look greasy. it smells like a urinal cake as well. the only reason this is called bed head manipulator is because they manipulated everyone into paying top dollar to smear their junk in their hair.</li>
            <li> I liked it, it is what expected. Description is correct, do not need to repeat it all, nothing bad, fits well, good quality, nothing to complain about... recommended!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Excellent transaction</li>
            <li> Love it on my hair, holds my style.</li>
            <li> This product is great for giving your hair that chunky, spiky, messy look without leaving a lot of extra residue. It has a strong hold and smells great in your hair. Like other Tigi products, it can be a bit pricey for the amount you get, but the quality is worth it.</li>
            <li> Great strong manipulator.  I used to use maximum strength gel to maintain a spiked hairstyle but gel does flake at times.  This never flakes and does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very sticky feeling but a little dab really will do you.</li>
            <li> Love this for my hair - recommended by my hairstylist and I couldn&#x27;t find locally.  Was very happy to find on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands and found that bed head manipulator works the best for me.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for my pixie haircut. A little bit goes a long way so don&#x27;t just scoop out have a handful. It is the best smelling hair product I have right now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years now, and still love it.  I am constantly trying new pomades and hair products just to see if anything stacks up (free samples) and nothing does.  I can emphatically say that nothing does.  This product is expensive, but well worth the extra money. AND YES they did change the formula, but it didn&#x27;t take away from the quality of it at all, the smell just changed slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless this product is great for a few main reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1 - it washes out clean every time, even with just water&lt;br /&gt;2 - it can give you a multitude of looks, wetter hair &#x3D; pomade/gel type look, dry hair &#x3D; fiber type look&lt;br /&gt;3 - as the day goes on this product remains workable, but doesn&#x27;t look &#x27;greasy&#x27; or flake like gells or some fibers&lt;br /&gt;4 - it&#x27;s so versatile my girl friend has started stealing it and won&#x27;t go back to her old products&lt;br /&gt;5 - at the end of the day, if I haven&#x27;t washed it out of my hair, it&#x27;s still smooth enough to run my hand through it, no residue comes off on your hands, and it dissipates enough through the day that you can go to bed with it still &#x27;in&#x27; and not damage your hair at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps, this product kicks ass and is better than anything your stylist would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AK</li>
            <li> The consistency is no longer what it used to be. The texture is now extremely runny. it looks and feels like shampoo! Doesnt do the job for me and am sad bed head no longer uses their older formula.</li>
            <li> Great goop.  Use a little bit of water for a fresh look or a lot of water and it will harden like a handsome shell on your head.  Try one to confirm my unquestionable integrity, then wise up and buy bulk to save money.</li>
            <li> Not same as original product.  Not sure if it is original product or not.  The consistancy is different. :(</li>
            <li> As a long-time user I was very disappointed to learn that Tigi had changed the formula.  The new texture, smell and hold is not for me.  If you didn&#x27;t like bed head before, perhaps it&#x27;s worth trying.  I&#x27;ve switched to a Crew product, for now.</li>
            <li> This is some sort of knock-off. The material is thinner and does not work well. Do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and it works great.  It blends into your hands easily and keep your hair spiked up or textured the way you want it all day.  I use it with hair spray so nothing moves.</li>
            <li> This Bed Head product works great on my short hair style. I have used it for the past two years. The delivery cam in a timely fashion and for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works amazing.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years. Finally got smart and stopped paying $20 at CVS. I have very curly hair and this helps keep the frizz under control.</li>
            <li> This stuff keeps my hair in place which is what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It won&#x27;t be called on anytime soon to hold a radical style in place but does a good job with my fairly short hair.</li>
            <li> This was always my favorite product.  It was easy to use and did it&#x27;s job well.  Although not stated, Tigi has reformulated this product recently (I contacted them to be sure).  Their description of the new product matched what I saw (pearly, less tacky).  Overall, at best it just seems to be like most other products now instead of something different.  Doesn&#x27;t work well as my hair gets longer, doesn&#x27;t seem to hold as well, etc.  As with some products, sometimes it&#x27;s just a matter of getting used to using it differently, but so far I haven&#x27;t been able to get it to do what I want like I could with the original formula.  It won&#x27;t be my go-to product any more, so I&#x27;ll have to begin trying other products again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an update, I have tried this new formula more now, and I can definitely say I don&#x27;t like it and won&#x27;t be using it.  Also, I did more internet searching, and among other places, saw unhappy comments about the new formula on TIGI&#x27;s facebook page and even TIGI&#x27;s response that it was to meet new regulations (sounds like that even included removing the familiar fragrance).</li>
            <li> As many have discovered, the formula for Bed Head Manipulator has been changed.  All of the people that thought they received counterfeit products in fact received the new formula.  Personally I thought that there was something wrong with my latest until until some quick research confirmed that the formula was changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before this was my go to product, but now I cannot recommend this for anyone.  Whether they changed the formula to increase profit margins or to comply with regulations on new ingredients as they have suggested on the FB site, the truth remains that this is not at all like the old product and unfortunately is no longer worth using.</li>
