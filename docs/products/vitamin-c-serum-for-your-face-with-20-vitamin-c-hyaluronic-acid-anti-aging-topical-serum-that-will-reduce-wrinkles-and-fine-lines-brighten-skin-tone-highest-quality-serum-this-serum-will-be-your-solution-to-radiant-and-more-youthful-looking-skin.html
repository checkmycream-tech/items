            <li> My face felt so dry</li>
            <li> I have used it 4 days now on the  dry dry dry winter  skin on my face!  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sting my skin as other serums have done.</li>
            <li> I noticed one reviewer said it was working on her dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a little over twenty days</li>
            <li> Seems to firm up my skin well.  </li>
            <li> I am looking just after a few weeks of using this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now and have noticed that my uneven skin tone and wrinkles have started to fade away.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and isn&#x27;t greasy or irritating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I will buy again because the lack of company presence makes me doubt their integrity.</li>
            <li> But when my friend recommended this product, I thought that I would give it at least a try.</li>
            <li> Seriously, if you try to google the brand, nothing comes up except for the link to amazon.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to hide my eyes behind my make up and my glasses.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t look tired all the time!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the second Vitamin C serum I have tried and I have to say, I love this one.  I wash my face with Roc brand resurfacing disks first then apply this Vitamin C serum and my skin feels so smooth afterward.  I can feel my face tightening up and can see a difference after a 2 weeks of use. I had deep wrinkles between my eyebrows that are starting to look less noticable.  Can&#x27;t wait to see my face after a month.</li>
            <li> I have only used a short time.... but I like it. Seems to firm up my skin well.  We&#x27;ll see if my skin continues to improve with time.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars only because of the pump... it seems to stick and the serum kind of shoots all over. But I have figured out that if I cup my hand around it, as I pump, I can keep it in my hand.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin smooth and fresh feeling not wade down like others I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I have used Vit. C serum for years, and this has an added bonus of Vit E and hyaldronic acid which is very moisturizing.  Great company too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Vitamin C serum for a week and can see results.  I will continue to use it twice a day and look forward to even more results over the next few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting to see the results before posting my review and I must say I have yet to see a difference in my skin tone, texture or appearance.</li>
            <li> This stuff smell a so good. I use it on my face to give it a healthy look. I love it</li>
            <li> love this..I have used it 4 days now on the  dry dry dry winter  skin on my face!  it already feels much better and no flaky dry skin on my nose YaY!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it that long but  love it, it noticably reduces lines and crowsfeet</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this eye cream. A little goes a long way and isn&#x27;t greasy or irritating. Just a dab will do and feels great.</li>
            <li> I am excited to try as I want to see if there really is a difference as I have heard how great this is.</li>
            <li> This serum is fantastic!!! My solution to years of acne issues, my skin improved my first use. I can&#x27;t say enough wonderful things about it.</li>
            <li> Very good product,after a week my skin is tender and all the dark spots have become much brighter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something for my face quite awhile and I &#x27;ve found it.&lt;br /&gt;The Lumay Face Serum goes on easy and is non-greasy.  I was skeptical at first but I&#x27;m sold on this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;The service on this order was fantastic; it seems like I paid and next thing you know it arrived.&lt;br /&gt;I wish all my experiences around on-line ordering could be this great.&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommended A++</li>
            <li> My skin is really sensitive and I have tried tons of different serum before but nothing seems to work. I ended up having rash or I see no results  on my face at all. But when my friend recommended this product, I thought that I would give it at least a try. The result is amazing, my black circles are fading away so I don&#x27;t have to hide my eyes behind my make up and my glasses. This vitamin C serum is absorbed quickly on my skin and it is not sticky (love, love, love). Everyone says that my face looks brighter and that makes me so happy. Also I can&#x27;t keep my boyfriend away from touching my face because he says that my face is so smooth and soft LOL. I would recommend this product to everybody and I will definitely buy this product again &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I have been an avid user of facial Vitamin C serum and this is first time I have used this brand. I am very happy with the pump and with the fact that the precious contents are protected in a bottle that does not allow the light to be exposed to the serum and thereby oxidizing it. My skin continues to be radiant and glowing with the daily use of Vitamin C. This is one facial product I would not be without.</li>
            <li> I ordered this serum because I live in a dry climate and it really helped with rejuvinating my skin and improving the moisture content. I did not order this product to make an impression on others but rather to give my skin a natural feeling due to the dry climate, but I have been receiving compliments none the less on just how much better I am looking just after a few weeks of using this product. I highly reccommend this to anyone. It is non greasy and does not have any strong odours or perfume which appeals to me. Thanks Lumay.</li>

            <li> Lumay Serum feels great on my skin.  It doesn&#x27;t burn or make my eyes water as a lot of products do.  It soaks in nice ln and leaves a smooth finish.

            <li> All I can say is wow, My face felt so dry and I put this on it and it immediately felt soft and smooth. I honestly thought it would take a little bit to absorb but nope, instant relied. Not only that it seemed to give my face a glow. I absolutely love this and would recommend it to anyone. I received this at a discount in exchange for my honest review</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now and have noticed that my uneven skin tone and wrinkles have started to fade away. My skin is feeling much more smoother and clearer. I wanted to try out this vitamin C product as I heard it really works. And it&#x27;s true! I feel it&#x27;s increased my confidence when out in the business world too.  I recommend this product for both women and men !</li>
            <li> You do not need very much and feels nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> Love it .My face feels like silk. Works on hands too</li>
            <li> This stuff is going to help me stay looking young FOREVER!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Quick delivery,too!</li>
            <li> I love the serum and the packaging! The dispensing is great. The serum feels wonderful. It doesn&#x27;t sting my skin as other serums have done. I will definitely reorder the product. The customer service is amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> Very comforting.  You can actually feel the moisture soak into your skin and see the rejuvenating effect.  I love this serum and plan to buy more.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C , I have found is the best thing for my skin! It makes my skin radiant and healthy looking. I have used this product for a little over twenty days and I could see results in the first week! Try it, your skin will thank you!</li>
            <li> So, I actually really like this product. I did a lot of research before buying a serum and I like that this one comes in an airtight pump bottle and has a higher percent of vitamin c. My only issue is that I can&#x27;t find out anything about the company. It kind of creeps me out. Seriously, if you try to google the brand, nothing comes up except for the link to amazon. I&#x27;m not sure I will buy again because the lack of company presence makes me doubt their integrity.</li>
            <li> I love the Lumay vitamin c serum. It glides on smoothly, and a small amount will cover your entire face. I&#x27;ve noticed a freshness to my skin that hasn&#x27;t been there for awhile. I use the serum after my toner and before my moisturizer. I really like it.</li>
