            <li>I love this bath salt!</li>
            <li>I enjoy woodsy, earthy scents so this was a great choice.</li>
            <li>, it is not a feminine smell, which is nice.</li>
            <li>These salts provide a unique and pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>if anything :)</li>
            <li>Glad I found them here.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell of hibiki is really great and brings back my good memory.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the bath more after using it.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic for bathing.  </li>
            <li>you will probably enjoy this hinoki (cypress) scent.</li>
            <li>It is if you have ever walked in a wood full of evergreens..that smell.</li>
            <li>And have been loving them ever since I&#x27;ve been back home!</li>
            <li>Not sure I understand the excitement over this product, but of the Japanese &#x27;salts&#x27; (powder) I have tried this is the best.</li>
            <li>It is a much better value than epsom salts that I have bought at local retailers.  </li>

            <li>It definitely relaxes you and leaves your skin very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This particular scent was what I would call forest.</li>
            <li>The color is a weird milky yellow, but once you get past that, the feeling it leaves your body with is absolutely fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;relaxing and invigorating ~a wonderful product, magically transforming to the body.</li>
            <li>Love this for my bath, can&#x27;t wait to try the green.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with japanese onsen when I traveled there long time ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I order a new scent.</li>
            <li>Despite my rather sensitive skin, these salts do not cause rashes or breakouts.  </li>
            <li>They definitely provide extra relaxation and you get a large amount in the container.  </li>
            <li>However, I am careful to wait until the tub is full before getting in to ensure that the salts are properly diluted and mixed in my bath water.</li>

            <li> You can splurge a little for these salts because you only need to use a small amount to get the full effect.</li>
            <li> This hinoki smells like evergreen, dry cedar, with a lemon-like undertone; the scent has a calming effect and lasts throughout your soak.</li>

            <li> I enjoy woodsy, earthy scents so this was a great choice. This hinoki smells like evergreen, dry cedar, with a lemon-like undertone; the scent has a calming effect and lasts throughout your soak. You can splurge a little for these salts because you only need to use a small amount to get the full effect.</li>
            <li> smells great..like a spa experience</li>
            <li> I love this bath salt! I&#x27;m Japanese living in US for over 10 years and the only thing I miss badly is hotsprings. This hinoki scent brings me back the memory and feeling of the hotsprings in Japan. So relaxing!</li>
            <li> I am a Bath Roman Junky. Each time I run out of it I order a new scent. NONE of them have broken out my sensitive skin or if you are a female who has had lady part issues with certain bath items..none with this brand to be expected! This particular scent was what I would call forest. It is if you have ever walked in a wood full of evergreens..that smell. It also is a bit of an orangish yellow color. These products never stain my white garden tub and leave no residue. They scents mellow when mixed with water. This is one of those items that I keep in stock and give as gifts!</li>
            <li> Japanese traditional bath are made of hinoki, if its made of wood.&lt;br /&gt;Hinoki resist continuous exposure to water, resist mold growth, and the scent is so relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;So here we go, it&#x27;s gotta be hinoki type if anything :)</li>
            <li> I love these bath salts and they smell great. The Hinoki scent I think is Cypress, it is not a feminine smell, which is nice. I am addicted. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic for bathing.  It definitely relaxes you and leaves your skin very soft and smooth.  Perfect for this time of year when the heaters are drying out your skin.</li>
            <li> Love this for my bath, can&#x27;t wait to try the green.</li>
            <li> Not sure I understand the excitement over this product, but of the Japanese &#x27;salts&#x27; (powder) I have tried this is the best.</li>

It is a much better value than epsom salts that I have bought at local retailers.  I would recommend this one and I will try other products from this group.</li>
            <li> This took forever to arrive, but the rich cedar scent is wonderful.  Water turns saffron-yellow, if that&#x27;s an issue.</li>
            <li> The scent of this bath salt reminds me of soaking in a wooden onsen pool. The color is sort of a yellow-ish, but the scent is so wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;If you like scents like sandalwood or pine you will probably enjoy this hinoki (cypress) scent.</li>
            <li> These make every bath luxurious!  Despite my rather sensitive skin, these salts do not cause rashes or breakouts.  However, I am careful to wait until the tub is full before getting in to ensure that the salts are properly diluted and mixed in my bath water.</li>
            <li> While living in Japan, my wife discovered the Japanese Bath Salts - and loves them. They make great Christmas, birthday, valentine gifts. Glad I found them here. And reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I first got hooked on these bath salts while in Japan...  And have been loving them ever since I&#x27;ve been back home!</li>
            <li> milky and has that definite Japense &amp;#34;what is that smell?&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with japanese onsen when I traveled there long time ago.&lt;br /&gt;The smell of hibiki is really great and brings back my good memory.</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrific.  The color is a weird milky yellow, but once you get past that, the feeling it leaves your body with is absolutely fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;relaxing and invigorating ~a wonderful product, magically transforming to the body. No kidding. Thanks</li>
            <li> I love the smell. I enjoyed the bath more after using it.</li>
