            <li>It was wonderful to have her hair change textures within a week from looking greasy to feeling silky and dandruff free.  </li>

            <li>Good quality shampoo and masque.  </li>
            <li>Good Hair Product..</li>

            <li>Love it, love it, love it!!!!</li>
            <li>The first batch I bought was the best thing ever- loved it.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and a good consistency, but for some reason it just won&#x27;t rinse out of my hair.</li>
            <li>The lather was great, my hair felt CLEAN!</li>
            <li>And just as it claims, the sulfate free formula lathers up beautifully.</li>
            <li>This product is so moisture filled!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Dermorganic hair products!  </li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>Since switching to DermOrganic shampoo, masque, and oil, my hair looks and feels silky, smooth, and SHINY!!</li>
            <li>This stuff is magical!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>Favorite in our home and everyone can use it!  </li>
            <li>Glowing healthy hair!  </li>
            <li>I love this product, the smell, texture, everything about it!</li>
            <li>Try it you will love it too!</li>
            <li>Organic, no added fragrance great shampoo and fantastic Masque.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing as well.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner/deep conditioner is amazing.</li>
            <li>I really liked the product and then ordered from this retailer.  </li>
            <li>Fast, excellent delivery of my DermOrganic Shampoo and Masque .  </li>
            <li>Girl who cuts my hair always says how nice it is.</li>
            <li>Very nice, light shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m completely happy with both the product AND the company, bravo!</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell to it as well as appears to be healthy for the hair.  </li>
            <li>Most of all it smelled AMAZING and my hair was softer and NOT FRIZZY after 3 days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many shampoo and conditioner&#x27;s and this one by DermOrganic is by far the best one I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>The Shampoo leaves my hair feeling clean, light and smelling great.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My hair is more lustrous and silky with the l-i-t oil, than without.  </li>
            <li>My hair has not looked and felt this HEALTHY in ages.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite Shampoo and Conditioner combo out there.  </li>
            <li>When I went to use the shampoo, it was somewhat watery at the top.  </li>
            <li>And I really love that they both came with dispenser pumps.</li>
            <li>Love this product(shampoo and masque).</li>
            <li>I love it and will not change again.</li>
            <li>Love this shampooo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I normally love this product.  </li>
            <li>The one from the hairdresser was more the consistency of hand cream - not lotion - cream.    </li>
            <li>healthy shiny.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products trying to reach this goal, but none have delivered like DermOrganic.    </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>so diffent!and masque is okay only,straights my hair up,so</li>
            <li>I love the products but seems that I got a kit that was tampered with.</li>
            <li>After going without this shampoo and conditioner for 4 days, I can safely say it is a factor.      </li>
            <li>but I have gotten so many moisturizing products that leave my hair feeling greasy and unnatural.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this shampoo and conditioner-</li>
            <li>Boy am I glad I did :)  </li>
            <li>Sure.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair look and feel soo healthy.</li>
            <li>I get so much more compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li>Love it.....</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 2 years and absolutely love the product.  </li>
            <li>but i love them and my hair is the healthiest it has been in years even with hair coloring.</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair feels after shampooing.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the Shampoo.</li>
            <li>Your hair will get plenty of compliments, I&#x27;m sure :)</li>
            <li>products but this still remains my favorite that I return to</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this brand of organic (and paraben free!)</li>
            <li>These products leave my curly hair with a nice smooth texture.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell also.  </li>
            <li>Just to mention, the shampoo does not lather like most shampoos.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Our family has a variety of allergies from plant products, dyes, foods, ingredients and more.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love</li>
            <li>love this set and the argan oil.</li>
            <li>The moment I used these products, I fell in love with them.  </li>
            <li>I was growing my hair out and thought the shedding was just more noticable because the hairs were longer.</li>
            <li>The product is wonderful and I will definitely be ordering again!  </li>
            <li>It has made my hair so healthy.  </li>
            <li>I wash my hair about every 3 days and I am able to keep the shampoo and conditioner for about 6 months until I run out.  </li>
            <li>and I still love it.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my hair smooth and silky plus it smells really nice.</li>
            <li>This product leaves your hair full and healthy!</li>
            <li>Lasts a long time and treats my hair wonderfully!</li>
            <li>I have long hair with highlights and this has been the best shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of a large bottle for the shower, so it&#x27;s nice not to have to struggle with the pump.  </li>
            <li>far I&#x27;m completely happy with both the product AND the company, bravo!was satisfied with my response from them.    </li>
            <li>It was more than a couple of strands, and way more than i was comfortable with.</li>
            <li>she has never had such beautiful hair and a healthy scalp.  </li>
            <li>First of all the products are wonderful for your hair, and I have researched pricing of them and this is by far the cheapest.  </li>
            <li>Well, I was recommended this product because I was in search of paraben free, healthier more organic hair product line.  </li>
            <li>It is safe for color as it is phosphate free.  </li>
            <li>That was a very nice touch; they were concerned when I told them of the leaking and had me contact Blue Novelties, but stayed in touch with me to make sure I was satisfied with my response from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is more like my original sample.  </li>
            <li>My hair is easy to style</li>
            <li>It also seems to clean much better.  </li>
            <li>it is easy to brush out and doesnt tangle my hair.</li>
            <li>Love this product and so happy I could finally get some.  </li>
            <li>They felt right, and the masque was wonderful, leaving my hair super soft.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the leave-in treatment, BUT, the first ingredient is a toxic chemical that has been banned in Canada.</li>
            <li>So far this is the best organic &amp; natural shampoo &amp; conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
            <li>i have fine curly hair with damaged ends cause of the highlights   and coloring.....</li>
            <li>The product itself worked fine</li>
            <li>Hair is in great shape, super shiny, soft and strong.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>The conditioning masque really helped to make my hair soft, healthy, and strong again!!!</li>
            <li>It was love at first shampoo!    </li>
            <li>That way I wouldnt have to pack huge bottles in my suitcases.  </li>
            <li>I didnt notice any huge difference in my hair after using these products.  </li>
            <li>Like that the product is sulfate free.</li>
            <li>DermOrganic&#x27;s shampoo and masque are fantastic...</li>
            <li>I also appreciate that they do not test their products on animals and it is paraben free.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner, however, leaves it feeling smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I follow up by scrunching a leave-in conditioner to encourage my hair to chunk, then let it air-dry, and I end up with smooth, shiny curls.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser urged me to start using a sulfate free shampoo.  </li>
            <li>this product is glutten free &amp; now she is using it.....</li>
            <li>Once again, I will say this product does work great, if only they would get rid of the chemicals.</li>
            <li>I like that these are sulfate free.  </li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Purchased these at my local TJ Max for $ 19.99 a bottle and they work great.</li>
            <li>Overall, great purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to Biolage - so dissapointed it WAS a great product</li>
            <li>The shampoo doesn&#x27;t get very frothy or sudsy because of the lack of sulfur but it still cleans nicely.  </li>
            <li>On a completely non-important issue, the shampoo is reeeally pretty, lol.  </li>
            <li>I have enjoyed my hair products very much.  </li>
            <li>I can wash every day with this stuff (which is nice because I bike all over the place and live in a huge city and my hair gets pollution-ized).  </li>
            <li>I just assume it is a trade off for being organic and enviromentally friendly.</li>
            <li>, I received an email from the DermOrganic company shortly after receiving my products asking how I liked them, whether I was completely satisfied, etc.  </li>
            <li>It smells AMAZING and leaves your hair feeling soft and looking fabulous.</li>
            <li>but it still gets your hair clean.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t believe a shampoo without sulfates could lather like this, and the masque leaves my hair shiny, silky, and easy to brush right out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>So these large bottle ares a fabulous bargain!</li>
            <li>When that initial set of shampoo and conditioner bottles were empty, I hunted on the web to find more, and the price at Amazon (when you consider shipping) was the best I found.</li>
            <li>I loved this shampoo the second it touched my hair.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t, and the hair loss was getting more intense.</li>
            <li>I had been using Wen and was looking for a more reasonably priced option when I discovered DermOrganic.</li>
            <li>Great lather from the shampoo with a soft feeling, and also wonderful conditioner that deep conditions without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li>very gentle on my fine hair and lathers well.</li>
            <li>This product gives my hair a great soft feeling and makes the color come alive.  </li>
            <li>Plus, my hair is super bouncy, shiny and healthy-looking when I use the product.  </li>
            <li>even use it to wash my dogs that is how mild it is.</li>
            <li>She loves this product because it leaves her hair soft and very easy to comb and manage.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I have super fine hair and this product really give my hair a boost of fullness.</li>
            <li>Works great whether I leave it curly or blow dry straight.</li>
            <li>my hair is straight and fairly fine...  </li>
            <li>I definitely think the shampoo needs a conditioner, and the masque works amazing.  </li>
            <li>This product allows my over 35, highlighted hair feel soft and look healthy.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth</li>
            <li>What i love about the masque is that it is a conditioning product that can be applied directly to her scalp without causing oil build up.  </li>
            <li>I love the product, my hair feels soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>DermOrganics has been a life saver and worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Hair feels soft, full and strong.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is paraben free and free of other &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>My hair stays clean all day and is light and natural</li>
            <li>Really conditions your hair and treats it well :) Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think twice and ordered the leave-in right away.  </li>
            <li>I have finally found home :) this stuff lathers up amazing and the conditioner actually feels like I am feeding my hair.  </li>
            <li>This product helped my hair issue right away after the first use.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product line for the past couple of years and I love it!!</li>
            <li>Thank you very much for my product.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty well</li>
            <li>When I first pumped it out</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to Derm Organic when my husband got a sample from someone who worked for the company.  </li>
            <li>When a friend recommended this shampoo and conditioner, I was willing to try anything.  </li>
            <li>If you have never tried DermOrganic, it might make more sense to buy the smaller bottles.</li>
            <li>Also, to the person that said the shampoo she received was diluted, I&#x27;m pretty sure that that is how it is supposed to be, because my shampoo is the same way</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll add a picture of my shiny, healthy, blue hair for you to see.</li>
            <li>so i thought  if these products are made with the same oil i must love them.....  </li>
            <li>Since using this shampoo my hair feels so much healthier!</li>
            <li>First let me just tell you this comes with Dermorganic Leave-in Treatment with Organic Argan Oil which sells separately for around $15.  </li>
            <li>I recently received my latest purchase of DermOrganic Shampoo and Conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It threw me off when they first showed up</li>
            <li>It would be better marketed simply as a conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different shampoos/conditioners to repair my hair and nothing worked until I tried DermOrganic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already stocked up on a few bottles where I caught good deals at TJmaxx and online.    </li>
            <li>I was very surprised since I have tried dozens of organic shampoos &amp; conditioners in the past, this one is by far the best!</li>
            <li>Less frizz and more shine for my curls!</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny and healthy for the first time in a very long while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>for my fine hair it actually moisturies a bit too much, so i don&#x27;t use it daily, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair at all (which is good, but for my fine hair i get tons of fly-aways</li>
            <li>When I contacted Derm Organic about this, they said that they recommend only purchasing the shampoo from one of their recommended retailers due to the problems I had experienced.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had no problems with my pumps, they work beautifully on the 33oz bottles and my shampoo isn&#x27;t too thin, like another review mentioned.  </li>
            <li>so figured maybe it was some settling from the large container.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months and my hair has never been better!  </li>
            <li>Recently wanted to try a new shampoo /conditioner and saw this interesting stuff at TJmaxx, read the label and went online to check it out.  </li>
            <li>and it rinses clean, no residue left behind, and it smells good!</li>
            <li>i dont use this since i am male head and shoulders is fine for me</li>
            <li>It works great and my curls are actually coming in, which hasn&#x27;t happened since i was little.</li>
            <li>Was having trouble with dry hair that would not comb thru,  first time after use felt great,  and super soft.  </li>
            <li>I am always on the hunt for really moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair is very frizzy...</li>
            <li>So I really don&#x27;t think this is an Amazon problem, but something that this retailer is doing.  </li>
            <li>and I think it suds up and cleans very thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>Wen made my thin hair look great.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Although the shampoo is sulfate-free, it lathers almost as much as a dime-store shampoo, though my hair does feel a bit \\&quot;rough\\&quot; when I rinse it out.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!  </li>
            <li>I really think that after 10 years of experimenting I have found my product.  </li>
            <li>Please see cyclopentasiloxane dimethicone,  I prefer real organic products without harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li>that cleans very well.  </li>
            <li>Then I used the shampoo (with the pump) and the shampoo shot out real watery and not like the consistency in the bottle.</li>
            <li>This shampoo cleanses very well &amp; the masque (conditioner) moisturizes as well as high-quality salon brands,</li>
            <li>These products don&#x27;t really do much for me.  </li>
            <li>Fast</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to comb through my hair wet without fighting with it.  </li>
            <li>, that is straight and processed.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted this product to work.</li>
            <li>something happened after a couple of weeks; Every time I even lightly passed my fingers through my hair in the shower, I was left with clumps of falling hair in my hands.</li>
            <li>I really am heartbroken.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll keep &#x27;em guessing whether I&#x27;m going to show up curly or straight, but I&#x27;ll recommend DermOrganic to anyone who asks.</li>
            <li>Actually gives my hair such a nice wave</li>
            <li>They watered down the shampoo so much that it was more like water than shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I have thin - dry hair - this works the best out of all shampoo/conditioners used, including salon sold products -</li>
            <li>Anyway, I have very dry, wavy, thick hair that looks great when it&#x27;s got the right amount of moisture</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that was all dried out.</li>
            <li>I Bought the product from Amazon fulfillment and experienced the same thing that everyone else complained about.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I deal with this in my whole life, and honestly, I am surprised that an all natural organic product could produce these results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked everywhere and it really makes my hair soft!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using this brand.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend DermOrganic.</li>
            <li>I guess I had way too high expectations for it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone who struggles with damaged hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I color my hair and need to use high end products and DermOrganic is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The other sulfate free shampoos i have used do not lather up very well.</li>
            <li>I love the conditioner and oil treatment, but the shampoo leaves little to be desired.</li>
            <li>the first one would barely lather this one is more bubbly than dish washing detergent -it has totaly dried my hair out and makes my scalp itch</li>
            <li>I normally purchase the 8 oz bottles from my salon at $16 each.</li>
            <li>This how, however, lathers up just like any normal shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love it and it has made my hair condition smoother, softer without the limp.  </li>
            <li>and I waited a few more weeks for the falling to stop.</li>
            <li>Large size makes it very economical and allows me to share with my other family members!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rare to find an organic product that doesn&#x27;t leave your hair flat and oily.</li>
            <li>As far as I know, it lacks all the crappy chemicals that are in every shampoo/conditioner at the drugstore (my main source for this stuff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Wow, am I hooked!  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I have been using it for the past 12 month love it.</li>
            <li>I have heard or read reviews about people saying that the product was watered down but to avoid that I make sure that I buy from a Amazon prime vendor so that if I have that problem I can send it back</li>
            <li>They do the trick, get your hair clean but for the money not worth it in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>The price isn&#x27;t terrible, the smell is nice (my boyfriend uses it too) and the way my hair looks and feels after it&#x27;s dry is incredible-</li>
            <li>The large bottles I purchased from Blue Novelties did not seem to be diluted, haven&#x27;t thickened, and thankfully dispense w/o issue.</li>
            <li>as it clearly states on the DermOrganic \\&quot;Backbar Kit\\&quot; box that they came in...</li>
            <li>(This kind of hair can be very fussy, and the wrong products or drying process will make it \\&quot;1980s</li>
            <li>Like the conitioner, soft and silky results.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a complete \\&quot;Backbar Kit\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I thought, \\&quot;wow, it looks so pearly!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>Arrived in a timely fashion but was packaged in a soft mail pouch so one of the pumps on the conditioner does not work, it was snapped off.</li>
            <li>and this whole treatment brought my hair back to life   again...!!!!</li>
            <li>I have historically been known to spend way too much money on hair</li>
            <li>I am really trying to get my hair back to</li>
            <li>I go out with it after only air drying (although my preference is poker straight).  </li>
            <li>Dermorganics products make my hair feel like soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;really soft now and</li>
            <li>have naturally wavy/curly hair and the shampoo and conditioner do make my hair almost too soft.</li>
            <li>These products leave my hair soft and shiny, my husband loves them too.</li>
            <li>The biggest con for us is that we have to use a lot of shampoo (it is thin) and the masque does not smell as nice as the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair, which I straighten with a flat iron.</li>
            <li>Purchased smaller bottles of this product at a much, much higher price several times from the hair dresser, but won&#x27;t ever do that again after finding it here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my second order of this shampoo,but the first time I bought from a different distributor.i still like it,makes my hair look healthy,even my hairstylists noticed it.but</li>
            <li>it has brought my hair back to life, volume, no split ends, barely any breakage and my hair seems to be growing at a very fast rate, and I have only been using this product for 3 weeks!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s healthy state- after dying it blonde for the last few</li>
            <li>I had already stopped using dermorganic and switched back to my normal brand.</li>
            <li>Therefore, my hair is pretty damaged and has a lot of breakage at the ends and feels elastic when wet.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair and have been using WEN for years..</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new shampoo and conditioner to try and replace my Shikai set that can be purchased at Whole Foods, and these seem to due the trick.</li>
            <li>Leaves my thick coarse hair feeling smoother and I love that there are no harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li>I am a very busy person and just decided to keep the product and next time buy from another retailer.  </li>
            <li>After going from Brown to Blonde my hair was pretty damaged and extremely dry.</li>
            <li>, i can&#x27;t tell you how soft and managebel it left my hair  </li>
            <li>With all of my old shampoos I could really only wash my hair once or twice a week-</li>
            <li>My hair finally feels soft again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try if you are looking for a deep reconditioning system that doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li>The smell is sweet and nutty, the products are concentrated so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>The pumps constantly get clogged and I have to spend precious time in the mornings trying to coax the very thick product out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>This stuff is real thick and very smooth.</li>
            <li>One of the bottles came with a broken pump so I had to transfer it into a different container with a working pump top.</li>
            <li>It is thinner than the masque, but certainly not too thin to use effectively.  </li>
            <li>My teen daughter developed a severe reaction to shampoos containing sulfate last summer when we swam in a pool almost daily.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo lathers up very well, and the masque is lightweight and does not weigh your hair down.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, but dry.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally wavy and on the dry side.  </li>
            <li>After about a month, I&#x27;m noticing a LOT less hair in my comb and drain and my hair feels much fuller -- in addition to being silkier and softer.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought she&#x27;d wasted her money because I&#x27;d been using a brand that worked fairly well on my coarse, thick, curly hair, and I was wary of new products.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that even though they aren&#x27;t fully all natural/organic, they due have less chemicals in them and keep my thick long hair clean for up to three full days (as I do not wash my hair daily).</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the shampoo - hardly lathers</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It was wonderful to have her hair change textures within a week from looking greasy to feeling silky and dandruff free.  </li>

            <li> Loved it too....</li>

            <li> The first batch I bought was the best thing ever- loved it.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell and a good consistency, but for some reason it just won&#x27;t rinse out of my hair.</li>
            <li> The lather was great, my hair felt CLEAN!</li>
            <li> And just as it claims, the sulfate free formula lathers up beautifully.</li>
            <li> This product is so moisture filled!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Dermorganic hair products!  </li>

            <li> It smells amazing as well.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner/deep conditioner is amazing.</li>
            <li> I really liked the product and then ordered from this retailer.  </li>
            <li> Fast, excellent delivery of my DermOrganic Shampoo and Masque .  </li>
            <li> Girl who cuts my hair always says how nice it is.</li>
            <li> Very nice, light shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m completely happy with both the product AND the company, bravo!</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell to it as well as appears to be healthy for the hair.  </li>
            <li> Most of all it smelled AMAZING and my hair was softer and NOT FRIZZY after 3 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many shampoo and conditioner&#x27;s and this one by DermOrganic is by far the best one I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> The Shampoo leaves my hair feeling clean, light and smelling great.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> My hair is more lustrous and silky with the l-i-t oil, than without.  </li>
            <li> My hair has not looked and felt this HEALTHY in ages.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Shampoo and Conditioner combo out there.  </li>
            <li> When I went to use the shampoo, it was somewhat watery at the top.  </li>
            <li> And I really love that they both came with dispenser pumps.</li>
            <li> Love this product(shampoo and masque).</li>
            <li> I love it and will not change again.</li>
            <li> Love this shampooo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I normally love this product.  </li>
            <li> The one from the hairdresser was more the consistency of hand cream - not lotion - cream.    </li>
            <li> healthy shiny.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products trying to reach this goal, but none have delivered like DermOrganic.    </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> so diffent!and masque is okay only,straights my hair up,so</li>
            <li> I love the products but seems that I got a kit that was tampered with.</li>
            <li> After going without this shampoo and conditioner for 4 days, I can safely say it is a factor.      </li>
            <li> but I have gotten so many moisturizing products that leave my hair feeling greasy and unnatural.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this shampoo and conditioner-</li>
            <li> Boy am I glad I did :)  </li>
            <li> Sure.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair look and feel soo healthy.</li>
            <li> I get so much more compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li> Love it.....</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 years and absolutely love the product.  </li>
            <li> but i love them and my hair is the healthiest it has been in years even with hair coloring.</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair feels after shampooing.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE the Shampoo.</li>
            <li> Your hair will get plenty of compliments, I&#x27;m sure :)</li>
            <li> products but this still remains my favorite that I return to</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brand of organic (and paraben free!)</li>
            <li> These products leave my curly hair with a nice smooth texture.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell also.  </li>
            <li> Just to mention, the shampoo does not lather like most shampoos.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Our family has a variety of allergies from plant products, dyes, foods, ingredients and more.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and I love</li>
            <li> love this set and the argan oil.</li>
            <li> The moment I used these products, I fell in love with them.  </li>
            <li> I was growing my hair out and thought the shedding was just more noticable because the hairs were longer.</li>
            <li> The product is wonderful and I will definitely be ordering again!  </li>
            <li> It has made my hair so healthy.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hair about every 3 days and I am able to keep the shampoo and conditioner for about 6 months until I run out.  </li>
            <li> and I still love it.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my hair smooth and silky plus it smells really nice.</li>
            <li> This product leaves your hair full and healthy!</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and treats my hair wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I have long hair with highlights and this has been the best shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of a large bottle for the shower, so it&#x27;s nice not to have to struggle with the pump.  </li>
            <li> far I&#x27;m completely happy with both the product AND the company, bravo!was satisfied with my response from them.    </li>
            <li> It was more than a couple of strands, and way more than i was comfortable with.</li>
            <li> she has never had such beautiful hair and a healthy scalp.  </li>
            <li> First of all the products are wonderful for your hair, and I have researched pricing of them and this is by far the cheapest.  </li>
            <li> Well, I was recommended this product because I was in search of paraben free, healthier more organic hair product line.  </li>
            <li> It is safe for color as it is phosphate free.  </li>
            <li> That was a very nice touch; they were concerned when I told them of the leaking and had me contact Blue Novelties, but stayed in touch with me to make sure I was satisfied with my response from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is more like my original sample.  </li>
            <li> My hair is easy to style</li>
            <li> It also seems to clean much better.  </li>
            <li> it is easy to brush out and doesnt tangle my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product and so happy I could finally get some.  </li>
            <li> They felt right, and the masque was wonderful, leaving my hair super soft.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the leave-in treatment, BUT, the first ingredient is a toxic chemical that has been banned in Canada.</li>
            <li> So far this is the best organic &amp; natural shampoo &amp; conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
            <li> i have fine curly hair with damaged ends cause of the highlights   and coloring.....</li>
            <li> The product itself worked fine</li>
            <li> Hair is in great shape, super shiny, soft and strong.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> The conditioning masque really helped to make my hair soft, healthy, and strong again!!!</li>
            <li> It was love at first shampoo!    </li>
            <li> That way I wouldnt have to pack huge bottles in my suitcases.  </li>
            <li> I didnt notice any huge difference in my hair after using these products.  </li>
            <li> Like that the product is sulfate free.</li>
            <li> DermOrganic&#x27;s shampoo and masque are fantastic...</li>
            <li> I also appreciate that they do not test their products on animals and it is paraben free.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner, however, leaves it feeling smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> I follow up by scrunching a leave-in conditioner to encourage my hair to chunk, then let it air-dry, and I end up with smooth, shiny curls.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser urged me to start using a sulfate free shampoo.  </li>
            <li> this product is glutten free &amp; now she is using it.....</li>
            <li> Once again, I will say this product does work great, if only they would get rid of the chemicals.</li>
            <li> I like that these are sulfate free.  </li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Purchased these at my local TJ Max for $ 19.99 a bottle and they work great.</li>
            <li> Overall, great purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to Biolage - so dissapointed it WAS a great product</li>
            <li> The shampoo doesn&#x27;t get very frothy or sudsy because of the lack of sulfur but it still cleans nicely.  </li>
            <li> On a completely non-important issue, the shampoo is reeeally pretty, lol.  </li>
            <li> I have enjoyed my hair products very much.  </li>
            <li> I can wash every day with this stuff (which is nice because I bike all over the place and live in a huge city and my hair gets pollution-ized).  </li>
            <li> I just assume it is a trade off for being organic and enviromentally friendly.</li>
            <li> , I received an email from the DermOrganic company shortly after receiving my products asking how I liked them, whether I was completely satisfied, etc.  </li>
            <li> It smells AMAZING and leaves your hair feeling soft and looking fabulous.</li>
            <li> but it still gets your hair clean.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe a shampoo without sulfates could lather like this, and the masque leaves my hair shiny, silky, and easy to brush right out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> So these large bottle ares a fabulous bargain!</li>
            <li> When that initial set of shampoo and conditioner bottles were empty, I hunted on the web to find more, and the price at Amazon (when you consider shipping) was the best I found.</li>
            <li> I loved this shampoo the second it touched my hair.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t, and the hair loss was getting more intense.</li>
            <li> I had been using Wen and was looking for a more reasonably priced option when I discovered DermOrganic.</li>
            <li> Great lather from the shampoo with a soft feeling, and also wonderful conditioner that deep conditions without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> very gentle on my fine hair and lathers well.</li>
            <li> This product gives my hair a great soft feeling and makes the color come alive.  </li>
            <li> Plus, my hair is super bouncy, shiny and healthy-looking when I use the product.  </li>
            <li> even use it to wash my dogs that is how mild it is.</li>
            <li> She loves this product because it leaves her hair soft and very easy to comb and manage.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have super fine hair and this product really give my hair a boost of fullness.</li>
            <li> Works great whether I leave it curly or blow dry straight.</li>
            <li> my hair is straight and fairly fine...  </li>
            <li> I definitely think the shampoo needs a conditioner, and the masque works amazing.  </li>
            <li> This product allows my over 35, highlighted hair feel soft and look healthy.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth</li>
            <li> What i love about the masque is that it is a conditioning product that can be applied directly to her scalp without causing oil build up.  </li>
            <li> I love the product, my hair feels soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> DermOrganics has been a life saver and worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Hair feels soft, full and strong.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is paraben free and free of other &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> My hair stays clean all day and is light and natural</li>
            <li> Really conditions your hair and treats it well :) Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think twice and ordered the leave-in right away.  </li>
            <li> I have finally found home :) this stuff lathers up amazing and the conditioner actually feels like I am feeding my hair.  </li>
            <li> This product helped my hair issue right away after the first use.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product line for the past couple of years and I love it!!</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for my product.  </li>
            <li> Works pretty well</li>
            <li> When I first pumped it out</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to Derm Organic when my husband got a sample from someone who worked for the company.  </li>
            <li> When a friend recommended this shampoo and conditioner, I was willing to try anything.  </li>
            <li> If you have never tried DermOrganic, it might make more sense to buy the smaller bottles.</li>
            <li> Also, to the person that said the shampoo she received was diluted, I&#x27;m pretty sure that that is how it is supposed to be, because my shampoo is the same way</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll add a picture of my shiny, healthy, blue hair for you to see.</li>
            <li> so i thought  if these products are made with the same oil i must love them.....  </li>
            <li> Since using this shampoo my hair feels so much healthier!</li>
            <li> First let me just tell you this comes with Dermorganic Leave-in Treatment with Organic Argan Oil which sells separately for around $15.  </li>
            <li> I recently received my latest purchase of DermOrganic Shampoo and Conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It threw me off when they first showed up</li>
            <li> It would be better marketed simply as a conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different shampoos/conditioners to repair my hair and nothing worked until I tried DermOrganic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already stocked up on a few bottles where I caught good deals at TJmaxx and online.    </li>
            <li> I was very surprised since I have tried dozens of organic shampoos &amp; conditioners in the past, this one is by far the best!</li>
            <li> Less frizz and more shine for my curls!</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny and healthy for the first time in a very long while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> for my fine hair it actually moisturies a bit too much, so i don&#x27;t use it daily, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair at all (which is good, but for my fine hair i get tons of fly-aways</li>
            <li> When I contacted Derm Organic about this, they said that they recommend only purchasing the shampoo from one of their recommended retailers due to the problems I had experienced.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had no problems with my pumps, they work beautifully on the 33oz bottles and my shampoo isn&#x27;t too thin, like another review mentioned.  </li>
            <li> so figured maybe it was some settling from the large container.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months and my hair has never been better!  </li>
            <li> Recently wanted to try a new shampoo /conditioner and saw this interesting stuff at TJmaxx, read the label and went online to check it out.  </li>
            <li> and it rinses clean, no residue left behind, and it smells good!</li>
            <li> i dont use this since i am male head and shoulders is fine for me</li>
            <li> It works great and my curls are actually coming in, which hasn&#x27;t happened since i was little.</li>
            <li> Was having trouble with dry hair that would not comb thru,  first time after use felt great,  and super soft.  </li>
            <li> I am always on the hunt for really moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair is very frizzy...</li>
            <li> So I really don&#x27;t think this is an Amazon problem, but something that this retailer is doing.  </li>
            <li> and I think it suds up and cleans very thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> Wen made my thin hair look great.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Although the shampoo is sulfate-free, it lathers almost as much as a dime-store shampoo, though my hair does feel a bit \\&quot;rough\\&quot; when I rinse it out.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!  </li>
            <li> I really think that after 10 years of experimenting I have found my product.  </li>
            <li> Please see cyclopentasiloxane dimethicone,  I prefer real organic products without harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li> that cleans very well.  </li>
            <li> Then I used the shampoo (with the pump) and the shampoo shot out real watery and not like the consistency in the bottle.</li>
            <li> This shampoo cleanses very well &amp; the masque (conditioner) moisturizes as well as high-quality salon brands,</li>
            <li> These products don&#x27;t really do much for me.  </li>
            <li> Fast</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to comb through my hair wet without fighting with it.  </li>
            <li> , that is straight and processed.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted this product to work.</li>
            <li> something happened after a couple of weeks; Every time I even lightly passed my fingers through my hair in the shower, I was left with clumps of falling hair in my hands.</li>
            <li> I really am heartbroken.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep &#x27;em guessing whether I&#x27;m going to show up curly or straight, but I&#x27;ll recommend DermOrganic to anyone who asks.</li>
            <li> Actually gives my hair such a nice wave</li>
            <li> They watered down the shampoo so much that it was more like water than shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I have thin - dry hair - this works the best out of all shampoo/conditioners used, including salon sold products -</li>
            <li> Anyway, I have very dry, wavy, thick hair that looks great when it&#x27;s got the right amount of moisture</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that was all dried out.</li>
            <li> I Bought the product from Amazon fulfillment and experienced the same thing that everyone else complained about.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I deal with this in my whole life, and honestly, I am surprised that an all natural organic product could produce these results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked everywhere and it really makes my hair soft!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using this brand.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend DermOrganic.</li>
            <li> I guess I had way too high expectations for it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for anyone who struggles with damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I color my hair and need to use high end products and DermOrganic is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The other sulfate free shampoos i have used do not lather up very well.</li>
            <li> I love the conditioner and oil treatment, but the shampoo leaves little to be desired.</li>
            <li> the first one would barely lather this one is more bubbly than dish washing detergent -it has totaly dried my hair out and makes my scalp itch</li>
            <li> I normally purchase the 8 oz bottles from my salon at $16 each.</li>
            <li> This how, however, lathers up just like any normal shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love it and it has made my hair condition smoother, softer without the limp.  </li>
            <li> and I waited a few more weeks for the falling to stop.</li>
            <li> Large size makes it very economical and allows me to share with my other family members!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rare to find an organic product that doesn&#x27;t leave your hair flat and oily.</li>
            <li> As far as I know, it lacks all the crappy chemicals that are in every shampoo/conditioner at the drugstore (my main source for this stuff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Wow, am I hooked!  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for the past 12 month love it.</li>
            <li> I have heard or read reviews about people saying that the product was watered down but to avoid that I make sure that I buy from a Amazon prime vendor so that if I have that problem I can send it back</li>
            <li> They do the trick, get your hair clean but for the money not worth it in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> The price isn&#x27;t terrible, the smell is nice (my boyfriend uses it too) and the way my hair looks and feels after it&#x27;s dry is incredible-</li>
            <li> The large bottles I purchased from Blue Novelties did not seem to be diluted, haven&#x27;t thickened, and thankfully dispense w/o issue.</li>
            <li> as it clearly states on the DermOrganic \\&quot;Backbar Kit\\&quot; box that they came in...</li>
            <li> (This kind of hair can be very fussy, and the wrong products or drying process will make it \\&quot;1980s</li>
            <li> Like the conitioner, soft and silky results.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a complete \\&quot;Backbar Kit\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I thought, \\&quot;wow, it looks so pearly!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely fashion but was packaged in a soft mail pouch so one of the pumps on the conditioner does not work, it was snapped off.</li>
            <li> and this whole treatment brought my hair back to life   again...!!!!</li>
            <li> I have historically been known to spend way too much money on hair</li>
            <li> I am really trying to get my hair back to</li>
            <li> I go out with it after only air drying (although my preference is poker straight).  </li>
            <li> Dermorganics products make my hair feel like soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;really soft now and</li>
            <li> have naturally wavy/curly hair and the shampoo and conditioner do make my hair almost too soft.</li>
            <li> These products leave my hair soft and shiny, my husband loves them too.</li>
            <li> The biggest con for us is that we have to use a lot of shampoo (it is thin) and the masque does not smell as nice as the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly hair, which I straighten with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> Purchased smaller bottles of this product at a much, much higher price several times from the hair dresser, but won&#x27;t ever do that again after finding it here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my second order of this shampoo,but the first time I bought from a different distributor.i still like it,makes my hair look healthy,even my hairstylists noticed it.but</li>
            <li> it has brought my hair back to life, volume, no split ends, barely any breakage and my hair seems to be growing at a very fast rate, and I have only been using this product for 3 weeks!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s healthy state- after dying it blonde for the last few</li>
            <li> I had already stopped using dermorganic and switched back to my normal brand.</li>
            <li> Therefore, my hair is pretty damaged and has a lot of breakage at the ends and feels elastic when wet.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair and have been using WEN for years..</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new shampoo and conditioner to try and replace my Shikai set that can be purchased at Whole Foods, and these seem to due the trick.</li>
            <li> Leaves my thick coarse hair feeling smoother and I love that there are no harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> I am a very busy person and just decided to keep the product and next time buy from another retailer.  </li>
            <li> After going from Brown to Blonde my hair was pretty damaged and extremely dry.</li>
            <li> , i can&#x27;t tell you how soft and managebel it left my hair  </li>
            <li> With all of my old shampoos I could really only wash my hair once or twice a week-</li>
            <li> My hair finally feels soft again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try if you are looking for a deep reconditioning system that doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> The smell is sweet and nutty, the products are concentrated so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The pumps constantly get clogged and I have to spend precious time in the mornings trying to coax the very thick product out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> This stuff is real thick and very smooth.</li>
            <li> One of the bottles came with a broken pump so I had to transfer it into a different container with a working pump top.</li>
            <li> It is thinner than the masque, but certainly not too thin to use effectively.  </li>
            <li> My teen daughter developed a severe reaction to shampoos containing sulfate last summer when we swam in a pool almost daily.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers up very well, and the masque is lightweight and does not weigh your hair down.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft, but dry.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy and on the dry side.  </li>
            <li> After about a month, I&#x27;m noticing a LOT less hair in my comb and drain and my hair feels much fuller -- in addition to being silkier and softer.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought she&#x27;d wasted her money because I&#x27;d been using a brand that worked fairly well on my coarse, thick, curly hair, and I was wary of new products.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that even though they aren&#x27;t fully all natural/organic, they due have less chemicals in them and keep my thick long hair clean for up to three full days (as I do not wash my hair daily).</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the shampoo - hardly lathers</li>
            <li> When I went to get a cut &amp; color the other day, my stylist couldn&#x27;t belive how soft my hair was without any oily</li>
            <li> When I got the product, it was in a large box with the oil treatment taken out and a very little of the shampoo leaked on the box.  </li>
            <li> The containers are larger than they appear and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Well, this seemed to be a good deal, but when I actually used the shampoo, it became very, very obvious that the person who sold me this shampoo, watered it down - to the point that is shoots out and is so thin that it&#x27;s hard to hold in your hand.  </li>
            <li> I use the Keratin express because I dye my hair about every 3-4 weeks and use a flat iron about once/twice a week.  </li>
            <li> I threw out my flat iron, my blow dryer and bought dermorganic with the highest of hopes.</li>
            <li> Her hair is far less frizzy and</li>
            <li> The shampoo seems drying for my dry coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I have pseudo ethnic hair, that grows long but its extremely dry, brittle and frizzy aka a daily nightmare.  </li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews here, I find it interesting that while some people have complained that Blue Novelties diluted the products, others complain the product is too thick to dispense using the pump.  </li>
            <li> I used to use Pantene long ago</li>
            <li> I have used the Dermorganic Masque for quite awhile, as has my daughter, who has extremely long hair.  </li>
            <li> Also, they smell strange.</li>
            <li> : I have long sort-of-straight hair that does get frizzy.</li>
            <li> The leave in treatment is a must for thick hair..smells great..dries hair fast.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo is thinner than other organic shampoos I&#x27;ve tried in the past, I read you need to shake it because it will seperate, but it doesn&#x27;t affect the performance, still lathers very well</li>
            <li> So, I use the leave-in conditioner/argon oil and usually one other styling product -- either a heat protectant for straightening or a curl-enhancer for definition depending on my mood and how much time I have in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If your family has allergies that are opposite from each other, this product bypassed all of them.  </li>
            <li> (The air is DRY here, fly-aways are almost a way of life.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and the dry ends it leaves me</li>
            <li> I have dry curly hair that tends to be frizzy.  </li>
            <li> At some point a few months ago I decided enough was enough.</li>
            <li> so i just ordered the DermOrganic Daily Conditioner &amp; also the DermOrganic Sculpting Whip (which actually is meant to tame fly-aways &amp; friz without hardening like sprays &amp; gels)</li>
            <li> I have tried Aveda, Pureology, redkin, bumble and bumble and all sorts of natural products from small companies (the companies I prefer to work with-</li>
            <li> my hair is down to my butt &amp; bleached blonde every 3 to 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t  use it often,it&#x27;s hard to fix my hair after it,but it makes it very soft tho.</li>
            <li> I have pitch black hair, but I bleach it practically blonde every 3 months.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this on 2/17 for a little over $45 from Blue Novelties, the description states that it includes the leave-in-treatment, however it does NOT.  </li>
            <li> only complaint, and it has nothing to do with the product, is the packaging of my Shampoo &amp; Masque from Blue Novelties.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found that I&#x27;ve run out of the bathroom a couple of times without using my usual light-hold gel, only to find it wasn&#x27;t nearly as fly-away as usual without it.  </li>
            <li> the few extra dollars to get what I paid for.  </li>
            <li> I tried the shake it up method before I used it a few more times and realized that it was silly to waste time shaking my shampoo each time I needed to use it.</li>
            <li> and I think the company tries to mislead its customers by calling it \\&quot;DermOrganic\\&quot; when its not.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is thick which is great, nothing worse than thin, running conditioner!</li>
            <li> so be careful</li>
            <li> My friend, who works in the beauty industry, gave me a few travel packages she had back in Nov 2010 to use the morning of my wedding and on my honeymoon.</li>
            <li> Could be the Masque making my hair feel rough as well.</li>
            <li> The shampoo consistency is very thin and watery like it had been diluted or cut with water, much thinner in consistency than the last bottle of shampoo I purchased.</li>
            <li> little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> My daughter has dry, thick curly hair, patches of psoriasis on the back of her scalp and periodic bouts of oily scalp.  </li>
            <li> didnt even use 1/4 of the bottle of shampoo and the condtioner is not nearly as good as the old formula either.</li>
            <li> ....free of just about every other thing you wouldn&#x27;t want in your hair.  </li>
            <li> Also, I agree with another reviewer who indicated her bottles were not packaged as well as some other products from Amazon, in that mine leaked a bit in transit.  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed :)</li>
            <li> (Even other hairdressers)</li>
            <li> you order it from and read the other reviews.</li>
            <li> At the time I first ordered this off Amazon it was difficult to find.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t using any other product in my hair.</li>
            <li> The aroma of the Argan oil is delicate but lasting.</li>
            <li> In the past five weeks my hair has been bleached twice, dyed with permanent dye three times, and then dyed with semi permanent dye (don&#x27;t ask, long story).</li>
            <li> Later it was thick at the bottom.  </li>
            <li> My experience has been the bottles I purchased at the salon became thick over a short period.</li>
            <li> Eventually all that was left was really thick shampoo stuck to the sides of the bottle</li>
            <li> It seemed like the shampoo was watered down.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair</li>
            <li> Watered down formula.  </li>
            <li> I have heard that some of the stores sell it water down</li>
            <li> they refunded half of my purchase price...and has since corrected this issue and updated the description.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it about five times now and my hair is softer, shiny, and less frizzy</li>
            <li> used to order this through a salon, but through Amazon I could get both the shampoo and masque for less than I paid for just the masque at the salon.</li>
            <li> However, I now see this product at Marshall stores for less $</li>
            <li> B003RBQYR2 instead for a little over $47 as of today, 3/1/2010.</li>
            <li> It also had a little bit of leaking from the product.  </li>
            <li> The scent is a little earthy but, you get used to it.</li>
            <li> One child is not able to use plant based products and has a formaldehyde allergy and the other child has severe dye allergies.  </li>
            <li> The product I had gotten from my hairdresser was so thick, it was hard to pump out when it got low in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> A few of the reviews also states that the oil is included, so I wanted to let any prospective buyer(s) know that it does not include the oil.  </li>
            <li> Messy,</li>
            <li> thickens and volumizes without being overly heavy.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why, when my hairdresser was having trouble getting it in her shop, I turned to the internet to find it.  </li>
            <li> or my hair would get dried out-</li>
            <li> Even converted a few friends from using salon products, Wen, and off the shelf brands.   </li>
            <li> I purchased the 33.8 oz duo, as I planned on making DermOrganic my everyday shampoo, instead I will need to be returning it.  </li>
            <li> I typically run a comb through my hair while conditioning in the shower - so it needs to run through without snagging!  </li>
            <li> My wife has very thick and long hair.  </li>
            <li> The product was very thin and was not the same quality compared to previous purchases I had made from my hair dresser.</li>
            <li> Not like a lot of other \\&quot;eco-friendly\\&quot; brands that leave behind a residue or dirty-feeling scalp after a few washes.  </li>
            <li> I do need to add a little water in the shampoo bottle when it gets too thick for the pump dispenser.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick long color treated hair that usually gets frizzy and is hard to manage at times.</li>
            <li> and I never thought I&#x27;d find another shampoo/conditioner in the organic range to give me the same feeling on my hair, but I&#x27;ve never been happier to prove myself wrong.  </li>
            <li> Now looking over the records of past orders here at Amazon, I see that I also ordered a sample for a friend after my husband brought me my sample.  </li>
            <li> no more hives.</li>
            <li> My mom bought small bottles of this shampoo and conditioner from her beauty salon to give to me.</li>
            <li> Love the Shampoo and Masque but the delivery system is terrible.  </li>
            <li> I usually have to put a ton of creme rinse in my hair.</li>
            <li> I can order DermOrganic online here from Amazon, because I unfortunately cant get it locally</li>
            <li> But when I purchased from the UglyNBeauty it came thick and fragrant.  </li>
            <li> My wife said when she bought this product the shampoo was initially thick.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the shampoo is about the consistency of skim milk (VERY thin and watered down).  </li>
            <li> I find it atrocious that someone would water down the formula to save a few dollars here and there.</li>
            <li> the shampoo thickens at the bottom and has a liquid base at the top, need to shake it vigorously to form an even base</li>
            <li> Now I just want my hair to grow back. :(</li>
            <li> It makes it very hard to get the shampoo from the dispenser to your hair.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, my hair goes through a lot of processing and oftentimes looks like it with fly-aways and a little bit of frizz, despite the fact that I have used high-quality, expensive products for years.    </li>
            <li> However, I am not certain if this was just a bad batch, or if somehow this product was severely diluted when it was sent to me.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo does have a tendacy to change consistancy from very thin to quite thick but it does not affect the performance of the product or the lathering power.</li>
            <li> The DermOrganic Masque&#x27;s pump was broken in shipping making is difficult to pour out the correct amount without wasting or spilling some.   </li>
            <li> It has taken my tired broken hair, and made it fuller, stronger, and easier to style!</li>
            <li> I had bald spots all around my scalp, bad split ends and just dull hair.</li>
            <li> I was using Wen shampoo for a while, but it is so expensive.  </li>
            <li> As time went on it seemed to become very thin.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin hair, I wore fused extensions for 5 years, and clip-in&#x27;s for a couple years after that.</li>
            <li> Maybe this was a random event, but disappointing nonetheless.   </li>
            <li> I was recommended this product by my stylist and it has not been a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I cannot go without blowing it out and these cold days in NY are getting to my hair.</li>
            <li> Also once to the bottom 1/4 of bottle the pump stops working making it inconvenient to get the product out.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> (Bad batch like they guessed?)  </li>
            <li> So, I don&#x27;t know if this was a bad batch</li>
            <li> I am quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed after I read the ingredients in the products.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo is worthless without the conditioner and oil treatment.</li>
            <li> I also hate that \\&quot;squeaky clean\\</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am always on the hunt for really moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. Recently got Brazilian hair treatment and was told to only use this. Works pretty well however I have coarse hair that absorbs everything so it can&#x27;t be moisturizing enough for me.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product by my stylist and it has not been a disappointment. It leaves my hair with lots of volume and shine. And just as it claims, the sulfate free formula lathers up beautifully. Definitely a plus. Would definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I love the conditioner and oil treatment, but the shampoo leaves little to be desired. The shampoo is worthless without the conditioner and oil treatment.</li>
            <li> Like that the product is sulfate free. Like the conitioner, soft and silky results. Not crazy about the shampoo - hardly lathers so I feel like I have to use a lot. Overall I know it&#x27;s a good product, good for mg hair and a good deal.</li>
            <li> My hair is very frizzy...I cannot go without blowing it out and these cold days in NY are getting to my hair. This product is so moisture filled!! The shampoo and conditioner come with pumps and a bonus bottle of hair oil you can use for finishing or before blow-drying for extra sleek blowout. Get this stuff! I love it.</li>
            <li> DermOrganic&#x27;s shampoo and masque are fantastic...although I do recommend using this in conjunction with the leave-in-treatment oil.  The shampoo lathers up very well, and the masque is lightweight and does not weigh your hair down.  I have shoulder length hair and only need one pump of each.  I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo and masque for 6 days &amp; the leave-in-treatment for 1 day (I just received it yesterday), and my fly-aways are almost nonexistent.  My hair is more lustrous and silky with the l-i-t oil, than without.  My hair has not looked and felt this HEALTHY in ages. I am in love with my hair again!!  :o)    When I purchased this on 2/17 for a little over $45 from Blue Novelties, the description states that it includes the leave-in-treatment, however it does NOT.  A few of the reviews also states that the oil is included, so I wanted to let any prospective buyer(s) know that it does not include the oil.  I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that Blue Novelties has removed the oil from the packaging...as it clearly states on the DermOrganic \\&quot;Backbar Kit\\&quot; box that they came in...the leave-in-treatment oil is included.  Amazon has the GREATEST customer service...they refunded half of my purchase price...and has since corrected this issue and updated the description.    If you are looking for a complete \\&quot;Backbar Kit\\&quot; (33oz shampoo, 33oz masque, &amp; 4oz l-i-t oil) purchase ASIN: B003RBQYR2 instead for a little over $47 as of today, 3/1/2010.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Shampoo and Conditioner combo out there.  The Shampoo leaves my hair feeling clean, light and smelling great. Not like a lot of other \\&quot;eco-friendly\\&quot; brands that leave behind a residue or dirty-feeling scalp after a few washes.  And the conditioner actually makes my hair feel silky! I typically run a comb through my hair while conditioning in the shower - so it needs to run through without snagging!  And the best part is you can&#x27;t beat this value! I normally purchase the 8 oz bottles from my salon at $16 each. So these large bottle ares a fabulous bargain!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying different organic shampoos and conditioners and finally found the DermOrganic duo.  Wow, am I hooked!  I didn&#x27;t believe a shampoo without sulfates could lather like this, and the masque leaves my hair shiny, silky, and easy to brush right out of the shower.  I used to use Pantene long ago and I never thought I&#x27;d find another shampoo/conditioner in the organic range to give me the same feeling on my hair, but I&#x27;ve never been happier to prove myself wrong.  My hair felt so silky after the masque that I thought I still had product in my hair; I kept rinsing then finally realized that&#x27;s just how my hair felt after using it!  My hair is easy to style and I&#x27;ve found that I&#x27;ve run out of the bathroom a couple of times without using my usual light-hold gel, only to find it wasn&#x27;t nearly as fly-away as usual without it.  (The air is DRY here, fly-aways are almost a way of life.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had no problems with my pumps, they work beautifully on the 33oz bottles and my shampoo isn&#x27;t too thin, like another review mentioned.  (Bad batch like they guessed?)  It is thinner than the masque, but certainly not too thin to use effectively.  On a completely non-important issue, the shampoo is reeeally pretty, lol.  When I first pumped it out I thought, \\&quot;wow, it looks so pearly!\\&quot;  I know it&#x27;s corny, but it&#x27;s a beautiful pearly white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint, and it has nothing to do with the product, is the packaging of my Shampoo &amp; Masque from Blue Novelties. (Yes, I reviewed packaging elsewhere.)  My two bottles were packed so that they bounced together in an INNER box during shipping and my shampoo leaked.  Messy, but I didn&#x27;t return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a customer service note, I received an email from the DermOrganic company shortly after receiving my products asking how I liked them, whether I was completely satisfied, etc.  That was a very nice touch; they were concerned when I told them of the leaking and had me contact Blue Novelties, but stayed in touch with me to make sure I was satisfied with my response from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;m completely happy with both the product AND the company, bravo!was satisfied with my response from them.    So far I&#x27;m completely happy with both the product AND the company, bravo!</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to Derm Organic when my husband got a sample from someone who worked for the company.  I really liked the product and then ordered from this retailer.  When I got the product, it was in a large box with the oil treatment taken out and a very little of the shampoo leaked on the box.  I didn&#x27;t order the oil, so figured that was why the price was low.  When I went to use the shampoo, it was somewhat watery at the top.  Later it was thick at the bottom.  It seemed like the shampoo was watered down.  I paid a good price for this, so figured maybe it was some settling from the large container.  The shampoo didn&#x27;t seem to work at well as the sample I received.  I contacted the company and they said that I could return it and possibly it was an error from Amazon shipping.  I am a very busy person and just decided to keep the product and next time buy from another retailer.  I am now out of the product and just purchased from another retailer.  It is more like my original sample.  There is no watery shampoo.  When I contacted Derm Organic about this, they said that they recommend only purchasing the shampoo from one of their recommended retailers due to the problems I had experienced.  Now looking over the records of past orders here at Amazon, I see that I also ordered a sample for a friend after my husband brought me my sample.  It also had a little bit of leaking from the product.  So I really don&#x27;t think this is an Amazon problem, but something that this retailer is doing.  To give this retailer credit, they did offer to refund my money.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I are gluten intolerant. For years she has come out of the shower with hives on her face, neck, and shoulders. After using these products...no more hives. The 33.8 oz bottles are a great size. And I really love that they both came with dispenser pumps. We will be buying these items again.</li>
            <li> Love this product(shampoo and masque). very gentle on my fine hair and lathers well. The shampoo does have a tendacy to change consistancy from very thin to quite thick but it does not affect the performance of the product or the lathering power. I just assume it is a trade off for being organic and enviromentally friendly.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Dermorganic hair products!  I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo &amp; masque for over three months and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  This product allows my over 35, highlighted hair feel soft and look healthy.  It&#x27;s worth a try if you are looking for a deep reconditioning system that doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down. It&#x27;s also sulfate-free!</li>
            <li> My teen daughter developed a severe reaction to shampoos containing sulfate last summer when we swam in a pool almost daily.  When a friend recommended this shampoo and conditioner, I was willing to try anything.  It was wonderful to have her hair change textures within a week from looking greasy to feeling silky and dandruff free.  All three of my children and I are now using these products. I do need to add a little water in the shampoo bottle when it gets too thick for the pump dispenser.  I love it and will not change again.</li>
            <li> Love this shampooo and conditioner.  Large size makes it very economical and allows me to share with my other family members!</li>
            <li> This product helped my hair issue right away after the first use.  Was having trouble with dry hair that would not comb thru,  first time after use felt great,  and super soft.  Will use this product forever,  and my family as well.</li>
            <li> Love these! Leaves my thick coarse hair feeling smoother and I love that there are no harmful ingredients. I am hooked.</li>
            <li> My stylist introduced me to this produce and I love it.  I have super fine hair and this product really give my hair a boost of fullness.</li>
            <li> Purchased smaller bottles of this product at a much, much higher price several times from the hair dresser, but won&#x27;t ever do that again after finding it here on Amazon.  Currently, I am using the Shampoo, Masque, Argan Oil &amp; the mousse. It is a life-saver for curly hair &amp; the mousse thickens and volumizes without being overly heavy.  The aroma of the Argan oil is delicate but lasting. It is sulfate-free and ....free of just about every other thing you wouldn&#x27;t want in your hair.  After reading the other reviews here, I find it interesting that while some people have complained that Blue Novelties diluted the products, others complain the product is too thick to dispense using the pump.  My experience has been the bottles I purchased at the salon became thick over a short period. Diluting it with water helped, but never fully solved the issue.  The large bottles I purchased from Blue Novelties did not seem to be diluted, haven&#x27;t thickened, and thankfully dispense w/o issue. It&#x27;s kind of a large bottle for the shower, so it&#x27;s nice not to have to struggle with the pump.  Also, I agree with another reviewer who indicated her bottles were not packaged as well as some other products from Amazon, in that mine leaked a bit in transit.  I left a separate packaging review.  Blue Novelties contacted me after the transaction, and I conveyed these remarks.  Overall, if you are hooked on DermOrganic, I would recommend this product for both quality and value.  If you have never tried DermOrganic, it might make more sense to buy the smaller bottles.</li>
            <li> I normally love this product.  It is wonderful for my hair.  That&#x27;s why, when my hairdresser was having trouble getting it in her shop, I turned to the internet to find it.  Well, this seemed to be a good deal, but when I actually used the shampoo, it became very, very obvious that the person who sold me this shampoo, watered it down - to the point that is shoots out and is so thin that it&#x27;s hard to hold in your hand.  It&#x27;s about the consistency of buttermilk.  The product I had gotten from my hairdresser was so thick, it was hard to pump out when it got low in the bottle.  The one from the hairdresser was more the consistency of hand cream - not lotion - cream.    So these people ripped me off.  If you are wanting to find this product, don&#x27;t buy it from Blue Novelties. They watered down the shampoo so much that it was more like water than shampoo.  I would guess there was about 1/4 product to water.  Big, big rip off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many shampoo and conditioner&#x27;s and this one by DermOrganic is by far the best one I have ever tried. It makes my hair feel like I just got a haircut, even though the last time I got a haircut was over a month ago.  I also appreciate that they do not test their products on animals and it is paraben free.  Also, to the person that said the shampoo she received was diluted, I&#x27;m pretty sure that that is how it is supposed to be, because my shampoo is the same way and I think it suds up and cleans very thoroughly.  I highly recommend using this brand.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair and have been using WEN for years..Wen made my thin hair look great. WEN also is now going for 60 to 70 dollars a bottle. Considering you have to use 20 to 30 pumps each time.....well you get the idea. TIME FOR A CHANGE. I found this and after reading the reviews gave it a shot. It made my hair feel and look every bit as good as WEN but saves a fortune. Keep in mind that i also purchased thr leave in treatment. When I used all three I was so happy with the results. Now I have a shampoo/conditioner/leave-in that will last awhile without breaking the bank. I would recomend this product line. Thanks</li>
            <li> My mom bought small bottles of this shampoo and conditioner from her beauty salon to give to me. At first, I thought she&#x27;d wasted her money because I&#x27;d been using a brand that worked fairly well on my coarse, thick, curly hair, and I was wary of new products. (This kind of hair can be very fussy, and the wrong products or drying process will make it \\&quot;1980s big\\&quot; and frizzy.) I figured I&#x27;d try it, just to see, and my hair loved it! Although the shampoo is sulfate-free, it lathers almost as much as a dime-store shampoo, though my hair does feel a bit \\&quot;rough\\&quot; when I rinse it out. The conditioner, however, leaves it feeling smooth and silky. I follow up by scrunching a leave-in conditioner to encourage my hair to chunk, then let it air-dry, and I end up with smooth, shiny curls. When that initial set of shampoo and conditioner bottles were empty, I hunted on the web to find more, and the price at Amazon (when you consider shipping) was the best I found. I&#x27;ll be using this for the foreseeable future!</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair, which I straighten with a flat iron. Needless to say, my hair goes through a lot of processing and oftentimes looks like it with fly-aways and a little bit of frizz, despite the fact that I have used high-quality, expensive products for years.    Since switching to DermOrganic shampoo, masque, and oil, my hair looks and feels silky, smooth, and SHINY!! Not greasy shiny... healthy shiny. I could be in a hair commercial! I have tried many products trying to reach this goal, but none have delivered like DermOrganic.    Order it now. You won&#x27;t be sorry! This is my stocking stuffer for everyone this Christmas.</li>
            <li> The product was very thin and was not the same quality compared to previous purchases I had made from my hair dresser.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and I can use it every day without feeling like a need to change things up. Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Recently wanted to try a new shampoo /conditioner and saw this interesting stuff at TJmaxx, read the label and went online to check it out.  I gave it a try based on reviews and what I had found online.  This stuff is magical!  Hair feels soft, full and strong.  Another thing that appealed to me was the smell.  It has a nice smell to it as well as appears to be healthy for the hair.  I definitely think the shampoo needs a conditioner, and the masque works amazing.  Both great products.  I&#x27;ve already stocked up on a few bottles where I caught good deals at TJmaxx and online.    Highly recommend!  *note:  my hair is straight and fairly fine...  The two products combined work great with it.</li>
            <li> In the past five weeks my hair has been bleached twice, dyed with permanent dye three times, and then dyed with semi permanent dye (don&#x27;t ask, long story). After using the shampoo and masque one time, my hair was even softer then before the processing. I&#x27;ve used it about five times now and my hair is softer, shiny, and less frizzy then it&#x27;s ever been! I can&#x27;t recommend these products enough!  I&#x27;ll add a picture of my shiny, healthy, blue hair for you to see.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely fashion but was packaged in a soft mail pouch so one of the pumps on the conditioner does not work, it was snapped off.</li>
            <li> I Bought the product from Amazon fulfillment and experienced the same thing that everyone else complained about.  Watered down formula.  But when I purchased from the UglyNBeauty it came thick and fragrant.  It also seems to clean much better.  Totally worth the few extra dollars to get what I paid for.  I find it atrocious that someone would water down the formula to save a few dollars here and there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this products after seeing all the reviews about it and  i&#x27;ve personally used organic Argan oil and i loved it so i thought  if these products are made with the same oil i must love them.....  and i did, i can&#x27;t tell you how soft and managebel it left my hair  i have fine curly hair with damaged ends cause of the highlights   and coloring..... and this whole treatment brought my hair back to life   again...!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my second order of this shampoo,but the first time I bought from a different distributor.i still like it,makes my hair look healthy,even my hairstylists noticed it.but the texture of shampoo is so diffent!and masque is okay only,straights my hair up,so I don&#x27;t  use it often,it&#x27;s hard to fix my hair after it,but it makes it very soft tho.</li>
            <li> Since using this shampoo my hair feels so much healthier! I really love it and recommend it to everyone!! Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this!</li>
            <li> The DermOrganic Barback package that I ordered came without the 4oz. bottle of Argan Oil. The box showed all three bottles but only two were present. The shampoo consistency is very thin and watery like it had been diluted or cut with water, much thinner in consistency than the last bottle of shampoo I purchased. The DermOrganic Masque&#x27;s pump was broken in shipping making is difficult to pour out the correct amount without wasting or spilling some.   I love the products but seems that I got a kit that was tampered with.</li>
            <li> My daughter has dry, thick curly hair, patches of psoriasis on the back of her scalp and periodic bouts of oily scalp.  We have made a ton of changes to her routine- adding an omega 3 supplement and an anti-inflamatory to her diet as well as a change in shampoo and conditioner.  After going without this shampoo and conditioner for 4 days, I can safely say it is a factor.      She uses both products together and also uses a leave in conditioner that we add a couple of drops of moroccan oil in before applying- the result- she has never had such beautiful hair and a healthy scalp.  What i love about the masque is that it is a conditioning product that can be applied directly to her scalp without causing oil build up.  Her hair is far less frizzy and the best I have seen her psoriasis.      The biggest con for us is that we have to use a lot of shampoo (it is thin) and the masque does not smell as nice as the shampoo.  But, considering the results, we can deal with these drawbacks.</li>
            <li> Love the Shampoo and Masque but the delivery system is terrible.  The pumps constantly get clogged and I have to spend precious time in the mornings trying to coax the very thick product out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews- but I felt inclined to endorse this product.  I have historically been known to spend way too much money on hair products- I am always trying to find the perfect product- I have tried Aveda, Pureology, redkin, bumble and bumble and all sorts of natural products from small companies (the companies I prefer to work with- oh...is this Amazon.com I am reviewing on...shoot).  Anyway, I have very dry, wavy, thick hair that looks great when it&#x27;s got the right amount of moisture but I have gotten so many moisturizing products that leave my hair feeling greasy and unnatural.  I also hate that \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot; feeling that I get with some shampoos- and the dry ends it leaves me with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this shampoo and conditioner- I really think that after 10 years of experimenting I have found my product.  The price isn&#x27;t terrible, the smell is nice (my boyfriend uses it too) and the way my hair looks and feels after it&#x27;s dry is incredible- and even without additional styling products.  I am really trying to get my hair back to it&#x27;s healthy state- after dying it blonde for the last few years- and I feel that with this product things are really starting to improve and I don&#x27;t feel the need to apply heat to my hair after washing.  With all of my old shampoos I could really only wash my hair once or twice a week- or my hair would get dried out- I can wash every day with this stuff (which is nice because I bike all over the place and live in a huge city and my hair gets pollution-ized).  My hair is shiny and healthy for the first time in a very long while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so pumped about this stuff.  You should buy it.  Seriously.</li>
            <li> First let me just tell you this comes with Dermorganic Leave-in Treatment with Organic Argan Oil which sells separately for around $15.  I didn&#x27;t know that I actually had the leave in treatment in my cart and decided I would leave for my next order.  Boy am I glad I did :)  Now onto the shampoo and conditioner.  I use the Keratin express because I dye my hair about every 3-4 weeks and use a flat iron about once/twice a week.  My hairdresser urged me to start using a sulfate free shampoo.  Sure.  Started using Livin the Dream by Tigi...then went organic with Kenra Platinum.  I have finally found home :) this stuff lathers up amazing and the conditioner actually feels like I am feeding my hair.  My hairdresser keeps saying \\&quot;Your hair feels so great\\&quot; it&#x27;s been in the best shape it&#x27;s ever been.  The leave in treatment is a must for thick hair..smells great..dries hair fast.  Actually gives my hair such a nice wave I go out with it after only air drying (although my preference is poker straight).  You will not be disappointed :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! It makes my hair look and feel soo healthy. Less frizz and more shine for my curls! I get so much more compliments on my hair. Its and amazing product!</li>
            <li> My hair dresser started me on the leave-in treatment &amp; I was amazed at the product so I started using the shampoo &amp; Masque. Loved it too.... my hair is down to my butt &amp; bleached blonde every 3 to 4 weeks. I get complements all the time on my hair..... (Even other hairdressers) My mom has allerges &amp; just found out she is allergic to glutten &amp; this product is glutten free &amp; now she is using it..... Love it.....</li>
            <li> First of all the products are wonderful for your hair, and I have researched pricing of them and this is by far the cheapest.  The containers are larger than they appear and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I recently received my latest purchase of DermOrganic Shampoo and Conditioner.  I have been using this product for 2 years and absolutely love the product.  However, I am not certain if this was just a bad batch, or if somehow this product was severely diluted when it was sent to me.  The consistency of the shampoo is about the consistency of skim milk (VERY thin and watered down).  It makes it very hard to get the shampoo from the dispenser to your hair.  It ends up running all over the place.  Again, I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for some time.  So, I don&#x27;t know if this was a bad batch or if I received a diluted version.  I am quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed after I read the ingredients in the products.  Yes, the products work great.  I really liked the leave-in treatment, BUT, the first ingredient is a toxic chemical that has been banned in Canada. Please see cyclopentasiloxane dimethicone,  I prefer real organic products without harmful chemicals.  Once again, I will say this product does work great, if only they would get rid of the chemicals.</li>
            <li> It works great and my curls are actually coming in, which hasn&#x27;t happened since i was little. It threw me off when they first showed up but i love them and my hair is the healthiest it has been in years even with hair coloring. I will never switch to another hair product again! I&#x27;m set for life!</li>
            <li> I loved this shampoo the second it touched my hair.  It&#x27;s a no-lather smoother and detangler that cleans very well.  I love the way my hair feels after shampooing.  The Masque, however, does not behave as you would expect a masque to.  It would be better marketed simply as a conditioner.  It leaves my hair soft, but dry.  I suppose this would be a good conditioner for people with oily hair.</li>
            <li> I bought the two liter duo and when I received them, I opened them to see consistency of both and all looked well. Then I used the shampoo (with the pump) and the shampoo shot out real watery and not like the consistency in the bottle. I shook it up and tried again and that helped a bit. Next time I used it, same thing, shampoo shot out like water. I tried the shake it up method before I used it a few more times and realized that it was silly to waste time shaking my shampoo each time I needed to use it. So I stopped and just went with the watery consistency. Eventually all that was left was really thick shampoo stuck to the sides of the bottle and it wouldn&#x27;t come out of the pump. Maybe this was a random event, but disappointing nonetheless.   The product itself worked fine and I would have bought again if not for the watery shampoo.     As an aside, this is not truly organic shampoo and I think the company tries to mislead its customers by calling it \\&quot;DermOrganic\\&quot; when its not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months and my hair has never been better!  I have dry curly hair that tends to be frizzy.  This product gives my hair a great soft feeling and makes the color come alive.  Works great whether I leave it curly or blow dry straight.</li>
            <li> My wife has very thick and long hair.  She loves this product because it leaves her hair soft and very easy to comb and manage.</li>
            <li> After one use my hair is softer, no tangles and looks great! I was very surprised since I have tried dozens of organic shampoos &amp; conditioners in the past, this one is by far the best! The shampoo is thinner than other organic shampoos I&#x27;ve tried in the past, I read you need to shake it because it will seperate, but it doesn&#x27;t affect the performance, still lathers very well and it rinses clean, no residue left behind, and it smells good! The conditioner is thick which is great, nothing worse than thin, running conditioner! Will keep buying it. :D</li>
            <li> Fast, excellent delivery of my DermOrganic Shampoo and Masque .  Thank you very much for my product.  Love it, love it, love it!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rare to find an organic product that doesn&#x27;t leave your hair flat and oily. This product leaves your hair full and healthy!</li>
            <li> My wife said when she bought this product the shampoo was initially thick.  As time went on it seemed to become very thin.  She removed the pump and washed it out (it seemed somewhat clogged) and then stirred up the remaining product.  The result was a thicker shampoo once again.  So it seems that this product may start to separate at some point but it can be remedied.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Shampoo. Your hair will get plenty of compliments, I&#x27;m sure :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a fan of the masque - My hair feels coated and waxy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product line for the past couple of years and I love it!! Really conditions your hair and treats it well :) Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed my hair products very much.  The package was well done and it arrived on time as it was advise.</li>
            <li> I have thin - dry hair - this works the best out of all shampoo/conditioners used, including salon sold products - have tried several different &amp;#34;high-lined&amp;#34; products but this still remains my favorite that I return to</li>
            <li> One of only 2 products I will use on my hair.  Execellent ingredients and excellent results.  My hair is naturally wavy and on the dry side.  Dermorganics products make my hair feel like soft and silky.  I also use their argan oil on my ends prior to blowdrying.</li>
            <li> I like the conditioner. The shampoo seems drying for my dry coarse hair. Also once to the bottom 1/4 of bottle the pump stops working making it inconvenient to get the product out.</li>
            <li> I like that these are sulfate free.  I was using Wen shampoo for a while, but it is so expensive.  I like this shampoo, but it doesn&#x27;t compare to the Wen.  One of the bottles came with a broken pump so I had to transfer it into a different container with a working pump top.</li>
            <li> my wife loves this so i ordered it for her i dont use this since i am male head and shoulders is fine for me</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic. Used to get patched of eczema on my scalp, not anymore! The scent is a little earthy but, you get used to it. Hair is in great shape, super shiny, soft and strong.</li>
            <li> Well, I was recommended this product because I was in search of paraben free, healthier more organic hair product line.  This stuff works great, however its still a 4 on the EWG cosmetic database.[...]</li>
            <li> So far this is the best organic &amp; natural shampoo &amp; conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used!! This shampoo cleanses very well &amp; the masque (conditioner) moisturizes as well as high-quality salon brands, for my fine hair it actually moisturies a bit too much, so i don&#x27;t use it daily, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair at all (which is good, but for my fine hair i get tons of fly-aways so i just ordered the DermOrganic Daily Conditioner &amp; also the DermOrganic Sculpting Whip (which actually is meant to tame fly-aways &amp; friz without hardening like sprays &amp; gels) i look forwarding to getting my order so I can try these products! I highly recommend DermOrganic.</li>
            <li> I love the product, my hair feels soft and silky.  It is safe for color as it is phosphate free.  Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> after reading the reviews this stuff is just not for me thankyou everyone!</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner has saved my hair. After going from Brown to Blonde my hair was pretty damaged and extremely dry. I tried multiple shampoos and deep conditioners, but nothing has worked as well at DermOrganic. My hair finally feels soft again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brand of organic (and paraben free!) shampoo and conditioner. The other sulfate free shampoos i have used do not lather up very well. This how, however, lathers up just like any normal shampoo. It smells AMAZING and leaves your hair feeling soft and looking fabulous. Pair it with the Leave-In argan oil and you are bound to have a great hair day!</li>
            <li> My friend told me about these products, and I have not stopped thanking her! It has taken my tired broken hair, and made it fuller, stronger, and easier to style! I will never switch to something else again!</li>
            <li> These products leave my curly hair with a nice smooth texture.  Love the smell also.  Just to mention, the shampoo does not lather like most shampoos.  That does not bother me, however.  Good deal for the cost also.</li>
            <li> Favorite in our home and everyone can use it!  Glowing healthy hair!  This is the only set we purchase now, except for a once a month clarifying shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our family has a variety of allergies from plant products, dyes, foods, ingredients and more.  If your family has allergies that are opposite from each other, this product bypassed all of them.  One child is not able to use plant based products and has a formaldehyde allergy and the other child has severe dye allergies.  DermOrganics has been a life saver and worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo and conditioner for about a month now.  I guess I had way too high expectations for it.  It was recommended by a gf who like me has curly hair.  The thing is my gf is not puerto rican like me...I have pseudo ethnic hair, that grows long but its extremely dry, brittle and frizzy aka a daily nightmare.  These products don&#x27;t really do much for me.  I will finish them as they have no sulfates but I wont purchase again.  I will probably try mixed chicks or go back to deva curl.</li>
            <li> I usually have to put a ton of creme rinse in my hair. This stuff is real thick and very smooth. I love it. My hair is&lt;br /&gt;really soft now and not so bushy.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried ton&#x27;s of products for my hair and this one is the best and I love how&lt;br /&gt;a little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Will order it again. I have heard that some of the stores sell it water down so be careful&lt;br /&gt;who you order it from and read the other reviews.</li>
            <li> The best ever shampoo and conditioner!  Lasts a long time and treats my hair wonderfully! Recommend it to all my family and friends</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;exactly as expected.&lt;br /&gt;happy with the product</li>
            <li> love this set and the argan oil. Girl who cuts my hair always says how nice it is. Girlfriend wanted it for Christmas.</li>
            <li> My friend, who works in the beauty industry, gave me a few travel packages she had back in Nov 2010 to use the morning of my wedding and on my honeymoon. That way I wouldnt have to pack huge bottles in my suitcases.  I&#x27;m telling you...It was love at first shampoo!    Thank goodness I can order DermOrganic online here from Amazon, because I unfortunately cant get it locally (you can if you have a cosmotology license..which I don&#x27;t..and neither does my friend).  These products have been a life/hair saver.  I&#x27;m able to comb through my hair wet without fighting with it.  The Masque is a great detangler.  These products are so awesome, I tell EVERYONE about it.  Even converted a few friends from using salon products, Wen, and off the shelf brands.   I&#x27;ll continue using DermOrganic&#x27;s Shampoo and Masque until they stop making it.  And when that happens, I&#x27;ll cry.</li>
            <li> The moment I used these products, I fell in love with them.  They felt right, and the masque was wonderful, leaving my hair super soft.  I didn&#x27;t think twice and ordered the leave-in right away.  I have used it for about a week now, and realized it has given me dandruff!!!!!  This is the first time I deal with this in my whole life, and honestly, I am surprised that an all natural organic product could produce these results. It is such a shame!!!  I purchased the 33.8 oz duo, as I planned on making DermOrganic my everyday shampoo, instead I will need to be returning it.  I tried to make my son use them, to see if it will produce the same results in him, but after seeing my scalp, he simply refused to try it at all...  Shame!</li>
            <li> I have used the Dermorganic Masque for quite awhile, as has my daughter, who has extremely long hair.  It has always worked well to keep the frizzies out of my wavy hair and keep my daughter&#x27;s hair in great condition.&lt;br /&gt;I used to order this through a salon, but through Amazon I could get both the shampoo and masque for less than I paid for just the masque at the salon.</li>
            <li> I love this product, the smell, texture, everything about it! I have very thin hair, I wore fused extensions for 5 years, and clip-in&#x27;s for a couple years after that. I had bald spots all around my scalp, bad split ends and just dull hair. I was walking in TJ maxx and I stumbled upon this! WOW! it has brought my hair back to life, volume, no split ends, barely any breakage and my hair seems to be growing at a very fast rate, and I have only been using this product for 3 weeks!</li>
            <li> I didnt notice any huge difference in my hair after using these products.  They do the trick, get your hair clean but for the money not worth it in my opinion.  Also, they smell strange.</li>
            <li> My hair stays clean all day and is light and natural feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is never a residue or build up.</li>
            <li> Good quality shampoo and masque.  I have been using the shampoo daily for years.</li>
            <li> Purchased these at my local TJ Max for $ 19.99 a bottle and they work great. I was looking for a new shampoo and conditioner to try and replace my Shikai set that can be purchased at Whole Foods, and these seem to due the trick. I like the fact that even though they aren&#x27;t fully all natural/organic, they due have less chemicals in them and keep my thick long hair clean for up to three full days (as I do not wash my hair daily). Overall, great purchase.</li>
            <li> At the time I first ordered this off Amazon it was difficult to find.  I love it and it has made my hair condition smoother, softer without the limp.  I have fine hair, that is straight and processed.  However, I now see this product at Marshall stores for less $</li>
            <li> Organic, no added fragrance great shampoo and fantastic Masque. I have been using it for the past 12 month love it.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that was all dried out. It has been frizzy from blow-drying, with damaged split ends from coloring. At some point a few months ago I decided enough was enough. I threw out my flat iron, my blow dryer and bought dermorganic with the highest of hopes. I really wanted this product to work. The lather was great, my hair felt CLEAN! Which is something I didn&#x27;t feel when i tried Wen some years ago. Most of all it smelled AMAZING and my hair was softer and NOT FRIZZY after 3 days. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I even stocked up with liter bottles immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then something happened after a couple of weeks; Every time I even lightly passed my fingers through my hair in the shower, I was left with clumps of falling hair in my hands. It was more than a couple of strands, and way more than i was comfortable with. And it was falling out from the root. I wasn&#x27;t using any other product in my hair. It had to be the dermorganic. But I still wanted it to work. I figured maybe this was temporary and I waited a few more weeks for the falling to stop. It didn&#x27;t, and the hair loss was getting more intense. each passing of my fingers took up to 12 strands of hair with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 weeks later, I gave up. I went to my salon where my stylist noticed areas where I have noticeable hair loss. I had already stopped using dermorganic and switched back to my normal brand. The hair loss stopped. I really am heartbroken. Now I just want my hair to grow back. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from Psoriasis for years.  It tends to come-and-go on my scalp.  Has stayed away since I started using this shampoo and conditioner.  Plus, my hair is super bouncy, shiny and healthy-looking when I use the product.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I had given this product a 5 star rating at one point but couldnt find my review to update it. The first batch I bought was the best thing ever- loved it. Then when I bought the second time they had changed the shampoo now it says made with skin cleansers  the first one would barely lather this one is more bubbly than dish washing detergent -it has totaly dried my hair out and makes my scalp itch like I have dandruff - didnt even use 1/4 of the bottle of shampoo and the condtioner is not nearly as good as the old formula either. I&#x27;m going back to Biolage - so dissapointed it WAS a great product</li>
            <li> my wife loves this shampoo and Amazon has become the only store I buy it from I have heard or read reviews about people saying that the product was watered down but to avoid that I make sure that I buy from a Amazon prime vendor so that if I have that problem I can send it back</li>
            <li> I had been using Wen and was looking for a more reasonably priced option when I discovered DermOrganic. I was growing my hair out and thought the shedding was just more noticable because the hairs were longer. After about a month, I&#x27;m noticing a LOT less hair in my comb and drain and my hair feels much fuller -- in addition to being silkier and softer. When I went to get a cut &amp; color the other day, my stylist couldn&#x27;t belive how soft my hair was without any oily feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally wavy/curly hair and the shampoo and conditioner do make my hair almost too soft. So, I use the leave-in conditioner/argon oil and usually one other styling product -- either a heat protectant for straightening or a curl-enhancer for definition depending on my mood and how much time I have in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep &#x27;em guessing whether I&#x27;m going to show up curly or straight, but I&#x27;ll recommend DermOrganic to anyone who asks.</li>
            <li> The product is wonderful and I will definitely be ordering again!  I have been recommending it to all my friends too!</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell and a good consistency, but for some reason it just won&#x27;t rinse out of my hair. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me, but everytime I use it it leaves my roots and hair feeling waxy and covered in powder or...something. I spend 15 minutes rinsing it out of my hair and it just...won&#x27;t come out. Could be the Masque making my hair feel rough as well.</li>
            <li> I have pitch black hair, but I bleach it practically blonde every 3 months. Therefore, my hair is pretty damaged and has a lot of breakage at the ends and feels elastic when wet. I also swim, so my hair is even further damaged by chlorine. I&#x27;ve tried so many different shampoos/conditioners to repair my hair and nothing worked until I tried DermOrganic. The conditioning masque really helped to make my hair soft, healthy, and strong again!!! I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I highly recommend this for anyone who struggles with damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo and conditioner for about a year now.  I will never use another shampoo/conditioner again.  It has made my hair so healthy.  I have long hair with highlights and this has been the best shampoo.  Since the shampoo doesnt have sulfates it does not foam and lather like regular shampoo but it still gets your hair clean.  It smells amazing as well.  I wash my hair about every 3 days and I am able to keep the shampoo and conditioner for about 6 months until I run out.  You should def try this product.  I also have the hair spray,, not only does it hold my hair it is easy to brush out and doesnt tangle my hair.</li>
            <li> I like that this brand is organic, it works and is gluten-free. I have Celiac&#x27;s so for precautionary measures am eliminating wheat from everything around me. These products leave my hair soft and shiny, my husband loves them too. The smell is sweet and nutty, the products are concentrated so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is great shampoo and conditioner. I use the masque two-three times per week. My hair grows about 1-2 inches per month and I know it&#x27;s because of this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product and so happy I could finally get some.  I&#x27;ve looked everywhere and it really makes my hair soft!</li>
            <li> Very nice, light shampoo and conditioner.  I love that it is paraben free and free of other &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;.  The shampoo doesn&#x27;t get very frothy or sudsy because of the lack of sulfur but it still cleans nicely.  The conditioner is very nice too.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Good Hair Product..on time delivery..been using it for sometime now..the shampoo thickens at the bottom and has a liquid base at the top, need to shake it vigorously to form an even base</li>
            <li> This conditioner/deep conditioner is amazing. As far as I know, it lacks all the crappy chemicals that are in every shampoo/conditioner at the drugstore (my main source for this stuff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely just put it in and rinse out, I let it sit for at least a minute or 2 before rinsing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I have long sort-of-straight hair that does get frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this set for about a year now and I still love it. I have very thick long color treated hair that usually gets frizzy and is hard to manage at times. This stuff makes my hair smooth and silky plus it smells really nice. Try it you will love it too!</li>
            <li> Great lather from the shampoo with a soft feeling, and also wonderful conditioner that deep conditions without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> I have been using DermOrganic products for years.  With my allergies I can not use scented products and was so happy to find this product.  I color my hair and need to use high end products and DermOrganic is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;I even use it to wash my dogs that is how mild it is.</li>
