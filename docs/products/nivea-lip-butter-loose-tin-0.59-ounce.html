    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Calling this product &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34; was an excellent idea.</li>
            <li>Great stuff!</li>
            <li>It feels so good on my lips!</li>
            <li>product is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried and trust me, I&#x27;ve tried most of them out there.</li>
            <li>and you get a fair amount of product.</li>
            <li>This is the best lip balms available out there for the price.</li>
            <li>I have fell in love with this product!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>Nice alternative to Vaseline</li>
            <li>but I can honestly say that I will never be without Nivea Lip Butter ever again.</li>
            <li>I find it fits nicely into the front pocket of my jeans without making a bulge like a stick does.</li>
            <li>This by far is the best I have ever tried!&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>I love his by my beside at night to put on before I got to sleep &amp; sometimes in the morning</li>
            <li>I was disappoint to learn this overpriced product, is mostly petroleum.</li>
            <li>It is not my favorite, but I like it and like having it.</li>
            <li>This is way more creamy and much more healing.  </li>
            <li>Nice and smooth and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Good Product, Fast Delivery.</li>
            <li>It has great natural ingredients like Shea butter, sweet almonds and glycerine.</li>
            <li>Great, simple, colorless lip balm.  </li>
            <li>The smooth skin does not have any taste or smell.</li>
            <li>It is just as everyone says super creamy, super hydrating, and super cute.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not usually so &#x27;over-the-top&#x27; about many products</li>
            <li>Great little tin of lip balm, colorless, odorless, not waxy or greasy.</li>
            <li>A skin professional told me it is much better to use Shea butter on my lips than petroleum because the skin can get oxygen through Shea butter but not petroleum.  </li>
            <li>Worth the 89cents I paid for it.</li>
            <li>This was the right price and nothing frilly (since it&#x27;s just for nighttime).  </li>
            <li>Nice for when you don&#x27;t want messy lipstick or greasy lipgloss, great for a soft, natural look.</li>
            <li>The metal case arrived slightly damaged (looked rusty and beat up) but the product itself is good.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s pretty neutral.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about 4-5cm in diameter (under 2&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with this, and it&#x27;ll last a long time.  </li>
            <li>and this works really well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soothing..</li>
            <li>Really softens the lips.</li>
            <li>works real well in moistening cracked lips</li>
            <li>I love it so much I use it everyday!</li>
            <li>Even if my lips become super dry, one application of this softens them.</li>
            <li>I would repurchase this product and recommend it for anyone who wants just a simple moisturizer for their lips.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t last as long as vaseline.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t last past a few minutes after applying it on the lips; my lips become dry quickly as if I didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I have dry lips</li>
            <li> I have dry lips</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months and only used maybe 1/8 of the tin..</li>
            <li> This goes on soft and pale white, but have no fear that pale opaque color disappears.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s tiny so small - and that&#x27;s not clear in the pic</li>
            <li> Just like I expected.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done as expected.  </li>
            <li> may feel a little heavy on the lips initially</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;anyways, it&#x27;s not really giving me expected results :S</li>
            <li> but it melts in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I live in Aspen and when it&#x27;s cold skiing chapstick doens&#x27;t apply so well.  </li>
            <li> But it does&#x27;t feel like your usual chap stick, either..</li>
            <li> HATE that globby feeling of chapstick or burts bees...too much wax.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed by how small the tin was compared to the cost.  </li>
            <li> This has been a really cold winter and my lips are chapped often..</li>

            <li> I love his by my beside at night to put on before I got to sleep &amp; sometimes in the morning</li>
            <li> SOOO conditioning. No yucky flavor. Nivea rocks once again!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used everything from Chapstick to Chanel lip moisturizing products. This by far is the best I have ever tried!&lt;br /&gt;Great stocking stuffers!!</li>
            <li> HATE that globby feeling of chapstick or burts bees...too much wax. Calling this product &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34; was an excellent idea. It is silky, lasts forever and makes my lips feel moist without that waxy buildup.</li>
            <li> I have dry lips and this works really well. may feel a little heavy on the lips initially but it melts in a few minutes. I use this at night before I go to bed and it stays till the morning.</li>
            <li> I like the product.  I was disappointed by how small the tin was compared to the cost.  A skin professional told me it is much better to use Shea butter on my lips than petroleum because the skin can get oxygen through Shea butter but not petroleum.

            <li> Not overly greasy but not matte either. There&#x27;s no fragrance so it&#x27;s pretty neutral. Nice alternative to Vaseline and you get a fair amount of product. Worth the 89cents I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth and easy to apply. Just like I expected.</li>
            <li> This has been a really cold winter and my lips are chapped often.. This stuff works miracles... It feels almost like Nivea hand cream, but not quite..But it does&#x27;t feel like your usual chap stick, either.. It&#x27;s very soothing.. A little goes a long way.. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months and only used maybe 1/8 of the tin..</li>
            <li> Great, simple, colorless lip balm.  Gets the job done as expected.  It&#x27;s about 4-5cm in diameter (under 2&amp;#34;).  The metal case arrived slightly damaged (looked rusty and beat up) but the product itself is good.</li>
            <li> I wanted a replacement for my vaseline lip butter, which is sold in the UK.  I like tins and I need something to put on my lips at night.  This was the right price and nothing frilly (since it&#x27;s just for nighttime).  I also wanted something to wear under lipsticks, to keep my lips moist but not ruin the color of my lipstick.  I&#x27;m really happy with this, and it&#x27;ll last a long time.  However, it doesn&#x27;t last as long as vaseline.  I would repurchase this product and recommend it for anyone who wants just a simple moisturizer for their lips.</li>

            <li> Great little tin of lip balm, colorless, odorless, not waxy or greasy. Really softens the lips. Nice for when you don&#x27;t want messy lipstick or greasy lipgloss, great for a soft, natural look. Grade: A</li>
            <li> works real well in moistening cracked lips</li>
            <li> Good Product, Fast Delivery. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I have fell in love with this product! It feels so good on my lips!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually so &#x27;over-the-top&#x27; about many products but I can honestly say that I will never be without Nivea Lip Butter ever again. This is an amazing product. I like the tin, whereas I&#x27;ve read others that don&#x27;t. I find it fits nicely into the front pocket of my jeans without making a bulge like a stick does. This goes on soft and pale white, but have no fear that pale opaque color disappears. It has no camphor like Chapstick or Carmex. It has great natural ingredients like Shea butter, sweet almonds and glycerine. I bought the flavorless Nivea lip butter to help repair the damage cause by a sever allergic reaction to &#x27;candy-cane&#x27;flavored Chapstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried and trust me, I&#x27;ve tried most of them out there.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balms available out there for the price. Even if my lips become super dry, one application of this softens them. I have dry lips and I use lip balms daily, especially at night. I have used burt&#x27;s bees, chapsticks etc but nothing works like this. The smooth skin does not have any taste or smell. I got the Raspberry one as well but haven&#x27;t tried that out yet. Grab them when they are on sale!!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t last past a few minutes after applying it on the lips; my lips become dry quickly as if I didn&#x27;t use it. I won&#x27;t try this again.</li>
            <li> This has to be applied a lot</li>
    </ol>
