            <li>Love many of their blends.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite beauty products.</li>
            <li>I read all these reviews about how it was so musky and sexy</li>
            <li>I have received many complements and recommend Auric Blends to all who ask.</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>Lovely scent...</li>
            <li>I usually love sandalwood anything, but this smelled to me like some sort of combination of Axe and baby powder.</li>
            <li>More than a drop is overpowering.</li>
            <li>I bought my first two Auric Blends perfumes two years ago and was very pleased.</li>
            <li>It fits perfectly for my use which is to layer it with other perfumes.</li>
            <li>Has a strong powdery smell.</li>
            <li>The sandalwood oil is strong, though.</li>
            <li>This is a light scent that has a very nice soft smell.</li>
            <li>it smelled okay, but it wasn&#x27;t the true sandalwood fragrance I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Love this classic scent in a handy roller bottle.</li>
            <li>and it mixes fine with his body chemistry, but still not what we were hoping for.  </li>
            <li>This smells so strong of cheap perfume.  </li>
            <li>It is very strong at first.</li>
            <li>The smell is light and does not have that musky smell of sandlewood.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and arrived in a timely manner!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad this didn&#x27;t cost much with free shipping.</li>
            <li>Sandalwood is woody and sweet.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a true sandalwood perfume, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a true sandalwood scent.</li>
            <li>Really smells like authentic sandalwood.</li>
            <li>The scents are lovely and I wish I could describe them in detail, but the last four perfumes I bought are more diluted each time and I can&#x27;t pick up on the depth of the fragrances.</li>
            <li>Got here quick.</li>
            <li>Nice light sandalwood oil for daily use as perfume.</li>
            <li>kinda sweet, not real natural smelling but pretty good.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive my new roll on Sandalwood perfume this week.</li>
            <li>This smells sort of like Love&#x27;s Baby Soft, basically just baby powder with a hint of sandalwood.</li>
            <li>This went right in the garbage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice enough, it lasts and my husband absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li>I love this perfume will be ordering more in the near future..</li>
            <li>Long lasting beautiful fragrance.</li>
            <li>It took a hot shower and lots of scrubing to remove the oil from my skin.</li>
            <li>I will order again, but possibly with a more pungent variety.</li>
            <li>With my most recent order the roll-on function has stopped working and the perfume is not being dispensed from the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I knew that this wasn&#x27;t pure sandalwood, but this does not smell like sandalwood.</li>
            <li>They last a very long time, and you don&#x27;t need to apply a bunch on to smell good for the whole day.</li>
            <li>It is very perfume-y - I get very congested and sneeze when I wear it.</li>
            <li>This went straight into the garbage</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t do this with just any oil.</li>
            <li>I have never tired roll on perfume oils before</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t smell much like sandalwood to me.  </li>
            <li>It was shipped really fast</li>
            <li>Arrive fast.</li>
            <li>However, what ever it is blended with is very overpowering and floral.</li>
            <li>They smell almost identical, and very Johnson &amp; Johnson baby oil like to me.</li>
            <li>Note in packaging listed it as hazardous waste, yet shipped USPS.  </li>
            <li>Cheap imitation that will burn your nose hairs right off</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a different kind of sandlewood than I thought its light, breezy, and subtle.</li>
            <li>I bought another two last summer and two more just recently.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing sandalwood for years and recently have not been able to find it anywhere locally, but I struck out by purchasing this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve emailed the seller to ask how they will make this right and am currently awaiting reply.</li>
            <li>I had ordered this same thing several years ago and back then it smelled more like sandalwood.</li>
            <li>Then again, I&#x27;ve never smelled REAL sandal wood, only sandalwood scented products</li>
            <li>I was trying to smell like sandalwood, and this is as far from it as you can get.</li>
            <li>Auric Blends fans will agree, would be fine with a small price increase if it meant the perfumes could be concentrated again.</li>
            <li>It smelled exactly like I had expected it to.</li>
            <li>It smells very synthetic and just not good; too sickeningly sweet.  </li>
            <li>I can barely tell the difference between the two scents though.</li>
            <li>I can only wear oils because I am sensitive to perfumes, this gave me a headache.</li>
            <li>Divine Opium has similar notes to my favorite Black Opium but a little brighter.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but it&#x27;s only a HINT of sandalwood in the fragrance.</li>
            <li>The same would go for other scents you might try; use a tiny dab at first until you know how it works on you.</li>
            <li>Like I said, they&#x27;re so weak that the full fragrance notes are hard to pick up on, and the scent fades quickly.</li>

            <li> I smell the oil for myself--some things are hard to get right via ordering online only.</li>
            <li> just doesn&#x27;t last very long at all.</li>
            <li> My nose is extremely sensitive, so I had a few other people close their eyes and smell each fragrance.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Sandalwood scent and it definitely smells like baby powder even after it dries down...</li>
            <li> This smells not even remotely close to sandalwood.</li>
            <li> Not as heady a fragrance as I expected</li>
            <li> We use this oil to blend with a couple of other scents for something custom.</li>
            <li> The scent lasts awhile on your skin, and the little bottle itself lasts a long time, too!</li>
            <li> Maybe this kind of thing is up to the individual, but this smelled horrible to me.</li>
            <li> All day, I kept thinking there were babies around me, and I don&#x27;t even like babies, so it was no fun.</li>
            <li> do not like its scent- not true sandalwood to my nostrils....</li>
            <li> Possibly Sandalwood is not a good fragrance for this purpose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why other people cannot smell anything.</li>
            <li> Just a little dab lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> Too childish for my taste.</li>
            <li> The product seems weak, for I feel the perfume in the oil is minimal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about this scent.  </li>
            <li> Not what I usually associate with organic either.</li>
            <li> I sincerely mean that, because I like this company.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t mean to give it 4 stars, can&#x27;t change it.    </li>
            <li> All I need is a dab behind my ears, and on my wrists and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> , I would like to mention that when it arrived the roller ball was broken - stuck inside the cap.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m feeling really silly for having ordered 2.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product was very disappointing to me.  </li>
            <li> I wonder if that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re using as a base for the scents.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed, but I suppose you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> this fragrance oil was purchased for my husband--we were HOPING for SANDALWOOD scent--this is awfully powdery smelling--</li>
            <li> Smells awful!</li>
            <li> The sandalwood scent is awful.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this Sandalwood.  Nice easy smell.</li>
            <li> I knew that this wasn&#x27;t pure sandalwood, but this does not smell like sandalwood. It is very perfume-y - I get very congested and sneeze when I wear it. This went straight into the garbage</li>
            <li> I get what I wanted. Sandalwood scent. It fits perfectly for my use which is to layer it with other perfumes. I&#x27;m not sure why other people cannot smell anything. My bottle is great.</li>
            <li> I bought my first two Auric Blends perfumes two years ago and was very pleased. I bought another two last summer and two more just recently. The scents are lovely and I wish I could describe them in detail, but the last four perfumes I bought are more diluted each time and I can&#x27;t pick up on the depth of the fragrances. I even wrote an email to Auric Blends politely voicing concern. I understand perfume ingredients must be expensive, but &amp;#34;watering down&amp;#34; perfumes with carrier oil to make the batch more cost efficient is compromising the product. I, and I believe many of my fellow Auric Blends fans will agree, would be fine with a small price increase if it meant the perfumes could be concentrated again. I sincerely mean that, because I like this company.  The latest two I purchased are Sandalwood and Divine Opium. Sandalwood is woody and sweet. Divine Opium has similar notes to my favorite Black Opium but a little brighter. Like I said, they&#x27;re so weak that the full fragrance notes are hard to pick up on, and the scent fades quickly.</li>
            <li> a favorite even if it is not from Bangalore</li>
            <li> this fragrance oil was purchased for my husband--we were HOPING for SANDALWOOD scent--this is awfully powdery smelling--it&#x27;s nice, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but it&#x27;s only a HINT of sandalwood in the fragrance. I&#x27;m feeling really silly for having ordered 2. my husband does say that he likes it and he is wearing it and it mixes fine with his body chemistry, but still not what we were hoping for.  next time I&#x27;ll order from a local company or just go to a retail store--that way I smell the oil for myself--some things are hard to get right via ordering online only.</li>
            <li> This product was affordable, but doesn&#x27;t smell like sandalwood at all.  I was very disappointed, but I suppose you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Family is very happy using this blend of roll on perfume, as it&#x27;s an enjoyable sent. The seller had met my expectations and I would do business again with the seller.</li>
            <li> This is a light scent that has a very nice soft smell. Best sandalwood scent out there and very good price</li>
            <li> We use this oil to blend with a couple of other scents for something custom. You really can&#x27;t do this with just any oil. This stuff is great!</li>
            <li> This smells not even remotely close to sandalwood. I have been wearing sandalwood for years and recently have not been able to find it anywhere locally, but I struck out by purchasing this. Well, the search continues....</li>
            <li> This product was very disappointing to me.  The smell is light and does not have that musky smell of sandlewood.  It took a hot shower and lots of scrubing to remove the oil from my skin.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive my new roll on Sandalwood perfume this week. As soon as I got the package opened I was rolling it on myself. It smelled exactly like I had expected it to. It smells like Sandalwood, nothing else. If you want something musky and earthy, this is perfect!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and arrived in a timely manner!!</li>
            <li> do not like its scent- not true sandalwood to my nostrils....recommend the patchouli scent instead</li>
            <li> does not appear to be very good sandlewood</li>
            <li> This scent is wonderful. Not overpowering like others I have tried.  Its been on 6 hrs and still smells divine:-)</li>
            <li> The product seems weak, for I feel the perfume in the oil is minimal.  Possibly Sandalwood is not a good fragrance for this purpose. I will order again, but possibly with a more pungent variety.</li>
            <li> Got here quick. Smells sweeter than  I remember.</li>
            <li> I love this oil and have been using it for years. It has a really pleasant scent, that is never overpowering. The scent lasts awhile on your skin, and the little bottle itself lasts a long time, too! Great product!</li>
            <li> Love this classic scent in a handy roller bottle. Auric blends are always top notch. Love many of their blends.</li>
            <li> I have never tired roll on perfume oils before and I thought I would give it a try. This smell is warm and wonderful. All I need is a dab behind my ears, and on my wrists and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this perfume oil for years and have never had the problem I&#x27;m now having.  With my most recent order the roll-on function has stopped working and the perfume is not being dispensed from the bottle.  Basically, I have the product but it&#x27;s unusable!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about this scent.  It&#x27;s nice enough, it lasts and my husband absolutely loves it!  I like it well enough but it doesn&#x27;t smell much like sandalwood to me.  *shrug*  Then again, I&#x27;ve never smelled REAL sandal wood, only sandalwood scented products so maybe my idea of what it smells like is a bit off.</li>
            <li> I tried to like it.  Good shipping speed, good price, packaged well.  But it doesn&#x27;t smell like sandalwood to me, not even a tiny bit.  It smells very synthetic and just not good; too sickeningly sweet.  Sigh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I would like to mention that when it arrived the roller ball was broken - stuck inside the cap.  FYI - it is not returnable, to anyone thinking about ordering this.  I&#x27;ve emailed the seller to ask how they will make this right and am currently awaiting reply.</li>
            <li> Good product, I like the scent even if it&#x27;s not 100% sandalwood</li>
            <li> Nice light sandalwood oil for daily use as perfume. Not greasy or oily, but the scent lasts all day. One of my favorite beauty products.</li>
            <li> This went right in the garbage. Smells awful! If you&#x27;re looking for a true sandalwood perfume, look elsewhere. Cheap imitation that will burn your nose hairs right off</li>
            <li> This is a perfume OIL, so use a tiny dab of it, but I like the sandalwood scent &amp; it lasts the day &amp; sometimes longer. The same would go for other scents you might try; use a tiny dab at first until you know how it works on you.</li>
            <li> Should have listened to the reviewers who said this smells like baby powder and nothing like sandalwood.  Won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> This literally just smells like baby powder. I read all these reviews about how it was so musky and sexy and I was so jazzed to buy it and then I smelled like someone had just changed my diaper. I couldn&#x27;t wait to shower so I could get that smell off me. All day, I kept thinking there were babies around me, and I don&#x27;t even like babies, so it was no fun. It&#x27;s not a terrible smell, don&#x27;t get me wrong. In fact, it&#x27;s perfectly pleasant. But if I wanted to smell like baby powder, I&#x27;d just wear baby powder. I was trying to smell like sandalwood, and this is as far from it as you can get. What a bummer. What a waste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a different kind of sandlewood than I thought its light, breezy, and subtle. I like it!!! Would buy others</li>
            <li> Not as heady a fragrance as I expected</li>
            <li> It was shipped really fast and it was as described.  I gave it to my friend because (in my opinion) it can be worn by either sex.  It may just be my sense of smell, but it smells somewhat like baby powder and I&#x27;m not a fan of that smell (I DO like babies, just not baby powder smell), so I gave it to him and he likes it a lot.</li>
            <li> Have been searching for this product finally found it.  I love this perfume will be ordering more in the near future..</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t mean to give it 4 stars, can&#x27;t change it.    I&#x27;m glad this didn&#x27;t cost much with free shipping. This smells sort of like Love&#x27;s Baby Soft, basically just baby powder with a hint of sandalwood. Too childish for my taste.</li>
            <li> Arrive fast. I have been a fan of the Auric Blends Perfumes Oils for some time now. They last a very long time, and you don&#x27;t need to apply a bunch on to smell good for the whole day.</li>
            <li> This sandalwood is actually a blend that hints at being sandalwood. However, what ever it is blended with is very overpowering and floral. I had ordered this same thing several years ago and back then it smelled more like sandalwood. If you are looking for a true sandalwood scent. Skip this and look else where.</li>
            <li> Long lasting beautiful fragrance. Really smells like authentic sandalwood. Just a little dab lasts for hours. I have received many complements and recommend Auric Blends to all who ask. I really love it.</li>
            <li> Not the scent I associate with sandalwood.  Petrochemical scent.  Note in packaging listed it as hazardous waste, yet shipped USPS.  Not what I usually associate with organic either.</li>
            <li> I purchased the &#x27;Sandalwood&#x27; roll-on fragrance, and was sent &#x27;Aphrodesia&#x27; instead, which the seller corrected by sending me the correct item. I can barely tell the difference between the two scents though. They smell almost identical, and very Johnson &amp; Johnson baby oil like to me. I wonder if that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re using as a base for the scents. My nose is extremely sensitive, so I had a few other people close their eyes and smell each fragrance. Everyone came to the same conclusion. Needless to say, I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like sandalwood. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The sandalwood scent is awful.  Does not have a &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; smell at all.  This smells so strong of cheap perfume.  I can only wear oils because I am sensitive to perfumes, this gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> nice scent.  kinda sweet, not real natural smelling but pretty good.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Sandalwood scent and it definitely smells like baby powder even after it dries down... Specifically it smells like the &amp;#34;Baby Soft&amp;#34; perfume you can find for $3 at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> Lovely scent...just doesn&#x27;t last very long at all.</li>
            <li> Maybe this kind of thing is up to the individual, but this smelled horrible to me. I threw it away immediately. I usually love sandalwood anything, but this smelled to me like some sort of combination of Axe and baby powder.</li>
            <li> This oil didn&#x27;t smell anything LIKE sandalwood.  it smelled okay, but it wasn&#x27;t the true sandalwood fragrance I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use a lot. It is very strong at first. Has a strong powdery smell.</li>
            <li> This smells so good. SO good! I can&#x27;t even describe it.  The sandalwood oil is strong, though. A tiny big lasts all day. More than a drop is overpowering.</li>
