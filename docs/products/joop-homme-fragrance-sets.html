            <li>love the smell, its not too strong its perfect :)I could be smelling it all day, its seductive:)</li>

            <li>And it is exactly perfect, amazing and impressive cologne, it is last long....</li>
            <li>The scent lasted for more than 12 hours.  </li>
            <li>and I find the scent more feminine than manly.</li>
            <li>this is a sophisticated scent that will have woman &amp;#34;buzzin&amp;#34; around you like bees to honey.</li>
            <li>I love Amazon</li>
            <li>and I think it is the greatest online store, but I am going to go back to Walgreens, when it is time to buy Joop!</li>
            <li>I have been in using this fragrance since 1995, and I must admit it is still my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this on him.</li>
            <li>so glad I searched at amazon.</li>
            <li>Joop cologne is one of my favorite scents and i have used it for years.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t explain how many times I&#x27;ve been complimented.  </li>
            <li>when I dress in layers mellows out the strength and highlights more of the sweetness.</li>
            <li>Great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>- Girls Love it -</li>
            <li>And Amazon&#x27;s free delivery service!</li>
            <li>nothing can compare with the vanilla, woodsy, jasmine sandalwood scent :)</li>
            <li>My girl asked me to purchase this, telling me that the scent drove her nuts, and that she would not be able to keep her hands off me if I wore it.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m more discouraged that these items are sold as though they are authentic</li>
            <li>and they surely are not cause my nose and anyone elses for that matter don&#x27;t lie.</li>
            <li>I was pleased and would re-order from this vendor.</li>
            <li>the item as described, even better for me.  </li>
            <li>I love it on my husband.  </li>
            <li>Lovely scent.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Now, he always has this unique scents that is refreshing and nice.</li>
            <li>The smell is very sophisticated with a strong sweet musk scent that lasts ALL DAY.</li>
            <li>This cologne has a very pleasant smell, its long lasting and the price its excellent .</li>
            <li>More than one spray will make you smell as though you took a swim in a river full of Joop!.</li>
            <li>great fragance,&lt;br /&gt;i would totally recommend this amazing perfum.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and shipment was very fast!</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend every man and woman own this!  </li>
            <li>i would buy it again thanks for good price</li>
            <li>it aint broke don&#x27;t fix it&amp;#34;, so I stay with what has gotten me great results.&amp;#34; All of my girlfriends absolutely love this cologne, and I get countless compliments on it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to buy a gift for my Dad - just get him a Joop.</li>
            <li>Not as strong.</li>
            <li>Decent deal at a fair price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way too strong n musky for my taste</li>
            <li>I love Joop very much and I am glad that you had</li>
            <li>It has a semi-dark, but sweet smell to it, which gives it a very unique scent.</li>
            <li>The product was fine.  </li>
            <li>Price was fine as well.  </li>
            <li>The price was fantastic.</li>
            <li>This Whole Process was very easy.</li>
            <li>and you will be good for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap enough</li>
            <li>If you like the smell of clean clothes aka Tide with Bleach.</li>
            <li>It smells like one chocolate covered cherry got tossed into a bathtub filled with maraschino cherries in that super sweet syrup...</li>
            <li>The price point was just right!</li>
            <li>Its too sweet like vanilla.  </li>
            <li>I also like cool water, hugo boss and gio</li>
            <li>Sweet.  </li>
            <li>A little bit is all it takes, which is a good thing!  </li>
            <li>stuff is too sweet, too feminine, too complex,&lt;br /&gt;and gives me a mild headache.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also asked other women about this cologne, and most agree this is one of the best scents they&#x27;ve sampled on a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is strong, but it&#x27;s a scent that is distinctive and complex and that I instantly enjoyed.  </li>
            <li>Product was shipped and received quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different colognes and I must say this one has one of my favorite scents off all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found another cologne worthy of replacing it.  </li>
            <li>Everyone wants to smell like a Toilette, so I strongly recommend this cologne.</li>
            <li>Came exactly as described, looking like I got it from the department store shelf!  </li>
            <li>This cologne has a nice quick dry-down time and will last all day without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>Its exactly worth you paid....</li>
            <li>This cologne is heads and tails above the rest of the colognes I own.  </li>
            <li>this is even better than the original and complements come regularly..</li>
            <li>I was just at a gentleman&#x27;s club the other day, and this stripper was all over me telling me how good I smell.</li>
            <li>My wife would have to put her nose right on my skin or clothing to smell it.  </li>
            <li>but, the cologne I bought doesn&#x27;t seem quite right.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a high quality cologne made in France, not some cheap stuff made here in America or elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>MUST BUY  SMELLS GREAT  SMALL BUT SMELLS</li>
            <li>The item was very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>thanks amazon!</li>
            <li>Every woman I&#x27;ve met loves the scent even if it isn&#x27;t necessarily her favorite.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>This is the first time, I purchased JOOP, it is recommended by my son in law.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend love this product and its the only cologne he used.</li>
            <li>I have an old bottle of the original.</li>
            <li>I really dread even using the stuff now and will probably most likely give it away to someone.</li>
            <li>, it seems rather potent and lasts all day long.  </li>
            <li>Worth the little extra, for sure :)</li>
            <li>The scent is very unique and stay for a long while.</li>
            <li>I discovered that the smell requires a certain layer of clothing.</li>
            <li>The price for this large size is unbeatable.  </li>
            <li>The scent is not as strong/deep/complex as the real cologne.  </li>
            <li>I was very disapointed.</li>
            <li>The product from this seller appears not to be the real thing</li>
            <li>really paid off.</li>
            <li>The product arrived on time, very well packed.</li>
            <li>I highly recomend Joop!</li>
            <li>really special.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>AND THE LADIES REALLY LIKE IT.  </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t spray too much.</li>
            <li>After using this, I am really become its lover.</li>
            <li>after reading rave reviews online and trying to secure a bottle for months i finally got a bottle today and all i can is, freaking yuck!!!</li>
            <li>much like that bathroom hand soap they have at rest areas and truck stops...</li>
            <li>Modist smell is very pleasent .</li>
            <li>and i must say, it came fast,</li>
            <li>im very dissapointed of buying perfume from here because i bought 2 and cant even use it</li>
            <li>If anyone wants a video I can upload it so everybody can see the color difference.</li>
            <li>Price was better than any other comparison.</li>
            <li>Out of all my purchases from other companies, this one arrived first.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks :)</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t smell like the original not even close and of course it last about 10 minutes!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simply a nice smelling and long lasting cologne.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is also usually priced reasonably which is always a nice thing in a world of high price retail.</li>
            <li>The bottle is brand new and the sprayer works as you&#x27;d expect it to!</li>
            <li>I recommend highly.</li>
            <li>Initially when I got my first sample of Joop!</li>
            <li>This very large 4.2 ounce bottle will last quite awhile!  </li>
            <li>directly on the skin, as the scent is strong enough to cover up your natural scent completely (scents should complement your natural smell not replace</li>
            <li>This is the same cologne which I first caught a whiff of as a teenager in high school-</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommended, fellas (and to you ladies wishing to purchase a new scent for your man).</li>
            <li>It was shipped in new retail packaging, as described.</li>
            <li>My bf tried this new cologne in attempt to change his style up</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t a big fan, it simply didn&#x27;t fit my style.</li>
            <li>Very masculine scent, matches my style.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The money I saved going cheap buying thru Amazon at a discount was not worth it.</li>
            <li>Strong, so a little goes a LOOOOOOOONG way.  </li>
            <li>Even though the scent is similar when you first use it, however in a very short time it dissipates and actually has somewhat of a mild stench that remains.</li>
            <li>Amazon sells it for FAR less and will ship it for free.  </li>
            <li>It reminded me of perfumes wore by old women.  </li>
            <li>It never gets old.</li>
            <li>It got here in just a few days with the free shipping</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyhow, My hubby wears it (i wear the womens) and just WOW is all I can</li>
            <li>has been a long-time standby for me going on nearly 20 years now.</li>
            <li>Loud.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they renamed this Willy Wonka for Men.  </li>
            <li>The manufacturer of this product has changed the formula when compared to the old.</li>
            <li>, I will keep buying from old and trustable supplier.</li>
            <li>Every time my husband uses it, he says: \\&quot;This is not the original one, it smells different and does not last the same, please don&#x27;t buy it on Internet</li>
            <li>Unless the manufacturer changes back to the original formula dont waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with this amazing smelling cologne with a smell that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>you cant barely smell it...</li>
            <li>or it&#x27;s old and past its useful life.  </li>
            <li>A little too strong for me - and personally not masculine enough.</li>
            <li>Its an ok everyday casual clean sent.</li>
            <li>Product was received much sooner the expected, thank you, I need one extra Christmas present and this helped.</li>
            <li>Last a long time, a little goes a long way and it&#x27;s a very intriguing scent.  </li>
            <li>The ONLY Downside is that its pretty Expensive; But worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s large enough to be used everyday.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and I find the scent more feminine than manly.</li>
            <li> this is a sophisticated scent that will have woman &amp;#34;buzzin&amp;#34; around you like bees to honey.</li>
            <li> I love Amazon</li>
            <li> and I think it is the greatest online store, but I am going to go back to Walgreens, when it is time to buy Joop!</li>
            <li> I have been in using this fragrance since 1995, and I must admit it is still my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this on him.</li>
            <li> so glad I searched at amazon.</li>
            <li> Joop cologne is one of my favorite scents and i have used it for years.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t explain how many times I&#x27;ve been complimented.  </li>
            <li> when I dress in layers mellows out the strength and highlights more of the sweetness.</li>
            <li> Great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> - Girls Love it -</li>
            <li> And Amazon&#x27;s free delivery service!</li>
            <li> nothing can compare with the vanilla, woodsy, jasmine sandalwood scent :)</li>
            <li> My girl asked me to purchase this, telling me that the scent drove her nuts, and that she would not be able to keep her hands off me if I wore it.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m more discouraged that these items are sold as though they are authentic</li>
            <li> and they surely are not cause my nose and anyone elses for that matter don&#x27;t lie.</li>
            <li> I was pleased and would re-order from this vendor.</li>
            <li> the item as described, even better for me.  </li>
            <li> I love it on my husband.  </li>
            <li> Lovely scent.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Now, he always has this unique scents that is refreshing and nice.</li>
            <li> The smell is very sophisticated with a strong sweet musk scent that lasts ALL DAY.</li>
            <li> This cologne has a very pleasant smell, its long lasting and the price its excellent .</li>
            <li> More than one spray will make you smell as though you took a swim in a river full of Joop!.</li>
            <li> great fragance,&lt;br /&gt;i would totally recommend this amazing perfum.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and shipment was very fast!</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend every man and woman own this!  </li>
            <li> i would buy it again thanks for good price</li>
            <li> it aint broke don&#x27;t fix it&amp;#34;, so I stay with what has gotten me great results.&amp;#34; All of my girlfriends absolutely love this cologne, and I get countless compliments on it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to buy a gift for my Dad - just get him a Joop.</li>
            <li> Not as strong.</li>
            <li> Decent deal at a fair price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too strong n musky for my taste</li>
            <li> I love Joop very much and I am glad that you had</li>
            <li> It has a semi-dark, but sweet smell to it, which gives it a very unique scent.</li>
            <li> The product was fine.  </li>
            <li> Price was fine as well.  </li>
            <li> The price was fantastic.</li>
            <li> This Whole Process was very easy.</li>
            <li> and you will be good for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap enough</li>
            <li> If you like the smell of clean clothes aka Tide with Bleach.</li>
            <li> It smells like one chocolate covered cherry got tossed into a bathtub filled with maraschino cherries in that super sweet syrup...</li>
            <li> The price point was just right!</li>
            <li> Its too sweet like vanilla.  </li>
            <li> I also like cool water, hugo boss and gio</li>
            <li> Sweet.  </li>
            <li> A little bit is all it takes, which is a good thing!  </li>
            <li> stuff is too sweet, too feminine, too complex,&lt;br /&gt;and gives me a mild headache.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also asked other women about this cologne, and most agree this is one of the best scents they&#x27;ve sampled on a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is strong, but it&#x27;s a scent that is distinctive and complex and that I instantly enjoyed.  </li>
            <li> Product was shipped and received quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different colognes and I must say this one has one of my favorite scents off all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found another cologne worthy of replacing it.  </li>
            <li> Everyone wants to smell like a Toilette, so I strongly recommend this cologne.</li>
            <li> Came exactly as described, looking like I got it from the department store shelf!  </li>
            <li> This cologne has a nice quick dry-down time and will last all day without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> Its exactly worth you paid....</li>
            <li> This cologne is heads and tails above the rest of the colognes I own.  </li>
            <li> this is even better than the original and complements come regularly..</li>
            <li> I was just at a gentleman&#x27;s club the other day, and this stripper was all over me telling me how good I smell.</li>
            <li> My wife would have to put her nose right on my skin or clothing to smell it.  </li>
            <li> but, the cologne I bought doesn&#x27;t seem quite right.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a high quality cologne made in France, not some cheap stuff made here in America or elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> MUST BUY  SMELLS GREAT  SMALL BUT SMELLS</li>
            <li> The item was very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> thanks amazon!</li>
            <li> Every woman I&#x27;ve met loves the scent even if it isn&#x27;t necessarily her favorite.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> This is the first time, I purchased JOOP, it is recommended by my son in law.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend love this product and its the only cologne he used.</li>
            <li> I have an old bottle of the original.</li>
            <li> I really dread even using the stuff now and will probably most likely give it away to someone.</li>
            <li> , it seems rather potent and lasts all day long.  </li>
            <li> Worth the little extra, for sure :)</li>
            <li> The scent is very unique and stay for a long while.</li>
            <li> I discovered that the smell requires a certain layer of clothing.</li>
            <li> The price for this large size is unbeatable.  </li>
            <li> The scent is not as strong/deep/complex as the real cologne.  </li>
            <li> I was very disapointed.</li>
            <li> The product from this seller appears not to be the real thing</li>
            <li> really paid off.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time, very well packed.</li>
            <li> I highly recomend Joop!</li>
            <li> really special.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> AND THE LADIES REALLY LIKE IT.  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t spray too much.</li>
            <li> After using this, I am really become its lover.</li>
            <li> after reading rave reviews online and trying to secure a bottle for months i finally got a bottle today and all i can is, freaking yuck!!!</li>
            <li> much like that bathroom hand soap they have at rest areas and truck stops...</li>
            <li> Modist smell is very pleasent .</li>
            <li> and i must say, it came fast,</li>
            <li> im very dissapointed of buying perfume from here because i bought 2 and cant even use it</li>
            <li> If anyone wants a video I can upload it so everybody can see the color difference.</li>
            <li> Price was better than any other comparison.</li>
            <li> Out of all my purchases from other companies, this one arrived first.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks :)</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t smell like the original not even close and of course it last about 10 minutes!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply a nice smelling and long lasting cologne.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is also usually priced reasonably which is always a nice thing in a world of high price retail.</li>
            <li> The bottle is brand new and the sprayer works as you&#x27;d expect it to!</li>
            <li> I recommend highly.</li>
            <li> Initially when I got my first sample of Joop!</li>
            <li> This very large 4.2 ounce bottle will last quite awhile!  </li>
            <li> directly on the skin, as the scent is strong enough to cover up your natural scent completely (scents should complement your natural smell not replace</li>
            <li> This is the same cologne which I first caught a whiff of as a teenager in high school-</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommended, fellas (and to you ladies wishing to purchase a new scent for your man).</li>
            <li> It was shipped in new retail packaging, as described.</li>
            <li> My bf tried this new cologne in attempt to change his style up</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a big fan, it simply didn&#x27;t fit my style.</li>
            <li> Very masculine scent, matches my style.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> The money I saved going cheap buying thru Amazon at a discount was not worth it.</li>
            <li> Strong, so a little goes a LOOOOOOOONG way.  </li>
            <li> Even though the scent is similar when you first use it, however in a very short time it dissipates and actually has somewhat of a mild stench that remains.</li>
            <li> Amazon sells it for FAR less and will ship it for free.  </li>
            <li> It reminded me of perfumes wore by old women.  </li>
            <li> It never gets old.</li>
            <li> It got here in just a few days with the free shipping</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyhow, My hubby wears it (i wear the womens) and just WOW is all I can</li>
            <li> has been a long-time standby for me going on nearly 20 years now.</li>
            <li> Loud.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they renamed this Willy Wonka for Men.  </li>
            <li> The manufacturer of this product has changed the formula when compared to the old.</li>
            <li> , I will keep buying from old and trustable supplier.</li>
            <li> Every time my husband uses it, he says: \\&quot;This is not the original one, it smells different and does not last the same, please don&#x27;t buy it on Internet</li>
            <li> Unless the manufacturer changes back to the original formula dont waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with this amazing smelling cologne with a smell that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> you cant barely smell it...</li>
            <li> or it&#x27;s old and past its useful life.  </li>
            <li> A little too strong for me - and personally not masculine enough.</li>
            <li> Its an ok everyday casual clean sent.</li>
            <li> Product was received much sooner the expected, thank you, I need one extra Christmas present and this helped.</li>
            <li> Last a long time, a little goes a long way and it&#x27;s a very intriguing scent.  </li>
            <li> The ONLY Downside is that its pretty Expensive; But worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s large enough to be used everyday.</li>
            <li> it doesnt last long  but its a buy for me</li>
            <li> Spry evenly  for pleasent &amp; long lasting smell</li>
            <li> In addition it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> if you are going to wear a single layer of clothing, such as a sleeveless shirt or t-shirt.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but needless to say, she was correct :).&lt;br</li>
            <li> is to apply a &#x60;single&#x27; spray on your under shirt and then proceed to put on your dress shirt, sweater, sports cost or jacket.</li>
            <li> Not watered down or anything, for the price, this is definitely a</li>
            <li> Previous colognes I&#x27;ve bought didn&#x27;t seem to last all day.  </li>
            <li> little later her girl friend came over to me and said that i smell \\&quot;Yummy and would like to taste you!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for men in late 30&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble finding it for the past several years as the big stores (Macy&#x27;s, etc.) stopped carrying it.  </li>
            <li> I will not by Joop on Amazon or other online site again.</li>
            <li> He loves it and wont use any other.</li>
            <li> i think is imitation...</li>
            <li> The new Joop is worthless and does not have the lasting fragrance of the old.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s been my gift to him for the last 6 years at least.</li>
            <li> It is surely a fake product and not the real thing.</li>
            <li> It seems watered down.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes when ordering online we have received imitation JOOP!</li>
            <li> I knew what I was getting into when I bought this classic blind.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is good....makes my heart beat a little faster when I smell it.  </li>
            <li> It was a waste of money - don&#x27;t waste yours.</li>
            <li> , I wasted my money, don&#x27;t waste yours.</li>
            <li> plus I didn&#x27;t waste any gas.</li>
            <li> The font on the bottle is wrong, the scent lasts only a little while, and the bottle is poor quality compared to the last I bought in a department store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usually over twice the price at any department store, maybe more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Joop is definitely not \\&quot;girly\\&quot; (disregard the purple-colored bottle/liquid) or for the faint of heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure where this stuff comes from.</li>
            <li> You are not able to return it to Amazon once you have it.</li>
            <li> , I usually stock up with this product because I use it every day</li>
            <li> Never got a complaint about it either.</li>
            <li> Nothing to complaint about.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I have never given a bad review such as this ever.</li>
            <li> I keep thinking he&#x27;ll get tired of Joop</li>
            <li> Women hide behind me.</li>
            <li> I guess because I take the train to work everyday and people stink really badly.</li>
            <li> I found it online at a random website, ordered &amp; it turned out to be counterfeit/fake.  </li>
            <li> This is a fake Joop.</li>
            <li> It is getting quite expensive but is a bit cheaper on line than in retail stores.</li>
            <li> Even the title on the bottle seems wrong.  </li>
            <li> so sad.....</li>
            <li> I was wrong!</li>
            <li> so sick.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> You will be extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Joop for years. I&#x27;ve had trouble finding it for the past several years as the big stores (Macy&#x27;s, etc.) stopped carrying it.  I found it online at a random website, ordered &amp; it turned out to be counterfeit/fake.  I then found it on Amazon &amp; picked up 3 bottles figuring I could trust amazon.  Mistake.  I now have several bottles of counterfeit/fake Joop.  The scent is not as strong/deep/complex as the real cologne.  In addition it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  It was a waste of money - don&#x27;t waste yours.</li>
            <li> Have liked this for years, has a very nice smell to it. Amazon seems to have the best price for this size when it is time to order.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Joop for about 10 years, and decided to buy my next bottle from Amazon. I was very disapointed. This is a fake Joop. The font on the bottle is wrong, the scent lasts only a little while, and the bottle is poor quality compared to the last I bought in a department store. Don&#x27;t buy, Amazon will not accept returns on this item, I wasted my money, don&#x27;t waste yours. Will never buy fragrances online again.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  I have been using Joop for 12 years.  The product from this seller appears not to be the real thing or it&#x27;s old and past its useful life.  It did not exhibit the fragrance power you expect from a regular store bought bottle of Joop.  I will not by Joop on Amazon or other online site again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27. I purchased this perfume because of the good reviews I found here.  The scent lasted for more than 12 hours.  I got headache and I find the scent more feminine than manly. Its too sweet like vanilla.  It reminded me of perfumes wore by old women.  I used this once and won&#x27;t be using this again.  I&#x27;ll just give this perfume to somebody else.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this cologne, and this cologne only since 1997. I come from the school of &amp;#34;if it aint broke don&#x27;t fix it&amp;#34;, so I stay with what has gotten me great results.&amp;#34; All of my girlfriends absolutely love this cologne, and I get countless compliments on it. I was just at a gentleman&#x27;s club the other day, and this stripper was all over me telling me how good I smell. No I wasn&#x27;t paying her either, and I already got her number, so she wasn&#x27;t just telling me that to get a lap dance. Lol. All jokes aside this is a sophisticated scent that will have woman &amp;#34;buzzin&amp;#34; around you like bees to honey. I am scared to even try another cologne, because I feel like I would be cheating on my joop! That is how reliable, and good it has been to me over the years.</li>
            <li> The product was fine.  I like this brand and have used it for years.  Price was fine as well.  However, as I pay for Amazon Prime each year and this item is listed as Prime eligible, I was QUITE displeased to get it 6, yes SIX, days later!  What&#x27;s up with that Amazon!?</li>
            <li> This Whole Process was very easy. I got a confirmation saying that my order was being processed within about an hour of my purchase, and the product delivered on schedule in Great Shape. I&#x27;ll be Ordering again in the future. JOOP is a Great Smelling Cologne. But I actually ordered it as an Xmas gift for a Woman. She loves this stuff. The ONLY Downside is that its pretty Expensive; But worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne from Amazon, thinking I was buying the same product I used to buy from pharmacies and departments stores. I was wrong! The product is definitely not the same. Every time my husband uses it, he says: \\&quot;This is not the original one, it smells different and does not last the same, please don&#x27;t buy it on Internet never again.\\&quot;  I love Amazon and I think it is the greatest online store, but I am going to go back to Walgreens, when it is time to buy Joop! again.</li>
            <li> I have been in using this fragrance since 1995, and I must admit it is still my favorite cologne. It has a semi-dark, but sweet smell to it, which gives it a very unique scent. No matter how antidotal this following might be, just about every woman I have been around always seems to like the way Joop! smells. This fragrance is also usually priced reasonably which is always a nice thing in a world of high price retail.</li>
            <li> My favorite mens cologne! It&#x27;s such a unique&lt;br /&gt;scent. I bought it for my husband and he wears&lt;br /&gt;it every day. I had to tell him not to overdo it&lt;br /&gt;with two sprays though, as the scent lasts all day&lt;br /&gt;best price for joop anywhere I&#x27;ve checked.</li>
            <li> purchased Joop for my husband for our anniversary. I love the smell of this on him. runs about 45.00 or more in stores great deal at 25.00 plus I had a gift card.  so glad I searched at amazon. really paid off. thanks amazon!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to buy a gift for my Dad - just get him a Joop. He loves it and wont use any other.</li>
            <li> Product was shipped and received quickly.  Price was better than any other comparison. I have just started ordering on amazon, so am always hesitant with online purchases.  Out of all my purchases from other companies, this one arrived first.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks :)</li>
            <li> Joop cologne is one of my favorite scents and i have used it for years. It is getting quite expensive but is a bit cheaper on line than in retail stores.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase. I saved $20.00 buying thru Amazon plus I didn&#x27;t waste any gas.</li>
            <li> This is by FAR the best smell I have ever come across in my 24 years in this world!  I have been trying to find out the name of it for about 5 years now,  and someone finally told me!  I want to bathe in it!  What an AMAZING price!  I HIGHLY recommend every man and woman own this!  I think woman should wear it too!</li>
            <li> This is one of the  most pleasant and soothing colognes on the market. Can&#x27;t explain how many times I&#x27;ve been complimented.  I recommend highly.</li>
            <li> Everyone wants to smell like a Toilette, so I strongly recommend this cologne. Quality product. Will order again when this supply runs out.</li>
            <li> My husband cannot get enough of this cologne! The newer fragrances just don&#x27;t cut it. The price point was just right! Will order again!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrid! My husband bought this and it makes me so so sick. It smells like baby powder and nastiness! I hate it.</li>
            <li> I like great perfume and specially being noticed by my lovely life partner. It last all day and noticeable everywhere. I get a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> Initially when I got my first sample of Joop! I wasn&#x27;t a big fan, it simply didn&#x27;t fit my style. Sometime later after I received a Christmas gift of Joop! cologne and aftershave I discovered that the smell requires a certain layer of clothing. The smell is very sophisticated with a strong sweet musk scent that lasts ALL DAY. I would not recommend applying Joop! if you are going to wear a single layer of clothing, such as a sleeveless shirt or t-shirt. Nor would I recommend applying Joop! directly on the skin, as the scent is strong enough to cover up your natural scent completely (scents should complement your natural smell not replace it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The art of wearing Joop! is to apply a &#x60;single&#x27; spray on your under shirt and then proceed to put on your dress shirt, sweater, sports cost or jacket. There is no reason what-so-ever to apply more than one spray of Joop!. More than one spray will make you smell as though you took a swim in a river full of Joop!. And over scented guys aren&#x27;t a very big turn-on to the opposite sex. I find that using Joop! when I dress in layers mellows out the strength and highlights more of the sweetness.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different colognes and I must say this one has one of my favorite scents off all.  I also like cool water, hugo boss and gio but I would recommend this one over all of them.  It is not an overpowering smelling cologne but it lasts all day with just two or three sprays and I get complimented all the time on how great I smell when wearing this.</li>
            <li> I have used this cologne maybe for 10 years. And it is exactly perfect, amazing and impressive cologne, it is last long.... Its exactly worth you paid.... Dont think a lot on it, just buy it...</li>
            <li> Great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This stuff is good....makes my heart beat a little faster when I smell it.  Strong, so a little goes a LOOOOOOOONG way.  Worth the little extra, for sure :)</li>
            <li> A girl friend said she likes JOOP, so i put on a few sprays that the men&#x27;s room attendant had in \\&quot;Da Club\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When i returned by her side she said that i smelled great, and then she kissed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little later her girl friend came over to me and said that i smell \\&quot;Yummy and would like to taste you!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is too sweet, too feminine, too complex,&lt;br /&gt;and gives me a mild headache.  BUT...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Hate It - Girls Love it - So i wear it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this product both 1-Star and 5-Stars.</li>
            <li> A little too strong for me - and personally not masculine enough. To each his own though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product for the price. Thats a LOT of cologne!</li>
            <li> He loves it and he smells really good!  lol  I keep thinking he&#x27;ll get tired of Joop but it&#x27;s been my gift to him for the last 6 years at least.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time, very well packed. I highly recomend Joop! By Joop! For men.This is the third time I order this Eau De Toilette.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Joop! for almost 20 years. It never gets old. Very masculine scent, matches my style. Highly recommended for men in late 30&#x27;s! And Amazon&#x27;s free delivery service! Wow! I got mine in two days! Thank you! Alex</li>
            <li> Joop! cologne sold on Amazon is an amazing bargain.  The price for this large size is unbeatable.  It&#x27;s usually over twice the price at any department store, maybe more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like the smell of Joop! and plan on buying it, it is FOOLISH to get it anywhere else.  Amazon sells it for FAR less and will ship it for free.  It got here in just a few days with the free shipping option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a high quality cologne made in France, not some cheap stuff made here in America or elsewhere.  Previous colognes I&#x27;ve bought didn&#x27;t seem to last all day.  My wife would have to put her nose right on my skin or clothing to smell it.  Not with Joop!, it seems rather potent and lasts all day long.  A little bit is all it takes, which is a good thing!  This very large 4.2 ounce bottle will last quite awhile!  Don&#x27;t bathe in the stuff, just one squirt maybe two and you will be good for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap enough you can get it as a gift and feel like you gave them something really special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with this amazing smelling cologne with a smell that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This is the same cologne which I first caught a whiff of as a teenager in high school- we had a school coach that wore it all the time! I finally asked him the name of it and he said \\&quot;Yoop\\&quot; pronounced with a Y which would be the french spelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, for years and years I searched for \\&quot;YOOP\\&quot; cologne and finally came across Joop!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a scent that I can not describe, and anytime I smell a male wearing it- oh my gosh it is like I want to chase &amp; follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, My hubby wears it (i wear the womens) and just WOW is all I can say-- nothing can compare with the vanilla, woodsy, jasmine sandalwood scent :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything and I like this the best. Never got a complaint about it either. I like to smell good. I guess because I take the train to work everyday and people stink really badly. So it&#x27;s my way of protesting. Seriously. It&#x27;s a battle of smells. Women hide behind me. LOL</li>
            <li> Excellent cologne, excellent service</li>
            <li> everyone loves this scent</li>
            <li> my purchase was just as promised. The price was fantastic. the product arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Last a long time, a little goes a long way and it&#x27;s a very intriguing scent.  The girlies love it!</li>
            <li> This cologne has a nice quick dry-down time and will last all day without being overpowering. All it takes it one spritz and it even works applied to clothing. Every woman I&#x27;ve met loves the scent even if it isn&#x27;t necessarily her favorite. JOOP! has been a long-time standby for me going on nearly 20 years now. It&#x27;s simply a nice smelling and long lasting cologne.</li>
            <li> GREAT SERVICE &amp; GREAT PRODUCT, THANKS</li>
            <li> This cologne is heads and tails above the rest of the colognes I own.  My girl asked me to purchase this, telling me that the scent drove her nuts, and that she would not be able to keep her hands off me if I wore it.  I was skeptical at first, but needless to say, she was correct :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also asked other women about this cologne, and most agree this is one of the best scents they&#x27;ve sampled on a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is strong, but it&#x27;s a scent that is distinctive and complex and that I instantly enjoyed.  This Joop is definitely not \\&quot;girly\\&quot; (disregard the purple-colored bottle/liquid) or for the faint of heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended, fellas (and to you ladies wishing to purchase a new scent for your man).</li>
            <li> This cologne has a very pleasant smell, its long lasting and the price its excellent . I will be purchasing more,highly recomended it, very happy with my purchased. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I knew what I was getting into when I bought this classic blind.  Sweet.  Loud.  Chick Magnet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they renamed this Willy Wonka for Men.  It smells like one chocolate covered cherry got tossed into a bathtub filled with maraschino cherries in that super sweet syrup... and you have to find it with your mouth, while blindfolded to spend the night with Salma Hayek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The girls YOU will get may not look like Salma, so you might want to keep that blindfold handy.</li>
            <li> I have loved the smell of this cologne for years. It didn&#x27;t hurt that a beautiful chick told me that she loved my cologne when I was in college. We still talk every now and then.</li>
            <li> this is even better than the original and complements come regularly.. i would buy it again thanks for good price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure but, the cologne I bought doesn&#x27;t seem quite right.  Even the title on the bottle seems wrong.  Shouldn&#x27;t it say \\&quot;eue de toilet\\&quot; on the front?  Or something like that.  It seems watered down.  Not as strong.</li>
            <li> MUST BUY  SMELLS GREAT  SMALL BUT SMELLS AWESOME&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY IT  I RECOMMENDED  but buy one thats bigger it doesnt last long  but its a buy for me</li>
            <li> I love Joop very much and I am glad that you had it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Glenn</li>
            <li> Decent deal at a fair price</li>
            <li> I have never given a bad review such as this ever. I would like to discourage anyone to buy this cologne. It is surely a fake product and not the real thing. Even though the scent is similar when you first use it, however in a very short time it dissipates and actually has somewhat of a mild stench that remains. I&#x27;ve even had friends try to pick up on the scent and they couldn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m not sure where this stuff comes from. You are not able to return it to Amazon once you have it. I bought Joop and Jean Paul Gaultier. These were a trade marks in my arsenal for leaving there tracks for weeks into my clothes if I just hung them on the hanger. The money I saved going cheap buying thru Amazon at a discount was not worth it. I really dread even using the stuff now and will probably most likely give it away to someone. I think I&#x27;m more discouraged that these items are sold as though they are authentic and they surely are not cause my nose and anyone elses for that matter don&#x27;t lie.</li>
            <li> JOOP IS MY FAVORITE,,,IT SMELLS SO GOOOOD AND THE LADIES REALLY LIKE IT.  &amp;#34;OH! DAN YOU SMELL SOOO GOOOOD&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;YEP..BABIE, IT&#x27;S JOOP&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The item was very reasonably priced. It came in great time and the product was REAL JOOP! Sometimes when ordering online we have received imitation JOOP! I was pleased and would re-order from this vendor.</li>
            <li> Product was received much sooner the expected, thank you, I need one extra Christmas present and this helped. It was shipped in new retail packaging, as described. I would buy from this vender again, as well I&#x27;ve bookmarked them</li>
            <li> Some reviews said musky in a european sort of way, what ever that means. All I know is it smells good and people notice it in a nice way.</li>
            <li> Great buy for sure! Smells amazing and shipment was very fast! I would definately recommend this to anyone I know!</li>
            <li> What can I say, I&#x27;ve loved this scent for years.  I&#x27;ve never found another cologne worthy of replacing it.  It smells not at all like aftershave or alcohol.</li>
            <li> Nothing to complaint about. the item as described, even better for me.  great fragance,&lt;br /&gt;i would totally recommend this amazing perfum.</li>
            <li> My bf tried this new cologne in attempt to change his style up and I must say it is one of the nastiest colognes I&#x27;ve ever smelled. My stomach churned and I got dizzy everytime I gig a wiff I gagged. It&#x27;s way too strong n musky for my taste</li>
            <li> If you like the smell of clean clothes aka Tide with Bleach. Than this is the sent for you. I only wear it just to go outside and goof around it. Its an ok everyday casual clean sent. Just don&#x27;t spray too much. Its very strong.</li>
            <li> Great buy on a Great product.</li>
            <li> This is a great cologne...I love it on my husband.  Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I have an old bottle of the original. The manufacturer of this product has changed the formula when compared to the old. The new Joop is worthless and does not have the lasting fragrance of the old. Unless the manufacturer changes back to the original formula dont waste your money on this product. You will be extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is the first time, I purchased JOOP, it is recommended by my son in law. After using this, I am really become its lover.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s girlfriend had purchased it for him and I noticed how great he smelled, so I got some for my husband.  Lovely scent.</li>
            <li> Only perfume my husband wears that constantly people comment on and ask the name.</li>
            <li> after reading rave reviews online and trying to secure a bottle for months i finally got a bottle today and all i can is, freaking yuck!!! smells horrible and way to much like that bathroom hand soap they have at rest areas and truck stops...i am now out almost $25 for the smallest bottle that i wouldn&#x27;t even spray on my dog...</li>
            <li> muy buena,esta fragancia siempre ne ha gustado,es especial para usarla noctunamente,y estoy muy contento por haberla adquirido a un buen precio</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s large enough to be used everyday. Modist smell is very pleasent . Spry evenly  for pleasent &amp; long lasting smell</li>
            <li> I just bought this and i must say, it came fast, great packaging and the scent is spot on. Not watered down or anything, for the price, this is definitely a MUST BUY. 1 squirt on each wrist and your good. This is very strong, so dont overdue it with the squirts.</li>
            <li> I love Joop!  Been wearing it for years and always get compliments</li>
            <li> my husband loves this brand has been using it forever ...gets a lot of compliment from his friends and co workers .</li>
            <li> I have always loved this scent. Great price!!! Bought this for my husband for Christmas He smells great with this on.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend love this product and its the only cologne he used. The scent is very unique and stay for a long while. Now, he always has this unique scents that is refreshing and nice. Love it.</li>
            <li> bought this for my husbands birthday. love the smell, its not too strong its perfect :)I could be smelling it all day, its seductive:)</li>
            <li> Came exactly as described, looking like I got it from the department store shelf!  The bottle is brand new and the sprayer works as you&#x27;d expect it to!</li>
            <li> this perfume doesnt last on the cloth.....you cant barely smell it...i think is imitation...im very dissapointed of buying perfume from here because i bought 2 and cant even use it</li>
            <li> Even before I opened I noticed the color was different! anyway once opened it is dissolved on water or something like this, it doesn&#x27;t smell like the original not even close and of course it last about 10 minutes!, I usually stock up with this product because I use it every day and I always buy it with the after shave package from another supplier here in Amazon and always good, I will keep buying from old and trustable supplier. If anyone wants a video I can upload it so everybody can see the color difference. I thought I already wrote a review but I could not find it so here it is again. so sad.....</li>
            <li> Excellent perfume, longlasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> This stuff it soo nice every time I put it on I get someone telling me how good I smell ladies love it to lol Superfast shipping great product would buy from again plus the price was right..</li>
            <li> One of the necessity fragrances</li>
