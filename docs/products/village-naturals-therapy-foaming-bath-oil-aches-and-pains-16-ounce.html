            <li>This is my favorite body wash.  </li>

            <li>The scent is not the norm for me, but I have fallen in love with it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product because you can use it as both a foaming bath and as a wash.</li>
            <li>I love love love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it and love how it soothes my aching muscles when i use it.</li>
            <li>The fragrance just makes me feel better.</li>
            <li>I love Village Naturals products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This helps me sleep better at night if I soak about an hour before bed time.</li>
            <li>and she always has a better night sleep after this</li>
            <li>This scent is my favorite scent in the world.</li>
            <li>Love the eucalyptus oil fragrance.</li>
            <li>Love it for after runs.</li>
            <li>Such a great product!!</li>
            <li>So lovely I got some for my mohter.</li>
            <li>I love the bath oil that also bubbles.  </li>
            <li>I just bought 4 more bottles.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes so many bubbles.</li>
            <li>This is favorite of mine.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff in my bath.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of eucalyptus and spearmint.  </li>
            <li>Use it with the Aches and pains lotion to make your muscles relax and enable a better day or night.</li>
            <li>It is very effective as a body wash, not so much as a bubble bath.</li>
            <li>It is so cool and refreshing!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very clean, wake you up menthol aroma.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good bath oil.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for a long soak in the tub after crossfit</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not some incredible therapy like it claims, but it&#x27;s nice, refreshing, and doesn&#x27;t leave a filmy residue like so many other washes do.</li>
            <li>As far as penetrating the skin and relaxing the muscles, the hot water of the bath does a better job, but the potent aromatherapy used in the bath oil works wonderfully and is relaxing in itself.</li>
            <li>Love it, relaxing, calming and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>Good smell and very relaxing.</li>
            <li>We both used the body wash daily and loved the tingly feeling it provided!  </li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to see that it was available for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Luckily it was packaged in a ziplock bag (which I thought was a bit unprofessional!)</li>
            <li>Along with a huge glass of wine</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>I really wanted the sea salt kind</li>
            <li>The foaming quality is great and last.</li>
            <li>this has a nice smell and is very relaxing.  </li>
            <li>If you are using it in a Jacuzzi tub be sure not to use too much, you may get too many bubbles.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff but this exact item is on Walmart.com for $4.97.</li>
            <li>Great oil if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li>I bought 3 different kinds of bubble bath and this by far is the best.</li>
            <li>The bath oil is ok, though it really don&#x27;t penetrate the sore muscles through your body.   </li>
            <li>Start with a couple of caps full and work up from there.     </li>
            <li>You really do feel more relaxed after wards.</li>
            <li>The lotion works well for occasional nite-time leg cramps - just rub it in good</li>
            <li>and you feel the cool refreshment relieving the pain.  </li>
            <li>The Village Natural products are no longer available in a store near me, and I was delighted to discover that it is available through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>At this price, next time I am gong to go for a more organic bubble that I know will be safe for myself and for my family.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of back and hip problems and Fibro and it really feels good in my bath as well as making me feel so clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>It smells good and makes me fell good after a long run than a long soak in this.</li>
            <li>This bath oil has a strong menthol and eucalyptus scent which I really like.  </li>
            <li>I have been enjoying bubble baths since I was a teenager, and this product surprised me.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to many bath oils and bath salts and Village Natural products do not seem to cause skin problems for me.  </li>
            <li>I also mix this in with my regular shower cream for an extra boost &amp; it leaves my skin soft &amp; smelling wonderful.</li>
            <li>If you do get the Stress and Tension do remember that it does have Peppermint which cools the muscles so your hot water will feel cooler.</li>
            <li>I put knee socks on...and they don&#x27;t come back :-)</li>
            <li>You can just relax your body in the hot peppermint scent bath.  </li>
            <li>and I was willing to try anything.</li>
            <li>For me this is a safe way to reduce aches and paines by simply taking a soak in your bath tub.  </li>
            <li>it much cheaper in Kmart!</li>
            <li>It really really does work!</li>
            <li>It really makes your aches and pains melt away!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a smart husband ;)</li>
            <li>Regardless of how long I&#x27;m standing this targets the areas that hurt the most.</li>
            <li>The scent is not too strong, but you definitely notice it, and I think it smells therapeutic.</li>
            <li>Fills the whole bathroom with the smell and helped her muscles relax.</li>
            <li>It smells really minty.</li>
            <li>it really does make a difference</li>
            <li>The scent makes me feel physically rejuvenated and the bubbles are great and last for the entire bath.</li>
            <li>I recommend this whole heartedly.</li>
            <li>and it really relaxes her</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much in either application.</li>
            <li>The product was okay-not as much &#x27;aromatherapy&#x27; as I thought.  </li>
            <li>She takes a bath almost every night and absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>peppermint smell is very soothing.</li>
            <li>The smell is noticeable but not overpowering, and it really does wonders for aching muscles.</li>
            <li>I have muscle spasms in my back sometimes and a nice hot bath with this helps every single time.</li>
            <li>I loved the seller and the product so much I had just recently bought the other types.</li>
            <li>It leaked in the shipping box all over my other gifts, so I wasn&#x27;t able to try it.</li>
            <li>While most of the ingredients in these salts are OK and they do smell nice, I was sorry to learn from the ingredient list that it has \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; which is a big toxic NO NO on the Skin Deep Cosmetic Database.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for someone who wants to relax and soak in the tub.</li>
            <li>I have very hard water, and still get good lather.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to those who prefer herbal over floral.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>This product has very pleasent natural herbal aromas.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and enjoy it each and every time!  </li>
            <li>I found if I used it directly as a washing lotion; a bit on a cloth on my shoulders where it hurt, I got better results than from soaking in a bath-tub with it diluted down.</li>
            <li>With the water as hot as I could take it and about a third of a cup of this</li>
            <li>The oil really works those kinks, twinges, and other pains right out.</li>
            <li>With that said, I am giving a 2 star rating because I was surprised to discover that one of this products main ingredients is Sodium Laureth Sulfate, which if you are not familiar with, is a cheap common poison that is put into many store bought bathroom products.</li>
            <li>I think it might help clear your sinus too.</li>
            <li>The bubbles last through the whole bath.</li>
            <li>My skin - and my lungs seem to know its natural and there are not issues there.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Wanted a natural product, not a soap.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, but have had no issues, even though the label says it can cause irritation.</li>
            <li>Cool green effect.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the smell of the menthol is so strong it smells like medicine.</li>
            <li>I think that for the price you are paying for this bubble bath, they should at least be less worried about making money and more conscious of putting the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; back in to Village Natural Therapy.</li>
            <li>I get used to my other bubble baths and forget and put too much of this stuff</li>
            <li>Great for people with fibromyalgia suffers on some of those rough days</li>
            <li>I switch between this &amp; the Stress &amp; Tension &amp; will even mix a little of both if I really need too.</li>

            <li> I have been enjoying bubble baths since I was a teenager, and this product surprised me.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to many bath oils and bath salts and Village Natural products do not seem to cause skin problems for me.  </li>
            <li> I also mix this in with my regular shower cream for an extra boost &amp; it leaves my skin soft &amp; smelling wonderful.</li>
            <li> If you do get the Stress and Tension do remember that it does have Peppermint which cools the muscles so your hot water will feel cooler.</li>
            <li> I put knee socks on...and they don&#x27;t come back :-)</li>
            <li> You can just relax your body in the hot peppermint scent bath.  </li>
            <li> and I was willing to try anything.</li>
            <li> For me this is a safe way to reduce aches and paines by simply taking a soak in your bath tub.  </li>
            <li> it much cheaper in Kmart!</li>
            <li> It really really does work!</li>
            <li> It really makes your aches and pains melt away!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a smart husband ;)</li>
            <li> Regardless of how long I&#x27;m standing this targets the areas that hurt the most.</li>
            <li> The scent is not too strong, but you definitely notice it, and I think it smells therapeutic.</li>
            <li> Fills the whole bathroom with the smell and helped her muscles relax.</li>
            <li> It smells really minty.</li>
            <li> it really does make a difference</li>
            <li> The scent makes me feel physically rejuvenated and the bubbles are great and last for the entire bath.</li>
            <li> I recommend this whole heartedly.</li>
            <li> and it really relaxes her</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use much in either application.</li>
            <li> The product was okay-not as much &#x27;aromatherapy&#x27; as I thought.  </li>
            <li> She takes a bath almost every night and absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> peppermint smell is very soothing.</li>
            <li> The smell is noticeable but not overpowering, and it really does wonders for aching muscles.</li>
            <li> I have muscle spasms in my back sometimes and a nice hot bath with this helps every single time.</li>
            <li> I loved the seller and the product so much I had just recently bought the other types.</li>
            <li> It leaked in the shipping box all over my other gifts, so I wasn&#x27;t able to try it.</li>
            <li> While most of the ingredients in these salts are OK and they do smell nice, I was sorry to learn from the ingredient list that it has \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; which is a big toxic NO NO on the Skin Deep Cosmetic Database.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for someone who wants to relax and soak in the tub.</li>
            <li> I have very hard water, and still get good lather.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to those who prefer herbal over floral.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> This product has very pleasent natural herbal aromas.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and enjoy it each and every time!  </li>
            <li> I found if I used it directly as a washing lotion; a bit on a cloth on my shoulders where it hurt, I got better results than from soaking in a bath-tub with it diluted down.</li>
            <li> With the water as hot as I could take it and about a third of a cup of this</li>
            <li> The oil really works those kinks, twinges, and other pains right out.</li>
            <li> With that said, I am giving a 2 star rating because I was surprised to discover that one of this products main ingredients is Sodium Laureth Sulfate, which if you are not familiar with, is a cheap common poison that is put into many store bought bathroom products.</li>
            <li> I think it might help clear your sinus too.</li>
            <li> The bubbles last through the whole bath.</li>
            <li> My skin - and my lungs seem to know its natural and there are not issues there.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Wanted a natural product, not a soap.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, but have had no issues, even though the label says it can cause irritation.</li>
            <li> Cool green effect.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the smell of the menthol is so strong it smells like medicine.</li>
            <li> I think that for the price you are paying for this bubble bath, they should at least be less worried about making money and more conscious of putting the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; back in to Village Natural Therapy.</li>
            <li> I get used to my other bubble baths and forget and put too much of this stuff</li>
            <li> Great for people with fibromyalgia suffers on some of those rough days</li>
            <li> I switch between this &amp; the Stress &amp; Tension &amp; will even mix a little of both if I really need too.</li>
            <li> I cannot use products like BenGay etc due to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It smells terrific and the bubbles are plentiful and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Great body wash to use after a tough workout or if you just slept wrong.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, hate how much it bubbles up.</li>
            <li> my  back felt as loose as when the PT works on it.</li>
            <li> This really helps with aches and pains that come from being on your feet all day and working hard.  </li>
            <li> Works well to relax muscles after a long day.</li>
            <li> Makes a lot of bubbles but the scent gets old after a few uses.</li>
            <li> One minor problem:  </li>
            <li> but I can deal with the smell as long as it helps sooth body</li>
            <li> The bubbles stay for a long time and are small and thick - it&#x27;s the first bubble bath I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li> Reading other reviews I see that this has happened before.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m out this gift and hope the other damaged items get replaced before Christmas.</li>
            <li> Like the Cold and Allergy, full of chemicals to generate suds and a bubble bath.</li>
            <li> My only complaint was it was spilling in the package when I received it.</li>
            <li> It also has Blue Lake &amp; Yellow Lake coloring, which seems unnecessary to have the water turn green.  </li>
            <li> Clears out your sinuses though, while your swirling suds down the drain.</li>
            <li> Since I had a shipping problem previously, I did not order any items on this order that might be damaged by liquids; I ordered my books on a separate order.  </li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t make a mess of your tub like some do.</li>
            <li> My problem is I ordered multiple bottles and one of the bottles was broken.</li>
            <li> Just a few minutes in a bath of the liquid or crystals</li>
            <li> I usually wait a few hours</li>
            <li> You can apply a small amount of the bath oil on your wash cloth and apply onto the area you would like to be massaged.  </li>
            <li> Not sure about the aches &amp; pains effectiveness</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m less tense after a soak in this bath oil.</li>
            <li> The bottle was put into a ziplock bag, but the bag did not stay sealed so a small amount of the product leaked into the box.  </li>
            <li> I use other eucalyptus bath oils and have no problem, but this one makes my entire body itch really bad.</li>
            <li> My husband suffers from chronic pain because of a spinal fusion back in the 90&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> It eases the pain while in the tub, of course, so no its not worth $15 although I will buy it again only at Walmart this time....:(</li>
            <li> I could not find relief for sore, tired feet.  </li>
            <li> I have had very painful neck and back problems lately</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandma who has very bad arthritis and can only take bath&#x27;s anymore.</li>
            <li> Sad that I can&#x27;t get the Stress and Tension now</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed, however, that it was leaking when it arrived!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> One of the best body wash products I have found!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff but this exact item is on Walmart.com for $4.97.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good bath oil.  I have used better in my time, but this gets the job done for a good price.  As far as penetrating the skin and relaxing the muscles, the hot water of the bath does a better job, but the potent aromatherapy used in the bath oil works wonderfully and is relaxing in itself.</li>
            <li> My wife love to soak in this bath oil.  She loves the cented aroma and how it soothes aching muscles.</li>
            <li> Love this product. The bubbles last through the whole bath. The bath salt version of this works well for body aches.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product. My problem is I ordered multiple bottles and one of the bottles was broken. I tried to get in touch with the company hoping they would offer to send another bottle to replace it but I never heard from them.</li>
            <li> The bath oil is ok, though it really don&#x27;t penetrate the sore muscles through your body.   I really wanted the sea salt kind like they used to sell but they took it off the market.</li>
            <li> The items (5 of them) were returned by the USPS never delivered as they were damaged.  I received credit for O N E  not FIVE.  I have written you 3 times and still no response I demand that you refund all my money immediately!    Thank you</li>
            <li> This bath foam smells great and really does seem to relieve aches and pains. Good job, people who made this!</li>
            <li> I use other eucalyptus bath oils and have no problem, but this one makes my entire body itch really bad.</li>
            <li> I bought the Stress and Tension foaming bath oil and it is AMAZING!!!! I loved the seller and the product so much I had just recently bought the other types. Sad that I can&#x27;t get the Stress and Tension now but I am waiting with baited breath. If you do get the Stress and Tension do remember that it does have Peppermint which cools the muscles so your hot water will feel cooler.</li>
            <li> I would have to say that I enjoyed the smell of this bubble bath, if your looking for a bubble bath that smells great and leaves you with the smell even after you leave the bath tub, this is the product for you. However, I didn&#x27;t notice any aches and pain relief. With that said, I am giving a 2 star rating because I was surprised to discover that one of this products main ingredients is Sodium Laureth Sulfate, which if you are not familiar with, is a cheap common poison that is put into many store bought bathroom products. I think that for the price you are paying for this bubble bath, they should at least be less worried about making money and more conscious of putting the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; back in to Village Natural Therapy. At this price, next time I am gong to go for a more organic bubble that I know will be safe for myself and for my family.</li>
            <li> For my daughter to relax. She lioves it!</li>
            <li> We purchase this product often locally and wanted to share with our kids.  They like it also.  It&#x27;s relaxing, therapeutic and aromatic.</li>
            <li> Great product! If you are using it in a Jacuzzi tub be sure not to use too much, you may get too many bubbles. Start with a couple of caps full and work up from there.     I love it.    Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift and she loves it. Says it smells great and works great too. Fills the whole bathroom with the smell and helped her muscles relax.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and it makes good bubbles.</li>
            <li> Works well to relax muscles after a long day.</li>
            <li> It smells really minty. If you don&#x27;t like mint smell don&#x27;t get it. Otherwise great deal for price. Nothing else to say.</li>
            <li> It leaked in the shipping box all over my other gifts, so I wasn&#x27;t able to try it. Reading other reviews I see that this has happened before. Now I&#x27;m out this gift and hope the other damaged items get replaced before Christmas. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great oil if you have dry skin. Softens without feeling oily. Won&#x27;t make a mess of your tub like some do. You really do feel more relaxed after wards.</li>
            <li> I buy a variety of bath soaks for my daughter for Christmas every year.  It is her luxary time to soak in a warm tub and read a book.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the greatest. I cannot use products like BenGay etc due to sensitive skin. Plus those ingredients are a defini9te asthma trigger. But not Village naturals. My skin - and my lungs seem to know its natural and there are not issues there.&lt;br /&gt;But definately buy the lotion to go with it. The lotion works well for occasional nite-time leg cramps - just rub it in good and they go away.&lt;br /&gt;Then I put knee socks on...and they don&#x27;t come back :-)</li>
            <li> Very pleasant - didn&#x27;t do anything for my pain, but I enjoyed the smell of it.  I found if I used it directly as a washing lotion; a bit on a cloth on my shoulders where it hurt, I got better results than from soaking in a bath-tub with it diluted down.</li>
            <li> Very good product at a very good price. Will return when I run out...</li>
            <li> My husband suffers from chronic pain because of a spinal fusion back in the 90&#x27;s.  This product was recommended to him by a patient from the Laser Spine Institute of Scottsdale, AZ.  At the time, I had suffered an injury to my inner thigh and was walking with a cane for support.  We both used the body wash daily and loved the tingly feeling it provided!  I was very pleased to see that it was available for a reasonable price. I have gotten several bottles and my husband still uses it daily.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> IF YOU NEED A BODYWASH FOR RELAX, BUY IT.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite body wash.  I love the smell and the sense of healing your aches and pains.  Not sue it really does make a difference but it helps me.</li>
            <li> I paid $15 for this bubble bath but I found out its $5 at walmart. It eases the pain while in the tub, of course, so no its not worth $15 although I will buy it again only at Walmart this time....:(</li>
            <li> Great body wash to use after a tough workout or if you just slept wrong. It makes a great gift for my friends that are marathon runners! It is very effective as a body wash, not so much as a bubble bath.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandma who has very bad arthritis and can only take bath&#x27;s anymore. She said she liked it alot and it did relieve some of her pains</li>
            <li> I have been enjoying bubble baths since I was a teenager, and this product surprised me. I love it! The scent makes me feel physically rejuvenated and the bubbles are great and last for the entire bath. It changes the feel of the water and makes skin feel like silk, without leaving residue. The scent is not the norm for me, but I have fallen in love with it. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I do yoga a lot and I have all kinds of injuries from a car accident last year.. this stuff works wonders!  I use it in the shower if I don&#x27;t have time to make a bubble bath and I feel sooo great and all tingly after using it... My skin feels rejuvenated after using it - so then I don&#x27;t have to apply Tigerbalm immediately post shower.. I usually wait a few hours</li>
            <li> Like the Cold and Allergy, full of chemicals to generate suds and a bubble bath. Wanted a natural product, not a soap.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product because you can use it as both a foaming bath and as a wash. This is the second time I have ordered this and when it is gone I am going to order it again.</li>
            <li> Solid bubble bath. Cool green effect. Makes a lot of bubbles but the scent gets old after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Good smell and very relaxing.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my back pain.  The scent of the bath oil is so soothing and remind you of spa.  You can just relax your body in the hot peppermint scent bath.  I use this bath oil as body wash too.  You can apply a small amount of the bath oil on your wash cloth and apply onto the area you would like to be massaged.  It works wonder!  You can immediately feel the soothing power penetrating to your body and soften the muscle tissues.  Try it!  You will be amazed!  I think it might help clear your sinus too.</li>
            <li> I love love love this stuff. I love the smell of it and love how it soothes my aching muscles when i use it. And the price is to die for. I recommend this whole heartedly. I also have the granules which i also like but prefer the bath oil. Just wish they had a bubble bath.</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife. She doesn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the aches &amp; pains effectiveness but it&#x27;s pleasant as a wash and makes great suds for a bath.</li>
            <li> Perfect for a long soak in the tub after crossfit</li>
            <li> Nice xmas gift for those who have parents and or people in their lives who still love to take a bath. Nice packaging, good look and nice on the aches and pains dept.</li>
            <li> I have had very painful neck and back problems lately and I was willing to try anything. This worked for me. With the water as hot as I could take it and about a third of a cup of this the relief was almost instant. after soaking for a 1/2 hour my  back felt as loose as when the PT works on it.</li>
            <li> The fragrance just makes me feel better. It does make your skin tingle! I love Village Naturals products. So glad they are on Amazon!</li>
            <li> For me this is a safe way to reduce aches and paines by simply taking a soak in your bath tub.  No worry about harmful&lt;br /&gt;side affects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This helps me sleep better at night if I soak about an hour before bed time.</li>
            <li> This really helps with aches and pains that come from being on your feet all day and working hard.  It helps the muscles relax.</li>
            <li> I could not find relief for sore, tired feet.  This is it. Just a few minutes in a bath of the liquid or crystals and you feel the cool refreshment relieving the pain.  Happy feet!!!!!</li>
            <li> Have been using it for my mom&#x27;s bath. She is 93 and it really relaxes her and she always has a better night sleep after this</li>
            <li> Great product.  Actually does ease muscle pain and aches. Smells good, foams up and relaxes.  I highly recommend it for someone who wants to relax and soak in the tub.</li>
            <li> This scent is my favorite scent in the world. It&#x27;s a very clean, wake you up menthol aroma. I will be buying this product for years to come!</li>
            <li> Love the smell, hate how much it bubbles up. I thought FOAM not monsoon of white. Clears out your sinuses though, while your swirling suds down the drain.</li>
            <li> Love the eucalyptus oil fragrance. It&#x27;s not some incredible therapy like it claims, but it&#x27;s nice, refreshing, and doesn&#x27;t leave a filmy residue like so many other washes do. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> We have used this bubble bath for a out 3 years and smells and feels great. Lathers up nicely and fills the air with this aroma of pain freeness</li>
            <li> Love it for after runs. It smells good and makes me fell good after a long run than a long soak in this.</li>
            <li> This product has very pleasent natural herbal aromas. The foaming quality is great and last. I use it for both bath and body wash. You don&#x27;t need to use much in either application. Highly recommend to those who prefer herbal over floral.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a restaurant manager &amp; my legs kill after a 6 hour day as well as after an 11 hour day. Regardless of how long I&#x27;m standing this targets the areas that hurt the most. I also mix this in with my regular shower cream for an extra boost &amp; it leaves my skin soft &amp; smelling wonderful. Just as the Stress &amp; Tension version it is a wonderful soak. I switch between this &amp; the Stress &amp; Tension &amp; will even mix a little of both if I really need too. Such a great product!!</li>
            <li> So lovely I got some for my mohter.</li>
            <li> Got this item for my mother in law she seems to like it. My only complaint was it was spilling in the package when I received it. Other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> While most of the ingredients in these salts are OK and they do smell nice, I was sorry to learn from the ingredient list that it has \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; which is a big toxic NO NO on the Skin Deep Cosmetic Database.  It also has Blue Lake &amp; Yellow Lake coloring, which seems unnecessary to have the water turn green.  This isn&#x27;t a children&#x27;s bath product after all.  Next time I&#x27;ll check the product label in a store like Wholefoods or on the Cosmetic Database before ordering.</li>
            <li> I love the bath oil that also bubbles.  this has a nice smell and is very relaxing.  I do feel like my muscles relax and i&#x27;m less tense after a soak in this bath oil.</li>
            <li> This bath oil has a strong menthol and eucalyptus scent which I really like.  However, if you don&#x27;t care for the menthol aroma, this product is not for you.  The Village Natural products are no longer available in a store near me, and I was delighted to discover that it is available through Amazon.  I am allergic to many bath oils and bath salts and Village Natural products do not seem to cause skin problems for me.  One minor problem:  I have ordered this product before through Amazon and the liquids had leaked into the shipping box.  This happened again with one bottle in this shipment.  The bottle was put into a ziplock bag, but the bag did not stay sealed so a small amount of the product leaked into the box.  Since I had a shipping problem previously, I did not order any items on this order that might be damaged by liquids; I ordered my books on a separate order.  Recommend the product; don&#x27;t care for the packaging.</li>
            <li> The product was okay-not as much &#x27;aromatherapy&#x27; as I thought.  I was very disappointed, however, that it was leaking when it arrived!  Luckily it was packaged in a ziplock bag (which I thought was a bit unprofessional!) so it didn&#x27;t leak all over the box.  I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Great used as bubble bath. I have muscle spasms in my back sometimes and a nice hot bath with this helps every single time. Along with a huge glass of wine but I&#x27;m gonna go ahead and pretend it is all owed to this bubble bath...</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this a month ago for my wife. She takes a bath almost every night and absolutely loves it. I just bought 4 more bottles. I&#x27;m a smart husband ;)</li>
            <li> This stuff makes so many bubbles. I get used to my other bubble baths and forget and put too much of this stuff in.&lt;br /&gt;The peppermint smell is very soothing.</li>
            <li> This is favorite of mine. Great for people with fibromyalgia suffers on some of those rough days</li>
            <li> great for achy body , needs better smell but I can deal with the smell as long as it helps sooth body</li>
            <li> I enjoy baths, and  this bubble bath not only makes a mountain of fragrant bubbles, but also leaves behind a sparkling tub when the water drains.  I&#x27;ve found that eliminating bar soap and using this product as a bath wash guarantees no bath tub ring or scrubbing.</li>
            <li> This is the fourth time I&#x27;ve bought this, and I will definitely buy it again. The smell is noticeable but not overpowering, and it really does wonders for aching muscles. The bubbles stay for a long time and are small and thick - it&#x27;s the first bubble bath I&#x27;ve had that I was truly impressed and satisfied with the bubbles.</li>
            <li> i HAVE ALREADY USED THIS IN THE TUB AND DON&#x27;T KNOW IF IT WAS THE AROMA OR THE COOLNESS OF THE OIL BUT IT FELT MARVELOUS</li>
            <li> I have very hard water, and still get good lather. My only complaint is that the smell of the menthol is so strong it smells like medicine.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff in my bath. I have a lot of back and hip problems and Fibro and it really feels good in my bath as well as making me feel so clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and fabulous in the bath and even better if you are able to use it with a whirlpool tub or a system that turns a tub into one.  It relaxes sore muscles and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Works great but overpriced!&lt;br /&gt;Get it much cheaper in Kmart!</li>
            <li> This bath oil is a staple in my medicine cabinet.  It really really does work!</li>
            <li> This body wash is AMAZING!  It really makes your aches and pains melt away!  It is so cool and refreshing!  I love the scent of eucalyptus and spearmint.  I use it everyday and enjoy it each and every time!  I highly recommend it.  I have sensitive skin, but have had no issues, even though the label says it can cause irritation.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect way to end a stressful day. The oil really works those kinks, twinges, and other pains right out. You can use it as a bath soak or shower gel.Use it with the Aches and pains lotion to make your muscles relax and enable a better day or night. The scent is not too strong, but you definitely notice it, and I think it smells therapeutic.</li>
            <li> Love it, relaxing, calming and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 different kinds of bubble bath and this by far is the best. It smells terrific and the bubbles are plentiful and last a long time. I will buy it again.</li>
