            <li>Products are amazing.</li>
            <li>I liked that I could smell what it was made of, but some people probably won&#x27;t get into that.</li>
            <li>Liked the shampoo.</li>
            <li>I feel like I kind got ripped off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been hearing good things about this line and decided to try sample pack before splurging on full size item</li>
            <li>The conditioner was also very light as well, but it didn&#x27;t feel like I was trying to moisturizer my hair.</li>
            <li>The hair mask was definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Customer Service- Make sure to ensure you receive tracking updates after a label is created.</li>
            <li>More of just rejuvation , my hair was already shiny and moisturized after the shampoo, the conditioner gave this lift to my hair.</li>
            <li>I will order again, very much pleased</li>
            <li>I am not in love with this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it to death.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a product to moisturized my hair and make it more manageable.</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>so it kind of gives this scent of clean.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good line</li>
            <li>It has good slip and best of all hair was soft the entire time.  </li>
            <li>My curls also had great definition, I still can&#x27;t believe how soft my hair felt after using this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slick, it smells delicious, and it made my hair soft, gave great definition, and would have kept it hydrated and at full poof for a good week if I&#x27;d let it.</li>
            <li>A great product for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I tried this product because of how it was detailed to perform on natural hair and it supposed to provide great results for your hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light scent not over bearing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a sulfate free shampoo and had my hair feeling still moisturized.</li>
            <li>The shampoo was great, it clarified without totally frying my hair.</li>
            <li>TGIN arrived on time packaged securely.</li>
            <li>I do note that my hair is pretty healthy already and did not need to be moisturized so perhaps the benefits of this brand were lost on me</li>
            <li>The daily moisturizer was ok but not the best and the deep condition was overwhelmingly sweet</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been seeing a lot of praise about the collection and wanted to try it before getting the full sizes.</li>
            <li>will purchase the full size.</li>
            <li>This product was good to the last drop.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shampoo - This is the best sulfate free shampoo I have ever used, seriously!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be looking into more products on their site (there is a shipping discount for full sizes on their website)!</li>
            <li>I wanted to give the most accurate review possible.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner were great and did exactly what they said it would - moisturize and a slight detangle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honey Hair Mask - I used this right after I rinsed the shampoo out.  </li>
            <li>Not too much sheen, but definitely good for dry lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>not any better then any other sulfate free conditioner would.</li>
            <li>The first thing I&#x27;ll say is the shampoo, it .has</li>
            <li>TGIN really got something going here!</li>
            <li>My ultimate favorite which I will continue to use until they don&#x27;t carry is the hair butter.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with the ENTIRE TGIN line thanks to this sample kit!  </li>
            <li>I had to wash it out of my hair and afterwards I felt better physically.</li>
            <li>My hair was clean and very soft.</li>
            <li>Sometimes my hair can feel dry after shampooing and even after doing a deep condition but my hair felt great after just the shampoo!&lt;br</li>
            <li>They all seem to work very well, my hair was very moisturized even before the adding the moisturizer and hair mask.</li>
            <li>I covered whole head with plastic cap and used my heating cap for about an hour and then rinsed.  </li>
            <li>I have 4c hair and found this product to be very drying...</li>
            <li>and I must say I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I have not tried the products, but giving it a very like because I hope I do.</li>
            <li>It left it relatively soft and I was still able to run my fingers through it.</li>
            <li>It certainly leaves my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how far these little bottles can go.</li>
            <li>It was a little pricey for my liking, but I&#x27;m glad I did it.</li>
            <li>It left my scalp clean, but my hair soft.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never been so soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>Wow wow wow</li>
            <li>After receiving this product, I really like it especially the hair mask.</li>
            <li>YESSS it was that much and only from a lil drop!</li>
            <li>Hair remained just as soft was</li>
            <li>my natural hair will not buy this again.</li>
            <li>Its soft, moisturized and not as frizzy as before.</li>
            <li>4C natural hair user.</li>
            <li>I had to use a bunch of it too, not very slick.</li>
            <li>Only used on a small section thank goodness because I was able to reach for one of my staple moisturizers (asiam milk) to complete my wash day</li>
            <li>The shampoo lathered up well and left my daughter&#x27;s hair very soft.</li>
            <li>in all I was extremely pleased with my purchase and will purchasing the shampoo and mask again in the future maybe not soon because if I only have to use a small amount of shampoo</li>
            <li>I wanted a product that would make my hair feel baby soft and this did not do such.</li>
            <li>The shampoo did not dry out my hair.</li>
            <li>I purchased this sample back to try on my daughter&#x27;s loose natural hair and my locs.</li>

            <li> I have naturally curly hair and its hard to maintain because I am currently in the middle east its hot, the water is hard and sand everywhere.</li>
            <li> This collection offers a little taste of all of the products.</li>
            <li> I had to gather up a big amount of suds and put aside to use on my other sections of hair,</li>
            <li> The products made my hair feel dry and rough.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a whole lot of it either to wash your hair, I only put a small amount in my palm and then put it on my hair and it practically doubled in size!!!</li>
            <li> The product tgin was is not a good product for natural hair</li>
            <li> I am an extreme product junkie.</li>
            <li> The package was extremely neat, the description of the products are in the box as well as what each are used for.</li>
            <li> The mask I will have to purchase as it&#x27;s not enough to make it past one wash.  </li>
            <li> Normally I give shampoos a glare when I pass them on the shelves because they leave my hair wiry, or worse, they mat it!</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried tgin or at least curious try the sample pack</li>
            <li> I have had the this product sample for a few months now</li>
            <li> 4c girls need moisture TGIN, not sure how this is the &amp;#34;moist collection&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I wish they would put the twisted cream in the package with the 2oz.</li>
            <li> When I bought this product I was extremely skeptical.</li>
            <li> I believe I am terribly allergic to the product.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been seeing a lot of praise about the collection and wanted to try it before getting the full sizes. This collection offers a little taste of all of the products. They all seem to work very well, my hair was very moisturized even before the adding the moisturizer and hair mask. The hair mask was definitely my favorite. It&#x27;s light and airy like whipped cream, but very good at its job. I&#x27;ll definitely be looking into more products on their site (there is a shipping discount for full sizes on their website)! Also, try the lip balm, it glides on like chapstick, but lasts like a gloss. Not too much sheen, but definitely good for dry lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer Service- Make sure to ensure you receive tracking updates after a label is created. Mine was overlooked, but the customer service department caught the error before I even realized there was a problem.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the shampoo.  It left my scalp clean, but my hair soft.  The butter moisturizer was excellent for my twist.</li>
            <li> After receiving this product, I really like it especially the hair mask.</li>
            <li> The product is good. I wish they would put the twisted cream in the package with the 2oz.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering it again, my twist out are prefect!!!!</li>
            <li> I am an extreme product junkie. I buy different products trying to see what works for my hair. When I bought this product I was extremely skeptical. I didn&#x27;t think it would do anything for my hair. The package was extremely neat, the description of the products are in the box as well as what each are used for. The first thing I&#x27;ll say is the shampoo, it .has a lemon smell, mixed with something else. It&#x27;s a light scent not over bearing so it kind of gives this scent of clean. I&#x27;ve never used a sulfate free shampoo and had my hair feeling still moisturized. The conditioner was also very light as well, but it didn&#x27;t feel like I was trying to moisturizer my hair. More of just rejuvation , my hair was already shiny and moisturized after the shampoo, the conditioner gave this lift to my hair. Ohhh I just loved it. The hair mask locked in the moisture and when I woke up the next day to take out my twist my hair was shinning. If you haven&#x27;t tried tgin or at least curious try the sample pack and I kid you not it will have your hair feeling light and bouncy with a great shine. All the products are a must buy and I don&#x27;t see myself steering away from this product any time soon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how far these little bottles can go. I ordered the trial size just to try it out and I still have product. It&#x27;s been about a month and I am so pleased! TGIN really got something going here!</li>
            <li> I purchased this sample back to try on my daughter&#x27;s loose natural hair and my locs. The shampoo lathered up well and left my daughter&#x27;s hair very soft.</li>
            <li> I will order again, very much pleased</li>
            <li> The shampoo did not dry out my hair. My hair was clean and very soft. will purchase the full size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been hearing good things about this line and decided to try sample pack before splurging on full size item and I must say I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.  My hair type is 4 a/b.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo - This is the best sulfate free shampoo I have ever used, seriously! You don&#x27;t need a whole lot of it either to wash your hair, I only put a small amount in my palm and then put it on my hair and it practically doubled in size!!! I had to gather up a big amount of suds and put aside to use on my other sections of hair, YESSS it was that much and only from a lil drop! So next time I will use the smallest of smallest drops.  It has good slip and best of all hair was soft the entire time.  My curls also had great definition, I still can&#x27;t believe how soft my hair felt after using this shampoo.  Sometimes my hair can feel dry after shampooing and even after doing a deep condition but my hair felt great after just the shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Triple Moisture Conditioner - Did not try, will update when I do&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honey Hair Mask - I used this right after I rinsed the shampoo out.  I covered whole head with plastic cap and used my heating cap for about an hour and then rinsed.  Hair remained just as soft was when I shampooed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buttercream Moisturizer - Did not care for this at all, did nothing for my hair.  Provided no sheen, no moisture, nothing.  Only used on a small section thank goodness because I was able to reach for one of my staple moisturizers (asiam milk) to complete my wash day routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I was extremely pleased with my purchase and will purchasing the shampoo and mask again in the future maybe not soon because if I only have to use a small amount of shampoo and I don&#x27;t shampoo often that bottle might last me all year!  The mask I will have to purchase as it&#x27;s not enough to make it past one wash.  This is a pretty good line and I would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I am not in love with this product.  Very happy that I was able to try in a travel size package.  I have 4c hair and found this product to be very drying...4c girls need moisture TGIN, not sure how this is the &amp;#34;moist collection&amp;#34;.  Followed the instructions (which I never do) and even viewed videos for tips.</li>
            <li> It was a little pricey for my liking, but I&#x27;m glad I did it. The shampoo was great, it clarified without totally frying my hair. It left it relatively soft and I was still able to run my fingers through it. Normally I give shampoos a glare when I pass them on the shelves because they leave my hair wiry, or worse, they mat it! This has given me some hope for shampoo. The sent was, well, soapy I liked that I could smell what it was made of, but some people probably won&#x27;t get into that. The conditioner didn&#x27;t amaze me, it worked well with my hair, but not any better then any other sulfate free conditioner would. I had to use a bunch of it too, not very slick. Now the honey mask, that was the big winner. It&#x27;s slick, it smells delicious, and it made my hair soft, gave great definition, and would have kept it hydrated and at full poof for a good week if I&#x27;d let it.</li>
            <li> Products are amazing. My hair was extremely HAPPY!! My ultimate favorite which I will continue to use until they don&#x27;t carry is the hair butter.  Wow wow wow</li>
            <li> TGIN arrived on time packaged securely. I love this product. It certainly leaves my hair very soft and manageable. It gave me the best twist out I ever had. Great product.</li>
            <li> Liked the shampoo. It made my hair shiny. Deep conditioner actually already have. Love it to death. Butter cream is great for styling and moisture. Didn&#x27;t try the replenishing conditioner. Now I&#x27;m trying the twist define cream. They should include that in the sample too.</li>
            <li> A great product for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> The product tgin was is not a good product for natural hair my natural hair will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> This product was good to the last drop.</li>
            <li> I am in love with the ENTIRE TGIN line thanks to this sample kit!  My hair has never been so soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> I wanted to give the most accurate review possible. I have had the this product sample for a few months now and I must say I really like this product. I have naturally curly hair and its hard to maintain because I am currently in the middle east its hot, the water is hard and sand everywhere. I was looking for a product to moisturized my hair and make it more manageable. And I believe I have found my match. I tried all types of products over here and nothing seemed to work. TGIN has worked wonders for my hair. Its soft, moisturized and not as frizzy as before. I will definitely be purchasing these products again.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because of how it was detailed to perform on natural hair and it supposed to provide great results for your hair. It wasn&#x27;t for me. The products made my hair feel dry and rough. It may work for others but just not me.</li>
            <li> Love it... perfect sample size, now I know what I like and do not like from this line... The deep conditioner is the BOOM !!</li>
            <li> 4C natural hair user. The shampoo and conditioner were great and did exactly what they said it would - moisturize and a slight detangle. The daily moisturizer was ok but not the best and the deep condition was overwhelmingly sweet and I did not see any benefits to using it. I do note that my hair is pretty healthy already and did not need to be moisturized so perhaps the benefits of this brand were lost on me but it may be helpful for someone else. I wanted a product that would make my hair feel baby soft and this did not do such.</li>
            <li> Favorite shampoo and moisturizer- great quality!</li>
            <li> I believe I am terribly allergic to the product.  I had to wash it out of my hair and afterwards I felt better physically.</li>
            <li> I understand this is problem an error on my end. The title of the product does say &amp;#34;2oz&amp;#34; but when you look at the photo the images are not &amp;#34;2oz&amp;#34; bottles. I was under the assumption that I would be receiving two larger bottles of shampoo and conditioner while the hair mask and daily treatment were going to be 2oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise I would have just bought the Shampoo/Conditioner combo for the same price. I am unsure if I will be returning or not. I feel like I kind got ripped off.</li>
            <li> I have not tried the products, but giving it a very like because I hope I do.</li>
