            <li>It&#x27;s non greasy and super light, and it smells amazing.  </li>
            <li>, my fine lines are less visible and the best part is that it&#x27;s not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also loving it on my body and specially on my cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>I break out easily</li>
            <li>I switched over to more natural lines for good reasons.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Nice natural effective product.</li>
            <li>After the first evening, I woke up to nice supple refreshed skin.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using rose hip oil</li>
            <li>She wears a fair amount of makeup, which takes it&#x27;s toll on her skin, so she decided to try Rosehip Oil instead of her normal nighttime creams.  </li>
            <li>I have to say that this does absorb SUPER quickly and is a nice lightweight oil for moisturizing.</li>
            <li>it smells amazing, and I feel good that I&#x27;m only putting pure, healthy ingredients on my skin :)</li>
            <li>I noticed it also help fine wrinkle lines or &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34; around the eyes.</li>
            <li>It also helped tightened and reduced fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li>It helps with age spots, fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day for two weeks and my fine lines are deminishing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen some improvement with fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>wrinkles, fine lines, acne, rosacea, scars, stretch marks etc.</li>
            <li>And not to worry but the oil doesn&#x27;t really have a smell which I love!</li>
            <li>Nice large bottle.</li>
            <li>It is very light and soaks in right away, does not leave an oily feel at all.</li>
            <li>So when I was able to get it on promotion I was super excited about it.</li>
            <li>but it lasts forever because it&#x27;s a huge bottle.</li>
            <li>It also is a huge bottle for the amount you need .</li>
            <li>Did I mention that the bottle is HUGE?</li>
            <li>This is a huge bottle that came well packaged and protected.  </li>

            <li>Great carrier oil for my essential oils.</li>
            <li>Light and absorbs well.</li>
            <li>Comes with a dropper top and a solid twist off top for traveling, which is nice...</li>

            <li>Very luxurious oil!!!  </li>

            <li>So happy I was introduced to this beautiful, 100% Organic, Cold Pressed Rosehip Oil.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am very comfortable in highly recommending</li>

            <li>As good as the ridiculously expensive mail order kinds and at a great price</li>
            <li>I expected the rose hips to have a very pleasant aroma, instead it smelled like any other oil.  </li>
            <li>Makes my 66 year old skin feel more soft and more elastic!  </li>
            <li>I tried to use as makeup remover, and it exactly work with light make up ( not with eyes and lip).</li>
            <li>It definitely hydrates and protects, which is very important for me living in the desert!</li>

            <li>Great product of its type- nice light scent and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>But, most importantly the skin just soaks up this light  &#x27;dry&#x27; oil as it should, leaving no greasing residue.  </li>
            <li>It really helped giving my baby fine hair some volume.  </li>

            <li>This stuff is great, brilliant, and like it says, you only need a few drops, but I&#x27;m only giving it a 4 because it doesn&#x27;t soak into the skin as readily as I would like it to.</li>

            <li>I finally find my favorite oil.  </li>
            <li>smaller businesses who make quality products is a rewarding thing to do...</li>

            <li>Big thumbs up to the company for providing a safe and organic way of moisturizing your skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>Really big bottle and 100% organic which makes me feel safe to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Soft and light, no discernible fragrance.</li>
            <li>but my complexion has really improved!</li>
            <li>Fantastic multi-purpose, natural product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so used to most products coming in tiny 1 oz.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>I will most definitely continue to use it for all types of treatments day or nighttreatments.</li>
            <li>My skin feels fresh and is much smoother than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an oil, but it&#x27;s not too heavy and it feels SO good on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Unlike some reviews, my oil has barely any scent which is a HUGE plus because I have sensitive skin and break out / rash easily from scented lotions and oils.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this oil for a couple of days, but so far I love it!  </li>
            <li>I was not compensated in any other way and this is my HONEST review.</li>
            <li>Rosehip is wonderful on aging skin an can help bring dull skin back to glowing skin.</li>
            <li>It is a very light golden with a faint pleasant natural fragrance.  </li>
            <li>used to buy different serums/oils for my face, hair and body because you need them all, right?&lt;br /&gt;These products cost more, yet smaller in ounces and weren&#x27;t always paraben/sulfate free.</li>
            <li>I am 66 in twenty seven days - pretty much beyond help UNTIL I tried this product.  </li>
            <li>My face is softer and gives me a fresh new day glow all of the time.</li>
            <li>I have even begun to use a few drops on my hair and the results have been pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>this absorbs so quickly and completely.....</li>
            <li>and I wake up to a super soft face .  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves the skin feeling silky, soft and nourished.  </li>
            <li>A large four ounce bottle.  </li>
            <li>pure rosehip oil.</li>
            <li>Large bottle.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin very soft without leaving a sticky or oily residue on my skin like many other oils and lotions I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The fine line in my face Is  starting to fade.</li>
            <li>I added some to my lotion, the smell is pretty decent.</li>
            <li>so I am used to very high quality without a lot of fragrance and &amp;#34;fillers&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, it really helped my dry skin!</li>
            <li>I just tried it on my hands so far, and they feel really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Amazing results after just a few uses.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really looking forward to the whole line of products.</li>
            <li>This oil really irritated my face.</li>
            <li>I use it very day.</li>
            <li>I really really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I can not believe the difference so much</li>
            <li>Does not take much to do the job.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It really seems to moisturize.</li>
            <li>I have been using on my face before bedtime and waking up with really hydrated skin.  </li>
            <li>I also combine with my body lotion and it really softens areas like my elbows and feet.  </li>
            <li>I use it on the ends of my hair, really helps with dryness and frizz.</li>
            <li>Nor did it absorb very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>is that they did not put any additives in their oil or call it Rosehip oil when it&#x27;s really a blend of oils (a problem that occurs with valuable oils).  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>It really does what it says, it heals the skin, keeps the moisture locked in and the dryness out.</li>
            <li>It is soaked up by my skin very well and leave no oily feel or look.</li>
            <li>This review expresses my real opinion about this product.</li>
            <li>Rosehip oil is an important part of my daily skin care routine.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast as well.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>disappeared and the oil really helped to hydrate my skin by leaving a glow look.  </li>
            <li>Came lightening fast</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really moisturizing</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Also use on my feet to keep them extra smooth.  </li>
            <li>It really works and it is organic</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Really like this oil.</li>
            <li>Very soothing on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li>and Ive noticed my foundation hoes on much smoother.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>After doing so, the oil becomes much thicker and cloudy in appearance.</li>
            <li>It work very well on my hair.</li>
            <li>Is very soothing product.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>but it works so well at absorbing.</li>
            <li>and this I believe to be because of the lightness and quickly absorbing formula.</li>
            <li>Thanks for offering this product at the discount...</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Very hydrating &amp; makes skin feel supple.</li>
            <li>This oil is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Very earthy.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s working really</li>
            <li>and I have both been using Rosehip Oil - a few drops on our hands, rubbing it between our hands to warm it a bit and then massaging into our skin on our face and neck then our hands.</li>
            <li>love this it left my face so soft</li>
            <li>Although I only used it for a week, the deep wrinkles are still visble, but the fine lines under my eyes have significantly reduce.</li>
            <li>This product is phenomenal due to its&#x27; simple, organic, chemical free way of soothing skin.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, so it&#x27;s a great value for your money.</li>
            <li>Better than other oil.</li>
            <li>due to that I am able to add it to my DYI lotions and creams and it</li>
            <li>was really excited when you told me about this essential oil!</li>
            <li>So far so good - I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it works yet.</li>
            <li>Recently I used Rosehip Oil directly on my face to help a spot on my face that was becoming raised and worried me.  </li>
            <li>Just started using so still waiting for a long time result, but so far I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>It does not have any of the characteristic strong scent of Rosehip oil.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product as it really improved my skin and hair conditions.  </li>
            <li>No rose smell of at all, but the oil is light and easily being absorb.</li>
            <li>I also had a bit of unexpected surgery, leaving me with a 4 inch scar I was less than thrilled with.</li>
            <li>I found this product through research and was presently surprised with the outcome I got just after the first use.</li>
            <li>My skin is very very dry because of winter and they hands soaked up 2 to 3 applications of this easily.</li>
            <li>Applied rose hip oil to my very dry calves and they improved immensely !</li>
            <li>I am amazed by how great it moisturized my dry hands, especially those dry cuticle.</li>
            <li>I put a couple of drops of this rosehip oil on them before bed and they are soft and smooth the next morning.  </li>
            <li>The oil dries quickly on your skin, but at the same time leaves it feeling moisturized and refreshed.</li>
            <li>My skin is visibly brighter, feels softer and my hair looks vibrant.</li>
            <li>After only using for a short while I am already noticing more hydrated, even toned skin on my face, neck and chest (the bottle is a generous size so why not apply it to those areas as well?).  </li>
            <li>It really makes my skin feel so soft too!</li>
            <li>This is a high quality oil.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comforting to know that the company uses high quality, organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend......</li>
            <li>Highly recommended this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a week now and am pleased with the quality.  </li>
            <li>I put a little more on my face before bedtime</li>
            <li>Even though I received this oil at a modest discount in exchange for leaving a review, I find myself wishing I hadn&#x27;t even paid that much.</li>
            <li>It is very hydrating and makes your skin soft and glowing.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure about long term effects but it moisturizes really nicely and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy!</li>
            <li>is that it says to refrigerate to keep it fresh which makes total sense, but I worry that I won&#x27;t bother going to fetch the bottle from the kitchen before a shower.</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin glows after just a few days of using it in the mornings.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the way this feels, doesn&#x27;t leave your face oily, I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see results yet!</li>
            <li>I normally buy Rosehip Oils from some brand names and cost me a lot.</li>
            <li>I am glad to report that the use of this oil has calmed this spot down and it is almost completely gone . . .</li>
            <li>I have been wanting to try this Rosehip oil for a very long time because I was told that it keeps your skin really soft and smooth</li>
            <li>This oil soaked right into my skin immediately and didn&#x27;t leave any left over on my skin or film.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a licensed esthetican and rosehip is the new &amp;#34;it&amp;#34; ingredient.</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to blending a new body oil for myself</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to blending a new body oil for myself</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t live without it!&lt;br /&gt;Buy</li>
            <li>Live the feeling of it on my skin.</li>
            <li>The Rosehip oil absorbs quickly into your skin leaving you feeling dry - not oily.  </li>
            <li>Many oils come in a wide array of refinements with different properties to each.  </li>
            <li>During the winter,  my skin becomes super dry to the point it hurts.</li>
            <li>I got this because I have super dry skin on my arms, and this has taken it away.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft.</li>
            <li>I use this nightly in lieu of a night cream and my face is very soft and hydrated in the morning</li>
            <li>for the short time I&#x27;ve used this product I like it very much.</li>
            <li>It also came with a dropper which made it easy to get it out with out a mess.</li>
            <li>the dropper is big enough that you don&#x27;t have to dip and squeeze more than once - That might now seem like a big deal</li>
            <li>it was exactly the incentive that I needed to continue not only using this product but looking into additional oils and how they can benefit me and my daughter.</li>
            <li>and im constantly washing my hands, either with hot soapy water or with hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li>So at the end of the day/week my hands are super dry, cracking, and sometimes even chapped!</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the size of the bottle!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Even after the first use I notice a big difference</li>
            <li>Will finish this bottle and definitely repurchase as I can use it in so many different applications which is a Big Bang for my buck.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin soft!</li>
            <li>It makes my face and skin look amazing and a little bit goes a long way!  </li>
            <li>My hair is really dry, so I warm a little of this oil in bowl and then massage it into my hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li>and wow, my skin and hair are so soft!</li>
            <li>My 4 yr old son hates lotions, he has very sensitive skin and the lotions tend to irritate him (even those for sensitive skin)</li>
            <li>Both of these types of Rosehip oils have an extremely nutty scent that dissipates quickly upon application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a chance to try this product a few months ago during a demonstration, and immediately had it as a priority for purchase when it came available.</li>
            <li>There are so many uses for this delicate oil, please investigate and treat yourself to this product.  </li>
            <li>, I would not recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My 6 year old daughter</li>
            <li>It helps mature skin with hydration and wrinkle reduction.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a product to make a part of your daily beauty regimen, I highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li>noticed a big change on my skin it did give me a brightening effect, supple and rosy blush effect which I really like&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but so far my skin feels tighter and plumper.  </li>
            <li>I have used this for one week and my face is so soft.</li>
            <li>I was surprised it was clear and has no odor....</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I really want to try in my hair next.</li>
            <li>Just wonderfully soft skin.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s making my skin so soft</li>
            <li>My skin became soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I used it on my body and had baby soft skin.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and my wrinkles are softened.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 73 and a California girl who has seen way too much sun, but I still can&#x27;t resist setting out and getting my daily dose of vitamin D!</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and my wrinkles have softened.</li>
            <li>even though it&#x27;s an oil, I like how it doesn&#x27;t actually make my skin really oily.</li>
            <li>My face feels hydrated and I actually feel like I can wear it even without makeup because the shine is not to much.</li>
            <li>I used this in a face mask that I made and afterwards my skin felt both soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I am truly pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>At 55 yrs old I do not expect to look 18 ever again</li>
            <li>This oil leaves my dkin soft  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the bottle for the price.  </li>
            <li>but I could feel how soft it made my skin almost immediately..</li>
            <li>It is filled with fatty acids and antioxidants.</li>
            <li>Even tho im still young</li>
            <li>My natural color pops.</li>
            <li>and this oil helps to keep it moist and soft.</li>
            <li>I have used the rosehip oil for maybe a couple of weeks and the dryness has completely disappeared .</li>
            <li>I really like that I can spread it over my entire face, including my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your skin so soft and not greasy</li>
            <li>organic rosehip oil is a deep oil that can make the face oily looking if too much is applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I like to use natural products on it.</li>
            <li>I have been really pleased with the results I have seen over the last few days.</li>
            <li>It was so beyond worth the $23 spent, and I will be returning to this company once my oil runs out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days and my skin feels great...softer and generally more nourished.  </li>
            <li>It seemed to absorb more on my hands and a little goes a long way, so with this size bottle</li>
            <li>I have really dry skin and live in Hollywood (where it&#x27;s super dry w no humidity).</li>
            <li>i was skeptical to put it on my face as i am prone to break outs, but it is so light and absorbs quickly leaving your skin feeling refreshed and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I have been using botanicals for many years and this oil acts responds to the skin as a top of the line 100% cold pressed organic Rosehip oil would be expected to.  </li>
            <li>But it was not one of the cheaper reviewer discounts I have gotten, and I just really value the characteristic properties of Rosehip oil which I do not find here.  </li>
            <li>Quite dry really.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soothing when it comes straight out of the refrigerator and put on dry skin.</li>
            <li>Try to use it alone at first then after a time like one month mix it with other oils</li>
            <li>I will give it another try since this has happened before with other products when I first try them.</li>
            <li>However, I would much rather buy a small bottle of this oil  if need be than a large bottle with a decent shelflife but lacking in the characteristic properties.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a softer texture with my skin, especially with my old acne scars.</li>
            <li>Apparently, it is just an ultra refined Rosehip oil.  </li>
            <li>I bought this with a coupon, really not expecting much.</li>
            <li>I got this mainly because I need something for my dry hands</li>
            <li>The next morning I washed my hair and it was soft</li>
            <li>Something about it being Rose HIP oil would lead me to wrongly believe that it would somehow smell like roses....</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin, I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>The product came carefully packaged and included an eye dropper large enough to screw atop the container for easier use.</li>
            <li>My 7 year old has very dry skin and cuticles and after just one application, I noticed a considerable difference.</li>
            <li>how soft, flat, and evenly colored the healing incision is!</li>
            <li>I received this the same day I spent too much time in the sun.</li>
            <li>It makes my face smooth and less dark circles</li>
            <li>They resolve quickly and without the deep cracking and bleeding that usually torment me this time of year.</li>
            <li>I think it is a little too lightweight for my super dry skin</li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate so my skin always needs extra hydration.  </li>
            <li>I live in a semi-arid climate, and have been battling with dry skin on several areas of my body/face.</li>
            <li>I have been using it on my winter dry patches that have developed on my face.</li>
            <li>I struggle with eczema and so far it seems to be gentle enough and even improving a little bit!  </li>
            <li>Before starting my skin was sunburned and dry; and looked like a 64 year old’s skin.  </li>
            <li>So far so great!&lt;br /&gt;Living in the desert my skin and hair get very dry.</li>
            <li>The quality is high, not watered down like some brands.</li>
            <li>Which is a good and bad thing</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Rose Hip Oil has powerful skin rejuvenating properties</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non greasy and super light, and it smells amazing.  </li>
            <li> , my fine lines are less visible and the best part is that it&#x27;s not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also loving it on my body and specially on my cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
            <li> The oil absorbs very quickly &amp; does not have a smell.</li>
            <li> the skin absorbs it easily.</li>
            <li> Smoothing and absorbs easily.</li>
            <li> I break out easily</li>
            <li> I switched over to more natural lines for good reasons.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Nice natural effective product.</li>
            <li> After the first evening, I woke up to nice supple refreshed skin.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time using rose hip oil</li>
            <li> She wears a fair amount of makeup, which takes it&#x27;s toll on her skin, so she decided to try Rosehip Oil instead of her normal nighttime creams.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that this does absorb SUPER quickly and is a nice lightweight oil for moisturizing.</li>
            <li> it smells amazing, and I feel good that I&#x27;m only putting pure, healthy ingredients on my skin :)</li>
            <li> I noticed it also help fine wrinkle lines or &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34; around the eyes.</li>
            <li> It also helped tightened and reduced fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li> It helps with age spots, fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day for two weeks and my fine lines are deminishing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen some improvement with fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> wrinkles, fine lines, acne, rosacea, scars, stretch marks etc.</li>
            <li> And not to worry but the oil doesn&#x27;t really have a smell which I love!</li>
            <li> Nice large bottle.</li>
            <li> It is very light and soaks in right away, does not leave an oily feel at all.</li>
            <li> So when I was able to get it on promotion I was super excited about it.</li>
            <li> but it lasts forever because it&#x27;s a huge bottle.</li>
            <li> It also is a huge bottle for the amount you need .</li>
            <li> Did I mention that the bottle is HUGE?</li>
            <li> This is a huge bottle that came well packaged and protected.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product at a huge discount</li>
            <li> Huge bottle.</li>
            <li> Great product will definitely buy again!!!</li>
            <li> I noticed an immediate difference in my skin after I showered and it slid on smoothly.</li>
            <li> but my hair was silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily and am really happy with it.</li>
            <li> It works great as a carrier oil with essential oils.  </li>

            <li> This rosehip seed oil is smooth and absorbs well.</li>
            <li> Great carrier oil for my essential oils.</li>
            <li> Light and absorbs well.</li>
            <li> Comes with a dropper top and a solid twist off top for traveling, which is nice...</li>
            <li> It is filled with Vitamin C.  </li>
            <li> By far the best face cream so soft and my skin is so smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li> I prefer a cream that gets absorbed more.</li>
            <li> I also feel comfortable using it on my toddler son&#x27;s skin.  </li>

            <li> Very luxurious oil!!!  </li>
            <li> excellent product, rosehip is full of vitamin c which makes it a very good serum substitute since some serum have bad ingredients.</li>

            <li> I was given a significant discount to review this product.</li>

            <li> could go into the benefits of rosehip oil for hair (my curly hair loved using this oil as deep conditioning treatment), but what I think is</li>
            <li> So happy I was introduced to this beautiful, 100% Organic, Cold Pressed Rosehip Oil.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am very comfortable in highly recommending</li>
            <li> That oil retains the antioxidant rich properties of Rosehip oil while not leaving everything stained orange (a distinct problem with the unrefined oil).</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have super curly and frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> It makes the skin immediately silky and absorbs really quickly.</li>

            <li> It is fragrance free, light and very soothing to the skin.</li>
            <li> As good as the ridiculously expensive mail order kinds and at a great price</li>
            <li> I expected the rose hips to have a very pleasant aroma, instead it smelled like any other oil.  </li>
            <li> Makes my 66 year old skin feel more soft and more elastic!  </li>
            <li> I tried to use as makeup remover, and it exactly work with light make up ( not with eyes and lip).</li>
            <li> It definitely hydrates and protects, which is very important for me living in the desert!</li>

            <li> The reasons I loved this oil included the large bottle that it came with, the easy drop applicator, and the extremely minimal scent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> Great product of its type- nice light scent and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> But, most importantly the skin just soaks up this light  &#x27;dry&#x27; oil as it should, leaving no greasing residue.  </li>
            <li> It really helped giving my baby fine hair some volume.  </li>

            <li> This stuff is great, brilliant, and like it says, you only need a few drops, but I&#x27;m only giving it a 4 because it doesn&#x27;t soak into the skin as readily as I would like it to.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this oil for a couple of days, but so far I love it!  </li>
            <li> I was not compensated in any other way and this is my HONEST review.</li>
            <li> Rosehip is wonderful on aging skin an can help bring dull skin back to glowing skin.</li>
            <li> It is a very light golden with a faint pleasant natural fragrance.  </li>
            <li> used to buy different serums/oils for my face, hair and body because you need them all, right?&lt;br /&gt;These products cost more, yet smaller in ounces and weren&#x27;t always paraben/sulfate free.</li>
            <li> I am 66 in twenty seven days - pretty much beyond help UNTIL I tried this product.  </li>
            <li> My face is softer and gives me a fresh new day glow all of the time.</li>
            <li> I have even begun to use a few drops on my hair and the results have been pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> this absorbs so quickly and completely.....</li>
            <li> and I wake up to a super soft face .  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and leaves the skin feeling silky, soft and nourished.  </li>
            <li> A large four ounce bottle.  </li>
            <li> pure rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> Large bottle.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin very soft without leaving a sticky or oily residue on my skin like many other oils and lotions I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The fine line in my face Is  starting to fade.</li>
            <li> I added some to my lotion, the smell is pretty decent.</li>
            <li> so I am used to very high quality without a lot of fragrance and &amp;#34;fillers&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Love this product, it really helped my dry skin!</li>
            <li> I just tried it on my hands so far, and they feel really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Amazing results after just a few uses.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really looking forward to the whole line of products.</li>
            <li> This oil really irritated my face.</li>
            <li> I use it very day.</li>
            <li> I really really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I can not believe the difference so much</li>
            <li> Does not take much to do the job.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It really seems to moisturize.</li>
            <li> I have been using on my face before bedtime and waking up with really hydrated skin.  </li>
            <li> I also combine with my body lotion and it really softens areas like my elbows and feet.  </li>
            <li> I use it on the ends of my hair, really helps with dryness and frizz.</li>
            <li> Nor did it absorb very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> is that they did not put any additives in their oil or call it Rosehip oil when it&#x27;s really a blend of oils (a problem that occurs with valuable oils).  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> It really does what it says, it heals the skin, keeps the moisture locked in and the dryness out.</li>
            <li> It is soaked up by my skin very well and leave no oily feel or look.</li>
            <li> This review expresses my real opinion about this product.</li>
            <li> Rosehip oil is an important part of my daily skin care routine.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast as well.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> disappeared and the oil really helped to hydrate my skin by leaving a glow look.  </li>
            <li> Came lightening fast</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really moisturizing</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>

            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Really like this oil.</li>
            <li> Very soothing on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> and Ive noticed my foundation hoes on much smoother.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> After doing so, the oil becomes much thicker and cloudy in appearance.</li>
            <li> It work very well on my hair.</li>
            <li> Is very soothing product.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> but it works so well at absorbing.</li>
            <li> and this I believe to be because of the lightness and quickly absorbing formula.</li>
            <li> Thanks for offering this product at the discount...</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Very hydrating &amp; makes skin feel supple.</li>

            <li> Very earthy.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s working really</li>
            <li> and I have both been using Rosehip Oil - a few drops on our hands, rubbing it between our hands to warm it a bit and then massaging into our skin on our face and neck then our hands.</li>
            <li> love this it left my face so soft</li>
            <li> Although I only used it for a week, the deep wrinkles are still visble, but the fine lines under my eyes have significantly reduce.</li>
            <li> This product is phenomenal due to its&#x27; simple, organic, chemical free way of soothing skin.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so it&#x27;s a great value for your money.</li>
            <li> Better than other oil.</li>
            <li> due to that I am able to add it to my DYI lotions and creams and it</li>
            <li> was really excited when you told me about this essential oil!</li>
            <li> So far so good - I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it works yet.</li>
            <li> Recently I used Rosehip Oil directly on my face to help a spot on my face that was becoming raised and worried me.  </li>
            <li> Just started using so still waiting for a long time result, but so far I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> It does not have any of the characteristic strong scent of Rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product as it really improved my skin and hair conditions.  </li>
            <li> No rose smell of at all, but the oil is light and easily being absorb.</li>
            <li> I also had a bit of unexpected surgery, leaving me with a 4 inch scar I was less than thrilled with.</li>
            <li> I found this product through research and was presently surprised with the outcome I got just after the first use.</li>
            <li> My skin is very very dry because of winter and they hands soaked up 2 to 3 applications of this easily.</li>
            <li> Applied rose hip oil to my very dry calves and they improved immensely !</li>
            <li> I am amazed by how great it moisturized my dry hands, especially those dry cuticle.</li>
            <li> I put a couple of drops of this rosehip oil on them before bed and they are soft and smooth the next morning.  </li>
            <li> The oil dries quickly on your skin, but at the same time leaves it feeling moisturized and refreshed.</li>
            <li> My skin is visibly brighter, feels softer and my hair looks vibrant.</li>
            <li> After only using for a short while I am already noticing more hydrated, even toned skin on my face, neck and chest (the bottle is a generous size so why not apply it to those areas as well?).  </li>
            <li> It really makes my skin feel so soft too!</li>
            <li> This is a high quality oil.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comforting to know that the company uses high quality, organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> highly recommend......</li>
            <li> Highly recommended this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a week now and am pleased with the quality.  </li>
            <li> I put a little more on my face before bedtime</li>
            <li> Even though I received this oil at a modest discount in exchange for leaving a review, I find myself wishing I hadn&#x27;t even paid that much.</li>
            <li> It is very hydrating and makes your skin soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure about long term effects but it moisturizes really nicely and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy!</li>
            <li> is that it says to refrigerate to keep it fresh which makes total sense, but I worry that I won&#x27;t bother going to fetch the bottle from the kitchen before a shower.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin glows after just a few days of using it in the mornings.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the way this feels, doesn&#x27;t leave your face oily, I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see results yet!</li>
            <li> I normally buy Rosehip Oils from some brand names and cost me a lot.</li>
            <li> I am glad to report that the use of this oil has calmed this spot down and it is almost completely gone . . .</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try this Rosehip oil for a very long time because I was told that it keeps your skin really soft and smooth</li>
            <li> This oil soaked right into my skin immediately and didn&#x27;t leave any left over on my skin or film.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a licensed esthetican and rosehip is the new &amp;#34;it&amp;#34; ingredient.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to blending a new body oil for myself</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to blending a new body oil for myself</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without it!&lt;br /&gt;Buy</li>
            <li> Live the feeling of it on my skin.</li>
            <li> The Rosehip oil absorbs quickly into your skin leaving you feeling dry - not oily.  </li>
            <li> Many oils come in a wide array of refinements with different properties to each.  </li>
            <li> During the winter,  my skin becomes super dry to the point it hurts.</li>
            <li> I got this because I have super dry skin on my arms, and this has taken it away.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft.</li>
            <li> I use this nightly in lieu of a night cream and my face is very soft and hydrated in the morning</li>
            <li> for the short time I&#x27;ve used this product I like it very much.</li>
            <li> It also came with a dropper which made it easy to get it out with out a mess.</li>
            <li> the dropper is big enough that you don&#x27;t have to dip and squeeze more than once - That might now seem like a big deal</li>
            <li> it was exactly the incentive that I needed to continue not only using this product but looking into additional oils and how they can benefit me and my daughter.</li>
            <li> and im constantly washing my hands, either with hot soapy water or with hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li> So at the end of the day/week my hands are super dry, cracking, and sometimes even chapped!</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the size of the bottle!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Even after the first use I notice a big difference</li>
            <li> Will finish this bottle and definitely repurchase as I can use it in so many different applications which is a Big Bang for my buck.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin soft!</li>
            <li> It makes my face and skin look amazing and a little bit goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> My hair is really dry, so I warm a little of this oil in bowl and then massage it into my hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li> and wow, my skin and hair are so soft!</li>
            <li> My 4 yr old son hates lotions, he has very sensitive skin and the lotions tend to irritate him (even those for sensitive skin)</li>
            <li> Both of these types of Rosehip oils have an extremely nutty scent that dissipates quickly upon application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a chance to try this product a few months ago during a demonstration, and immediately had it as a priority for purchase when it came available.</li>
            <li> There are so many uses for this delicate oil, please investigate and treat yourself to this product.  </li>
            <li> , I would not recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old daughter</li>
            <li> It helps mature skin with hydration and wrinkle reduction.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a product to make a part of your daily beauty regimen, I highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li> noticed a big change on my skin it did give me a brightening effect, supple and rosy blush effect which I really like&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but so far my skin feels tighter and plumper.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for one week and my face is so soft.</li>
            <li> I was surprised it was clear and has no odor....</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I really want to try in my hair next.</li>
            <li> Just wonderfully soft skin.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s making my skin so soft</li>
            <li> My skin became soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I used it on my body and had baby soft skin.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and my wrinkles are softened.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 73 and a California girl who has seen way too much sun, but I still can&#x27;t resist setting out and getting my daily dose of vitamin D!</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and my wrinkles have softened.</li>
            <li> even though it&#x27;s an oil, I like how it doesn&#x27;t actually make my skin really oily.</li>
            <li> My face feels hydrated and I actually feel like I can wear it even without makeup because the shine is not to much.</li>
            <li> I used this in a face mask that I made and afterwards my skin felt both soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I am truly pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> At 55 yrs old I do not expect to look 18 ever again</li>
            <li> This oil leaves my dkin soft  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the bottle for the price.  </li>
            <li> but I could feel how soft it made my skin almost immediately..</li>
            <li> It is filled with fatty acids and antioxidants.</li>
            <li> Even tho im still young</li>
            <li> My natural color pops.</li>
            <li> and this oil helps to keep it moist and soft.</li>
            <li> I have used the rosehip oil for maybe a couple of weeks and the dryness has completely disappeared .</li>
            <li> I really like that I can spread it over my entire face, including my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your skin so soft and not greasy</li>
            <li> organic rosehip oil is a deep oil that can make the face oily looking if too much is applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I like to use natural products on it.</li>
            <li> I have been really pleased with the results I have seen over the last few days.</li>
            <li> It was so beyond worth the $23 spent, and I will be returning to this company once my oil runs out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days and my skin feels great...softer and generally more nourished.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to absorb more on my hands and a little goes a long way, so with this size bottle</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and live in Hollywood (where it&#x27;s super dry w no humidity).</li>
            <li> i was skeptical to put it on my face as i am prone to break outs, but it is so light and absorbs quickly leaving your skin feeling refreshed and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I have been using botanicals for many years and this oil acts responds to the skin as a top of the line 100% cold pressed organic Rosehip oil would be expected to.  </li>
            <li> But it was not one of the cheaper reviewer discounts I have gotten, and I just really value the characteristic properties of Rosehip oil which I do not find here.  </li>
            <li> Quite dry really.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soothing when it comes straight out of the refrigerator and put on dry skin.</li>
            <li> Try to use it alone at first then after a time like one month mix it with other oils</li>
            <li> I will give it another try since this has happened before with other products when I first try them.</li>
            <li> However, I would much rather buy a small bottle of this oil  if need be than a large bottle with a decent shelflife but lacking in the characteristic properties.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a softer texture with my skin, especially with my old acne scars.</li>
            <li> Apparently, it is just an ultra refined Rosehip oil.  </li>
            <li> I bought this with a coupon, really not expecting much.</li>
            <li> I got this mainly because I need something for my dry hands</li>
            <li> The next morning I washed my hair and it was soft</li>
            <li> Something about it being Rose HIP oil would lead me to wrongly believe that it would somehow smell like roses....</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> The product came carefully packaged and included an eye dropper large enough to screw atop the container for easier use.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old has very dry skin and cuticles and after just one application, I noticed a considerable difference.</li>
            <li> how soft, flat, and evenly colored the healing incision is!</li>
            <li> I received this the same day I spent too much time in the sun.</li>
            <li> It makes my face smooth and less dark circles</li>
            <li> They resolve quickly and without the deep cracking and bleeding that usually torment me this time of year.</li>
            <li> I think it is a little too lightweight for my super dry skin</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate so my skin always needs extra hydration.  </li>
            <li> I live in a semi-arid climate, and have been battling with dry skin on several areas of my body/face.</li>
            <li> I have been using it on my winter dry patches that have developed on my face.</li>
            <li> I struggle with eczema and so far it seems to be gentle enough and even improving a little bit!  </li>
            <li> Before starting my skin was sunburned and dry; and looked like a 64 year old’s skin.  </li>
            <li> So far so great!&lt;br /&gt;Living in the desert my skin and hair get very dry.</li>
            <li> The quality is high, not watered down like some brands.</li>
            <li> Which is a good and bad thing</li>
            <li> There is very little that can be used, as the open wounds and sensitive new skin cannot tolerate chemicals.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can blow dry with a round brush and totally skip the flat iron when I put this oil on my hair first.</li>
            <li> My new go to product for any dry, rough skin.  </li>
            <li> I really love the product, but it is hard to apply a small amount with the dropper.</li>
            <li> Once you open the bottle the color of it is a pale yellow and of a normal oily consistency.</li>
            <li> This is a big bottle and will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I received a broken eyedropper and was overnighted a whole new bottle.</li>
            <li> Being a nurse my hands are extremely dry from constant hand washing and alcohol foam.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Rosehip Oil daily; sometimes I reapply during the day if the weather is dry...  </li>
            <li> i have used this for several reasons eczema, dry cracked feet, moisturizer for my face and have even incorporated it into my hair routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on my face instead of my expensive creams, and it absorbs right in, doesn&#x27;t leave me oily or shiny, and makes my skin really soft.</li>
            <li> I mix it with other essential oils and use daily on hair and body......</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually using it on my very dry lips, as well as my face.</li>
            <li> The oil is lighter than I expected and the bottle actually larger.  </li>
            <li> So long as they can provide the paperwork to assure customers, I would not worry about that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having long hair and living in the desert always posses a challenge with keeping my skin and hair hydrated.  </li>
            <li> Nothing has ever proven helpful in the long term.</li>
            <li> Helped my daughters dry skin so much, especially after moving to a very dry climate.</li>
            <li> It revitalizes my dry hair and skin during a long winter.</li>
            <li> So long as they can provide the paperwork to assure customers, I would not worry about that.value the characteristic properties of Rosehip oil which I do not find here.  </li>
            <li> But seriously, I have noticed that my “crow’s feet” aren’t as large as they had been, so there is hope with continued use.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be looking into what other products they carry.</li>
            <li> just 4 drops goes a long way and soothes my dry skin!</li>
            <li> Has helped with dry spots.</li>
            <li> It also helps with the spots of dry skin on your body.  </li>
            <li> It is an aweome product to use on dry dkin...</li>
            <li> I have combination skin which depending on the season tends to get dry in winter.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> My dry skin was immediately revitalized.</li>
            <li> I did try it on my dry hands though, and I like the results.</li>
            <li> My face is combination oily and dry and this product works wonders.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my  dry hands at night before bed.</li>
            <li> I have some skin issues with dry patches.</li>
            <li> that is curly, dry and bleached.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 63, with dry skin, and my skin should gulp it up, but doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> From time to time for whatever reason my lips get really dry.  </li>
            <li> It is so hydrating and soothing on my face, which runs on the dry side...  </li>

            <li> She has had some issues with split ends this winter and was concerned about dry hair and skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also helped a lot with the dry skin on my elbows, which were cracking and hurt like heck.</li>
            <li> I use this on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have definitely noticed a difference in my skin, it has only been a few weeks</li>
            <li> For instance, you can buy avocado oil that is thick and bright green or avocado oil that is thin, transparent, and a pale yellow-green.  </li>
            <li> If I had read the previous reviews then I would have known prior that it was unscented.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry.</li>
            <li> It is very dry here in AZ so using oils and lotions is a must.</li>
            <li> My skin was very dry.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and have tried dozens of products.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> but I have very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> so I am thinking it will last a little while.</li>
            <li> I am use to it having a red tinge to it with a little earthy smell.</li>
            <li> I wish it would last a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> It only takes a few drops.  </li>
            <li> And it only takes a few drops to nourish your skin, so you don’t have to “oil” yourself up.  </li>
            <li> Minimal excess and</li>
            <li> but when you&#x27;re creating a &amp;#34;relaxed&amp;#34; mood, minimal efforts are best.&lt;br /&gt;While I was motivated to purchase this item at a reduced price</li>
            <li> Only after few applications, I have noticed the split ends on my hair</li>
            <li> It only takes a few drops.</li>
            <li> The order process and delivery was as expected with Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days</li>
            <li> you need only a few drops.</li>
            <li> I just used a few drops and massaged my scalp and left it in overnight.</li>
            <li> My  experience with refined Rosehip oil such as that sold by Foxbrim has been that it is a pale orange color.</li>
            <li> As you can see from the photo, it is an extremely pale yellow color.</li>
            <li> There was no left over residue that made my hair look flat or feel too soft  that I was unable to style my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair (down to my waist)</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise the rosehip oil makes a dramatic  difference.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face, neck, back of my hands and even a little in my curly hair!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way....</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t compete with other products.</li>
            <li> Makes sense why glycerine was added to it in other products.</li>
            <li> and I noticed small white heads.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s due to this oil.</li>
            <li> After one use, my rough elbows were already drastically softer!</li>
            <li> Sun spots have lightened slightly and my skin feels supple.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Seeing its an oil form you would expect it to be slight greasy but its not all all.</li>
            <li> Due to years of using prescribed cortisone creams, her body became addicted to the topical steroids.</li>
            <li> I tried a few drops on the ends of my hair and noticed I should have used one less drop</li>
            <li> Reviewing carrier oils can be a little tricky.</li>
            <li> hair just a little make it shine.  </li>
            <li> I used a little on my face and put a couple drops on my unruly hair.  </li>
            <li> Put in my hair at night also or if it gets a little frizzy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other lotions and oils in the past</li>
            <li> So at first I was disappointed, then I decided to still give it a try on my very dry hands and cuticles.</li>
            <li> Will diffidently reorder Rosehip Oil.</li>
            <li> I still have a few wrinkles, but I don’t recall the product claiming miracles.</li>
            <li> and I add a few drops to my shampoo for my hair too.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sorry to say this,  as I value any company that is striving to produce organic products and willing to allow me to try them out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is not uncommon with smaller and newer companies.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sorry to say this,  as I value any company that is striving to produce organic products and willing to allow me to try them out.   </li>
            <li> This is not uncommon with smaller and newer companies.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update in a few months.</li>
            <li> Received my bottle a few days ago and I may need a replacement soon.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this Rosehip Oil for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> Within recent months, I changed my unnecessary habit of buying &amp;#34;top shelf&amp;#34; skincare products.  </li>
            <li> In just a few weeks she&#x27;s seen a noticeable improvement in her complexion.  </li>
            <li> I can tell the difference just after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> At my Mother&#x27;s urging I began using a few drop of the rosehip oil on it twice a day.</li>
            <li> I use this as an everyday moisturizer</li>
            <li> An everyday part of my beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> used this as a scalp massage a few times.</li>
            <li> I plain to try it on my feet too.</li>
            <li> I used to take vitaminc tabs with rosehips as recommended besides just plain vitamin c</li>
            <li> Plain vitamin c was not helping.</li>
            <li> I usually put this on before putting moisturizer on and after using it for a few day, I think my skin is softer and brighter.</li>
            <li> I usually put 1-3 drops in my conditioner and a few drops in my face lotion every night.</li>
            <li> When those stopped working, she did her research and realized such prolonged use was actually making her &amp;#34;eczema&amp;#34; outbreaks the raging, painful attacks</li>
            <li> This oil is extremely greasy does not absorb into skin AT ALL!!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unbelievable when I use it with my unsented lotion.</li>
            <li> Have noticed small changes.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my hair after washing instead of my Moroccan Oil (not sure yet)</li>
            <li> Im not sure yet</li>
            <li> I, myself used it this past week</li>
            <li> Need some raw honey!  </li>
            <li> I am in my late sixties.  </li>
            <li> I get compliments on my skin lately.</li>
            <li> I had one serious patch that was raised</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a long tough cold  </li>
            <li> My skin had that paper thin look stating to come to it.  </li>

            <li> I am going to ditch my expensive hand cream and use it instead.</li>
            <li> I must say I was skeptical at the thought of putting oil on my face.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this oil does not meet either of those expectations.</li>
            <li> What makes designer products allude to being the &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; is merely a marketing scheme.  </li>
            <li> ill report again hopefully soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying expensive skincare products through the dermatologist since my 20s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been skeptical of adding an oil to my skincare routine</li>
            <li> I chose it because it is organic and cold pressed.</li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> This has been a bad winter for my skin.</li>
            <li> In 24 hours after applying the oil, the itching is gone and the painful bumps have shrunk dramatically.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed that it didn&#x27;t smell like roses though.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>

            <li> I love the rosehip oil.  What a change in my skin.  My skin is much healthier looking and it makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li> It is finally available! I had a chance to try this product a few months ago during a demonstration, and immediately had it as a priority for purchase when it came available. It is a fantastic product, at a great value, made from the purest ingredients, by knowledgeable people.  I was impressed with the results on the first try.</li>
            <li> So far so great!&lt;br /&gt;Living in the desert my skin and hair get very dry. Organic rose hip oil is working well for me. No build up on my hair at all. My skin happily drinks it up yet no feeling of residual oil. Hair and skin feel soft!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for both men and women as it doesn&#x27;t have any scent and it&#x27;s so easy to use. I&#x27;m really looking forward to the whole line of products.</li>
            <li> love that it is so lightweight! i was skeptical to put it on my face as i am prone to break outs, but it is so light and absorbs quickly leaving your skin feeling refreshed and hydrated. it&#x27;s also a great value for the price- nice big bottle! would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a week now and am pleased with the quality.  The oil is lighter than I expected and the bottle actually larger.  I&#x27;m actually using it on my very dry lips, as well as my face.</li>
            <li> great quality rosehip!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have been using if for my face, hair and hands. I doesnt make face hair and hands and greasy at all as it soaks right through right away. My face and hands are so soft, i love it. Also, it is fragrant free!</li>
            <li> Love love love this oil! I use it on my skin and hair, and am very impressed with how it leaves my skin soft, and moisturized, and my hair shiny and strong.</li>
            <li> I just started using this as one of my night time routines for my face and i must say it is amazing.  It makes my face smooth and less dark circles</li>
            <li> Excited about this great product! Being a nurse my hands are extremely dry from constant hand washing and alcohol foam. I have seen such an improvement since using this oil. Love it!</li>
            <li> I use oils on my skin a lot in the winter and this is definitely my new favorite.  Not only does it make my skin and hair look better but it lasts forever because it&#x27;s a huge bottle.</li>
            <li> My husband likes me to massage his face with this, and he says it feels good on his wind chapped skin.</li>
            <li> I love using this on my face after a shower! just 4 drops goes a long way and soothes my dry skin!</li>
            <li> This is so great and I love it. I always use it after taking a shower and it is just really good to the dry skin.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an argan oil alternative and thought this was the best solution after reading reviews.  After the first evening, I woke up to nice supple refreshed skin.  After the second evening I got three deep pimples on my cheek an I don&#x27;t get pimples on my cheek.  I read that it&#x27;s best to blend rosehip oil with another oil, so I will try it again after my pimples heal.</li>
            <li> This is a great all around product to have in your home. This one is very thin perfect for application or use It has a very lite smell, not heavy like many others do.It shipped very quickly and the seller is very friendly.</li>
            <li> So happy I was introduced to this beautiful, 100% Organic, Cold Pressed Rosehip Oil.  I have been using botanicals for many years and this oil acts responds to the skin as a top of the line 100% cold pressed organic Rosehip oil would be expected to.  It is a very light golden with a faint pleasant natural fragrance.  But, most importantly the skin just soaks up this light  &#x27;dry&#x27; oil as it should, leaving no greasing residue.  The skin uses it all.  This denotes its purity.  It only takes a few drops.  I use it on my hair and skin.  There are so many uses for this delicate oil, please investigate and treat yourself to this product.  A large four ounce bottle.  Your skin will love you for using this.</li>
            <li> Great oil. I love using this in my acne prone skin. This has been a bad winter for my skin. It just drinks this up!</li>
            <li> Amazing product for an amazing price! It brightens my skin and makes it look smoother. :)</li>
            <li> great for your skin, scars, blemishes, wrinkles, great stuff try it!</li>
            <li> pure rosehip oil. i&#x27;m using it for stretchmarks. a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I love it sooooooo much ... It has an immediate effect on my skin and my hair ... I have always a problem on summer ... But with rosehip it reduce these problems ... I just want to see the effect on strechmarks ... I&#x27;m sure it is going to be good.. Try to use it alone at first then after a time like one month mix it with other oils</li>
            <li> i really love this product, you only need about two drops to apply it absorbs quickly and i have used it on my face, hands and hair. It really helped giving my baby fine hair some volume.  Will diffidently reorder Rosehip Oil.</li>
            <li> Exelent, im an alergic, sensitiv skin person and it is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> If I had read the previous reviews then I would have known prior that it was unscented. Something about it being Rose HIP oil would lead me to wrongly believe that it would somehow smell like roses.... WRONG! It DOES NOT SMELL LIKE ROSES! In face it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything at all, it&#x27;s unscented! So at first I was disappointed, then I decided to still give it a try on my very dry hands and cuticles. It absorbed very quickly and didn&#x27;t leave me feeling overly greasy. I haven&#x27;t put it on my face or hair as yet, but I&#x27;m sure I will try it. It&#x27;s a generous amount in the bottle and you do not need a lot for each application so I am thinking it will last a little while.</li>
            <li> I received my rosehip oil on 07/01/15.  I started using it that day.  Before starting my skin was sunburned and dry; and looked like a 64 year old’s skin.  I am currently 54.  My skin had that paper thin look stating to come to it.  I spend a lot of time working outdoors in the summer and it has taken a toll on my skin. I have been using this Organic Rosehip oil for nine day, twice a day now for nine days, and have seen good results.  My skin looks firmer, and it no longer has that paper thin look on my arms.  My eyes aren’t as wrinkled as they were.  I still have a few wrinkles, but I don’t recall the product claiming miracles. But seriously, I have noticed that my “crow’s feet” aren’t as large as they had been, so there is hope with continued use.  I have been really pleased with the results I have seen over the last few days. The Rosehip oil absorbs quickly into your skin leaving you feeling dry - not oily.  And it only takes a few drops to nourish your skin, so you don’t have to “oil” yourself up.  This really is a good product to use; I have been reviewing this product for the UberZon Club, and I am glad I chose to review this one.  I would recommend it to all my family and friends.  Well worth the money I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  So many different applications.</li>
            <li> I love it !!! This is really a good quality.</li>
            <li> This oil really irritated my face. It was red and inflamed, I would not recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So excited to receive this!  I have heard nothing but fabulous things :)</li>
            <li> This is a high quality oil. Recommended.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin smooth and my hands obsorb it so well! I am going to ditch my expensive hand cream and use it instead. I am amazed by how great it moisturized my dry hands, especially those dry cuticle. Love it!</li>
            <li> I like a lot. no smell moisture my skin. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Very good quality oil.</li>
            <li> I like the organic oil to care my hair . My hair is very dry. After several days use. It&#x27;s becomes better than before.</li>
            <li> Great product will definitely buy again!!!</li>
            <li> I put it on my hands it instantly melted into my skin leaving it looking moist. Love this oil!</li>
            <li> This is better then any lotion only with out sun protection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very quickly learning why everyone has taken to oils for so many uses in their homes.  My 6 year old daughter and I have both been using Rosehip Oil - a few drops on our hands, rubbing it between our hands to warm it a bit and then massaging into our skin on our face and neck then our hands. I know that we have made this part of our routine and it&#x27;s quite relaxing. As for the packaging - Smart! Minimal excess and the dropper is big enough that you don&#x27;t have to dip and squeeze more than once - That might now seem like a big deal but when you&#x27;re creating a &amp;#34;relaxed&amp;#34; mood, minimal efforts are best.&lt;br /&gt;While I was motivated to purchase this item at a reduced price it was exactly the incentive that I needed to continue not only using this product but looking into additional oils and how they can benefit me and my daughter.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!  I didn&#x27;t know about rosehip oil and can tell you I use it very day. I just is all over my body and face and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li> Unlike some reviews, my oil has barely any scent which is a HUGE plus because I have sensitive skin and break out / rash easily from scented lotions and oils. I noticed an immediate difference in my skin after I showered and it slid on smoothly. I tried a few drops on the ends of my hair and noticed I should have used one less drop but my hair was silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> great product.  love the texture and the difference it has made in my skin.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be oily but it isn&#x27;t. Has helped with dry spots. Feels very clean, dries nice. I didn&#x27;t see any difference in wrinkles after using it for a week though. I even took pictures to compare after as week... No changes. But great moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!!! Easily absorbed into my skin and hair. Light weight and non greasy!!! I&#x27;m very pleased!!!</li>
            <li> I really love this! Wish I would have known about it sooner! I work in health care and im constantly washing my hands, either with hot soapy water or with hand sanitizer. So at the end of the day/week my hands are super dry, cracking, and sometimes even chapped! Once I heard was rosehip oil could do I was so excited to try it! This bottle of rosehip oil comes in a large 4 oz amber glass bottle with a glass eye dropper! Once you open the bottle the color of it is a pale yellow and of a normal oily consistency. Once I put it on my hands it instantly melted into my skin leaving it looking moist (but not greasy) and supple! And not to worry but the oil doesn&#x27;t really have a smell which I love! These 4 oz&#x27;s will probably be gone quicker that I think but I cannot wait to get more!</li>
            <li> Uuummm why have I never heard of Rosehip before? It&#x27;s unbelievable when I use it with my unsented lotion. I can&#x27;t wait to try it on my hair!</li>
            <li> I really really like this stuff. I&#x27;m a licensed esthetican and rosehip is the new &amp;#34;it&amp;#34; ingredient. I&#x27;ve been using this daily and am really happy with it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, my hands, knuckles especially, get so dry in the winter months.  Got this and have been using it for a week now and I can not believe the difference so much so my husband has started using it.  Keep it handy, so many uses .  WORKS GREAT</li>
            <li> Great product! It absorbs easily into the skin, making it feel soft and clean (not greasy). I look forward to using it in my skincare products and plan to try it in my hair per the bottle&#x27;s instructions. Beyond being a great product, the customer service is outstanding! I received a broken eyedropper and was overnighted a whole new bottle.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer without being greasy.  Does not take much to do the job.  Fine lines disappear and skin is very soft.</li>
            <li> Love this! I have only been using for a week so I&#x27;m not sure about long term effects but it moisturizes really nicely and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy! No smell to it</li>
            <li> skin loving oil great for scars and I love this oil and will definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> I was given a significant discount to review this product. I was surprised at the size of the bottle! It was such a nice size! The oil absorbs very quickly &amp; does not have a smell. The oil feels rejuvenating! I am excited about summer &amp; I think this will help with being out in the sun and restoring my moisture. Great to add to lotion or facial moisturizer to really amp it up! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This rosehip oil is so nourishing for your skin.  It helps mature skin with hydration and wrinkle reduction.  It also helps with the spots of dry skin on your body.  I have also used this in my homemade butters, it helps with skin softening.  It works great as a carrier oil with essential oils.  It doesn&#x27;t stain your clothing if you spill it or if it is still moist when you get dressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is great and the dropper is packaged separately, It comes safety sealed and I had no problems with leaking.  I would purchase this one again.</li>
            <li> Great oil for skin and I add a few drops to my shampoo for my hair too.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I Love this Oil! It is very light and soaks in right away, does not leave an oily feel at all. I use it on my face, neck, back of my hands and even a little in my curly hair! It is a large bottle which is great. Recently, I have been adding it to my body lotion and it does not have any smell so it doesn&#x27;t compete with other products. I will defiantly be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> WORKED AMAZING!! LOVED IT!</li>
            <li> love this it left my face so soft</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. It feels so smooth on my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face. It is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Wonderful natural oil. Have been using it on my face, hands &amp; even in hair. Lovely scent.</li>
            <li> I tried to use as makeup remover, and it exactly work with light make up ( not with eyes and lip). I added some to my lotion, the smell is pretty decent. However, my male friends said they are not big fan of it...Women are from Venus, Men can go back to their Mars.</li>
            <li> Using this in my nightly face serum!!  Very luxurious oil!!!  Nice light smell!</li>
            <li> It is an aweome product to use on dry dkin...Totally amazing instant results. I really like the results of smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Buyer beware: there is no USDA certified organic label on the bottle!</li>
            <li> This rosehip seed oil is smooth and absorbs well. Worth the cost. I use mine for homemade beauty products.</li>
            <li> Love this oil.  Makes my 66 year old skin feel more soft and more elastic!  Should skin feel like elastic?  I can tell difference in lines around eyes and mouth.  Will buy again</li>
            <li> Nice product and i like that it is organic.</li>
            <li> The product came carefully packaged and included an eye dropper large enough to screw atop the container for easier use. The oil is very lightweight and non-greasy, perfect for my acne-prone skin. I have noticed a softer texture with my skin, especially with my old acne scars. It definitely hydrates and protects, which is very important for me living in the desert! I have even begun to use a few drops on my hair and the results have been pretty amazing. If you&#x27;re looking for a product to make a part of your daily beauty regimen, I highly recommend this one!</li>

            <li> i love it&lt;br /&gt;Useful Products</li>
            <li> I suffer from Psioriasis and nothing I have tried has helped.  I heard about the benefits of Rosehip Oil so I thought I would try it.  In 24 hours after applying the oil, the itching is gone and the painful bumps have shrunk dramatically.  First impressions are very positive and I will continue to use this product.  If I find relief in 24 hours, imagine using this every day.  Bottle states this is 100% Rosehip Oil, no added chemicals.

            <li> I must say I was skeptical at the thought of putting oil on my face. I have combination skin which depending on the season tends to get dry in winter. I have used this for one week and my face is so soft. I put about four to five drops on my face at night and actually put it on in the morning after I get out of the shower. I then apply my foundation and my face is not greasy or oily. I love this product. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> this absorbs so quickly and completely.....I was surprised it was clear and has no odor....I am use to it having a red tinge to it with a little earthy smell. I just tried it on my hands so far, and they feel really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Love it, goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing but light weight. Really love this oil. Skin feels great.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product and it made my skin soft and smooth. Only drawback is that it has to be refrigerated, according to bottle,  so I forget it is there.</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked fresh, young, and clean in forever! Love it!</li>
            <li> Applied rose hip oil to my very dry calves and they improved immensely !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this oil for a couple of days, but so far I love it!  It&#x27;s an oil, but it&#x27;s not too heavy and it feels SO good on my skin.  Absorbs well.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  I haven&#x27;t seen any miracles but I have been using it for about 10 days.  It really seems to moisturize.</li>
            <li> I love it and def will buy again!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product! My hair has never looked better! I can blow dry with a round brush and totally skip the flat iron when I put this oil on my hair first.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using rose hip oil and I&#x27;m really impressed.  I live in a dry climate so my skin always needs extra hydration.  I have been using on my face before bedtime and waking up with really hydrated skin.  I also combine with my body lotion and it really softens areas like my elbows and feet.  After reading the reviews I really want to try in my hair next.</li>
            <li> Great carrier oil for my essential oils. Light and absorbs well. Has a pleasant smell and the dropper is very useful.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I use it on my face and arms, noticing softer skin. I use it on the ends of my hair, really helps with dryness and frizz. I think my hair is in better condition since I have been using this product. Thank you for such a good product.</li>
            <li> Most oils leave a greasy film on my skin, this oil does not, my skin feels softer and blemishes are healing faster.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely spectacular, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.  I&#x27;ve already noticed a visibly reduction in the fine lines and wrinkles on my face, and it&#x27;s done an amazing job hydrating my dry skin.  It&#x27;s non greasy and super light, and it smells amazing.  It&#x27;s comforting to know that the company uses high quality, organic ingredients.  I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Great product! Would buy again</li>
            <li> Great product of its type- nice light scent and a little goes a long way! Comes with a dropper top and a solid twist off top for traveling, which is nice...</li>
            <li> I received this the same day I spent too much time in the sun. It couldn&#x27;t have arrived at a better time. My thighs were very sunburned and I rubbed this beautiful oil all over my legs and nothing happened. No pain, peeling... Nothing. Just wonderfully soft skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great products. It leaves my skin feeling and smelling great</li>
            <li> Reviewing carrier oils can be a little tricky. Many oils come in a wide array of refinements with different properties to each.  For instance, you can buy avocado oil that is thick and bright green or avocado oil that is thin, transparent, and a pale yellow-green.  And it can be a matter of preference or of the particular use in mind as to what kind of refinement you prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Rosehip oil  that has not been refined is a deep orange color. My  experience with refined Rosehip oil such as that sold by Foxbrim has been that it is a pale orange color. That oil retains the antioxidant rich properties of Rosehip oil while not leaving everything stained orange (a distinct problem with the unrefined oil). It makes the skin immediately silky and absorbs really quickly. Both of these types of Rosehip oils have an extremely nutty scent that dissipates quickly upon application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Unfortunately, this oil does not meet either of those expectations. As you can see from the photo, it is an extremely pale yellow color. It does not have any of the characteristic strong scent of Rosehip oil. In fact, I could not detect any scent at all.  And I did not find that it left my skin silky. Nor did it absorb very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do like about this brand is that they did not put any additives in their oil or call it Rosehip oil when it&#x27;s really a blend of oils (a problem that occurs with valuable oils).  Apparently, it is just an ultra refined Rosehip oil.  I am guessing that the extra refinement  must help the shelflife of an oil that otherwise has a particularly short shelflife. However, I would much rather buy a small bottle of this oil  if need be than a large bottle with a decent shelflife but lacking in the characteristic properties. Even though I received this oil at a modest discount in exchange for leaving a review, I find myself wishing I hadn&#x27;t even paid that much. I&#x27;ll find uses for it I&#x27;m sure. But it was not one of the cheaper reviewer discounts I have gotten, and I just really value the characteristic properties of Rosehip oil which I do not find here.  I was looking forward to blending a new body oil for myself that would be silky and quick absorbing.  I&#x27;m very sorry to say this,  as I value any company that is striving to produce organic products and willing to allow me to try them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Customers may also want to notice that while at this time there is no USDA seal on the oil, in the customer question and answer section, the company clarifies that they are certified but are awaiting some paperwork and so forth to be able to put the seal on next Spring.  This is not uncommon with smaller and newer companies.  So long as they can provide the paperwork to assure customers, I would not worry about that.value the characteristic properties of Rosehip oil which I do not find here.

            <li> Love that it is 100% organic or I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it.  Nice large bottle. So far so good - I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it works yet. I&#x27;ll update in a few months.</li>
            <li> Wonderful service and product!!</li>
            <li> My mother is using this and it&#x27;s really helping her aging skin on her arms!  We love it.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness what a great deal on Rosehip oil.  I  use one oz rosehip oil w/ 10 drops of lavender essential oil and put on my face at night time and I wake up to a super soft face .  I love that this company does NoT test on animals.  Very good  quality.</li>
            <li> I expected the rose hips to have a very pleasant aroma, instead it smelled like any other oil.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Great product, will purchase again. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> This Oil is great!!! It really does what it says, it heals the skin, keeps the moisture locked in and the dryness out. I live in a semi-arid climate, and have been battling with dry skin on several areas of my body/face. This oil has taken care of any problem areas that I may have had before. I I can place cira 4-5 drops on my forehead and spread it all over my face, yes it spreads that well. It is soaked up by my skin very well and leave no oily feel or look. Love this oil, it is exactly what I have been looking for. So this product is a winner in my book. I can honestly highly recommend this product. I count on Amazon reviews when I make purchases, and know that others do the same. I would never want to influence anyone to make a product purchase, which I don&#x27;t believe is worth buying. If my review is helpful, let me know by checking helpful. This review expresses my real opinion about this product.</li>
            <li> Felt neutral about this product. Don&#x27;t think it is actually benefiting my hair condition</li>
            <li> Received my bottle a few days ago and I may need a replacement soon.  I&#x27;ve used it as a hair mask (wonderful), leave-in conditioner/smoother (works great and leaves my hair soft and not greasy), and as an all over body moisturizer (LOVE IT!). My 4 yr old son hates lotions, he has very sensitive skin and the lotions tend to irritate him (even those for sensitive skin), I used this oil and there was no fussing or chasing him down, he loved it. In fact, he now reminds me about putting on his oil.  I&#x27;ve used it on my face instead of my expensive creams, and it absorbs right in, doesn&#x27;t leave me oily or shiny, and makes my skin really soft.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, dry patches on my face cleared. It did a great job moisturizing my skin and its not oily or messy...the skin absorbs it easily. I use it at night time and during the day under my sunblock.  Product arrived in good packaging.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about this product that will let you know how pleased I was able to purchase it at a discount.  I have been using it on my winter dry patches that have developed on my face. I had one serious patch that was raised and because I have had Basel cell carcinoma I have to watch my skin closely.  I know that Rose Hips are filled with&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have known for years that Rosehip Oil is a very important ingredient in cosmetics as an antioxidant and used in cancer prevention.  It is filled with Vitamin C.  Recently I used Rosehip Oil directly on my face to help a spot on my face that was becoming raised and worried me.  I have had spots of basel cell carcinoma  removed on my face 2x so I watch spots like this closely.  I am glad to report that the use of this oil has calmed this spot down and it is almost completely gone . . . So happy that I ordered this when it was offered to me at at discount.  And even happier to report that I have such good results with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oils for a couple of weeks now and I&#x27;m in love! I have dry skin so I put it on my face at night and it&#x27;s making my skin so soft, my fine lines are less visible and the best part is that it&#x27;s not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also loving it on my body and specially on my cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t live without it!&lt;br /&gt;Buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This oil is so so nice. It have been putting it on my skin &amp; already see that my skin looks softer. It really makes my skin feel so soft too!</li>
            <li> This product is great! I used it on my arms and legs. It is very dry here in AZ so using oils and lotions is a must. This oil soaked right into my skin immediately and didn&#x27;t leave any left over on my skin or film. My skin became soft and moisturized. I was concerned that I would feel oily but that was not the case. I have fallen in love with this Rosehip oil. I chose it because it is organic and cold pressed. Well worth it! I will keep this on hand. Loving this product!</li>
            <li> this is a great product!!</li>
            <li> Rosehip oil is an important part of my daily skin care routine.  100% organic (a must), no animal testing, and an easy-to-use dropper bottle make this product great!  Shipping was fast as well.</li>
            <li> This oil is extremely greasy does not absorb into skin AT ALL!!!  It may be good but how can you use such an oily product???</li>
            <li> I just started using it.  A non greasy oil.  Quite dry really.  Makes sense why glycerine was added to it in other products.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I have only used it for a short time.  Therefore, I do not know if the products works or not.</li>
            <li> Nice! I&#x27;m very happy with this oil.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I am very pleased. I have used it on my skin to sooth some irritation and dryness. Glad that it&#x27;s natural. Looking forward to having it around for a variety of uses.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer ever. It makes my skin smooth and hydrated !  I love it !!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS OIL! First, I love that it is not tested on animals. Second, I am using this as a carrier for my essential oils that I apply to my face.  It does not feel at all greasy and it does not smell! My skin feels very soft. Excellent! I will order again!</li>
            <li> This is like magic in a bottle. My dry skin was immediately revitalized. I used this under my eyes and on my forehead and wrinkles were erased. I used it on my body and had baby soft skin. Any traces of stretch marks I was worried about have vanished. TRY IT TODAY.</li>
            <li> By far the best face cream so soft and my skin is so smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product as it really improved my skin and hair conditions.  Only after few applications, I have noticed the split ends on my hair disappeared and the oil really helped to hydrate my skin by leaving a glow look.  It also helped tightened and reduced fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li> My skin looks great on my face since I have been using the Rosehip Oil.  I am just now getting into using organic/natural products and I&#x27;m glad I started with this because it has me sold!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Came lightening fast and I used it to make bath bombs. Came out beautifully and worked well with the other bath bomb ingredients. I will purchase more for my next batches. Great quality and price.</li>
            <li> The oil is terrific and one of the best such oils I have used. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Soothing oil - great for face and body. Smoothing and absorbs easily.</li>
            <li> Received roseoil at reduced price for my opinion.  Rosehip oil helps moisturize my skin.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I really love the product, but it is hard to apply a small amount with the dropper.</li>
            <li> I like that this rosehip oil is organic. I tried it on my face and found it to be a bit too oily for my taste. I prefer a cream that gets absorbed more. I did try it on my dry hands though, and I like the results. It seemed to absorb more on my hands and a little goes a long way, so with this size bottle I imagine it lasting for quite a while. I plan to try it on my hair to see what effects it has. One hang-up I have that isn&#x27;t a big deal is that it says to refrigerate to keep it fresh which makes total sense, but I worry that I won&#x27;t bother going to fetch the bottle from the kitchen before a shower.</li>
            <li> Great product great price! I have been using this Rosehip Oil for a few weeks now and I can already tell a difference in my skin. My face is combination oily and dry and this product works wonders. My face is softer and gives me a fresh new day glow all of the time. I also use it on my  dry hands at night before bed. I highly recommend it and I love that it&#x27;s organic.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I was actually given a discount to review this and I am impressed. I have some skin issues with dry patches. This improved my skin. It didn&#x27;t leave it with an oily feeling at all . I plain to try it on my feet too. It also is a huge bottle for the amount you need . It only takes a few drops. It will easily last a year or more.  It also came with a dropper which made it easy to get it out with out a mess.</li>
            <li> This oil feels incredible on my skin. Had a patch that nothing I used would get rid of. This did the trick withou feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Great quality product. made my hair stronger and more moisturized than before.</li>
            <li> Great. Love how soft my skin is. So happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Just started using so still waiting for a long time result, but so far I love the way it makes my skin feel. A little goes a long way, so it&#x27;s a great value for your money.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review because I was traded for it. Excellent product. Works great as expexted.</li>
            <li> Love the way the organic rosehip oil makes my skin feel.  My skin feels soft and my wrinkles are softened.  I am in my late sixties.  Much to my surprise the rosehip oil makes a dramatic  difference.</li>
            <li> Live the feeling of it on my skin. Mixed with my Jajoba breathes life back into my skin instantly. Since you should refrigerate it, the cook sensation helps wake me up as well</li>
            <li> Love it.. will buy again</li>
            <li> Excellent oil product! Very useful and smells like heaven!</li>
            <li> I love this product.I would recommend</li>
            <li> Delivery was great and so far I&#x27;ve enjoyed the product without any adverse effects.  It&#x27;s really moisturizing and I&#x27;ve even gotten compliments on my skin!  I&#x27;m 73 and a California girl who has seen way too much sun, but I still can&#x27;t resist setting out and getting my daily dose of vitamin D!</li>
            <li> The oil came quickly and packaged well. I&#x27;ve been using it on my hair that is curly, dry and bleached. It helped a lot. I Tried it onece on my face that is oily and prone to brake outs and I noticed small white heads. I will give it another try since this has happened before with other products when I first try them. Overall I&#x27;m happy with this rose hip oil and would recommend. Ps this is also a hudge bottle and gray for the price.</li>
            <li> Rosehip is wonderful on aging skin an can help bring dull skin back to glowing skin. I add a drop of this to a vitamin c oil and love the result. I&#x27;ve been able to see a nice change in my mothers skin after I asked her to use it for a week. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I just received my rose hip oil yesterday..,used it today and my skin feels sublime. Packaging was perfect w a drop applicator was enclosed. Feels perfect.</li>
            <li> Great value, and many uses. I have oily skin, but this works wonderfully on my skin. I get compliments on my skin lately. I think it&#x27;s due to this oil. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Rosehip oil is an Excellent product!  Smells heavenly,  My skin feels soft and my wrinkles have softened. Also like using in&lt;br /&gt;my hair just a little make it shine.  I love that 100% Organic. It is also Great for my rough skin and cracked heels.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, brilliant, and like it says, you only need a few drops, but I&#x27;m only giving it a 4 because it doesn&#x27;t soak into the skin as readily as I would like it to. I&#x27;m 63, with dry skin, and my skin should gulp it up, but doesn&#x27;t. And, yes, I&#x27;m storing it in the frig, as said.</li>
            <li> Love the oil.  My skin was very dry.  After using this oil, my skin has transformed to healthy and glow.  This is an all-in-one oil perfect for face and body.  I finally find my favorite oil.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Within recent months, I changed my unnecessary habit of buying &amp;#34;top shelf&amp;#34; skincare products.  I switched over to more natural lines for good reasons.&lt;br /&gt;I used to buy different serums/oils for my face, hair and body because you need them all, right?&lt;br /&gt;These products cost more, yet smaller in ounces and weren&#x27;t always paraben/sulfate free. What makes designer products allude to being the &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; is merely a marketing scheme.  One that I refuse to participate in anymore!&lt;br /&gt;Except cosmetics like mascara:)&lt;br /&gt;The Rosehip Oil has a mild scent which is nice, I detest overbearing aromas for skincare products. It is lightweight and has just the right consistency you would be looking for in an oil.  I used a little on my face and put a couple drops on my unruly hair.  So far my hair feels wonderfully soft and I am impressed by how the oil absorbed into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I actually received this product for a discount and I will BUY this full price when I run out!&lt;br /&gt;Helping smaller businesses who make quality products is a rewarding thing to do...</li>
            <li> I love this product.  From time to time for whatever reason my lips get really dry.  I put a couple of drops of this rosehip oil on them before bed and they are soft and smooth the next morning.  Also use on my feet to keep them extra smooth.  My new go to product for any dry, rough skin.  It really works and it is organic so no need to worry about what you are doing to your body.  Highly recommend !!!</li>
            <li> This is a quality oil! I&#x27;ve been using on my face on and off when needed and am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful skin care product.  I am a big fan of Rose hip Oil and this seems to be high quality.  It absorbs quickly ans leave a skin feeling soft and smooth. It helps with age spots, fine lines and wrinkles. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I am surprisingly itching from it. Had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> Nephew has eczema. It works wonders on calming the flare up.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this oil! This company was easy to work it, shipped on time, and packaged my product safely so that there was no breakage. The oil dries quickly on your skin, but at the same time leaves it feeling moisturized and refreshed. I love the way my skin glows after just a few days of using it in the mornings. :) Big thumbs up to the company for providing a safe and organic way of moisturizing your skin. Did I mention that the bottle is HUGE? It was so beyond worth the $23 spent, and I will be returning to this company once my oil runs out. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Such a wonderful product!  It is so hydrating and soothing on my face, which runs on the dry side...  The company provided me with a recipe for a hydrating mask using Rosehip Oil and I am looking forward to trying it!  Need some raw honey!  I have been using the Rosehip Oil daily; sometimes I reapply during the day if the weather is dry...  Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> I am 66 in twenty seven days - pretty much beyond help UNTIL I tried this product.  It is magnificent and the kindest most excellent deed I have ever done for myself.  The viscous nature of Rosehip Oil put me off right off at first (pore clogs, etc.) - BUT fear not.  It is simply the balls.  Just call me Cleopatra.</li>
            <li> Put this on your clean face before Argan Oil and you WILL feel a difference!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I love using it in the hand cream I make. Love that it is 100% organic</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! It was shipped quickly, arrived in perfect condition, and was much larger than I expected. I will definitely be looking into what other products they carry. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have always been a big fan to essiantian oils. When I saw this I thought I have to give it a try. And to my surprise, this bottle works really great. Although I only used it for a week, the deep wrinkles are still visble, but the fine lines under my eyes have significantly reduce.</li>
            <li> This rosehip oil is amazing!  I have very dry skin and have tried dozens of products.  This oil absorbs quickly and has no greasy residue.  It keeps my skin moisturized for hours.  Since it&#x27;s organic I also feel comfortable using it on my toddler son&#x27;s skin.  He has eczema and this product helps with his dryness and itching.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I really like this product! It smells nice and even though it&#x27;s an oil, I like how it doesn&#x27;t actually make my skin really oily. I usually put this on before putting moisturizer on and after using it for a few day, I think my skin is softer and brighter. I think this product is really good and I would definitely recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t express how impressed I am with the company as well as the product just after one purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having long hair and living in the desert always posses a challenge with keeping my skin and hair hydrated.  I found this product through research and was presently surprised with the outcome I got just after the first use. The product arrived within 2 days of placing the order and was packaged well!!  I immediately did a hair mask for 30 minutes and after washing it out and styling my hair for the day it was as if my hair turned to silk.  There was no left over residue that made my hair look flat or feel too soft  that I was unable to style my hair. I will continue to use this product on my hair as well as my skin to keep it healthy and looking young.  Thank you, AntiAging!</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try this Rosehip oil for a very long time because I was told that it keeps your skin really soft and smooth especially if you wear it underneath your make up. So when I was able to get it on promotion I was super excited about it. I am currently wearing it under my make up and after wash my face I put a little more on my face before bedtime and I do notice a difference. My face feels hydrated and I actually feel like I can wear it even without makeup because the shine is not to much.</li>
            <li> My gf and I love this product!  She wears a fair amount of makeup, which takes it&#x27;s toll on her skin, so she decided to try Rosehip Oil instead of her normal nighttime creams.  In just a few weeks she&#x27;s seen a noticeable improvement in her complexion.  The Rosehip seems to hydrate her skin, instead of drying it out like the creams did.  For me, it&#x27;s great to use on my hands after doing chores or the dishes.  I recommend giving it a try!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth to buy. Really big bottle and 100% organic which makes me feel safe to give it a try. Love it.</li>
            <li> Just started using. Hopefully it works</li>
            <li> Amazing results after just a few uses.  It is not oily or greasy and absorbs into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li> Really like this oil. Soft and light, no discernible fragrance. Very soothing on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> Feeling refreshed. Put in my hair at night also or if it gets a little frizzy. My pores on my face look better already.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! I use it for everything!</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff, my wife loves it and even uses it for her hair</li>
            <li> I have used this on several areas where I have scars.  I can tell the difference just after a few weeks.  They are lighter.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I use this nightly in lieu of a night cream and my face is very soft and hydrated in the morning</li>
            <li> Bought this rosehip oil because I&#x27;m a mother of 4 and it&#x27;s cold/flu season. Every winter I wish my hands many many times a day to keep myself and my children healthy as possible, and as a result my hands end up cracked and bleeding. I use this a couple of times a day on my hands, it feels very nice and soaks in quickly. I&#x27;ve tried other lotions and oils in the past and I&#x27;ve had allergic reactions, but the rosehip oil hasn&#x27;t caused any problems at all. I also use it on the ends of my hair to help protect from heat and styling damage, I look forward to using it as a hair mask in the summer during pool season.</li>
            <li> for the short time I&#x27;ve used this product I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Great purchase! It revitalizes my dry hair and skin during a long winter.</li>
            <li> This is very smooth oil. Large bottle. Comes with a dropper. Great product.</li>
            <li> Works well on dry heels</li>
            <li> Great product, thanks</li>
            <li> So far I love this.  Can totally tell a difference with sunspots and healing mosquito bite scars.  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I used this in a face mask that I made and afterwards my skin felt both soft and supple. It was amazing! Im so glad that I got it a discount for review!</li>
            <li> WOW! After years of spending hundreds of dollars on skin cream and anti aging products, FINALLY something that has delivered results! I am truly pleasantly surprised. I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day for two weeks and my fine lines are deminishing. I have now begun to add a couple drops on my finger tips with my favorite moisturizer and it&#x27;s seems to work even better. At 55 yrs old I do not expect to look 18 ever again but my complexion has really improved!</li>
            <li> Smells and feels wonderful. I use it every morning right after washing my face.&lt;br /&gt;It is very refreshing.</li>
            <li> Better than other oil. Excellent quality.</li>
            <li> Helped my daughters dry skin so much, especially after moving to a very dry climate.</li>
            <li> love how this oil soothes your skin!!!</li>
            <li> Every summer I develop horrible scaly patches of psoriasis on my toes and feet. I have tried everything imaginable over the years, various prescriptions, home remedies, pastes, oils and goop. Nothing has ever proven helpful in the long term. I bought this with a coupon, really not expecting much. I have found it to be remarkably effective in lessening the effects of psoriasis. My patches are smaller, shallower, and do not itch or flake. They resolve quickly and without the deep cracking and bleeding that usually torment me this time of year. I also had a bit of unexpected surgery, leaving me with a 4 inch scar I was less than thrilled with. At my Mother&#x27;s urging I began using a few drop of the rosehip oil on it twice a day. Three weeks later and i am amazed at how soft, flat, and evenly colored the healing incision is! I will never go another summer, or surgery, without this stuff!</li>
            <li> Loooooove Rosehip oil..This oil leaves my dkin soft  even toned and hydrated..It Is lightly scented.I use this oil on my face after showering  and before bed at night..I wake up with a glowing non oily  face and Ive noticed my foundation hoes on much smoother. I will be purchasing again..I will never buy a drug store brand facial cream again...Honest review for a deep discounted price...</li>
            <li> Amazing Stuff.  My daughter and I are enjoying using this product.&lt;br /&gt;After a long tough cold  winter , this oil is helping to bring moisture back into our skin.</li>
            <li> I use this after Dermarolling. Have noticed small changes. Sun spots have lightened slightly and my skin feels supple.</li>
            <li> I like it. It works very well. Nice natural effective product.</li>
            <li> Great quality product.  I use it as a night moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve seen some improvement with fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> The reasons I loved this oil included the large bottle that it came with, the easy drop applicator, and the extremely minimal scent.&lt;br /&gt;I could go into the benefits of rosehip oil for hair (my curly hair loved using this oil as deep conditioning treatment), but what I think is the most phenomenal is how my little sister benefited. I actually teared up that this worked for her, and I am not exaggerating.&lt;br /&gt;My sister is currently going through Topical Steroid Withdrawal (also known as Red Skin Syndrome). Due to years of using prescribed cortisone creams, her body became addicted to the topical steroids. When those stopped working, she did her research and realized such prolonged use was actually making her &amp;#34;eczema&amp;#34; outbreaks the raging, painful attacks they were.&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, her skin is detoxing now and will for another several months. It is cracked, oozing and sloughs off. There is very little that can be used, as the open wounds and sensitive new skin cannot tolerate chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;She can, however, tolerate this. Not only can she tolerate it, it has offered her some relief, which is so rare and incredible during this process. This product is phenomenal due to its&#x27; simple, organic, chemical free way of soothing skin. This is definitely a &amp;#34;purchase again!&amp;#34; item for my family.&lt;br /&gt;**Small note:** The package states to refrigerate after opening. After doing so, the oil becomes much thicker and cloudy in appearance. However, that doesn&#x27;t seem to change its&#x27; effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Love this oil! I recieved it in the mail quickly. Amazon even, emailed me a mask recipe using this rosehip oil as one of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I had some severe dry-ness on my skin because of a salicylic acid product I was using and I rubbed this into my face every night and it felt SO amazing.  If you have dry skin, I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I love the product and helpful expedient business.</li>
            <li> Very good product for face, hair and skin.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I got this to review. It work very well on my hair. very nice</li>
            <li> Fantastic multi-purpose, natural product.  Loving the results so far!</li>
            <li> I love this Rosehip oil. it works wonderful on my oily skin and leaves it feeling fresh and clean. I highly recommend it. I came very quickly and packaging was wonderful.</li>
            <li> Amazing results...  Everyone has been asking me what have I been doing differently.  My skin looks so healthy and the tone on my face skin has evened out...</li>
            <li> Great product....highly recommend......packaged very well!! Arrived as promised.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Rosehip Oil. I put this on every day after I wash my face. I can&#x27;t wait to use it in my body butters too. Great product for a great price!</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!! It makes my skin feel smooth and hydrated without feeling too oily!!! It&#x27;s a must for summer</li>
            <li> Is very soothing product. Absorbs nicely into the skin.</li>
            <li> Love this! Helps to even out my skin tone and leaves my skin feeling so smooth!</li>
            <li> The fine line in my face Is  starting to fade.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy this oil. My skin feels supple and looks very nice! &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product and I LOVE IT!!! I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days and my skin feels great...softer and generally more nourished.  I have always used medical grade skin care products..Obagi, SkinMedica, etc. so I am used to very high quality without a lot of fragrance and &amp;#34;fillers&amp;#34;.  This 100% Organic Rosehip Oil lives up to all my expectations. It is fragrance free and very easy to use. I tried it on my hair after washing instead of my Moroccan Oil (not sure yet) and it&#x27;s on my cuticles.  I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the bottle for the price.  I&#x27;m so used to most products coming in tiny 1 oz. bottles!!  The order process and delivery was as expected with Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> excellent product, rosehip is full of vitamin c which makes it a very good serum substitute since some serum have bad ingredients. and it is 100% organic, awesome.</li>
            <li> Oils are great for your body!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days but I could feel how soft it made my skin almost immediately..&lt;br /&gt;Seeing its an oil form you would expect it to be slight greasy but its not all all. I love this</li>
            <li> rosehip oil....recieved and using it 2x a day.  Im not sure yet if its helping the brown spots on my hands.  time will tell.  ill report again hopefully soon.</li>
            <li> I love this oil I mix it with other essential oils and use daily on hair and body......</li>
            <li> Highly recommended this product.  It moisturized my skin and not feeling grease.</li>
            <li> I have used this oil on my face and scalp. I enjoyed how my skin feels after using the product.</li>
            <li> Rosehip oil has amazing benefits for anti again skin. It is filled with fatty acids and antioxidants. Has vitamin C which stimulates collagen production. Even tho im still young i want to preserve and prolong aging. So this product for me is a must. It has bi scent, and is 100% certified organic. That there is amazing. You really want ro only use the highest quality products on your skin because they will bring the best benefits. Will continue to use this as part of my daily regimen.</li>
            <li> This Rosehip Oil is GREAT! It is very hydrating and makes your skin soft and glowing. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, especially for winter skin.  It is light weight and absorbs quickly.  It keeps skin moist for hours. I also&lt;br /&gt;massage it into my fingernails and it keeps them healthy looking and shinning.</li>
            <li> I got this mainly because I need something for my dry hands and I love using ORGANIC products on my skin as well as my daughters. I have to say that this does absorb SUPER quickly and is a nice lightweight oil for moisturizing. My skin is very very dry because of winter and they hands soaked up 2 to 3 applications of this easily. Which is a good and bad thing haha. I think it is a little too lightweight for my super dry skin but it works so well at absorbing. I wish it would last a little bit longer. It comes with a dropper and in a glass bottle.  You can use it for all kinds of skin issues.. wrinkles, fine lines, acne, rosacea, scars, stretch marks etc. Basically if you have a skin problem, try this and it may help resolve it!  I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item for perspective as someone that has never had the chance to experience trying it!</li>
            <li> GOOD VALUE! This bottle is a great size and the product is excellent quality.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. It is fragrance free, light and very soothing to the skin. A little goes a long way.... you need only a few drops. It absorbs quickly and leaves the skin feeling silky, soft and nourished.  Although it works well as a stand alone product, I sometimes like using it as a serum under my daily spf and night cream on my face, neck and decollate. I&#x27;m so glad to have found this on amazon!&lt;br /&gt;PS It works well on hands and cuticles also.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed such a great product</li>
            <li> I have to say, I am really impressed with the product! My 7 year old has very dry skin and cuticles and after just one application, I noticed a considerable difference. I, myself used it this past week and wow, my skin and hair are so soft! I definitely recommend giving it a try!</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly and very well packaged.  I have used this on my hair as well as my face...love it!  It is like a tall drink of water for your face.  I struggle with eczema and so far it seems to be gentle enough and even improving a little bit!  I will try it on my son&#x27;s eczema and fingers crossed he responds well!</li>
            <li> Fantastic quality oil. I started using essential oils recently and had been looking for a skin and hair oil. I tried this organic rose hip oil when it went on a promo and I am so happy I did! I usually put 1-3 drops in my conditioner and a few drops in my face lotion every night. My skin is visibly brighter, feels softer and my hair looks vibrant. My natural color pops. The bottle is a great deal, the bottle is huge! I haven&#x27;t made a dent in it and I use it a lot. The quality is high, not watered down like some brands. As good as the ridiculously expensive mail order kinds and at a great price</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly and feels very nice. Look forward to using product more. I thought it was interesting that it recommends to refrigerate after opening. That should make it feel nice in these summer months.</li>
            <li> I really loved how the smell was super light. It didn&#x27;t clash with my perfume or anything. I also really liked how it wasn&#x27;t greasy or oily once I put it on my skin. After one use, my rough elbows were already drastically softer!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this oil helps to keep it moist and soft. Love it</li>
            <li> During the winter,  my skin becomes super dry to the point it hurts. Using this rosehip for a week now, and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference. The oilly feeling goes away after 5mins, so dont worry about having an oilly face</li>
            <li> Not greasy and oily feeling like most oils. I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the way this feels, doesn&#x27;t leave your face oily, I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see results yet!</li>
            <li> I got this because I have super dry skin on my arms, and this has taken it away. It smells great and isnt too heavy. What a great deal!</li>
            <li> Great oil for skin! Disappointed that it didn&#x27;t smell like roses though.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality product.  Face feels instantly smooth after applying.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Great oil and big bottle</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product!!</li>
            <li> I love this!!  I use it on my face before I put my regular lotion on.  I use it on my hands, elbows and in my hair.  It is so light yet effective.</li>
            <li> This is a huge bottle that came well packaged and protected.  No added fragrance, alcohol or chemicals is what convinced me to try this product when it was offered to me at a discount.  My hair is really dry, so I warm a little of this oil in bowl and then massage it into my hair and scalp.  I leave it on for about an hour and then wash it out so I am left with beautiful, soft hair.  I also apply it to dry and cracked skin to help moisturize and soften it.  Make sure you do not expose this bottle to extreme light.  Doing so can reduce the potency of it&#x27;s ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*product provided either free or at a discount in exchange for my review</li>
            <li> LOVE&amp;#60;LOVE&amp;#62;LOVe this product! I will buy Rosehip Oil again.</li>
            <li> I love this is my humidifier.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product for dry wintry skin, wrinkles and prevention of wrinkles. This as all but replaced my traditional moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have normal/combination skin with an oily T zone, but dry patches in the winter. I feel this product has help to balance out my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it really helped my dry skin!</li>
            <li> i have used this for several reasons eczema, dry cracked feet, moisturizer for my face and have even incorporated it into my hair routine. The scent is very light, not unsecured but very neutral. due to that I am able to add it to my DYI lotions and creams and it As will not alter the lovely scents I and others have created. I will most definitely continue to use it for all types of treatments day or nighttreatments. Even after the first use I notice a big difference I my dry heels and the dry ends of my hair. The longer I use it the better this seems to be getting. It also soothes the eczema out breaks I tend to get this time of year and this I believe to be because of the lightness and quickly absorbing formula. It is virtually oiliness free within a minute of application. Will finish this bottle and definitely repurchase as I can use it in so many different applications which is a Big Bang for my buck.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at a huge discount and I love it.. I use almond oil and coconut oil on my face and while it is great and will continue to use both, it didnt fix the dry skin on my cheeks. I have used the rosehip oil for maybe a couple of weeks and the dryness has completely disappeared . love this product and will buy again.. Thanks for offering this product at the discount... Susie Martin</li>
            <li> It makes your skin soft!</li>
            <li> Great product!  It came on time and in good condition.  It makes my face and skin look amazing and a little bit goes a long way!  I really like that I can spread it over my entire face, including my eyes.  I break out easily but I have very dry skin.  This has caused no breakouts but keeps my skin feeling and looking hydrated.</li>
            <li> My wife is  like  it. Thanks</li>
            <li> smell is good. I like this bulk size. good product</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin so soft and not greasy feeling love it!!</li>
            <li> This has worked wonders for my skin, people have noticed a difference!</li>
            <li> Great quality for a good price</li>
            <li> I use this as an everyday moisturizer and I love it!!</li>
            <li> I have definitely noticed a difference in my skin, it has only been a few weeks so i will continue to use this product. Has help around the eyes also.</li>
            <li> Done wonders for my skin &amp; hair!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this about 10 days. I use it on my face, elbows, cuticles, &amp; neck. Very hydrating &amp; makes skin feel supple.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my favorite that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I ordered this rose hip oil as a carrier oil for essential oils. I love that I recieve dual benefits of the rose hip oil AND the essential oil together! It&#x27;s perfect for a body oil, as it&#x27;s scent is light and it soaks in quickly! And it&#x27;s organic...hip hip hooray!</li>
            <li> This oil is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;This organic rosehip oil is a deep oil that can make the face oily looking if too much is applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very comfortable in highly recommending this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for a while now I absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is truly a great product.</li>
            <li> Ooooh! I LOVE this. I have really dry skin and live in Hollywood (where it&#x27;s super dry w no humidity). This lovely oil is the saving grace for winter days ... it smells amazing, and I feel good that I&#x27;m only putting pure, healthy ingredients on my skin :)</li>
            <li> Buying another bottle now!</li>
            <li> Absorbs beautifully!  Light and luxurious feeling! After only using for a short while I am already noticing more hydrated, even toned skin on my face, neck and chest (the bottle is a generous size so why not apply it to those areas as well?).  Big fan!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying expensive skincare products through the dermatologist since my 20s. I&#x27;ve always been skeptical of adding an oil to my skincare routine so I&#x27;m really glad I got around to trying this oil. It was much lighter than I expected and the backs of my hands look great. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have a scent because while I love tea tree oil, I don&#x27;t always want to smell like tea tree oil. It is also a great price.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely get another bottle when I run out.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I tried this! It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin very soft without leaving a sticky or oily residue on my skin like many other oils and lotions I&#x27;ve tried. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Feels amazing on my face! I have a dry scalp and dry hair and this does wonders. Smells yummy. Very earthy. My face loves me when I use this after I use my microdermabrasion kit on my face. I also used it on my sons chapped cheeks from playing in the snow and they almost immediately healed up. Huge bottle. I can imagine ever using all of this! But I sure will try! An everyday part of my beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> Quality product! I was nervous to use it on my face because I have combination skin and didn&#x27;t want it to leave my skin oily. That had not been a problem at all. Makes my skin softer. Love it!</li>
            <li> I normally buy Rosehip Oils from some brand names and cost me a lot. This bottle is cheaper and works the same.</li>
            <li> This is a huge bottle that will last forever and if you have never heard of rose hips or rose hip oil, I ask you to look it up. Marvelous for antiaging, dry skin, and is a remarkable product. I used to take vitaminc tabs with rosehips as recommended besides just plain vitamin c and it is amaaazing. Plain vitamin c was not helping. I use this oil in combination with Argan and maricuja oil and it works well. Now I need to try coconut oil also but just adding this, I am impressed!!!!</li>
            <li> No rose smell of at all, but the oil is light and easily being absorb.</li>
            <li> I have seen rosehip capsules as a supplement for many years but never tried them. I asked my son&#x27;s girlfriend to use this item on my behalf as she expressed great interest in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She used it on her hair, skin and nails every third day. She has had some issues with split ends this winter and was concerned about dry hair and skin. Also her nails have been breaking lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her words:&lt;br /&gt;I was really excited when you told me about this essential oil! I have wanted to try this for awhile but wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to spend the money on it. I&#x27;m glad I got to try this! I have very long hair (down to my waist) and I don&#x27;t like to get it cut and I like to use natural products on it. THIS IS GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;I used this as a scalp massage a few times. I just used a few drops and massaged my scalp and left it in overnight. The next morning I washed my hair and it was soft and I didn&#x27;t have any flyaway hair and my scalp wasn&#x27;t itchy. And it didn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy.&lt;br /&gt;It also helped a lot with the dry skin on my elbows, which were cracking and hurt like heck. They&#x27;re now all healed up nicely and not all scaly and gross.&lt;br /&gt;My cuticles are all healed too and my nails are growing back in. I love this stuff and I&#x27;m going to buy it in the future. This is a big bottle and will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have any scent to it and no flavor. I put a drop in my protein drink every morning. My doctor told me that it was good for my hair and skin from the inside. I think it&#x27;s working really good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item free (or nearly free) in return for my 100% honest opinion and review. I was not compensated in any other way and this is my HONEST review.</li>
            <li> I use this on my dry skin. It&#x27;s so soothing when it comes straight out of the refrigerator and put on dry skin. Love this brand!</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this rose oil. My skin feels fresh and is much smoother than I thought it would be. The seller gave a tip for a mask that I just tried. HEAVEN</li>
