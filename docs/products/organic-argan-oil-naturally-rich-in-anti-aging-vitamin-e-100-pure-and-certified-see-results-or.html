            <li>I love love love this product !!</li>
            <li>great for curly hair *like Actress Tracee Ellis Rose &amp; Rachel True</li>
            <li>Great product thanks !</li>
            <li>Very light texture.</li>
            <li>This bottle is huge!  </li>
            <li>For use on your hair, make sure you don&#x27;t use a lot because it will make it look greasy at the roots.</li>
            <li>My customers love these, I do also.  </li>
            <li>* works best for me if applied to damp skin,...is absorbed really well and hydration</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the product - I&#x27;ve added it to shampoos, conditioners, skin lotions to provide smoothness and moisturizing effect to hair &amp; skin.  </li>
            <li>I also add it too my favorite lotions</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it on my hair, yet, but I&#x27;m sure it will add shine.  </li>
            <li>Love this all over my body,</li>
            <li>With this product, my skin truly glows and looks healthy, because it is healthy.</li>
            <li>i know i will be purchasing more when it finishes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The Eve Hansen argan oil is heavier, rather like putting olive oil on the skin (which smells much better).</li>
            <li>I put it on my hands: after 15 minutes, the scent mostly dissipated, but my hands remain oily looking and feeling.</li>
            <li>I decided to put Argan Oil into a balm I made (Shea, cocoa butter, mango butter, ect) and my skin is better than it has been in years.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay...</li>
            <li>Will reorder for sure when I run out of my 1st supply.</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin looks in the AM.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have to say I love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Argan oil for quite some time, and I love the benefit to my skin.</li>
            <li>Scar is gradually changing for the better.  </li>
            <li>I love how this argan oil feels on my skin and hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had argon oil before but bought by Josie Maran and that one smelled much better.</li>
            <li>Comparable to a more name brand product.</li>
            <li>When I first received this product, I tried it and it seemed pleasant and silky texture.  </li>
            <li>This is the real deal!!!!</li>
            <li>it gives my skin a pretty healthy good skin glow.</li>
            <li>It is amazing how quickly it is absorbed.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;so far its working, love it!!</li>
            <li>The oil is very light and gets absorbed very quickly.</li>
            <li>There is no aroma that I can detect which is fine with me.  </li>
            <li>Huge size for the money.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a lot to use as moisturizer and it will sink into your skin leaving no trace of oiliness, just smooth hydrated skin.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, nice Product</li>
            <li>It added excellent moisture and shine without leaving heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>Mawesome my hair smooth and manageable</li>
            <li>Product arrived quicker than stated and the seller provided detailed instructions on how to trial the product.</li>
            <li>This Oil is fantastic...</li>
            <li>It works best for me when I mix a few drops with my moisturizer each morning.</li>
            <li>So far so good...</li>
            <li>Originally I purchased it for my scar after the surgery</li>
            <li>it, it is so affordable and it has so much to offer! :)</li>
            <li>I use about 6-8 drops twice a day and my skin feels great without all the greasiness I get with lotion, although I still use lotion over it on particularly dry, arid days.  </li>
            <li>Whole Foods sells once ounce for $19.99 and this is a huge 4 ounces!  </li>
            <li>I love this product as it is not greasy, soaks into skin fast and makes my skin feel like silk.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;I&#x27;m loving it so far.</li>
            <li>I am a first time buyer and have been very pleased so far!</li>
            <li>I mix it with body moisturizer after I shower and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>During the winter months I get eczema on my eyelids and mild rosacea.  </li>
            <li>quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>I am really beginning to see a very positive change for the better.  </li>
            <li>At first, everything feels fantastic.</li>
            <li>using the word love isn&#x27;t strong enough to tell how I feel about this product.</li>
            <li>I apply this amazing Argan oil on my toddler son&#x27;s scalp, on my skin &amp; nail beds almost daily.  </li>
            <li>but it is not noticeable once it is absorbed.  </li>
            <li>just makes it look alive and healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>It is worth the buy.</li>
            <li>It is absorbed right away and is not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>lucky I am to have such a wonderful young looking skin&amp;#34; ...Funny  thing is that often people that would benefit the most from taking a little care of their skin immediately tell me &amp;#34;  Oh...</li>
            <li>Not greasy at all and absorbs super fast into the skin.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>But again for the price, this is very well worth it.</li>
            <li>I will most likely stick with this when I run out.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, be aware you will be signed up on the Spam list of this company if you buy it.</li>
            <li>Thanks Eve!</li>
            <li>I will try it again, just to make sure, but I had used the other brand for the last 2 months without any issues, plus it has a nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I have a very oily complexion and do not normally put on any kind of moisturizers.</li>
            <li>and I love having such a large bottle...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Argan oil for a long time now and have been looking for a more affordable option .I</li>
            <li>Too much for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t have much of an aroma, which I like.</li>
            <li>and it really makes a difference.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I can really splurge and give all my skin a treat.</li>
            <li>My granddaughter will go straight to it when she comes over now.</li>
            <li>I no longer feel the need to use as much</li>
            <li>It is very damaged so it will take some time to see if this product helps.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried anti-fungal creams... straight coconut oil.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s too much trouble&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have very pronounced surgery scars.</li>
            <li>and I had to really rub it in.</li>
            <li>I have tried several different facial creams and oils, and nothing seems to work for me, since I have fairly oily skin.</li>
            <li>Bought it mainly for my hair.  </li>
            <li>But I wanted to keep at it, and a few short days later, all the purging cleared up and are healing beautifully.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product and company.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>So far I really like the oil.</li>
            <li>, I wouldn&#x27;t need any highlighter to contour my skin since it naturally glows and leaves the skin looking so well rested and much healthier than ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use 5-6 drops on damp towel dried hair - shinier, more manageable hair.</li>
            <li>(her skin is very sensitive).</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough about this product, ordered the small bottle before and loved it so much got the big one this time.</li>
            <li>and i could not see the clear effect.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so soft...</li>
            <li>I use this on my face under make up or alone to have a natural glow.</li>
            <li>Well, I think I finally found something my skin absolutely loves:</li>
            <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t had any problem with this item.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have an offensive smell and smells natural .</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m also using it directly on my hair.</li>
            <li>I am 57 yrs old &amp; my skin loves this product.</li>
            <li>I put my 3 drops into my hand and apply to face &amp; may face is soft &amp; supple in the morning.  </li>
            <li>&amp; my hair wakes up feeling soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>am 77 years old and people always remark about how &amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I decided that I wanted something natural and this is what I decided to go with.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>This brand was thicker, darker and smelled like old oil.  </li>
            <li>I am always looking for the naturally organics in food and skincare.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend using the oil directly on hair.</li>
            <li>So far I like it</li>
            <li>but I am very glad I was wrong.</li>
            <li>For the price, this oil truly goes a whole long way.</li>
            <li>and i will use it for a long time and then to write the real review.</li>
            <li>The Maran one is the only other argan oil I&#x27;ve used; it has no scent, is lighter and absorbs quickly yet moisturizes my face all night.</li>
            <li>My normally flaky skin is smooth and soft, and I see less and less clogged pores.  </li>
            <li>I also tried the oil directly on my skin and it felt a little sticky at first</li>
            <li>(As background: I am sensitive to scents and only use unscented products.)</li>
            <li>I was so surprised at how different my hair felt.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought the smell was odd</li>
            <li>I first tried it on my hands for a few days.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use much, but it weighed down my hair, like I hadn&#x27;t shampooed for a month.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love love love this product !!</li>
            <li> great for curly hair *like Actress Tracee Ellis Rose &amp; Rachel True</li>
            <li> Great product thanks !</li>
            <li> Very light texture.</li>
            <li> This bottle is huge!  </li>
            <li> For use on your hair, make sure you don&#x27;t use a lot because it will make it look greasy at the roots.</li>
            <li> My customers love these, I do also.  </li>
            <li> * works best for me if applied to damp skin,...is absorbed really well and hydration</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love the product - I&#x27;ve added it to shampoos, conditioners, skin lotions to provide smoothness and moisturizing effect to hair &amp; skin.  </li>
            <li> I also add it too my favorite lotions</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it on my hair, yet, but I&#x27;m sure it will add shine.  </li>
            <li> Love this all over my body,</li>
            <li> With this product, my skin truly glows and looks healthy, because it is healthy.</li>
            <li> i know i will be purchasing more when it finishes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The Eve Hansen argan oil is heavier, rather like putting olive oil on the skin (which smells much better).</li>
            <li> I put it on my hands: after 15 minutes, the scent mostly dissipated, but my hands remain oily looking and feeling.</li>
            <li> I decided to put Argan Oil into a balm I made (Shea, cocoa butter, mango butter, ect) and my skin is better than it has been in years.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay...</li>
            <li> Will reorder for sure when I run out of my 1st supply.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin looks in the AM.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have to say I love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Argan oil for quite some time, and I love the benefit to my skin.</li>
            <li> Scar is gradually changing for the better.  </li>
            <li> I love how this argan oil feels on my skin and hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had argon oil before but bought by Josie Maran and that one smelled much better.</li>
            <li> Comparable to a more name brand product.</li>
            <li> When I first received this product, I tried it and it seemed pleasant and silky texture.  </li>
            <li> This is the real deal!!!!</li>
            <li> it gives my skin a pretty healthy good skin glow.</li>
            <li> It is amazing how quickly it is absorbed.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;so far its working, love it!!</li>
            <li> The oil is very light and gets absorbed very quickly.</li>
            <li> There is no aroma that I can detect which is fine with me.  </li>
            <li> Huge size for the money.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot to use as moisturizer and it will sink into your skin leaving no trace of oiliness, just smooth hydrated skin.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, nice Product</li>
            <li> It added excellent moisture and shine without leaving heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> Mawesome my hair smooth and manageable</li>
            <li> Product arrived quicker than stated and the seller provided detailed instructions on how to trial the product.</li>
            <li> This Oil is fantastic...</li>
            <li> It works best for me when I mix a few drops with my moisturizer each morning.</li>
            <li> So far so good...</li>
            <li> Originally I purchased it for my scar after the surgery</li>
            <li> it, it is so affordable and it has so much to offer! :)</li>
            <li> I use about 6-8 drops twice a day and my skin feels great without all the greasiness I get with lotion, although I still use lotion over it on particularly dry, arid days.  </li>
            <li> Whole Foods sells once ounce for $19.99 and this is a huge 4 ounces!  </li>
            <li> I love this product as it is not greasy, soaks into skin fast and makes my skin feel like silk.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I&#x27;m loving it so far.</li>
            <li> I am a first time buyer and have been very pleased so far!</li>
            <li> I mix it with body moisturizer after I shower and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> During the winter months I get eczema on my eyelids and mild rosacea.  </li>
            <li> quick delivery.  </li>
            <li> I am really beginning to see a very positive change for the better.  </li>
            <li> At first, everything feels fantastic.</li>
            <li> using the word love isn&#x27;t strong enough to tell how I feel about this product.</li>
            <li> I apply this amazing Argan oil on my toddler son&#x27;s scalp, on my skin &amp; nail beds almost daily.  </li>
            <li> but it is not noticeable once it is absorbed.  </li>
            <li> just makes it look alive and healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> It is worth the buy.</li>
            <li> It is absorbed right away and is not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> lucky I am to have such a wonderful young looking skin&amp;#34; ...Funny  thing is that often people that would benefit the most from taking a little care of their skin immediately tell me &amp;#34;  Oh...</li>
            <li> Not greasy at all and absorbs super fast into the skin.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> But again for the price, this is very well worth it.</li>
            <li> I will most likely stick with this when I run out.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, be aware you will be signed up on the Spam list of this company if you buy it.</li>
            <li> Thanks Eve!</li>
            <li> I will try it again, just to make sure, but I had used the other brand for the last 2 months without any issues, plus it has a nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I have a very oily complexion and do not normally put on any kind of moisturizers.</li>
            <li> and I love having such a large bottle...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Argan oil for a long time now and have been looking for a more affordable option .I</li>
            <li> Too much for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t have much of an aroma, which I like.</li>
            <li> and it really makes a difference.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I can really splurge and give all my skin a treat.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter will go straight to it when she comes over now.</li>
            <li> I no longer feel the need to use as much</li>
            <li> It is very damaged so it will take some time to see if this product helps.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried anti-fungal creams... straight coconut oil.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s too much trouble&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have very pronounced surgery scars.</li>
            <li> and I had to really rub it in.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different facial creams and oils, and nothing seems to work for me, since I have fairly oily skin.</li>
            <li> Bought it mainly for my hair.  </li>
            <li> But I wanted to keep at it, and a few short days later, all the purging cleared up and are healing beautifully.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product and company.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> So far I really like the oil.</li>
            <li> , I wouldn&#x27;t need any highlighter to contour my skin since it naturally glows and leaves the skin looking so well rested and much healthier than ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use 5-6 drops on damp towel dried hair - shinier, more manageable hair.</li>
            <li> (her skin is very sensitive).</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this product, ordered the small bottle before and loved it so much got the big one this time.</li>
            <li> and i could not see the clear effect.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so soft...</li>
            <li> I use this on my face under make up or alone to have a natural glow.</li>
            <li> Well, I think I finally found something my skin absolutely loves:</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t had any problem with this item.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have an offensive smell and smells natural .</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m also using it directly on my hair.</li>
            <li> I am 57 yrs old &amp; my skin loves this product.</li>
            <li> I put my 3 drops into my hand and apply to face &amp; may face is soft &amp; supple in the morning.  </li>
            <li> &amp; my hair wakes up feeling soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> am 77 years old and people always remark about how &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I decided that I wanted something natural and this is what I decided to go with.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> This brand was thicker, darker and smelled like old oil.  </li>
            <li> I am always looking for the naturally organics in food and skincare.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend using the oil directly on hair.</li>
            <li> So far I like it</li>
            <li> but I am very glad I was wrong.</li>
            <li> For the price, this oil truly goes a whole long way.</li>
            <li> and i will use it for a long time and then to write the real review.</li>
            <li> The Maran one is the only other argan oil I&#x27;ve used; it has no scent, is lighter and absorbs quickly yet moisturizes my face all night.</li>
            <li> My normally flaky skin is smooth and soft, and I see less and less clogged pores.  </li>
            <li> I also tried the oil directly on my skin and it felt a little sticky at first</li>
            <li> (As background: I am sensitive to scents and only use unscented products.)</li>
            <li> I was so surprised at how different my hair felt.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought the smell was odd</li>
            <li> I first tried it on my hands for a few days.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use much, but it weighed down my hair, like I hadn&#x27;t shampooed for a month.  </li>
            <li> but when I added a few drops to my eye cream and facial cream , massaged it in, OMG my eye area is already less dry and my whole face and neck are softer than a babys bottom!!!</li>
            <li> This oil does not re grow hair but it made my hair very soft - not brittle - and it actually made my hair look slightly</li>
            <li> The only positive I can give is that it was well packaged in a dark, heavy glass jar with dropper.</li>
            <li> My face feels VERY SOFT and well moisturized, even with the harsh winter conditions in Michigan.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I got an old product, but this actually broke out my skin.  </li>
            <li> Just a few drops mixed with my facial sunscreen and wait several minutes to apply foundation.</li>
            <li> I will definitely go back to the other brand.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said it almost instantaneously softens and smooths facial skin.  </li>
            <li> I use it at night on my face, after I wash my hair, and in problem dry spots.  </li>
            <li> (&amp;#60;:  Did not use it all so now I am using it on my arms, face and hands to combat dry skin.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s scalp is no longer dry &amp; scaly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only slightly oilier feeling than the Josie Maran.</li>
            <li> I purchased because it said organic, had a pump, was larger size for less than the one I bought from my stylist (M Moroccanoil brand).  </li>
            <li> Josie Maran&#x27;s oil is a little too pricey for being almost the same thing.</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive as the packaging is generic.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser even complemented on the health of my hair and minimal split ends.</li>
            <li> But after a few short weeks, my pores begin to clog and my pimples to form.</li>
            <li> next experiment is to mix a few drops in my shampoo and see what that does.</li>
            <li> I have not used enough of the product yet to know if I like just the plain argan oil.  </li>
            <li> I have a few minor skin conditions with my face, mostly due to dry skin.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Has very little fragrance and no lasting odor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other brands at four times the price.</li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have used argan oil in combination with other ingredients in creams.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit spendy, so definitely use a small amount.  </li>
            <li> Only a small amount is needed.</li>
            <li> I have used other products that may contain argan oil but the results were not like this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone back to my usual brand and have no issues.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be the exact same product as some of the very expensive ones sold elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Clearly, a less expensive argan oil was too much to wish for.</li>
            <li> Will order other products from you!</li>
            <li> I have very dry, thin blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> Warning - slightly funky smell, but disappears in a bit.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would be decent because the Josie Maran argan oil I use is too expensive to slather on the way I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li> All you need is a little bit to see results.  </li>
            <li> A little Goes a loooooooong way</li>
            <li> I have quite a bit of acne &amp; extremely oily skin, someone recommended this oil to me &amp; I&#x27;m so thankful they did!!</li>
            <li> but it smells pretty unpleasant, which I&#x27;m quite bummed about because I wanted to put This on my face.</li>
            <li> Frankly, it is wasted on hair - this is oil THE oil for problematic skin.</li>
            <li> I tried it over night a few times and washed it out in the morning</li>
            <li> I also like to rub a few drops in my hair, it does not make it appear oily</li>
            <li> I have to admit that after a few days using it, I started to break out on my cheeks, usually a sign of an incompatibility with a cosmetic product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brand because I wanted to save money and my usual brand was backordered.</li>
            <li> I have had at least three mails asking me to review the product.</li>
            <li> I use this for all over body oil and also use a very small amount at the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunatelly, my toddler put it all over his syntetic rug, so oil is pretty awfully grease and uncleanable )))))</li>
            <li> I tired it once.  </li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> This version of Argan Oil is extremely unpleasant, with a nauseating scent that I cannot describe (rancid rubber?), that hits my stomach with an immediate punch.</li>
            <li> this product smells bad</li>
            <li> it smells bad to me.</li>
            <li> Nothing inappropriate in terms of the ethics, but annoying-</li>
            <li> I would never put it on my face or hair because of the sickening scent.</li>
            <li> It was just terrible.  </li>
            <li> I am over 50 and post menopause and have all the awful symptoms with my hair - thinning, brittle, etc.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have recently discovered Argan oil and find it to be essential for hair and nails. It also helps to minimize my scars. A miracle in a bottle!</li>
            <li> This oil is a great product for the price. Josie Maran&#x27;s oil is a little too pricey for being almost the same thing. I do have to say that the main difference is this oil is slightly greasier and has a smell I&#x27;m not too fond of. But again for the price, this is very well worth it. I will most likely stick with this when I run out.  You don&#x27;t need a lot to use as moisturizer and it will sink into your skin leaving no trace of oiliness, just smooth hydrated skin. It&#x27;s only slightly oilier feeling than the Josie Maran. For use on your hair, make sure you don&#x27;t use a lot because it will make it look greasy at the roots. I start at the bottom, when damp, and use any remaining traces at the roots to avoid this. It leaves my hair feeling and looking very healthy. My hair dresser even complemented on the health of my hair and minimal split ends. This oil is great. If I had never tried the more expensive name brand I would have rated this 5 stars instead of 4.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I purchased this oil for use in my homemade bath and beauty products.  Prior to receiving the oil the company contacted me by email, to explain how to use their product-excellent customer care and satisfaction.  I recently made some body cream, lotion and shampoo bars using this &amp;#34;Liquid Gold&amp;#34;.  I used at a rate of 1-5% depending on the product.  My customers love these, I do also.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Ian very satisfied with this product. Originally I purchased it for my scar after the surgery but I even use it for my face every night.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, nice Product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this argan oil for about 3 weeks now and have noticed these things:&lt;br /&gt; * makes my skin softer and smoother&lt;br /&gt; * works best for me if applied to damp skin,...is absorbed really well and hydration lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m amazed at the great price for 4 oz bottle of this organic argan oil....especially when considering&lt;br /&gt;the prices for the non-organic argan oil BLENDS that are out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend...and will purchase again!</li>
            <li> So far so good... No miracles but no complaints! Does look like my thinning edges around my hairline is coming back😊</li>
            <li> I purchased because it said organic, had a pump, was larger size for less than the one I bought from my stylist (M Moroccanoil brand).  I tired it once.  I didn&#x27;t use much, but it weighed down my hair, like I hadn&#x27;t shampooed for a month.  It was just terrible.  I will try it again, just to make sure, but I had used the other brand for the last 2 months without any issues, plus it has a nice fragrance.  I will definitely go back to the other brand.</li>
            <li> I have been using Argan oil from months and I loved it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this product, ordered the small bottle before and loved it so much got the big one this time. Use this in the morning and evening on my face and it&#x27;s so soft...highly recommend this product and company. It&#x27;s not greasy and no odor for us that have allergies with scents. Packaging is great and arrives when they say it will.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price compared to elsewhere. Buy it.</li>
            <li> This has been a great product! I use it at night on my face, after I wash my hair, and in problem dry spots.  I am a first time buyer and have been very pleased so far!</li>
            <li> I have a very oily complexion and do not normally put on any kind of moisturizers. Something about this product and what was said about it made me want to try it. It is awesome, feels so light, I do not feel as though I have anything on my face or neck but the improvement I see is wonderful! Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Nice oil, but smells like.. goat cheese. Too much for me.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunatelly, my toddler put it all over his syntetic rug, so oil is pretty awfully grease and uncleanable )))))</li>
            <li> Argan Oil is really nice.  It keeps my face moisturized without clogging up my pores.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t have much of an aroma, which I like.</li>
            <li> This bottle is huge!  Whole Foods sells once ounce for $19.99 and this is a huge 4 ounces!  A little goes a long way.  I use it on my hair and my skin.  Not greasy at all and absorbs super fast into the skin.</li>
            <li> I love it. A tad thicker than jojoba so its great for a nightime face moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I use this on my face under make up or alone to have a natural glow. I mix it with body moisturizer after I shower and it absorbs quickly. Has very little fragrance and no lasting odor. Just a few drops mixed with my facial sunscreen and wait several minutes to apply foundation. I&#x27;ve bought other brands at four times the price. Great product.</li>
            <li> So far I really like the oil. It has been 2 week since I am using it, I can see that my nails getting stronger and healhier.  It also helps to remove redness from my daughter&#x27;s cheeks (her skin is very sensitive).</li>
            <li> I like it.... really good</li>
            <li> Love the product - I&#x27;ve added it to shampoos, conditioners, skin lotions to provide smoothness and moisturizing effect to hair &amp; skin.  Just a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This is a great addition to any beauty or skin/hair care regimen.  As other reviewers have said it almost instantaneously softens and smooths facial skin.  It is amazing how quickly it is absorbed.  I also add it too my favorite lotions and it really makes a difference.  I haven&#x27;t tried it on my hair, yet, but I&#x27;m sure it will add shine.  I am not a fan of the scent but it is not noticeable once it is absorbed.  This is a great oil and I love having such a large bottle...I feel like I can really splurge and give all my skin a treat.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!! I use it on my daughter&#x27;s mixed hair. It added excellent moisture and shine without leaving heavy or greasy. Excellent product at a great price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil to use in some hand and body scrub I was making - named it &amp;#34;Put de Lime in de Coconut&amp;#34;. (&amp;#60;:  Did not use it all so now I am using it on my arms, face and hands to combat dry skin. I love it!  It is absorbed right away and is not greasy at all.  There is no aroma that I can detect which is fine with me.  It has a dropper which works well to control the amount you use - no drips.  Very nice and I will buy it again.  Don&#x27;t need to use a lot so it will last me awhile.  I have only used it for a week so can&#x27;t report effect on my skin.  Don&#x27;t plan on using it on my hair.  I do have a scar above my lip and am hoping it will help the appearance of that.  I will report back after I have used it for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> This is amazing!!! My hands even look younger in such a short time.  My granddaughter will go straight to it when she comes over now.</li>
            <li> I love this oil!  During the winter months I get eczema on my eyelids and mild rosacea.  By applying this oil to my face and eyelids, I no longer need to use medication for either condition.  I also use this on my hands and hair.  All you need is a little bit to see results.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> great price and great product. I was worried the product would not be quality but I am very glad I was wrong. Love this all over my body,</li>
            <li> Love this product! For the price, this oil truly goes a whole long way. I massage it onto my face, neck and all parts of my body that needs some pampering.I also apply a teeny tiny amount of this oil at the end of my hair after blow drying it, and say bye bye frizz. On the face, I put it after using my facial routine and before make up. It deeply penetrates inside the layers of the skin without clogging my pores, which I sometimes feel when using - even - the organic coconut oil. With this product, my skin truly glows and looks healthy, because it is healthy. Massage it onto your skin to help penetrate even deeper. I no longer feel the need to use as much make up anymore, I wouldn&#x27;t need any highlighter to contour my skin since it naturally glows and leaves the skin looking so well rested and much healthier than ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, it is so affordable and it has so much to offer! :)</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Used it in replace of&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;so far its working, love it!! thank you again, i know i will be purchasing more when it finishes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait a few weeks before writing a review because my skin is very finicky. At first, everything feels fantastic. But after a few short weeks, my pores begin to clog and my pimples to form. Or, my skin turns red and finally start to flake off, like after a sunburn. Well, I think I finally found something my skin absolutely loves: Even Hansen&#x27;s Argan Oil. I have to admit that after a few days using it, I started to break out on my cheeks, usually a sign of an incompatibility with a cosmetic product. But I wanted to keep at it, and a few short days later, all the purging cleared up and are healing beautifully. My normally flaky skin is smooth and soft, and I see less and less clogged pores.  I cannot believe how well this oil does for me. I will buy it over and over again. Frankly, it is wasted on hair - this is oil THE oil for problematic skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product as it is not greasy, soaks into skin fast and makes my skin feel like silk.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone and I will buy this product again and again. Thank you</li>
            <li> This item is an excellent Item, and I would recommend it to others. So far, I haven&#x27;t had any problem with this item.</li>
            <li> Works well. Doesn&#x27;t have an offensive smell and smells natural .</li>
            <li> this product smells bad</li>
            <li> I have not used enough of the product yet to know if I like just the plain argan oil.  I have used argan oil in combination with other ingredients in creams.  Bought it mainly for my hair.  It is very damaged so it will take some time to see if this product helps.  I am very pleased with the price of the 4 oz. bottle.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s no miracle like it&#x27;s touted to be, but it does work very well on my face (and a few scars).  I have a few minor skin conditions with my face, mostly due to dry skin.  I use about 6-8 drops twice a day and my skin feels great without all the greasiness I get with lotion, although I still use lotion over it on particularly dry, arid days.  It did nothing for my hair though.  I have very dry, thin blonde hair.  I tried it over night a few times and washed it out in the morning and if anything, it felt dryer after my shower.  It does help a bit with &amp;#34;wisps&amp;#34; (stray hairs when it&#x27;s staticky out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit spendy, so definitely use a small amount.  I have already recommended this to others.</li>
            <li> This version of Argan Oil is extremely unpleasant, with a nauseating scent that I cannot describe (rancid rubber?), that hits my stomach with an immediate punch. I would never put it on my face or hair because of the sickening scent. I was hoping it would be decent because the Josie Maran argan oil I use is too expensive to slather on the way I&#x27;d like.  The Maran one is the only other argan oil I&#x27;ve used; it has no scent, is lighter and absorbs quickly yet moisturizes my face all night. The Eve Hansen argan oil is heavier, rather like putting olive oil on the skin (which smells much better). I put it on my hands: after 15 minutes, the scent mostly dissipated, but my hands remain oily looking and feeling. (As background: I am sensitive to scents and only use unscented products.) Clearly, a less expensive argan oil was too much to wish for.</li>
            <li> I use this product in my hair, on my scalp, and face and it feels amazing afterwards! I will definitely buy this oil again!</li>
            <li> This gives my hair a great shine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been battling eczema on my knuckles and elbows for a while. I&#x27;ve tried mainstream over the counter intensive moisturizers... I&#x27;ve tried anti-fungal creams... straight coconut oil. I decided to put Argan Oil into a balm I made (Shea, cocoa butter, mango butter, ect) and my skin is better than it has been in years.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Great price, excellent quality.  I&#x27;m using it to make lotion for stretch marks  but I&#x27;m also using it directly on my hair. Mawesome my hair smooth and manageable</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS OIL!! i USE IT EVERYWHERE!!  I believe this oil has changed my life in big ways!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I am following the directions and notice the difference in my skin, hair and hands.  I will re-order&lt;br /&gt;when I use 3/4 of this product.  Don&#x27;t want to be without it.  Five star plus rating</li>
            <li> using the word love isn&#x27;t strong enough to tell how I feel about this product. I am 57 yrs old &amp; my skin loves this product. I put my 3 drops into my hand and apply to face &amp; may face is soft &amp; supple in the morning.  I put 3 drops in my palm and apply to hair and brush it through &amp; my hair wakes up feeling soft and silky.  I love love love this product !!</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for a short time. It&#x27;s working great on my skin...I like it.......The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell. But I&#x27;m happy with this purchase......</li>
            <li> This is Argan oil is great. I like the smell &amp; texture (not oily, silky feel) I use it on the ends of my hair &amp; hair line....&lt;br /&gt;Works great for curly hair *like Actress Tracee Ellis Rose &amp; Rachel True&lt;br /&gt;KEY USE: A little Goes a loooooooong way</li>
            <li> in fact, i just used it for sever times and i could not see the clear effect. but i think that is organic and i will use it for a long time and then to write the real review.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay... moisturizing is not that great.</li>
            <li> Perfect product, fast shipping</li>
            <li> Wonderful oil - it makes my face feel softer and my hands also</li>
            <li> Love this! Use it for my leave in hair oil mixture.</li>
            <li> Feels like a great quality product. Will reorder for sure when I run out of my 1st supply.</li>
            <li> Delivery on time .&lt;br /&gt;2 weeks in use  my hair looks good and looks stronger</li>
            <li> I love this as moisturizer, it is the best ! I also like to rub a few drops in my hair, it does not make it appear oily just makes it look alive and healthy and shiny. Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry. I apply it after my shower in the  evening. I love the way my skin looks in the AM.&lt;br /&gt;I am 77 years old and people always remark about how &amp;#34; lucky I am to have such a wonderful young looking skin&amp;#34; ...Funny  thing is that often people that would benefit the most from taking a little care of their skin immediately tell me &amp;#34;  Oh... that&#x27;s too much trouble&amp;#34;☺</li>
            <li> Totally made my skin breakout, but at the same time it&#x27;s nice.&lt;br /&gt;That said, be aware you will be signed up on the Spam list of this company if you buy it. I have had at least three mails asking me to review the product. Nothing inappropriate in terms of the ethics, but annoying- I WISH they would stop asking me to help them. Otherwise I&#x27;d give 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I have to say I love this product. It seems that my sink is softer and smoother. Only a small amount is needed. I use this for all over body oil and also use a very small amount at the ends of my hair. Wonderful product and I will buy again and again and again. Thank you Eve Hansen!</li>
            <li> I apply this amazing Argan oil on my toddler son&#x27;s scalp, on my skin &amp; nail beds almost daily.  My son&#x27;s scalp is no longer dry &amp; scaly.  My skin &amp; nail beds have J-like glow!  Hope everyone gets to benefit from Argan oil like I &amp; my son has.</li>
            <li> What a great product. I use it when I&#x27;m making Massage / Lotion candles to add Vitamin E for the skin.</li>
            <li> Good product for skin enhancement, the scent could be improved upon.</li>
            <li> Great! I have tried several different facial creams and oils, and nothing seems to work for me, since I have fairly oily skin. I am very happy that I have found this product! I understand why people have become so fond of it.</li>
            <li> thank you! i am a big fan of argan oil now!&lt;br /&gt;really leaves a silky feeling.  Highly recommended. Buy it. A+++</li>
            <li> This product is great! My wife had been pushing me to get a moisturizer for my face. I decided that I wanted something natural and this is what I decided to go with. My face feels VERY SOFT and well moisturized, even with the harsh winter conditions in Michigan. At first, I thought the smell was odd but my wife likes it. I&#x27;ll be purchasing this again when this bottle runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller was also great. Product arrived quicker than stated and the seller provided detailed instructions on how to trial the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the Argan Oil.  It seems to be the exact same product as some of the very expensive ones sold elsewhere. I was a little apprehensive as the packaging is generic. I first tried it on my hands for a few days.  I feel it does a very good job moisturizing. I would purchase  it again.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! My hair is soft and manageable. It is worth the buy. I have used other products that may contain argan oil but the results were not like this. 100% organic is the way to go and I truly appreciate that a helpful email is sent by the Eve Hansen to share some helpful hints.</li>
            <li> Lovely oil at a great price, Just as good as the pricier options. Huge size for the money.I&#x27;ve used Argan oil for a long time now and have been looking for a more affordable option .I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This Oil is fantastic... I use it on my hair, nails and skin.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Very light texture. I use 5-6 drops on damp towel dried hair - shinier, more manageable hair. Also a drop on my nails makes them stronger and healthier looking - almost as though I have had a French manicure. Warning - slightly funky smell, but disappears in a bit.</li>
            <li> Needed this in a hurry, great product. quick delivery.  Arrived in great condition.  Would recommend to anyone who likes and uses argan oil</li>
            <li> I have very pronounced surgery scars. This oil was recommended for scar massage. The oil is very light and gets absorbed very quickly. I have used it for 4 weeks now and am seeing some improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Argan oil for quite some time, and I love the benefit to my skin. I ordered this brand because I wanted to save money and my usual brand was backordered. This brand was thicker, darker and smelled like old oil.  Not sure if I got an old product, but this actually broke out my skin.  I&#x27;ve gone back to my usual brand and have no issues.  The only positive I can give is that it was well packaged in a dark, heavy glass jar with dropper.</li>
            <li> I am really beginning to see a very positive change for the better.  Scar is gradually changing for the better.  Ordered second bottle</li>
            <li> I love how this argan oil feels on my skin and hair. it gives my skin a pretty healthy good skin glow. This is the argan oil I will be sticking to&lt;br /&gt;since I am always looking for the naturally organics in food and skincare. I am very happy to have found Eva Hansen products. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I&#x27;m loving it so far. I have quite a bit of acne &amp; extremely oily skin, someone recommended this oil to me &amp; I&#x27;m so thankful they did!! Thank you!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> the product works well but it smells pretty unpleasant, which I&#x27;m quite bummed about because I wanted to put This on my face. I don&#x27;t think I can put this on my face Bc it smells bad to me. I&#x27;ve had argon oil before but bought by Josie Maran and that one smelled much better.</li>
            <li> Great value! Comparable to a more name brand product.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. It works best for me when I mix a few drops with my moisturizer each morning. I do this for my face and on my hands. This oil came to my attention when I purchased some shampoo that had Argon oil in it. I was so surprised at how different my hair felt. I am over 50 and post menopause and have all the awful symptoms with my hair - thinning, brittle, etc. This oil does not re grow hair but it made my hair very soft - not brittle - and it actually made my hair look slightly thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next experiment is to mix a few drops in my shampoo and see what that does. I do not recommend using the oil directly on hair. I tried that and it didn&#x27;t want to rinse out. I also tried the oil directly on my skin and it felt a little sticky at first and I had to really rub it in. Mixing with lotion or moisturizer works best and absorbs very quickly with no residue.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair and face.So far I like it and it works well.</li>
            <li> Just got it today, doesn&#x27;t smell good but when I added a few drops to my eye cream and facial cream , massaged it in, OMG my eye area is already less dry and my whole face and neck are softer than a babys bottom!!! This is the real deal!!!! Try it try it TRY IT!! Its like the fountain of youth!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!!</li>
            <li> Great product thanks !</li>
            <li> When I first received this product, I tried it and it seemed pleasant and silky texture.  HOWEVER, don&#x27;t know if I was suppose to refrigerate it to maintain it&#x27;s freshness, the scent/smell is suspect. Reminds me of the  smell of discarded cooking oil . however, once applied to skin the smell subsides.  Am going to use it on my legs and feet for now. Will contact Eve with my concerns.  UPDATE:::  I wrote to Eve regarding my concerns.  She was exceptionally apologetic, helpful, informative about her product and my concern.  Without delay she offered me any product on her site or another bottle of Argan Oil at no cost to me.  I opted for Argan Oil. Received it today and the scent is pleasant, a bit nutty, olive. Thanks Eve! Will order other products from you!</li>
