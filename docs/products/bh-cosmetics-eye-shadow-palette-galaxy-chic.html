            <li>The colors are amazing</li>
            <li>Product arrived fast and I was very happy with the palette&#x27;s size.</li>
            <li>The palette is very pigmented and incredible quality!</li>
            <li>palette is beautiful and I absolutely adore it.</li>
            <li>Beautiful colors that are highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received so many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>I really love the product</li>
            <li>Using them with eye drops as aposed to water they were better though.</li>
            <li>:) currently my favorite.</li>
            <li>Some of them come off light, but if you wear a primer underneath it shows better.</li>
            <li>(I found that a quarter worked perfect) wrapped in a napkin and press it as hard as you can into the eyeshadow well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pigmented and goes on smoothly!</li>
            <li>I love it sooooo much.</li>
            <li>Super pretty!</li>
            <li>The colors are very pigmented and rich.</li>
            <li>But when I use it with the white or black primer it looks perfect.</li>
            <li>The palette came quickly and very neatly packaged.</li>
            <li>I love these colors, however I have to use a white primer because it&#x27;s not as pigmented as I thought.</li>
            <li>(try not to mix too much since most of these have multiple colors in one eyeshadow).</li>
            <li>Great product but mine came broken</li>
            <li>Wow!! ðŸ˜‰</li>
            <li>When I finally got a full pallet and used the shadows they were not as pigmented as the swatches even when I use my urban decay primer</li>
            <li>Love the eye shadow, but came broken.</li>
            <li>If anyone&#x27;s used the wet brush application, I would highly suggest it with this palette.</li>
            <li>I did have two that were broken, but that&#x27;s actually an easy fix!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> when this is empty I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Just enough to get it wet don&#x27;t soak it.</li>
            <li> Let it dry out before you use</li>
            <li> they still weren&#x27;t as expected.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited about this but slowly as I returned the item three times due to broken shadows</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m only giving 4 stars because one shadow was broken.</li>
            <li> If I get it exchanged would it be possible for it to come broken again?</li>
            <li> Then put a few drops of rubbing alcohol into the eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> and I got 5 broken shadows</li>
            <li> Two came in broken.</li>
            <li> take something (I used a bobby pin) and crush the broken eyeshadow into a powder</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed to receive this package, with the shadows broken and crumbled everywhere.</li>
            <li> :(</li>

            <li> This palette is absolutely gorgeous and the colors are SO pigmented! I&#x27;ll post pictures (: when this is empty I will definitely buy again! I&#x27;ve received so many compliments on it. If anyone&#x27;s used the wet brush application, I would highly suggest it with this palette. It&#x27;s glittery so it goes on perfectly with water. Love this!</li>

            <li> the colors are amazing but i&#x27;m only giving 4 stars because one shadow was broken. i am keeping because 1) i know how to fix it and 2) i&#x27;ve been wanting this forever</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors I am in love!! Wow!! ðŸ˜‰</li>
            <li> There is no complaints about this pallet ! It&#x27;s very pigmented and goes on smoothly! The colors are amazing</li>
            <li> Two came in broken. I really love the product so I don&#x27;t want a refund. If I get it exchanged would it be possible for it to come broken again? It seems like a lot of people have the same issue.</li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect!! The palette is very pigmented and incredible quality! The palette came quickly and very neatly packaged. It was even larger than I anticipated. Amazing quality!</li>

            <li> I love these colors! Some of them come off light, but if you wear a primer underneath it shows better. I did have two that were broken, but that&#x27;s actually an easy fix!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just take something (I used a bobby pin) and crush the broken eyeshadow into a powder (try not to mix too much since most of these have multiple colors in one eyeshadow). Then put a few drops of rubbing alcohol into the eyeshadow. Just enough to get it wet don&#x27;t soak it. Then, take a coin (I found that a quarter worked perfect) wrapped in a napkin and press it as hard as you can into the eyeshadow well. It will press the powder back together and the alcohol will help it form. Let it dry out before you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This palette is beautiful and I absolutely adore it.</li>
            <li> Great product but mine came broken</li>
            <li> Never again will I refer to regular eyeshadows. Baked eyeshadows are the way to go especially with these.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this but slowly as I returned the item three times due to broken shadows my excitement died. When I finally got a full pallet and used the shadows they were not as pigmented as the swatches even when I use my urban decay primer they still weren&#x27;t as expected.  Using them with eye drops as aposed to water they were better though. Expect to use fingers instead of brushes.</li>
            <li> Love the eye shadow, but came broken.</li>
