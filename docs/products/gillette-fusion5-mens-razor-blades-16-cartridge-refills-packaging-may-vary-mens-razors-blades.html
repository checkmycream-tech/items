            <li>So I got an amazing razor, the best they make for $150.00 since I&#x27;m def going to be using the gift certificates for stuff I need.</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon is great becasue</li>
            <li>Gillette did some great research before producing this product.  </li>
            <li>Gillette 5 bladed system works great on my face</li>
            <li>I think this part is a great improvement in the retrieval of the blade.  </li>

            <li>This one is great.</li>
            <li>Great razor blades.  </li>
            <li>here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the great cosmetic design fool you.</li>
            <li>The item itself is great.  </li>
            <li>These razors are great.  </li>
            <li>But the Fusion Power is the happy exception.  </li>
            <li>Great place to shop</li>
            <li>if you want to find a great deal on these.</li>
            <li>and I thought that this product would work out great for me.</li>
            <li>The razor is great.  </li>
            <li>Great blades and an amazing shave!</li>
            <li>This was a good product with a Great price.</li>
            <li>Look, the Mach 3 is a superior razor, and if you are happy with it, don&#x27;t worry about immediately running to the store for a Fusion.  </li>
            <li>I have owned every incarnation of the Gillette razor, and I can easily say that this is the best.  </li>
            <li>The cartridge has a great life span, as I&#x27;ve used one cartridge for many shaves!</li>
            <li>I was impressed this is the best i have used so by far.</li>
            <li>except sometimes Costco has a good deal</li>
            <li>If this is fair then I dont know what fair is.  </li>
            <li>They had good reviews when we ordered, but they ended up being counterfeit.  </li>
            <li>of use:  All you have to do is snap the handle bit of the razor to the blades and your good to go</li>
            <li>good lord, it&#x27;s like you have been watching</li>
            <li>I recommend Gillette&#x27;s &#x27;Good News Pivot Plus with Lubrastrip&#x27; 12 pack for 50 cents each.  </li>
            <li>This product looked good for the price.</li>
            <li>Too good infact, think it was a knockoff.</li>
            <li>The item was received in a timely manner and we are delighted with the product.</li>
            <li>It also means I have to spend a lot of money shaving my face to look good.</li>
            <li>If you still uses cartridges to shave yourself you must buy this pack its really really good.</li>
            <li>Razors today are vastly superior to razors twenty years ago.</li>
            <li>Got a good price on these.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved the product which is why I ordered this replacement cartridges pack from amazon.</li>
            <li>but if you buy in bulk a good value on purchase</li>
            <li>The blades work great and leave my face very smooth</li>
            <li>I use this product and I,am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>The shaver glides over my face, and the vibration feels good - kind of like a pick-me-up in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Fusion Power because I am a huge Federer fan and he endorsed this product so I thought why the heck not!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, after using the first razor and cartridge, the closeness of the shave was incredible!</li>
            <li>I first tried the fusion power razor, I thought it was great!</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend this to any guy who needs a great shave.</li>
            <li>King of Shaves shaving oil is amazing no matter what razor you use.</li>
            <li>If you happen to own a pair of scissors, there would be NO NEED to get the Frustration-Free packaging.</li>
            <li>I smell noble price</li>
            <li>I guess power m3 is a better option atleast considering they have good replacement blades</li>
            <li>Nice shave - like the price compared to the store price</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shaving with this razor is like shaving with a warm stick of butter, but with a closer shave.</li>
            <li>The M3&#x27;s do just as good and are a safe and reliable shave.</li>
            <li>good product  easy to use</li>
            <li>Excellent directly through amazon.com!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, these Fusion Power&#x27;s are the best for me.</li>
            <li>These are the best razors for guys by far.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s my problem area for closeness and so far the Fusion is the best I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>Eventually, I went old school, safety razors are the best you&#x27;ll every get.</li>
            <li>I am 71 years old and this is the best razor blade I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It gives a pretty good shave, but not as good as the double-edges I used as a kid.</li>
            <li>I think the price in general for this brand is out of control, but it&#x27;s probably the best that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>But my first blade lasted about 3 months and gave a great shave.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the 5 blade technology as it gives you a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li>I also like the one-blade trimmer on top - very handy for evening out my sideburns and zapping those stray whiskers right under my nostrils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Power Fusion gives me a very smooth shave each and every time I use it.</li>
            <li>I have recently started shaving my head and am happy to say the Fusion Power provides the best overall shave I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li>Very smooth results, and no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The 5 blades are very smooth and glides across the face easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It shaves very smooth.</li>
            <li>I love the Gillette Fusion razor blades.  </li>
            <li>love how they take your money and never give you what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>is another interesting tidbit you probably didn&#x27;t know about all of this.</li>
            <li>That way you&#x27;ll be able to report if I have been fooled about that too.  :)</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s why I put ok</li>
            <li>I love this razor.  </li>
            <li>Liked the free shipping.</li>
            <li>A lot of people think these things are better than the Fusion /or/ the Pivot.  </li>
            <li>do make a face feel better after the shave tho.</li>
            <li>Give it a shot yourself, I think you&#x27;ll find that the best combo is to buy a Fusion Power razor and regular Fusion blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gives me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had, and I shave daily.</li>
            <li>Stick with a reputable dealer, like Amazon.</li>
            <li>these razors almost never go on sale and if you get the subscription delivery you can get even more of a discount.</li>
            <li>Cartridges are replaced without ever touching them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The safest, most reliable way to purchase our products is through retail stores.  </li>
            <li>, I bleed more with those blades</li>
            <li>Okay so they upped my blades from three to five, but I can still just stick with three.  </li>
            <li>I used a Mach 3 for years and was satisfied.</li>
            <li>This razor is well worth the investment, I loved my Mach 3</li>
            <li>but this is just much better in my opinion.</li>
            <li>With so many blades, I felt like I was shaving off layers of skin.  </li>
            <li>Shave isn&#x27;t much better than the Mach3 Turbo.  </li>
            <li>While it might take a shave or 2 more to get all the hairs off</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is more like 3 1/2 stars.  </li>
            <li>5 blades are definitely better than 1.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to have to buy some more of these in 2016.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But...  Compared to the Schick multi-blade razors, the Fusion is incredibly better.  </li>
            <li>The weight of the item could not have cost more than $15.00.  </li>
            <li>I received these blades Free from Gillette to try!</li>
            <li>No nicks, no pulling and smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt!</li>
            <li>SCHICK HYDRO 5 IS A BETTER BANG FOR YOUR BUCK</li>
            <li>the better</li>
            <li>MORE CAN I SAY</li>
            <li>(if I do, it&#x27;s more because of rushing or clumsiness than anything else).  </li>
            <li>(if I do, it&#x27;s more because of rushing or clumsiness than anything else).  </li>
            <li>+1 is better than 3 &#x3D;P</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think its the case for most people.</li>
            <li>Fushion is quite a bit better.</li>
            <li>The love of my life has always used this brand of shaver and when this newer model came out we bought it for an upgrade.  </li>
            <li>Came fast from the supplier and my husband&#x27;s happy with the fusion power blades.  </li>
            <li>The great shaves I got from the Fusion really sold me on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>ok product doesnt give me that close of a shave</li>
            <li>I recieved the razor with blade free from gilette and will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li>I love these razors.  </li>
            <li>Although Gillette has created fancier razor since this introduction, I&#x27;m sticking with what I&#x27;m confident in using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found that by subscribing for tri-annual shipment, I can save more money and since I don&#x27;t shave every day, I have a stockpile of replacement cartridges.</li>
            <li>Gillette Fusion razors are pretty good.</li>
            <li>From my first shave I have been delighted.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying my best to only use 2 a month, shaving every other day and none on the weekends, but that&#x27;s about the best I can do.</li>
            <li>I was a recent upgrade to Mach 3 and liked it a great deal.</li>
            <li>this is the first time in my 60 years + life they actually have a great blade and a great shave.</li>
            <li>The special coating on the razor&#x27;s \\&quot;face\\&quot; (the blue strip) mixes the best (for me) when I use \\&quot;Head Slick\\&quot; by Headblade.</li>
            <li>Gillette Fusion, or comparable manual razors, cost roughly 2.5 times what it cost me to operate the best Braun electric razor.</li>
            <li>All Gillette razors give you a shave, but if you are going to shave every day, this is the most comfortable and nicest feeling one.</li>
            <li>Heads are easy to snap off and on.  </li>
            <li>Work fine.</li>
            <li>THE PRODUCT WORKED FINE</li>
            <li>A fine replacement blade pack that works</li>
            <li>These are Gillette brand and work fine with my Fusion Power.</li>
            <li>The blades work as expected, which is very good.</li>
            <li>Smooth as silk; doesn&#x27;t miss any part of your face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard mixed reviews on the vibrating aspect of razors, personally, it is great for the Fusion.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s task: make your skin smooth, without any sign of beard.</li>
            <li>This 8-count package should last me for a couple years of happy shaving.</li>
            <li>Within about 4 days, I had a coupon in my mailbox for a free replacement 8 pack.</li>
            <li>Thank you for offereing this \\&quot;great deal\\&quot; on a product used daily in our home.</li>
            <li>Plus they have to make up the money somewhere, they basically give the razor away for free.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, this all leaves me wondering if I shouldn&#x27;t just get my own straight razor and avoid this monthly razor tax.</li>
            <li>I recieved these with a Gillette power razor for free to test and review.</li>
            <li>I received these Gillette Fusion Power Razor Blades to try free from Gillette.</li>
            <li>i really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s close, comfortable, and luxurious.</li>
            <li>A move comfortable, smoother shave for me.</li>
            <li>Now, I get the smooth shaves</li>
            <li>For years, I&#x27;ve been using cheap, reusable razors, including the Target brand triple blade models.</li>
            <li>The vibration works wonders on the stubble and makes it easy to clean when finished.</li>
            <li>Gives a smooth shave day after day.  </li>
            <li>shave did not seem as close and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I received these free from Gillette to try.  </li>
            <li>Great price compared to the local drugstore.</li>
            <li>Expensive but good and probably the best price for the blades.</li>
            <li>make sure you use the right shaving \\&quot;cream\\&quot; ... not just any will do, mind you.  </li>
            <li>Hey guys,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought a Fusion power when it came out and used it for a week</li>
            <li>Original blade lasted almost thrice the time than these.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll update this review when I change my first cartridge. :)</li>
            <li>This razor gives a good shave, but, it is really not that much better than the M3 or even the the Sensor.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find these cartridges at my local grocery, for some reason, so it&#x27;s nice being able to just order some.</li>
            <li>They very cleverly use terms like \\&quot;a better way to shave\\&quot; or \\&quot;30% closer blades\\&quot;, and there is a reason for this.</li>
            <li>However, Gillette with these newer hyped blade systems is able to charge a lot more for the replacement blades and reap higher profit margins than the older blade systems.</li>
            <li>They give a better shave than their Mach III predecessor, but the cost of blades has risen quite a bit over time making me question if it is even worth the price of the higher end blades.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re mostly usable, but not as comfortable as normal.  </li>
            <li>It does such a good job when I shave and</li>
            <li>SOME WHAT ENJOYABLE, THE POWER RAZOR REALLY DOES WORK WELL &amp; GIVES YOU</li>
            <li>But no matter how you cut it (no pun intended) they are expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks offering them at a more reasonable prise than brick &amp; mortar stores.</li>
            <li>Used all eight in two day&#x27;s trying to find a good one, cut my face each time I tried a different cartridge.</li>
            <li>I really find it much better than the M3.</li>
            <li>After years of trial and error, I&#x27;ve finally settled on a good shaving cream system:</li>
            <li>When I purchased these they were such a good deal compared to the retail pricing.</li>
            <li>For some reason though, these blades feel different, and not in a good way.</li>
            <li>The gentle vibration from the fusion power allow the blades to glide smoothly over skin without causing irritation!</li>
            <li>It is a very nice, well constructed product, but five blades are just not reasonable in my opinion.</li>
            <li>My guess is they regret having created a blade that isn&#x27;t as quickly disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so quick I don&#x27;t see how it could be avoided.</li>
            <li>The razor just glided over my skin, I never felt like I had to go back over areas, it was incredibly comfortable, and, most importantly,</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used Gillette since they gave my unit free razors during the first Gulf War (I was in the Marines at the time).  </li>
            <li>Also, when I used it my skin became more irritated than it normally does with shaving.</li>
            <li>It seems every 2-3 years, a new shaving product comes out that is much better.  </li>
            <li>The good news with this razor is that the single blade on the reverse makes a neat job of sideburns and mustache area for men.  </li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion Power Replacement Cartridges does cost a substantial amount of money, but it gives the person the realization that he is pretty clean shaven.</li>
            <li>open items immediately to make sure they are correct and read fine print on return dates....</li>
            <li>The Gillette Replacement Cartridges, although very high per unit, were sold at the most reasonable price I&#x27;ve seen on the internet.</li>
            <li>A REAL CLOSE COMFORTABLE</li>
            <li>These razors are fantastic but I never realized how much money I could be saving by switching to a comparable product.</li>
            <li>Give the suckers a free sample that&#x27;s great and make them pay for crummy blades after they&#x27;ve committed to the system.</li>
            <li>And Gillette knows this through their own internal research.</li>
            <li>but it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>But I can make them last a lot longer than the old 3-blade razors while still getting a great shave.  </li>
            <li>But I can make them last a lot longer than the old 3-blade razors while still getting a great shave.  </li>
            <li>SO WORTH IT.</li>
            <li>The cartridge for the gilette fusion power razors has a precision blade that allows a more detailed shave without using multiple razors.</li>
            <li>One of the blades isn&#x27;t placed right tho.  </li>
            <li>Pulsonic Shaver for $199.99 about a year ago, and periodically (right now for example) you can get $50.00 in gift certificates with the purchase of any Braun electric razor that is over $130.00.</li>
            <li>They snap right into the Fusion razor and can be replaced by just pushing the button on the cartridge.</li>
            <li>3 blades seems to be just the right amount for getting in all areas on the face.  </li>
            <li>I was right.</li>
            <li>the significant price difference between the older 3-blade systems and newer ones like Fusion, folks really are better off saving their money and sticking with the older systems.</li>
            <li>If you let your beard get a little \\&quot;scruffy\\&quot;, the Gillette Fusion Power razor feels like Velcro catching across your face!</li>
            <li>Smooth, high quality blades.  </li>
            <li>I do not use shaving cream, as I find that I cut myself much more easily that way, and shave carefully to avoid razor burn.</li>
            <li>The blades are great and usually will provide a weeks service before replacement.</li>
            <li>At $19 minus an extra discount this was a very good price for this 8 cartridge set of fusion blades.</li>
            <li>Without that blade, which cuts very close safely, I would not be able to cut my mustache area due to the size of the head.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>The service was good and the price was less than retail.  </li>
            <li>That said, a good blade shaves smooth and if you&#x27;ve ever tried using a disposable (cos you forgot to pack your  shaver), you&#x27;ll come to appreciate that gillette&#x27;s blades can last a very long time.</li>
            <li>I use cordless shavers but they still leave some stubble so using this product dry, I complete the shave nice and smooth</li>
            <li>It takes one AAA-battery that seems to last a decent interval (the low-battery indicator is a nice touch).  </li>
            <li>Those who ridicule the increasing number of blades on razors are likely those who don&#x27;t need much more than a Bic one-blade razor because it&#x27;s what works for them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine any possible improvement that can ever be made to deliver a better shave.</li>
            <li>We then went to order through amazon and went back to that site to see MANY complaints.  </li>
            <li>If you read the description closely of the Gillette Fusion product as put out by Gillette, you will see that Gillette doesn&#x27;t actually claim that you get a closer or even better shave.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to accept it at first, but after using these refills for a while I am willing to accept the premium.  </li>
            <li>But be aware of this for yourself as you try these refills.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>The lotion strips on the M3 Power feel better and seem to last longer than on the Fusion razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are simply too many points of contact along your face with this razor.</li>
            <li>It turned out to be the same thing but with more blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After the first shave my hopes were destroyed.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much !</li>
            <li>This is the first blade that does not cut and nick my face and leave me with sores or ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>At first I struggled a bit getting the battery cap off of the end.  </li>
            <li>My first time using a powered stick razor.  </li>
            <li>The power is nothing more than a small vibrator motor, like a cell phone, but it provides a closer shave because you end up applying more pressure with slower strokes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on the first cartridge</li>
            <li>The first shave was like a blade that I should have discarded.  </li>
            <li>Try it yourself but the initial blade is much better than the replacement cartridges.</li>
            <li>Schick is in trouble now, their crappy 4 blade razor wasn&#x27;t even as good as the mach 3</li>
            <li>I was just kidding though I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Gillette released a new razor with that many blades.</li>
            <li>I am a previous mach3 user and made the switch to fusion power because&lt;br /&gt;it is a more comfortable shave</li>
            <li>While shaving my skin felt really smooth, but my hairs grew back just as quickly as they did with the Mach3 Turbo (no noticeable</li>
            <li>The Fusion&#x27;s extra single blade is a great innovation, something they should consider for their single-blade model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a nice razor with some pros and cons compared to Gillette&#x27;s other blades.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite the introduction of the Phantom version, which gives men a more palatable black over the original orange, the shave it gives is still an inferior one.</li>
            <li>It works very well, the skin is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>The main bit of shaving is smoother and seems faster, but probably not so much as worth an upgrade from a M3 Power.</li>
            <li>They looked like the real thing and the packaging was exact, but they were fakes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.t my sideburns and zapping those stray whiskers right under my nostrils.</li>
            <li>I feel there is a limit to how many blades are realistic, and this felt like it was too big for my face</li>
            <li>I just make sure that the blades are dry after each shave.</li>
            <li>This was a much better value then purchasing locally and the blades are as described in normal retail packaging.</li>
            <li>The blade is pretty big, but it glides smoothly.</li>
            <li>That said, I can trim better with the single blade than with 3 (or 5) blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>then it does with the Fusion (on the large surface area portions of my face mind you), the M3 Power just seems safer in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These blades are extra fine</li>
            <li>This is the best shave I have had from any razor, wet or dry, outside of a barber&#x27;s chair.</li>
            <li>Now when I have purchased this same product from places like cvs, walmart and target; they shave so smoothly and gently.</li>
            <li>Mach3s lasted much longer, but still sometimes cut.</li>
            <li>These are not the real ones you buy at the store.</li>
            <li>The real money is with the replacement blades.</li>
            <li>And the blade stock used on the replacement blades is inferior and much duller to get folks to replace them faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks a Lot</li>
            <li>It really gives the smoothest shave.</li>
            <li>Twice as much as M3 and 3 times as much as Sensor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- I decided I didn&#x27;t like it as much as my M3 Power and put it aside.</li>
            <li>THANKS ART WOLF</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t have the serial number as the real Gillette blades have.</li>
            <li>They last about 2-3 weeks and always give a smooth no-nick shave.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>This is the only razor that get my face totally smooth and doesn&#x27;t cut my face.</li>
            <li>The packs were unopned, but it really felt to my wife and I that maybe they were 2nds or irregulars.</li>
            <li>Just be gentle and you will avoid bleeding.</li>
            <li>But the real question here is whether the \\&quot;power\\&quot; part of this product differentiates it at all from the non-\\&quot;power\\&quot; version.  </li>
            <li>Really, what&#x27;s the difference?  </li>
            <li>I always think they cost too much</li>
            <li>When ready to use them, discovered mistake.</li>
            <li>Unless you have a straight razor this might be the closest shave you&#x27;ll get.</li>
            <li>Really like these blades.  </li>
            <li>Last year I received a free Fusion handle and blade in the mail from Gillette.</li>
            <li>so much I have two - one in my travel kit.  </li>
            <li>I get really close and neat</li>
            <li>My whiskers grow fast, thick, and need some seriously good razors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, when I take into account that 4-pack might last me a year, an 8-pack at a high price is fine by me.</li>
            <li>Yes they are expensive but dagnabit these things work good!.  </li>
            <li>but they work better than any other blade I have found.  </li>
            <li>It was previously posted that Gillette uses better blades of their  sale on a purchase of new Fusion razor with extra blades to get one hooked into buying more replacements and then sells a lesser quality blade on one&#x27;s future purchase of more replacements.</li>
            <li>Smooth, fast and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>Ultimately, the result is worth the higher price.  </li>
            <li>Ultimately, the result is worth the higher price.  </li>
            <li>The single blade on the reverse is an interesting feature, but only somewhat useful.</li>
            <li>Blades are grossly over priced and only last 3 or 4 shaves at optimum sharpness.</li>
            <li>Design and look of the Fusion isn&#x27;t as slick or nice as the M3</li>
            <li>I have a pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I did like the ones I bought to try, but will not buy more until they come down in price.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was really excited waiting for my brand new Fusion Power razor to arrive, I am allergic to shaving so this was a big issue for me.</li>
            <li>The model just before this new one worked very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to see gillette improve on it, but they probably can&#x27;t without making it less safe and in this litigious climate they probably prefer to err on the side of caution.</li>
            <li>I actually bought another fusion razor on a great sale with extra cartridges and noticed the shave was much smoother and closer than the previous blades.</li>
            <li>also restock fee, must pay own shipping/handling to return with only possibility of getting a partial refund..</li>
            <li>On time and a decent price.</li>
            <li>I immediately decided to switch from an older system that I had been using for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price was right, but the shave would have been better with a dull steak knife.......</li>
            <li>A good shave but blades don&#x27;t last long enough to make up for high price.</li>
            <li>I think I will do that for the fact that although I do really like these new blades, they are high in cost compared to the M3 I normally use.  </li>
            <li>The reason I know is that I have a cousin high up in one of these companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>my beard is not thick, and I do sport a goatee, which may also help with longevity of cartridges.</li>
            <li>Great price for a brand product that is quite expensive in the stores.</li>
            <li>The blades that go with the razor packages actually come from a different stock, which are made much sharper to give a better shave and last much longer.</li>
            <li>I normally cut myself when I shave with a razor, but with this guy, the cuts stopped.</li>
            <li>You decide: Normally one blade in 8 weeks.</li>
            <li>Yes it&#x27;s a nice shave, but it&#x27;s not worth all the hype or additional financial burden</li>
            <li>wonder if the extra blades even do anything useful during my shave.  </li>
            <li>my Face\\&quot; shave cream, which does tend to extend the life of the cartridge, while also providing a better and closer shave, with far less irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you use this, try different shave creams, and be sure to thoroughly dry the cartridge between uses.</li>
            <li>Have you ever wondered why the original blade that came on the actual razor you purchased seemed to last much longer than any of the replacements.</li>
            <li>:  I use these blades a lot, they do not dull quickly so I get a long life span out of each of them (</li>
            <li>With the Gillette Fusion Power, I&#x27;ve finally found the right one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gillette has some of the nicest products on the market, and I expected the Fusion to blow me away, but unlike the jump that was made when the Mach3 came out, I was not as excited after my shave as I was for the hype</li>
            <li>instead of buying a new razor altogether.</li>
            <li>I no longer have to buy a new pack of blades every 4 weeks</li>
            <li>I had lost my Mach 3 Turbo, so I decided upgrading to new Gillette Fusion Power with 5 blades.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Shaving time IS reduced with this new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this new blade will put you back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, when I saw Gillette touting their new 5-blade system, I gave it a shot.  </li>
            <li>Every new razor they come out with</li>
            <li>Brand new, unopened.  </li>
            <li>The razors are not shaving smoothly, they are very very rough and tear up my face.</li>
            <li>Their ads lately have been targeted towards those reusing the product more than they&#x27;d like, and so there&#x27;s a whole marketing bend they&#x27;re on about checking your indicator strips to see if it&#x27;s time to replace.</li>
            <li>Harry&#x27;s is a better deal as far as everyday pricing goes.</li>
            <li>And I didn&#x27;t even have to send the old ones back - they went right in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Got a great deal on these.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t expect anything less for the usual price.</li>
            <li>Not such a hot deal.</li>
            <li>But hold on I purchased the replacement blades and WOW!  </li>
            <li>main problem that I was having was trying to catch the replacement cartridges at a reasonable price or on sale and Amazon.com became my sole source of purchasing there cartridges.</li>
            <li>I love the smooth shave that I receive from the blade and in over eight years, have only received two serious nicks, possibly from a defective cartridge.</li>
            <li>So the extra blade on the back of the Fusion was what really got me interested.</li>
            <li>I am one of those guys who have always had to deal with the \\&quot;five o&#x27;clock shadow that shows up around noon, so it is a tremendous advancement in shaving technology that I can get a close shave that won&#x27;t require a second shave in the middle of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess that these guys should really start working in something new because the \\&quot;adding more blades\\&quot; thing is getting exhausted.</li>
            <li>Most men might not change their blades as often as I did but the things got dull</li>
            <li>They went with a new interface for putting blades in that seems to take a step back, and having to buy the new razor to work with the new blades</li>
            <li>In a military environment that I live in, we constantly have to be clean shaven.</li>
            <li>Gentle on the skin especially for people with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Once again, I&#x27;ve been using mine for a long time and didn&#x27;t experience that first hand.  </li>
            <li>[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judging by the mixed reviews, some people may get real blades and some may not.  </li>
            <li>The head is massive but it glides really well.  </li>
            <li>Wow 5 blades instead of three?</li>
            <li>This is by far the closest shave yet.</li>
            <li>I was surprised.</li>
            <li>Wow, I thought.</li>
            <li>year or so later, my M3 Power stopped working, so I ran out to the store and picked up some normal Fusion replacement cartridges (not Fusion Power!)</li>
            <li>While it does shave close, for the first time ever my loves skin is ripped and cut up every single time.  </li>
            <li>I bought the exact same package from walgreens and the blades felt completely different.</li>
            <li>a steady hand can still produce the same result.</li>
            <li>purchased my first 4 pack locally and replaced the sample blade after it finally wore out.</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;ve changed cartridge/blades but only because the old blades look worn, but with the power on, it shaves as well as the new blade.</li>
            <li>Fusion power razor blades are great but very expensive.  </li>
            <li>I especially like the extra blade on the back to do sideburns and keep the back of my neck looking clean.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you order them ONLY directly through Amazon or be VERY careful ordering them through other sites.  </li>
            <li>this new blade will put you back.    </li>
            <li>And the fact that they always last 3 or 4 times as long as other blades makes them not nearly as expensive as you might think at first.</li>
            <li>While a little on the pricy side, they offer more comfort than any other blade around.</li>
            <li>last week I went to replace a cartridge, and found that ALL, literally all, were completely rusted !</li>
            <li>its a little pricey but worth the cash, if you have it to spend.&lt;br /&gt;thomas</li>
            <li>No longer am I buying Mach3 razors every month, I&#x27;m barely buying one pack a year.</li>
            <li>I switched to old school double edged razor blades</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s see...that a penny a shave for the blades plus a few cents worth of TOBS shave cream.</li>
            <li>I get a close shave that leaves my face feeling better than other products I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li>It does give a close shave and when you first give it a go you have to be a little careful because five blades is really almost overkill.  </li>
            <li>When I purchased my first Gillette Fusion Power razor a few years ago, I thought it was kind of silly</li>
            <li>The old two-blade blades the Gillette makes got tossed out the second the Mach3&#x27;s came out, and the Mach3&#x27;s were equally tossed when the Fusion Power&#x27;s arrived.</li>
            <li>(only have to replace the blade set once a year now for $25.00) and no shave cream (have to buy a few cleaning and lubrication packs though for about $40.00 for a years worth)</li>
            <li>the blades are not sharp and not aligned properly.</li>
            <li>the extra blade on the back for little stuff is actually more useful than one may think, also the strip runs down when you should change your blade which if you are lazy is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all</li>
            <li>The Fusion does truly gives me the best shave ever, and I have a very thick beard, and I have to agree the blade on the back is useless.  </li>
            <li>The only obvious new feature is the trimmer, which is only that, a feature, and not a real technical advance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s my take on razors in general: not all men are the same.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to have to start growing a beard year round and walking to work pretty soon with all of the astronomical increases in prices.  </li>
            <li>It is a little more expensive than other disposables but the close, comfortable shave makes up for the price.</li>
            <li>My old Mach3&#x27;s used to last a long time...</li>
            <li>The other day I realize it needed a new blade (admittedly I don&#x27;t shave every day).  </li>

            <li> shave from this razor is incredibly close, with no irritation.</li>
            <li> This is really great stuff.</li>
            <li> They do a great job</li>
            <li> I progressed from the Mach 3 to the Schick Quatro and was happy with teh move.  </li>
            <li> I have been using these blades with my Fusion Razor and they do a great job of giving me a close shave&lt;br</li>
            <li> You will be happy.  </li>
            <li> Great Product.  </li>
            <li> So I got an amazing razor, the best they make for $150.00 since I&#x27;m def going to be using the gift certificates for stuff I need.</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon is great becasue</li>
            <li> Gillette did some great research before producing this product.  </li>
            <li> Gillette 5 bladed system works great on my face</li>
            <li> I think this part is a great improvement in the retrieval of the blade.  </li>
            <li> These blades shave great, The closest I have gotten without nicks and cuts all over my face.  </li>
            <li> This one is great.</li>
            <li> Great razor blades.  </li>
            <li> here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the great cosmetic design fool you.</li>
            <li> The item itself is great.  </li>
            <li> These razors are great.  </li>
            <li> But the Fusion Power is the happy exception.  </li>
            <li> Great place to shop</li>
            <li> if you want to find a great deal on these.</li>
            <li> and I thought that this product would work out great for me.</li>
            <li> The razor is great.  </li>
            <li> Great blades and an amazing shave!</li>
            <li> This was a good product with a Great price.</li>
            <li> Look, the Mach 3 is a superior razor, and if you are happy with it, don&#x27;t worry about immediately running to the store for a Fusion.  </li>
            <li> I have owned every incarnation of the Gillette razor, and I can easily say that this is the best.  </li>
            <li> The cartridge has a great life span, as I&#x27;ve used one cartridge for many shaves!</li>
            <li> I was impressed this is the best i have used so by far.</li>
            <li> except sometimes Costco has a good deal</li>
            <li> If this is fair then I dont know what fair is.  </li>
            <li> They had good reviews when we ordered, but they ended up being counterfeit.  </li>
            <li> of use:  All you have to do is snap the handle bit of the razor to the blades and your good to go</li>
            <li> good lord, it&#x27;s like you have been watching</li>
            <li> I recommend Gillette&#x27;s &#x27;Good News Pivot Plus with Lubrastrip&#x27; 12 pack for 50 cents each.  </li>
            <li> This product looked good for the price.</li>
            <li> Too good infact, think it was a knockoff.</li>
            <li> The item was received in a timely manner and we are delighted with the product.</li>
            <li> It also means I have to spend a lot of money shaving my face to look good.</li>
            <li> If you still uses cartridges to shave yourself you must buy this pack its really really good.</li>
            <li> Razors today are vastly superior to razors twenty years ago.</li>
            <li> Got a good price on these.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the product which is why I ordered this replacement cartridges pack from amazon.</li>
            <li> but if you buy in bulk a good value on purchase</li>
            <li> The blades work great and leave my face very smooth</li>
            <li> I use this product and I,am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> The shaver glides over my face, and the vibration feels good - kind of like a pick-me-up in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Fusion Power because I am a huge Federer fan and he endorsed this product so I thought why the heck not!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, after using the first razor and cartridge, the closeness of the shave was incredible!</li>
            <li> I first tried the fusion power razor, I thought it was great!</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend this to any guy who needs a great shave.</li>
            <li> King of Shaves shaving oil is amazing no matter what razor you use.</li>
            <li> If you happen to own a pair of scissors, there would be NO NEED to get the Frustration-Free packaging.</li>
            <li> I smell noble price</li>
            <li> I guess power m3 is a better option atleast considering they have good replacement blades</li>
            <li> Nice shave - like the price compared to the store price</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaving with this razor is like shaving with a warm stick of butter, but with a closer shave.</li>
            <li> The M3&#x27;s do just as good and are a safe and reliable shave.</li>
            <li> good product  easy to use</li>
            <li> Excellent directly through amazon.com!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So far, these Fusion Power&#x27;s are the best for me.</li>
            <li> These are the best razors for guys by far.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my problem area for closeness and so far the Fusion is the best I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Eventually, I went old school, safety razors are the best you&#x27;ll every get.</li>
            <li> I am 71 years old and this is the best razor blade I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It gives a pretty good shave, but not as good as the double-edges I used as a kid.</li>
            <li> I think the price in general for this brand is out of control, but it&#x27;s probably the best that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> But my first blade lasted about 3 months and gave a great shave.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the 5 blade technology as it gives you a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li> I also like the one-blade trimmer on top - very handy for evening out my sideburns and zapping those stray whiskers right under my nostrils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Power Fusion gives me a very smooth shave each and every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I have recently started shaving my head and am happy to say the Fusion Power provides the best overall shave I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li> Very smooth results, and no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The 5 blades are very smooth and glides across the face easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It shaves very smooth.</li>
            <li> I love the Gillette Fusion razor blades.  </li>
            <li> love how they take your money and never give you what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> is another interesting tidbit you probably didn&#x27;t know about all of this.</li>
            <li> That way you&#x27;ll be able to report if I have been fooled about that too.  :)</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s why I put ok</li>
            <li> I love this razor.  </li>
            <li> Liked the free shipping.</li>
            <li> A lot of people think these things are better than the Fusion /or/ the Pivot.  </li>
            <li> do make a face feel better after the shave tho.</li>
            <li> Give it a shot yourself, I think you&#x27;ll find that the best combo is to buy a Fusion Power razor and regular Fusion blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gives me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had, and I shave daily.</li>
            <li> Stick with a reputable dealer, like Amazon.</li>
            <li> these razors almost never go on sale and if you get the subscription delivery you can get even more of a discount.</li>
            <li> Cartridges are replaced without ever touching them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The safest, most reliable way to purchase our products is through retail stores.  </li>
            <li> , I bleed more with those blades</li>
            <li> Okay so they upped my blades from three to five, but I can still just stick with three.  </li>
            <li> I used a Mach 3 for years and was satisfied.</li>
            <li> This razor is well worth the investment, I loved my Mach 3</li>
            <li> but this is just much better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> With so many blades, I felt like I was shaving off layers of skin.  </li>
            <li> Shave isn&#x27;t much better than the Mach3 Turbo.  </li>
            <li> While it might take a shave or 2 more to get all the hairs off</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is more like 3 1/2 stars.  </li>
            <li> 5 blades are definitely better than 1.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to buy some more of these in 2016.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But...  Compared to the Schick multi-blade razors, the Fusion is incredibly better.  </li>
            <li> The weight of the item could not have cost more than $15.00.  </li>
            <li> I received these blades Free from Gillette to try!</li>
            <li> No nicks, no pulling and smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt!</li>
            <li> SCHICK HYDRO 5 IS A BETTER BANG FOR YOUR BUCK</li>
            <li> the better</li>
            <li> MORE CAN I SAY</li>
            <li> (if I do, it&#x27;s more because of rushing or clumsiness than anything else).  </li>
            <li> (if I do, it&#x27;s more because of rushing or clumsiness than anything else).  </li>
            <li> +1 is better than 3 &#x3D;P</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think its the case for most people.</li>
            <li> Fushion is quite a bit better.</li>
            <li> The love of my life has always used this brand of shaver and when this newer model came out we bought it for an upgrade.  </li>
            <li> Came fast from the supplier and my husband&#x27;s happy with the fusion power blades.  </li>
            <li> The great shaves I got from the Fusion really sold me on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> ok product doesnt give me that close of a shave</li>
            <li> I recieved the razor with blade free from gilette and will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I love these razors.  </li>
            <li> Although Gillette has created fancier razor since this introduction, I&#x27;m sticking with what I&#x27;m confident in using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found that by subscribing for tri-annual shipment, I can save more money and since I don&#x27;t shave every day, I have a stockpile of replacement cartridges.</li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion razors are pretty good.</li>
            <li> From my first shave I have been delighted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying my best to only use 2 a month, shaving every other day and none on the weekends, but that&#x27;s about the best I can do.</li>
            <li> I was a recent upgrade to Mach 3 and liked it a great deal.</li>
            <li> this is the first time in my 60 years + life they actually have a great blade and a great shave.</li>
            <li> The special coating on the razor&#x27;s \\&quot;face\\&quot; (the blue strip) mixes the best (for me) when I use \\&quot;Head Slick\\&quot; by Headblade.</li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion, or comparable manual razors, cost roughly 2.5 times what it cost me to operate the best Braun electric razor.</li>
            <li> All Gillette razors give you a shave, but if you are going to shave every day, this is the most comfortable and nicest feeling one.</li>
            <li> Heads are easy to snap off and on.  </li>
            <li> Work fine.</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT WORKED FINE</li>
            <li> A fine replacement blade pack that works</li>
            <li> These are Gillette brand and work fine with my Fusion Power.</li>
            <li> The blades work as expected, which is very good.</li>
            <li> Smooth as silk; doesn&#x27;t miss any part of your face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard mixed reviews on the vibrating aspect of razors, personally, it is great for the Fusion.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s task: make your skin smooth, without any sign of beard.</li>
            <li> This 8-count package should last me for a couple years of happy shaving.</li>
            <li> Within about 4 days, I had a coupon in my mailbox for a free replacement 8 pack.</li>
            <li> Thank you for offereing this \\&quot;great deal\\&quot; on a product used daily in our home.</li>
            <li> Plus they have to make up the money somewhere, they basically give the razor away for free.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, this all leaves me wondering if I shouldn&#x27;t just get my own straight razor and avoid this monthly razor tax.</li>
            <li> I recieved these with a Gillette power razor for free to test and review.</li>
            <li> I received these Gillette Fusion Power Razor Blades to try free from Gillette.</li>
            <li> i really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s close, comfortable, and luxurious.</li>
            <li> A move comfortable, smoother shave for me.</li>
            <li> Now, I get the smooth shaves</li>
            <li> For years, I&#x27;ve been using cheap, reusable razors, including the Target brand triple blade models.</li>
            <li> The vibration works wonders on the stubble and makes it easy to clean when finished.</li>
            <li> Gives a smooth shave day after day.  </li>
            <li> shave did not seem as close and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I received these free from Gillette to try.  </li>
            <li> Great price compared to the local drugstore.</li>
            <li> Expensive but good and probably the best price for the blades.</li>
            <li> make sure you use the right shaving \\&quot;cream\\&quot; ... not just any will do, mind you.  </li>
            <li> Hey guys,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought a Fusion power when it came out and used it for a week</li>
            <li> Original blade lasted almost thrice the time than these.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll update this review when I change my first cartridge. :)</li>
            <li> This razor gives a good shave, but, it is really not that much better than the M3 or even the the Sensor.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find these cartridges at my local grocery, for some reason, so it&#x27;s nice being able to just order some.</li>
            <li> They very cleverly use terms like \\&quot;a better way to shave\\&quot; or \\&quot;30% closer blades\\&quot;, and there is a reason for this.</li>
            <li> However, Gillette with these newer hyped blade systems is able to charge a lot more for the replacement blades and reap higher profit margins than the older blade systems.</li>
            <li> They give a better shave than their Mach III predecessor, but the cost of blades has risen quite a bit over time making me question if it is even worth the price of the higher end blades.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re mostly usable, but not as comfortable as normal.  </li>
            <li> It does such a good job when I shave and</li>
            <li> SOME WHAT ENJOYABLE, THE POWER RAZOR REALLY DOES WORK WELL &amp; GIVES YOU</li>
            <li> But no matter how you cut it (no pun intended) they are expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks offering them at a more reasonable prise than brick &amp; mortar stores.</li>
            <li> Used all eight in two day&#x27;s trying to find a good one, cut my face each time I tried a different cartridge.</li>
            <li> I really find it much better than the M3.</li>
            <li> After years of trial and error, I&#x27;ve finally settled on a good shaving cream system:</li>
            <li> When I purchased these they were such a good deal compared to the retail pricing.</li>
            <li> For some reason though, these blades feel different, and not in a good way.</li>
            <li> The gentle vibration from the fusion power allow the blades to glide smoothly over skin without causing irritation!</li>
            <li> It is a very nice, well constructed product, but five blades are just not reasonable in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My guess is they regret having created a blade that isn&#x27;t as quickly disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so quick I don&#x27;t see how it could be avoided.</li>
            <li> The razor just glided over my skin, I never felt like I had to go back over areas, it was incredibly comfortable, and, most importantly,</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Gillette since they gave my unit free razors during the first Gulf War (I was in the Marines at the time).  </li>
            <li> Also, when I used it my skin became more irritated than it normally does with shaving.</li>
            <li> It seems every 2-3 years, a new shaving product comes out that is much better.  </li>
            <li> The good news with this razor is that the single blade on the reverse makes a neat job of sideburns and mustache area for men.  </li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Power Replacement Cartridges does cost a substantial amount of money, but it gives the person the realization that he is pretty clean shaven.</li>
            <li> open items immediately to make sure they are correct and read fine print on return dates....</li>
            <li> The Gillette Replacement Cartridges, although very high per unit, were sold at the most reasonable price I&#x27;ve seen on the internet.</li>
            <li> A REAL CLOSE COMFORTABLE</li>
            <li> These razors are fantastic but I never realized how much money I could be saving by switching to a comparable product.</li>
            <li> Give the suckers a free sample that&#x27;s great and make them pay for crummy blades after they&#x27;ve committed to the system.</li>
            <li> And Gillette knows this through their own internal research.</li>
            <li> but it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> But I can make them last a lot longer than the old 3-blade razors while still getting a great shave.  </li>
            <li> But I can make them last a lot longer than the old 3-blade razors while still getting a great shave.  </li>
            <li> SO WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> The cartridge for the gilette fusion power razors has a precision blade that allows a more detailed shave without using multiple razors.</li>
            <li> One of the blades isn&#x27;t placed right tho.  </li>
            <li> Pulsonic Shaver for $199.99 about a year ago, and periodically (right now for example) you can get $50.00 in gift certificates with the purchase of any Braun electric razor that is over $130.00.</li>
            <li> They snap right into the Fusion razor and can be replaced by just pushing the button on the cartridge.</li>
            <li> 3 blades seems to be just the right amount for getting in all areas on the face.  </li>
            <li> I was right.</li>
            <li> the significant price difference between the older 3-blade systems and newer ones like Fusion, folks really are better off saving their money and sticking with the older systems.</li>
            <li> If you let your beard get a little \\&quot;scruffy\\&quot;, the Gillette Fusion Power razor feels like Velcro catching across your face!</li>
            <li> Smooth, high quality blades.  </li>
            <li> I do not use shaving cream, as I find that I cut myself much more easily that way, and shave carefully to avoid razor burn.</li>
            <li> The blades are great and usually will provide a weeks service before replacement.</li>
            <li> At $19 minus an extra discount this was a very good price for this 8 cartridge set of fusion blades.</li>
            <li> Without that blade, which cuts very close safely, I would not be able to cut my mustache area due to the size of the head.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> The service was good and the price was less than retail.  </li>
            <li> That said, a good blade shaves smooth and if you&#x27;ve ever tried using a disposable (cos you forgot to pack your  shaver), you&#x27;ll come to appreciate that gillette&#x27;s blades can last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I use cordless shavers but they still leave some stubble so using this product dry, I complete the shave nice and smooth</li>
            <li> It takes one AAA-battery that seems to last a decent interval (the low-battery indicator is a nice touch).  </li>
            <li> Those who ridicule the increasing number of blades on razors are likely those who don&#x27;t need much more than a Bic one-blade razor because it&#x27;s what works for them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine any possible improvement that can ever be made to deliver a better shave.</li>
            <li> We then went to order through amazon and went back to that site to see MANY complaints.  </li>
            <li> If you read the description closely of the Gillette Fusion product as put out by Gillette, you will see that Gillette doesn&#x27;t actually claim that you get a closer or even better shave.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to accept it at first, but after using these refills for a while I am willing to accept the premium.  </li>
            <li> But be aware of this for yourself as you try these refills.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> The lotion strips on the M3 Power feel better and seem to last longer than on the Fusion razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are simply too many points of contact along your face with this razor.</li>
            <li> It turned out to be the same thing but with more blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After the first shave my hopes were destroyed.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much !</li>
            <li> This is the first blade that does not cut and nick my face and leave me with sores or ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> At first I struggled a bit getting the battery cap off of the end.  </li>
            <li> My first time using a powered stick razor.  </li>
            <li> The power is nothing more than a small vibrator motor, like a cell phone, but it provides a closer shave because you end up applying more pressure with slower strokes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on the first cartridge</li>
            <li> The first shave was like a blade that I should have discarded.  </li>
            <li> Try it yourself but the initial blade is much better than the replacement cartridges.</li>
            <li> Schick is in trouble now, their crappy 4 blade razor wasn&#x27;t even as good as the mach 3</li>
            <li> I was just kidding though I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Gillette released a new razor with that many blades.</li>
            <li> I am a previous mach3 user and made the switch to fusion power because&lt;br /&gt;it is a more comfortable shave</li>
            <li> While shaving my skin felt really smooth, but my hairs grew back just as quickly as they did with the Mach3 Turbo (no noticeable</li>
            <li> The Fusion&#x27;s extra single blade is a great innovation, something they should consider for their single-blade model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a nice razor with some pros and cons compared to Gillette&#x27;s other blades.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite the introduction of the Phantom version, which gives men a more palatable black over the original orange, the shave it gives is still an inferior one.</li>
            <li> It works very well, the skin is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> The main bit of shaving is smoother and seems faster, but probably not so much as worth an upgrade from a M3 Power.</li>
            <li> They looked like the real thing and the packaging was exact, but they were fakes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.t my sideburns and zapping those stray whiskers right under my nostrils.</li>
            <li> I feel there is a limit to how many blades are realistic, and this felt like it was too big for my face</li>
            <li> I just make sure that the blades are dry after each shave.</li>
            <li> This was a much better value then purchasing locally and the blades are as described in normal retail packaging.</li>
            <li> The blade is pretty big, but it glides smoothly.</li>
            <li> That said, I can trim better with the single blade than with 3 (or 5) blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> then it does with the Fusion (on the large surface area portions of my face mind you), the M3 Power just seems safer in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These blades are extra fine</li>
            <li> This is the best shave I have had from any razor, wet or dry, outside of a barber&#x27;s chair.</li>
            <li> Now when I have purchased this same product from places like cvs, walmart and target; they shave so smoothly and gently.</li>
            <li> Mach3s lasted much longer, but still sometimes cut.</li>
            <li> These are not the real ones you buy at the store.</li>
            <li> The real money is with the replacement blades.</li>
            <li> And the blade stock used on the replacement blades is inferior and much duller to get folks to replace them faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks a Lot</li>
            <li> It really gives the smoothest shave.</li>
            <li> Twice as much as M3 and 3 times as much as Sensor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - I decided I didn&#x27;t like it as much as my M3 Power and put it aside.</li>
            <li> THANKS ART WOLF</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t have the serial number as the real Gillette blades have.</li>
            <li> They last about 2-3 weeks and always give a smooth no-nick shave.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> This is the only razor that get my face totally smooth and doesn&#x27;t cut my face.</li>
            <li> The packs were unopned, but it really felt to my wife and I that maybe they were 2nds or irregulars.</li>
            <li> Just be gentle and you will avoid bleeding.</li>
            <li> But the real question here is whether the \\&quot;power\\&quot; part of this product differentiates it at all from the non-\\&quot;power\\&quot; version.  </li>
            <li> Really, what&#x27;s the difference?  </li>
            <li> I always think they cost too much</li>
            <li> When ready to use them, discovered mistake.</li>
            <li> Unless you have a straight razor this might be the closest shave you&#x27;ll get.</li>
            <li> Really like these blades.  </li>
            <li> Last year I received a free Fusion handle and blade in the mail from Gillette.</li>
            <li> so much I have two - one in my travel kit.  </li>
            <li> I get really close and neat</li>
            <li> My whiskers grow fast, thick, and need some seriously good razors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, when I take into account that 4-pack might last me a year, an 8-pack at a high price is fine by me.</li>
            <li> Yes they are expensive but dagnabit these things work good!.  </li>
            <li> but they work better than any other blade I have found.  </li>
            <li> It was previously posted that Gillette uses better blades of their  sale on a purchase of new Fusion razor with extra blades to get one hooked into buying more replacements and then sells a lesser quality blade on one&#x27;s future purchase of more replacements.</li>
            <li> Smooth, fast and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Ultimately, the result is worth the higher price.  </li>
            <li> Ultimately, the result is worth the higher price.  </li>
            <li> The single blade on the reverse is an interesting feature, but only somewhat useful.</li>
            <li> Blades are grossly over priced and only last 3 or 4 shaves at optimum sharpness.</li>
            <li> Design and look of the Fusion isn&#x27;t as slick or nice as the M3</li>
            <li> I have a pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I did like the ones I bought to try, but will not buy more until they come down in price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was really excited waiting for my brand new Fusion Power razor to arrive, I am allergic to shaving so this was a big issue for me.</li>
            <li> The model just before this new one worked very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to see gillette improve on it, but they probably can&#x27;t without making it less safe and in this litigious climate they probably prefer to err on the side of caution.</li>
            <li> I actually bought another fusion razor on a great sale with extra cartridges and noticed the shave was much smoother and closer than the previous blades.</li>
            <li> also restock fee, must pay own shipping/handling to return with only possibility of getting a partial refund..</li>
            <li> On time and a decent price.</li>
            <li> I immediately decided to switch from an older system that I had been using for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price was right, but the shave would have been better with a dull steak knife.......</li>
            <li> A good shave but blades don&#x27;t last long enough to make up for high price.</li>
            <li> I think I will do that for the fact that although I do really like these new blades, they are high in cost compared to the M3 I normally use.  </li>
            <li> The reason I know is that I have a cousin high up in one of these companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> my beard is not thick, and I do sport a goatee, which may also help with longevity of cartridges.</li>
            <li> Great price for a brand product that is quite expensive in the stores.</li>
            <li> The blades that go with the razor packages actually come from a different stock, which are made much sharper to give a better shave and last much longer.</li>
            <li> I normally cut myself when I shave with a razor, but with this guy, the cuts stopped.</li>
            <li> You decide: Normally one blade in 8 weeks.</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s a nice shave, but it&#x27;s not worth all the hype or additional financial burden</li>
            <li> wonder if the extra blades even do anything useful during my shave.  </li>
            <li> my Face\\&quot; shave cream, which does tend to extend the life of the cartridge, while also providing a better and closer shave, with far less irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you use this, try different shave creams, and be sure to thoroughly dry the cartridge between uses.</li>
            <li> Have you ever wondered why the original blade that came on the actual razor you purchased seemed to last much longer than any of the replacements.</li>
            <li> :  I use these blades a lot, they do not dull quickly so I get a long life span out of each of them (</li>
            <li> With the Gillette Fusion Power, I&#x27;ve finally found the right one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gillette has some of the nicest products on the market, and I expected the Fusion to blow me away, but unlike the jump that was made when the Mach3 came out, I was not as excited after my shave as I was for the hype</li>
            <li> instead of buying a new razor altogether.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to buy a new pack of blades every 4 weeks</li>
            <li> I had lost my Mach 3 Turbo, so I decided upgrading to new Gillette Fusion Power with 5 blades.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Shaving time IS reduced with this new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this new blade will put you back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , when I saw Gillette touting their new 5-blade system, I gave it a shot.  </li>
            <li> Every new razor they come out with</li>
            <li> Brand new, unopened.  </li>
            <li> The razors are not shaving smoothly, they are very very rough and tear up my face.</li>
            <li> Their ads lately have been targeted towards those reusing the product more than they&#x27;d like, and so there&#x27;s a whole marketing bend they&#x27;re on about checking your indicator strips to see if it&#x27;s time to replace.</li>
            <li> Harry&#x27;s is a better deal as far as everyday pricing goes.</li>
            <li> And I didn&#x27;t even have to send the old ones back - they went right in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Got a great deal on these.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t expect anything less for the usual price.</li>
            <li> Not such a hot deal.</li>
            <li> But hold on I purchased the replacement blades and WOW!  </li>
            <li> main problem that I was having was trying to catch the replacement cartridges at a reasonable price or on sale and Amazon.com became my sole source of purchasing there cartridges.</li>
            <li> I love the smooth shave that I receive from the blade and in over eight years, have only received two serious nicks, possibly from a defective cartridge.</li>
            <li> So the extra blade on the back of the Fusion was what really got me interested.</li>
            <li> I am one of those guys who have always had to deal with the \\&quot;five o&#x27;clock shadow that shows up around noon, so it is a tremendous advancement in shaving technology that I can get a close shave that won&#x27;t require a second shave in the middle of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess that these guys should really start working in something new because the \\&quot;adding more blades\\&quot; thing is getting exhausted.</li>
            <li> Most men might not change their blades as often as I did but the things got dull</li>
            <li> They went with a new interface for putting blades in that seems to take a step back, and having to buy the new razor to work with the new blades</li>
            <li> In a military environment that I live in, we constantly have to be clean shaven.</li>
            <li> Gentle on the skin especially for people with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Once again, I&#x27;ve been using mine for a long time and didn&#x27;t experience that first hand.  </li>
            <li> [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judging by the mixed reviews, some people may get real blades and some may not.  </li>
            <li> The head is massive but it glides really well.  </li>
            <li> Wow 5 blades instead of three?</li>
            <li> This is by far the closest shave yet.</li>
            <li> I was surprised.</li>
            <li> Wow, I thought.</li>
            <li> year or so later, my M3 Power stopped working, so I ran out to the store and picked up some normal Fusion replacement cartridges (not Fusion Power!)</li>
            <li> While it does shave close, for the first time ever my loves skin is ripped and cut up every single time.  </li>
            <li> I bought the exact same package from walgreens and the blades felt completely different.</li>
            <li> a steady hand can still produce the same result.</li>
            <li> purchased my first 4 pack locally and replaced the sample blade after it finally wore out.</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve changed cartridge/blades but only because the old blades look worn, but with the power on, it shaves as well as the new blade.</li>
            <li> Fusion power razor blades are great but very expensive.  </li>
            <li> I especially like the extra blade on the back to do sideburns and keep the back of my neck looking clean.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you order them ONLY directly through Amazon or be VERY careful ordering them through other sites.  </li>
            <li> this new blade will put you back.    </li>
            <li> And the fact that they always last 3 or 4 times as long as other blades makes them not nearly as expensive as you might think at first.</li>
            <li> While a little on the pricy side, they offer more comfort than any other blade around.</li>
            <li> last week I went to replace a cartridge, and found that ALL, literally all, were completely rusted !</li>
            <li> its a little pricey but worth the cash, if you have it to spend.&lt;br /&gt;thomas</li>
            <li> No longer am I buying Mach3 razors every month, I&#x27;m barely buying one pack a year.</li>
            <li> I switched to old school double edged razor blades</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s see...that a penny a shave for the blades plus a few cents worth of TOBS shave cream.</li>
            <li> I get a close shave that leaves my face feeling better than other products I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> It does give a close shave and when you first give it a go you have to be a little careful because five blades is really almost overkill.  </li>
            <li> When I purchased my first Gillette Fusion Power razor a few years ago, I thought it was kind of silly</li>
            <li> The old two-blade blades the Gillette makes got tossed out the second the Mach3&#x27;s came out, and the Mach3&#x27;s were equally tossed when the Fusion Power&#x27;s arrived.</li>
            <li> (only have to replace the blade set once a year now for $25.00) and no shave cream (have to buy a few cleaning and lubrication packs though for about $40.00 for a years worth)</li>
            <li> the blades are not sharp and not aligned properly.</li>
            <li> the extra blade on the back for little stuff is actually more useful than one may think, also the strip runs down when you should change your blade which if you are lazy is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all</li>
            <li> The Fusion does truly gives me the best shave ever, and I have a very thick beard, and I have to agree the blade on the back is useless.  </li>
            <li> The only obvious new feature is the trimmer, which is only that, a feature, and not a real technical advance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my take on razors in general: not all men are the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to start growing a beard year round and walking to work pretty soon with all of the astronomical increases in prices.  </li>
            <li> It is a little more expensive than other disposables but the close, comfortable shave makes up for the price.</li>
            <li> My old Mach3&#x27;s used to last a long time...</li>
            <li> The other day I realize it needed a new blade (admittedly I don&#x27;t shave every day).  </li>
            <li> now I spent $150.00 + $25.00 + $50.00 &#x3D; $225.00 for the first year and a half I&#x27;ve used this razor instead of $25.00 x 18 months</li>
            <li> I use them on my legs, armpits as I am a lady and they make you silky smooth for at least 2 days which I have not found with other shavers.</li>
            <li> If you can find these things for any less than the normal price just get them.</li>
            <li> The single razor on the back is necessary to shave some hard to reach places, and although it is an effect of the enormous shaving face, it is well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everyday pricing is way too high.</li>
            <li> I am not able to use them, they hurt so much.</li>
            <li> : these things last a LONG time.</li>
            <li> think this 8 cartridge pack will last me a LONG time.  </li>
            <li> They last for a long time.</li>
            <li> or I find them not lasting as long as this blade.  </li>
            <li> Blades last a long time.</li>
            <li> The razors work well and last me a long time.</li>
            <li> They even mentioned the blades being closer as an improvement, when in fact, I think they were forced to do it that way because if not they would have ended up with a huge cartridge that would not fit the contours of the face.  </li>
            <li> Also consider that you may get reasonably good counterfeits (though doubtful) which still isn&#x27;t giving you the actual product&#x27;s quality experience.  </li>
            <li> After one shave, it is immediately apparent, the five smaller blades beat the 3 or 2 blade models, hands down.</li>
            <li> The single blade on the back that is for sideburns and under the nose area does not seem to work at all.</li>
            <li> I WOULD NOT TYPICALLY TAKE TIME TO COMMENT ON SOMETHING AS MUNDANE AS A SHAVING PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I have pretty tough facial hair.  </li>
            <li> Will continue to buy as long as they are made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious why the plastic on these blades does not match any of the plastic on my razor or the colors from my other blades purchased at my local convenience store, but since these blades work I&#x27;m not (totally) complaining.  </li>
            <li> Also, the most expensive blades I&#x27;ve had to purchase but Amazon&#x27;s subscribe-and-save program is cheaper than Wal-Mart!</li>
            <li> For some reason they last only for few shaves.</li>
            <li> I have hated shaving my entire life and am delighted that one shaver has been invented that works so well.</li>
            <li> However I got this one a deal with a $6 off coupon, and with the amount of times I shave a week (3-4) I can get about 1 months use off of a single cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My beard grows every which way, leading to some discomfort with single or twin blade cartridges.</li>
            <li> Start with the single bladed side then use the 15 bladed* side.</li>
            <li> I received a single Fusion razor for Christmas and decided to try it out.</li>
            <li> You can use one blade for months with minimal degradation of the blade quality, as long as you use the vibrate function and cream.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t tell how dull it&#x27;s become compared to a new cartridge, but I still have no problems shaving (and it&#x27;s 4 months now).</li>
            <li> Store them in a dry pantry or somewhere else till use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> a black and white TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is hard to justify spending that much money on these blades when a lot less money and</li>
            <li> The blade stays sharp a long time.</li>
            <li> The five blades really nail my beard, and even tough spots like my chin and jaw line remain cut-free.  </li>
            <li> Arrived on time at expected price</li>
            <li> The product was received on time but the Gillete blades are not real.</li>
            <li> I even had problems with some blades always getting my hair jammed in between the blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I never have problems with my hair getting jammed</li>
            <li> The shave of the razor was rather rough.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have to be careful with this blade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll break out or rash up if my skin gets irritated, so I have to carefully prep for shaving.  </li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> So be careful...</li>
            <li> Trying to neaten the mustache with 3 blades is not really a viable option.</li>
            <li> You save about $8.00 for 8blades, and if your like me in the military saving 5 days out of the week this $8 adds up.  </li>
            <li> They may advertise the Fusion as having the closest shave you can get, but this was certainly not the case for me</li>
            <li> from previous history, i have purchased Gilette Fusion blade from amazon for a long time now.</li>
            <li> Until I tried Fusion catridges, I got decent shaves but not great.  </li>
            <li> The reality is that very little (if any) improvement in the actual shave itself has been made since the 3-blade systems.</li>
            <li> On the back side of the cartridge is a single blade for the bottom of sideburns and under the nose and other hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> Product is the same as we usually purchase at the store (but cheaper).</li>
            <li> Rotary blades were never able to do a close enough shave.</li>
            <li> You might think it a bit expensive but my first blade is still in the razor after about a month.</li>
            <li> address some of the issues brought up in the other reviews:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> an extremely close shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used fusion blades for quite awhile, but these definitely were not as smooth/sharp as usual.  </li>
            <li> but if you read the other reviews you&#x27;ll see that other men have done this as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I doubt the power aspect does anything other than add a gimic.  </li>
            <li> I usually shave every other day but this has given me the freedom to skip a 3rd day.</li>
            <li> Other than that....</li>
            <li> I still found a way to make these blades  work slightly better for me, but I was and am really disappointed.</li>
            <li> These five blades are too close to each other creating a very rough experience like ripping out my hairs and shaving my skin.</li>
            <li> M3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little bit expensive, but it worth it.</li>
            <li> One thing though, you have to be very careful.  </li>
            <li> I completely disagree about the blade on the back being useless.  </li>
            <li> The replacement blades, which cost big money, definitely last very little time before they become dull.</li>
            <li> unable to return as of April due to 2 months of having them, unopened, but ready for use when needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m cursed with sensitive skin and a tough beard.  </li>
            <li> I found it hard to get around facial areas like I could with the Mach3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> NO WORTH THE $$$$$....</li>
            <li> My only complaint about Gillette is the price for their replacement cartridges</li>
            <li> hands down...</li>
            <li> I cut down my expense to $36.00 a year by using &amp;#34;dollarshaveclub&amp;#34; service.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Closeness:  These blades are very sharp and take off hair with one stroke&lt;</li>
            <li> They are very sharp.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to get the angle correct, and it barely gets anything off.  </li>
            <li> Some have thick fast-growing hair, some thin slow-growing, some medium thickness fast growing, etc.</li>
            <li> But these blades cut through them like butter and with less irritation than the Mach 3</li>
            <li> I also seem to bleed alot less when I use these blades.  </li>
            <li> You just have to pass the blade less times on your skin than with</li>
            <li> I bought this 8 pack on Amazon, and these cost me less than $.40 per shave.</li>
            <li> The M3 Power got in tight spots just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> AS A WELL DESERVED LITTLE LUXURY.</li>
            <li> THE COST HAD BECOME A LITTLE TOO &amp;#34;PRICEY&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> However, the weak link up until now has been the actual shaver.  </li>
            <li> I shave every other day and usually get 2-3 weeks out of each blade.</li>
            <li> The single blade on the back is useless.  </li>
            <li> and the vibrating action was a mere gimmick.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.  </li>
            <li> All I&#x27;m saying is, it&#x27;s a gamble to save a few dollars.  </li>
            <li> Tried few times, but kept regretting.</li>
            <li> I have been using Gillette&#x27;s Fusion Razor for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I do not have a Power Fusion so WASTE of my MONEY because of 60 day rule to return even unopened items.</li>
            <li> The replacements are garbage, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I dreaded looking in a bathroom mirror at work and seeing dried blood spots (not to mention getting blood stains on my collar).  </li>
            <li> Partly because I don&#x27;t shave everyday (</li>
            <li> and I do have a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long for the blades to start cutting my face and neck, especially since I take forever to change blades.  </li>
            <li> These blades are expensive, but if I didn&#x27;t have to change them as often, it would actually cost less than I was paying for the Sensor refills.</li>
            <li> Gillette doesn&#x27;t want folks to get a bad first impression.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price!!</li>
            <li> After reading some of Hotdealz responses to negative reviews, I saw they get a little touchy when someone cries \\&quot;counterfeit\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Of all the blades I have tried in the past, these blades give me the closest shave with almost no nicks or cuts.  </li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s a bit expensive, it&#x27;s the only razor that I think that</li>
            <li> usually 2</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is that the price is too expensive.</li>
            <li> The cartridges are expensive but they last me for months.</li>
            <li> Lots of hype, but Gillette has gone backwards in the past fifty years in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> and I found it to be an overall fairly uncomfortable shaving experience, without getting noticeably closer than the M3 Power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only con is how damn expensive the blades are.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this is the only improvement over the Mach3.  </li>
            <li> I usually go through one a week, shaving my head twice a week and face every day.</li>
            <li> The only thing wrong</li>
            <li> I have used Gillette razors in the past and have always like the way they perform.  </li>
            <li> I used to get lots of nicks and burns with other razors because of my tough beard.</li>
            <li> the way, my power handle came broken, so I couldn&#x27;t test this feature, although I have had power handles in the past with other blades and the difference was minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I would have a very heavy beard).  </li>
            <li> only complaint would be how darn expensive these things are.  </li>
            <li> they seemed really dull BEFORE I used them.</li>
            <li> Electric shavers don&#x27;t work for me either - too hard on my skin, and I&#x27;d have a five-o&#x27;clock shadow around 2PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could hardly feel the silky way it removes hair.</li>
            <li> So you need to think hard before this upgrade.  </li>
            <li> After about a week the replacement blade was dull.</li>
            <li> I ordered these replacement cartridges and the blades were dull.  </li>
            <li> I used there blades and after about two or three times it gets dull.</li>
            <li> I got thick and hard hairs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Gillette must really think we&#x27;re stupid.</li>
            <li> these blades sucks.  </li>
            <li> If you do not own any of Gillet&#x27;s miraculous contributions to mankind,</li>
            <li> The postage sucks.  </li>
            <li> I was always cutting myself atleast once a week, especially on my chin.  </li>
            <li> I was astounded at how well it shaved...and got at least EIGHT shaves out of it.</li>
            <li> : Any suckers our there still letting Gillette rip them off?</li>
            <li> I usually get two months of shaves out of one blade!</li>
            <li> I was initially skeptical about the powered aspect due to my issues with electric shavers.  </li>
            <li> and I could seriously cut myself if I wasn&#x27;t careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seriously, I&#x27;ve had car payments lower than the cost of an 8-pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe I got the bad ones or something, but do not buy this pack expecting it to work the same way as the one that came with the razor.....</li>
            <li> You can use it over and over and never get tired of it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Total rip-off.  </li>
            <li> We had a bad experience with ordering them from someone else other than amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> The only thing i hate about these is that YES they are expensive.  </li>
            <li> This shaver, while refills can be expensive, provided a closeness in the shave I have never experienced before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s sad that this happened.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These EXPENSIVE blades work as advertised.  </li>
            <li> They are fake.</li>
            <li> In any case, if you get fake ones you have to pay the postage to return them to get your refund so you will lose time and money if you come up with the counterfeits.  </li>
            <li> I was unable to send them to Proctor and Gamble for their security team to research.  </li>
            <li> Yea I know the blades are a bit expensive but this razor shaves so close</li>
            <li> the blades are only copies i had a terrible time trying to shave with them</li>
            <li> They are definitely expensive</li>
            <li> TOO EXPENSIVE.....</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong with the Fusion Razor.</li>
            <li> I had a weird feeling that the statement was correct.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor forever and blades are a necessary evil.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous!!</li>
            <li> I have tried all the products Gillette produces and unfortunately they all are bad quality so expensive blades.</li>
            <li> It certainly is not worth the outrageous price Gillette is charging for refill blades.  </li>
            <li> Been using gillette forever now but stars knocked down for the insane price</li>
            <li> I would get 3-4 uses out of those nicer disposables before they stopped cutting the whiskers and started cutting my skin.</li>
            <li> Too bad Gillette has stopped mainstream marketing.</li>
            <li> you pay a lot of money to get a bad quality blades.</li>
            <li> Compared to the blade that came with the razor, these blades are really bad.</li>
            <li> $29.00 LOST. :(  </li>
            <li> but I have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> (what I had been paying every 4 weeks for blades) + $100.00 (18 months of shave cream) + $15 for stupid razor handle-thing&#x3D; $565.00&lt;br</li>
            <li> Never ever buying there crap again.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil Skin Cleanser for a base, then Kiss My Face Moisture Shave as a supplement.  </li>
            <li> $3.50 every time you change blades is just insane.  </li>
            <li> They were terrible!!!</li>

            <li> Meets expectations for a reduced price.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my husband. Product is the same as we usually purchase at the store (but cheaper). Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is really great stuff. You can use it over and over and never get tired of it. Thank you</li>
            <li> these blades sucks.  Never ever buying there crap again.</li>
            <li> I subscribe to these on Amazon.com, and locked in the price - The best razors... hands down... Cannot find them anywhere else cheaper either - except sometimes Costco has a good deal</li>
            <li> I love the Gillette Fusion razor blades.  They give a better shave than their Mach III predecessor, but the cost of blades has risen quite a bit over time making me question if it is even worth the price of the higher end blades.</li>
            <li> I used to get lots of nicks and burns with other razors because of my tough beard. Rotary blades were never able to do a close enough shave. Power Fusion gives me a very smooth shave each and every time I use it. It lasts over 20 shaves without any issue. I just make sure that the blades are dry after each shave. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I ordered this on 09/23/2009 and it is now almost the end of october... I have been had.&lt;br /&gt;I love how they take your money and never give you what you pay for.  If this is fair then I dont know what fair is.  DONT ORDER FROM THESE PEOPLE EVER!!!  THIS IS THE ONLY TIME I HAVE EVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH AMAZON.COM.  They do a great job and it&#x27;s sad that this happened.&lt;br /&gt;I am not doing business with AMAZON again.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my take on razors in general: not all men are the same. Some have thick fast-growing hair, some thin slow-growing, some medium thickness fast growing, etc. Everyone&#x27;s different. Those who ridicule the increasing number of blades on razors are likely those who don&#x27;t need much more than a Bic one-blade razor because it&#x27;s what works for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, these Fusion Power&#x27;s are the best for me. My whiskers grow fast, thick, and need some seriously good razors. The old two-blade blades the Gillette makes got tossed out the second the Mach3&#x27;s came out, and the Mach3&#x27;s were equally tossed when the Fusion Power&#x27;s arrived. The reason - the 2 blades hurt, I cut myself lots, and wore out in one or two uses. Mach3s lasted much longer, but still sometimes cut. These Power Fusions However, I must emphasize: *have yet to cut me*. I think the vibrate function is to thank for this, but I&#x27;ve yet to cut myself when the battery runs out either, so it may just be the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what Gillette does not want you to know though: these things last a LONG time. You can use one blade for months with minimal degradation of the blade quality, as long as you use the vibrate function and cream. How do I know they don&#x27;t want you to know this? Their ads lately have been targeted towards those reusing the product more than they&#x27;d like, and so there&#x27;s a whole marketing bend they&#x27;re on about checking your indicator strips to see if it&#x27;s time to replace. My guess is they regret having created a blade that isn&#x27;t as quickly disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, when I take into account that 4-pack might last me a year, an 8-pack at a high price is fine by me. No longer am I buying Mach3 razors every month, I&#x27;m barely buying one pack a year.</li>
            <li> These are not the real ones you buy at the store. I bought the exact same package from walgreens and the blades felt completely different.</li>
            <li> My husband says that \\&quot;Everyone who uses the Gillette Fusion knows this is the ultimate shaving product.  Smooth as silk; doesn&#x27;t miss any part of your face.  I can&#x27;t imagine any possible improvement that can ever be made to deliver a better shave.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time at expected price</li>
            <li> Of all the blades I have tried in the past, these blades give me the closest shave with almost no nicks or cuts.  I have been using them for about 2 years.  While a little on the pricy side, they offer more comfort than any other blade around.</li>
            <li> This was a much better value then purchasing locally and the blades are as described in normal retail packaging. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Excellent directly through amazon.com!  No different than at the stores, except for the price.  Make sure you order them ONLY directly through Amazon or be VERY careful ordering them through other sites.  We had a bad experience with ordering them from someone else other than amazon.com.  We ordered them somewhere else because of price.  They had good reviews when we ordered, but they ended up being counterfeit.  They broke and literally pulled the hair out of your skin instead of shaving it off.  We then went to order through amazon and went back to that site to see MANY complaints.  They looked like the real thing and the packaging was exact, but they were fakes.</li>
            <li> Best Razor I&#x27;ve used yet.  I progressed from the Mach 3 to the Schick Quatro and was happy with teh move.  With this move from the Quatro to the Fusion, the difference was astronomical.  I&#x27;ve heard mixed reviews on the vibrating aspect of razors, personally, it is great for the Fusion.</li>
            <li> If you read the description closely of the Gillette Fusion product as put out by Gillette, you will see that Gillette doesn&#x27;t actually claim that you get a closer or even better shave. They very cleverly use terms like \\&quot;a better way to shave\\&quot; or \\&quot;30% closer blades\\&quot;, and there is a reason for this. The reality is that very little (if any) improvement in the actual shave itself has been made since the 3-blade systems. And Gillette knows this through their own internal research. Their studies show that customers can&#x27;t discern the difference between 3-blade and Fusion systems. It is all just perception. However, Gillette with these newer hyped blade systems is able to charge a lot more for the replacement blades and reap higher profit margins than the older blade systems. The reason I know is that I have a cousin high up in one of these companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is another interesting tidbit you probably didn&#x27;t know about all of this. Have you ever wondered why the original blade that came on the actual razor you purchased seemed to last much longer than any of the replacements. Well there is a reason for this too. The blades that go with the razor packages actually come from a different stock, which are made much sharper to give a better shave and last much longer. Gillette doesn&#x27;t want folks to get a bad first impression. As you probably know, they don&#x27;t make money on the razors. The real money is with the replacement blades. And the blade stock used on the replacement blades is inferior and much duller to get folks to replace them faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the significant price difference between the older 3-blade systems and newer ones like Fusion, folks really are better off saving their money and sticking with the older systems.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000BUUVTY Gillette Fusion Power Replacement Cartridges, 8-Count Package]] may not be the greatest value out there, but if you have a [[ASIN:B000MLNVU8 Gillette Fusion Power Razor, Phantom, 1 razor]] these refills are what you need.  While I can understand that some accuse Gillette of a gimmick, I can say that these razor blades definitely do seem to shave closer than the Mach 3 version.  So if it&#x27;s a gimmick, then I too have been fooled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as it pertains to value there&#x27;s no doubt that these come at a premium price.  I was hesitant to accept it at first, but after using these refills for a while I am willing to accept the premium.  Perhaps its because of the extra blades, but these refills seem to last longer than my Mach 3 ones did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also heard it said that Gillette manufactures refills to a lower qualtiy than the initial blades.  Once again, I&#x27;ve been using mine for a long time and didn&#x27;t experience that first hand.  But be aware of this for yourself as you try these refills.  That way you&#x27;ll be able to report if I have been fooled about that too.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this 8 cartridge pack will last me a LONG time.  One word of advice, don&#x27;t store them in your bathroom where the steam will degrade the blades before use.  Store them in a dry pantry or somewhere else till use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I normally cut myself when I shave with a razor, but with this guy, the cuts stopped. My face would be bleeding after each shave before this guy.</li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion razors are pretty good. For some reason they last only for few shaves. My old Mach3&#x27;s used to last a long time...</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s a bit expensive, it&#x27;s the only razor that I think that&lt;br /&gt;accomplishes it&#x27;s task: make your skin smooth, without any sign of beard.</li>
            <li> Actually, I don&#x27;t know.  This was purchased as a gift and I wasn&#x27;t told that they didn&#x27;t like it so that&#x27;s why I put ok</li>
            <li> Overview:  I have been using these blades with my Fusion Razor and they do a great job of giving me a close shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closeness:  These blades are very sharp and take off hair with one stroke&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ease of use:  All you have to do is snap the handle bit of the razor to the blades and your good to go&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reliability:  I use these blades a lot, they do not dull quickly so I get a long life span out of each of them (usually 2 weeks)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: the extra blade on the back for little stuff is actually more useful than one may think, also the strip runs down when you should change your blade which if you are lazy is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all in all:  I would recommend this to somebody looking for a razor that gives a close shave without giving up comfort</li>
            <li> I love this razor.  It does such a good job when I shave and the tip with the blade helps when I want to trim my mustache or beard.  I would strongly recommend this to any guy who needs a great shave.</li>
            <li> This was a good product with a Great price. Shipping was super fast. I will order again from this seller. Thanks a Lot</li>
            <li> The blades work as expected, which is very good. The only problem I have is that the price is too expensive. I am only saving it might be $1.00-$1.50 on going to the local store and getting them there.</li>
            <li> Expensive but good and probably the best price for the blades. I switched to old school double edged razor blades $0.05/blade vs $3.00 per blade!</li>
            <li> this is the first time in my 60 years + life they actually have a great blade and a great shave. its a little pricey but worth the cash, if you have it to spend.&lt;br /&gt;thomas</li>
            <li> I am a previous mach3 user and made the switch to fusion power because&lt;br /&gt;it is a more comfortable shave and I can make blades last for 15 days&lt;br /&gt;or so.</li>
            <li> The service was good and the price was less than retail.  Liked the free shipping.</li>
            <li> Blades are grossly over priced and only last 3 or 4 shaves at optimum sharpness.</li>
            <li> When I purchased my first Gillette Fusion Power razor a few years ago, I thought it was kind of silly and the vibrating action was a mere gimmick. From my first shave I have been delighted. It really gives the smoothest shave. On the back side of the cartridge is a single blade for the bottom of sideburns and under the nose and other hard to reach places. The cartridges are expensive but they last me for months. This 8-count package should last me for a couple years of happy shaving. I wouldn&#x27;t go anywhere without it and I keep an extra one in my gym bag.</li>
            <li> Such a close effortless shave. You would swear there are no blades except there is no beard left after you slide it across your face. You might think it a bit expensive but my first blade is still in the razor after about a month.</li>
            <li> These blades are extra fine I have some. But I have no record of ordering this package of blades. If I did then they are excelent.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving for 40+ years, trying all types of products from disposable to electric razors. I have recently started shaving my head and am happy to say the Fusion Power provides the best overall shave I have ever experienced. It is a little more expensive than other disposables but the close, comfortable shave makes up for the price. Too bad Gillette has stopped mainstream marketing.</li>
            <li> Bought the Power version because they were cheaper than the regular fusion blades for some reason.  Work fine.</li>
            <li> Smooth, high quality blades.  Supposed to last about a month...I hope.</li>
            <li> I have owned every incarnation of the Gillette razor, and I can easily say that this is the best.  Look, the Mach 3 is a superior razor, and if you are happy with it, don&#x27;t worry about immediately running to the store for a Fusion.  However, the next time you are about to invest in blades, I definitely recommend you consider making the switch.  You will be happy.  If you do not own any of Gillet&#x27;s miraculous contributions to mankind, good lord, it&#x27;s like you have been watching a black and white TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To address some of the issues brought up in the other reviews:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The single razor on the back is necessary to shave some hard to reach places, and although it is an effect of the enormous shaving face, it is well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. King of Shaves shaving oil is amazing no matter what razor you use.</li>
            <li> This razor gives a good shave, but, it is really not that much better than the M3 or even the the Sensor.  It certainly is not worth the outrageous price Gillette is charging for refill blades.  Twice as much as M3 and 3 times as much as Sensor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$ 28.00 for 8 blades?  Ridiculous!!</li>
            <li> $3.50 every time you change blades is just insane.  May I recommend Gillette&#x27;s &#x27;Good News Pivot Plus with Lubrastrip&#x27; 12 pack for 50 cents each.  And there&#x27;s a guy selling Platinum double-edge blades on ebay for fifteen cents.  A lot of people think these things are better than the Fusion /or/ the Pivot.  Lots of hype, but Gillette has gone backwards in the past fifty years in my opinion.  I will say one thing: the Pivot Plus is a marvel of plastics technology and quality control.  It gives a pretty good shave, but not as good as the double-edges I used as a kid.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp.  Watch out because now there are six blades to cut yourself with.  One of the blades isn&#x27;t placed right tho.  hmmm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do make a face feel better after the shave tho.</li>
            <li> This product looked good for the price. Too good infact, think it was a knockoff. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Hey guys,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought a Fusion power when it came out and used it for a week - I decided I didn&#x27;t like it as much as my M3 Power and put it aside. The blades felt like they were scraping too closely against my skin and I found it to be an overall fairly uncomfortable shaving experience, without getting noticeably closer than the M3 Power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year or so later, my M3 Power stopped working, so I ran out to the store and picked up some normal Fusion replacement cartridges (not Fusion Power!) instead of buying a new razor altogether. The experience was completely different from what I remembered! The razor just glided over my skin, I never felt like I had to go back over areas, it was incredibly comfortable, and, most importantly, an extremely close shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprised, I wondered what it could be, and realized that it might be the blades making the difference. I picked up some Fusion Power replacements and tried them side by side and it confirmed for me - the Fusion Power blades are markedly worse than the regular Fusion blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t believe me? Give it a shot yourself, I think you&#x27;ll find that the best combo is to buy a Fusion Power razor and regular Fusion blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> I use this product and I,am very pleased with it. I shave about every two days and my Fusion blades still last from 45 to 60 days. Great Product.  THANKS ART WOLF</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used fusion blades for quite awhile, but these definitely were not as smooth/sharp as usual.  They&#x27;re mostly usable, but not as comfortable as normal.  (I threw one away immediately.)  I emailed the seller inquiring, but they did not reply.</li>
            <li> These EXPENSIVE blades work as advertised.  This is the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from a razor.  I have pretty tough facial hair.  But these blades cut through them like butter and with less irritation than the Mach 3 I used before.  I worried that so close a shave would encourage razor bumps and ingrown hairs.  But that was not a problem with these blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint would be how darn expensive these things are.  In spite of that, I would still recommend them.</li>
            <li> The replacement blades, which cost big money, definitely last very little time before they become dull. I thought I was the only one who noticed this and switched to a Braun electric razor but if you read the other reviews you&#x27;ll see that other men have done this as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the Braun Series 7- 790cc (9595) Pulsonic Shaver for $199.99 about a year ago, and periodically (right now for example) you can get $50.00 in gift certificates with the purchase of any Braun electric razor that is over $130.00. So I got an amazing razor, the best they make for $150.00 since I&#x27;m def going to be using the gift certificates for stuff I need. I no longer have to buy a new pack of blades every 4 weeks (only have to replace the blade set once a year now for $25.00) and no shave cream (have to buy a few cleaning and lubrication packs though for about $40.00 for a years worth) and I never get irritated skin anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now I spent $150.00 + $25.00 + $50.00 &#x3D; $225.00 for the first year and a half I&#x27;ve used this razor instead of $25.00 x 18 months (what I had been paying every 4 weeks for blades) + $100.00 (18 months of shave cream) + $15 for stupid razor handle-thing&#x3D; $565.00&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Gillette Fusion, or comparable manual razors, cost roughly 2.5 times what it cost me to operate the best Braun electric razor. Most men might not change their blades as often as I did but the things got dull so quick I don&#x27;t see how it could be avoided.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.  I doubt the power aspect does anything other than add a gimic.  The blades work great and leave my face very smooth (I would have a very heavy beard).  I especially like the extra blade on the back to do sideburns and keep the back of my neck looking clean.  The blades also seem to last for awhile - mine go two weeks or so before needing a change.</li>
            <li> The product was received on time but the Gillete blades are not real. They are fake. I am not able to use them, they hurt so much. the blades are not sharp and not aligned properly. they don&#x27;t have the serial number as the real Gillette blades have. I&#x27;ll never buy anything from this retailer.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the Gillette Fusion Power. Gives me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had, and I shave daily. Very smooth results, and no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually received some faulty blades from my recent order - they pulled and dragged on my face, and caused me to breakout. So after testing each blade in the pack, I called Gillette (1-800-GILLETTE, of course) and brought this to their attention. Within about 4 days, I had a coupon in my mailbox for a free replacement 8 pack. And I didn&#x27;t even have to send the old ones back - they went right in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So kudos on the product, and kudos on the customer service!!</li>
            <li> These are the best blades you can buy. I usually get two months of shaves out of one blade! Bought some here from Hotdealz and went through 8 blades in 5 weeks. After reading some of Hotdealz responses to negative reviews, I saw they get a little touchy when someone cries \\&quot;counterfeit\\&quot;. I&#x27;ll refrain from that here. You decide: Normally one blade in 8 weeks. Eight Hotdealz blades in 5 weeks. Hmmm. Not such a hot deal. Let the buyer beware. Stick with a reputable dealer, like Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was impressed this is the best i have used so by far.I usually shave every other day but this has given me the freedom to skip a 3rd day. wowsers!! .cool item</li>
            <li> The item was received in a timely manner and we are delighted with the product. No doubt we will reorder when the time arrises. Thank you for offereing this \\&quot;great deal\\&quot; on a product used daily in our home.</li>
            <li> These are the best razors for guys by far. They are the most expensive out there but it is well worth the price. They last for a long time. This 8 pack for my power fussion lasts for me about 6 months. The price on Amazon is great becasue these razors almost never go on sale and if you get the subscription delivery you can get even more of a discount.</li>
            <li> I WOULD NOT TYPICALLY TAKE TIME TO COMMENT ON SOMETHING AS MUNDANE AS A SHAVING PRODUCT BUT, I HAVE TO SAY IT MAKES A DAILY ACTIVITY SOME WHAT ENJOYABLE, THE POWER RAZOR REALLY DOES WORK WELL &amp; GIVES YOU A REAL CLOSE COMFORTABLE SHAVE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRICEY FOR A RAZOR BUT, I CONSIDER IT AS A WELL DESERVED LITTLE LUXURY.</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT WORKED FINE HOWEVER THE COST HAD BECOME A LITTLE TOO &amp;#34;PRICEY&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Cartridges are replaced without ever touching them.  They snap right into the Fusion razor and can be replaced by just pushing the button on the cartridge. They last about 2-3 weeks and always give a smooth no-nick shave.  Gillette has come up with the perfect razor and perfect blade replacement system.</li>
            <li> After trying to save money on blades by buying them off of Amazon and getting obvious counterfeits... going to war with the reseller... getting slapped around and retaliated against by the reseller, buyers should know you are running a likely risk buying razor blades from anywhere besides a retail store.  I contacted Proctor and Gamble about the counterfeits I received and here is their response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We appreciate your bringing this to our attention.  P&amp;G doesn&#x27;t distribute our products through Amazon.  If you have questions about the authenticity of the product you purchased, please contact Amazon.  In the meantime, I&#x27;m sharing your message with our Security Team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The safest, most reliable way to purchase our products is through retail stores.  [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judging by the mixed reviews, some people may get real blades and some may not.  In any case, if you get fake ones you have to pay the postage to return them to get your refund so you will lose time and money if you come up with the counterfeits.  Also consider that you may get reasonably good counterfeits (though doubtful) which still isn&#x27;t giving you the actual product&#x27;s quality experience.  Because I had to return the blades to the reseller I was unable to send them to Proctor and Gamble for their security team to research.  All I&#x27;m saying is, it&#x27;s a gamble to save a few dollars.  I will never buy blades again from an online seller.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> I am one of those guys who have always had to deal with the \\&quot;five o&#x27;clock shadow that shows up around noon, so it is a tremendous advancement in shaving technology that I can get a close shave that won&#x27;t require a second shave in the middle of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a tip here ... make sure you use the right shaving \\&quot;cream\\&quot; ... not just any will do, mind you.  The special coating on the razor&#x27;s \\&quot;face\\&quot; (the blue strip) mixes the best (for me) when I use \\&quot;Head Slick\\&quot; by Headblade. It is a mentholated cream.[[ASIN:B000ARQ90S HeadBlade Headslick Mentholated Shave Cream 8 fl oz (237 ml)]]</li>
            <li> Gillette did some great research before producing this product.  Smooth, fast and lasts a long time.  Will continue to buy as long as they are made.</li>
            <li> This is the best shave I have had from any razor, wet or dry, outside of a barber&#x27;s chair.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Power Replacement Cartridges does cost a substantial amount of money, but it gives the person the realization that he is pretty clean shaven. In a military environment that I live in, we constantly have to be clean shaven. It also means I have to spend a lot of money shaving my face to look good.</li>
            <li> I dont know what people are talking about when they complain about these blades.  Yes they are expensive but dagnabit these things work good!.  The only thing i hate about these is that YES they are expensive.  However I got this one a deal with a $6 off coupon, and with the amount of times I shave a week (3-4) I can get about 1 months use off of a single cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried all sorts of disposable razors and even some non-branded 5 bladed systems.  They all work however it comes at a cost, I bleed more with those blades or I find them not lasting as long as this blade.  I even had problems with some blades always getting my hair jammed in between the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette 5 bladed system works great on my face and I never have problems with my hair getting jammed (even when I dont shave for a couple of days).  I also seem to bleed alot less when I use these blades.  I dont know why, but my wife always teases me after I shave, she can tell which type of blade i used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using these blades on the ProGlide handle.</li>
            <li> Okay so they upped my blades from three to five, but I can still just stick with three.  I think I will do that for the fact that although I do really like these new blades, they are high in cost compared to the M3 I normally use.  I do like the way the blades are set neatly in the plactic molded container so you just retrieve them by sticking the handle in, hearing the click and then pulling it out.  The others I use have the plastic tabs you have to break off and then shake the blade out.  I think this part is a great improvement in the retrieval of the blade.  It does give a close shave and when you first give it a go you have to be a little careful because five blades is really almost overkill.  I did like the ones I bought to try, but will not buy more until they come down in price.  It is hard to justify spending that much money on these blades when a lot less money and a steady hand can still produce the same result.</li>
            <li> I used a Mach 3 for years and was satisfied. I was reluctant to try the  fusion, but a sample was included with my morning paper delivery a year ago, who would have thought to include it with the paper?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, after using the first razor and cartridge, the closeness of the shave was incredible! I used it for almost 3 months before having to bite the bullet and buy cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave from this razor is incredibly close, with no irritation. My beard grows every which way, leading to some discomfort with single or twin blade cartridges. This shaver, while refills can be expensive, provided a closeness in the shave I have never experienced before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have achieved a longer use per refill, partly I think, because I do not use a traditional shave cream. I use \\&quot;Kiss my Face\\&quot; shave cream, which does tend to extend the life of the cartridge, while also providing a better and closer shave, with far less irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use this, try different shave creams, and be sure to thoroughly dry the cartridge between uses. This will help to lengthen the life of the cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caveat... my beard is not thick, and I do sport a goatee, which may also help with longevity of cartridges. I currently use one cartridge every six weeks or so.</li>
            <li> Three months ago, I bought 48 Gillette Fusion Power refills (quite an investment), and placed them on my bathroom drawer, and to my surprise, last week I went to replace a cartridge, and found that ALL, literally all, were completely rusted !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a a shock, and all Mach 3 I had there for longer than that were just like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can P&amp;G can explain that??</li>
            <li> Great price for a brand product that is quite expensive in the stores. Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I had lost my Mach 3 Turbo, so I decided upgrading to new Gillette Fusion Power with 5 blades. I got thick and hard hairs. These five blades are too close to each other creating a very rough experience like ripping out my hairs and shaving my skin. Tried few times, but kept regretting. Finally, ended by buy Mach 3 Turbo.</li>
            <li> I am currently talking to the people over at Gillette over the concern that this product listed on Amazon may be counterfeit. The razors are not shaving smoothly, they are very very rough and tear up my face. Now when I have purchased this same product from places like cvs, walmart and target; they shave so smoothly and gently. Also the packaging looks off. I will not be buying again from Amazon if they are allowing counterfeit goods on their site.</li>
            <li> Yea I know the blades are a bit expensive but this razor shaves so close I couldn&#x27;t imagine anything else.  Plus they have to make up the money somewhere, they basically give the razor away for free.  This razor is well worth the investment, I loved my Mach 3 but this is just much better in my opinion. Schick is in trouble now, their crappy 4 blade razor wasn&#x27;t even as good as the mach 3 now what are they gonna do.  I recomend this to everyone espically for those who love the close shave!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll concur with others on the closest shave yet.  The head is massive but it glides really well.  I completely disagree about the blade on the back being useless.  Without that blade, which cuts very close safely, I would not be able to cut my mustache area due to the size of the head.  When compared to the Mach3 which you had to use for this area the closeness is not even in the same league.  That&#x27;s my problem area for closeness and so far the Fusion is the best I&#x27;ve used.  My only con is how damn expensive the blades are.  I&#x27;m trying my best to only use 2 a month, shaving every other day and none on the weekends, but that&#x27;s about the best I can do. That works out to about $6 a month just to shave.  I&#x27;m going to have to start growing a beard year round and walking to work pretty soon with all of the astronomical increases in prices.  What option do you have though?</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find these cartridges at my local grocery, for some reason, so it&#x27;s nice being able to just order some.</li>
            <li> These blades shave great, The closest I have gotten without nicks and cuts all over my face.  But no matter how you cut it (no pun intended) they are expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks offering them at a more reasonable prise than brick &amp; mortar stores.</li>
            <li> This is the only razor that get my face totally smooth and doesn&#x27;t cut my face.</li>
            <li> Excellent for people who break out after shaving.  Haven&#x27;t suffered razorburn since I started using.</li>
            <li> Well I am kinda puzzled about this item.The shave of the razor was rather rough.The packs were unopned, but it really felt to my wife and I that maybe they were 2nds or irregulars.Other than that....they did the job but were not the best set of blades I have purchased</li>
            <li> Best shave ever with the pro-glide system</li>
            <li> I have been using Gillette&#x27;s Fusion Razor for a few weeks now and it&#x27;s a nice razor with some pros and cons compared to Gillette&#x27;s other blades.  Gillette has some of the nicest products on the market, and I expected the Fusion to blow me away, but unlike the jump that was made when the Mach3 came out, I was not as excited after my shave as I was for the hype beforehand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The 5 blades are very smooth and glides across the face easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Shaving time IS reduced with this new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- With so many blades, I felt like I was shaving off layers of skin.  I feel there is a limit to how many blades are realistic, and this felt like it was too big for my face and I could seriously cut myself if I wasn&#x27;t careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Shave isn&#x27;t much better than the Mach3 Turbo.  While shaving my skin felt really smooth, but my hairs grew back just as quickly as they did with the Mach3 Turbo (no noticeable improvement).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This razor is SO big I found it hard to get around facial areas like I could with the Mach3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The lotion strips on the M3 Power feel better and seem to last longer than on the Fusion razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Design and look of the Fusion isn&#x27;t as slick or nice as the M3 Power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Blades are no longer interchangeable.  They went with a new interface for putting blades in that seems to take a step back, and having to buy the new razor to work with the new blades was a sneaky move in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The single blade on the back is useless.  It&#x27;s very hard to get the angle correct, and it barely gets anything off.  The M3 Power got in tight spots just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I plan to stick with my M3 Power.  3 blades seems to be just the right amount for getting in all areas on the face.  While it might take a shave or 2 more to get all the hairs off then it does with the Fusion (on the large surface area portions of my face mind you), the M3 Power just seems safer in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is more like 3 1/2 stars.  Yes it&#x27;s a nice shave, but it&#x27;s not worth all the hype or additional financial burden this new blade will put you back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** RECOMMENDEDworth all the hype or additional financial burden this new blade will put you back.    **** RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li> Once you try one of these you will never use a standard safety or double razor again.  The blades are great and usually will provide a weeks service before replacement.</li>
            <li> Excellent cartridges together with Amazon&#x27;s excellent cost make this an awesome product. If you happen to own a pair of scissors, there would be NO NEED to get the Frustration-Free packaging. Worked for me! I like to use these without shaving cream, just water only. Start with the single bladed side then use the 15 bladed* side. Just be gentle and you will avoid bleeding. *That was not a typo. I was just kidding though I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Gillette released a new razor with that many blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious why the plastic on these blades does not match any of the plastic on my razor or the colors from my other blades purchased at my local convenience store, but since these blades work I&#x27;m not (totally) complaining.  5 blades are definitely better than 1.  I think the price in general for this brand is out of control, but it&#x27;s probably the best that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This one is great. It works very well, the skin is smooth and soft. Just try use this. I recommanded for it. It&#x27;s perfect and convenient.</li>
            <li> At $19 minus an extra discount this was a very good price for this 8 cartridge set of fusion blades.</li>
            <li> Great razor blades.  I get a close shave that leaves my face feeling better than other products I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> The good news with this razor is that the single blade on the reverse makes a neat job of sideburns and mustache area for men.  Unfortunately, this is the only improvement over the Mach3.  It also delivers an inferior shave compared to its predecessors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the introduction of the Phantom version, which gives men a more palatable black over the original orange, the shave it gives is still an inferior one.</li>
            <li> My short, and to the point review: Keep your 3 blade Mach-3 razor unless you shave EVERY DAY. If you let your beard get a little \\&quot;scruffy\\&quot;, the Gillette Fusion Power razor feels like Velcro catching across your face! There are simply too many points of contact along your face with this razor. It is a very nice, well constructed product, but five blades are just not reasonable in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I bought a Gillette Fusion razor about a year ago.  The other day I realize it needed a new blade (admittedly I don&#x27;t shave every day).  I&#x27;m going to have to buy some more of these in 2016.</li>
            <li> This pack of cartridges must have been laying around in the back yard for sometime. Used all eight in two day&#x27;s trying to find a good one, cut my face each time I tried a different cartridge. I guess this is one item you don&#x27;t buy from an online retailer.</li>
            <li> Wow 5 blades instead of three? Who would have thought of that? I smell noble price here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the great cosmetic design fool you. It turned out to be the same thing but with more blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really excited waiting for my brand new Fusion Power razor to arrive, I am allergic to shaving so this was a big issue for me. After the first shave my hopes were destroyed. It turned out to be about the same thing. They even mentioned the blades being closer as an improvement, when in fact, I think they were forced to do it that way because if not they would have ended up with a huge cartridge that would not fit the contours of the face.  The only obvious new feature is the trimmer, which is only that, a feature, and not a real technical advance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that someday these companies start to invest a part of the income they get from the overpriced cartridges in research and development, instead of investing it in marketing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, my power handle came broken, so I couldn&#x27;t test this feature, although I have had power handles in the past with other blades and the difference was minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What will be next, let me guess, 7 blades? I guess that these guys should really start working in something new because the \\&quot;adding more blades\\&quot; thing is getting exhausted.</li>
            <li> A basic that is a must in my bathroom - however, they are pricy...</li>
            <li> Excellent shave and you can use over and over. The blade stays sharp a long time.</li>
            <li> Did you ever spend $20 on something wondering if it even does what it says on the box?  That&#x27;s how I feel about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if the extra blades even do anything useful during my shave.  But the real question here is whether the \\&quot;power\\&quot; part of this product differentiates it at all from the non-\\&quot;power\\&quot; version.  Really, what&#x27;s the difference?  I couldn&#x27;t tell any during my shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But...  Compared to the Schick multi-blade razors, the Fusion is incredibly better.  The wire that holds in the Schick blades makes for not as close a shave.  The Fusion&#x27;s extra single blade is a great innovation, something they should consider for their single-blade model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, this all leaves me wondering if I shouldn&#x27;t just get my own straight razor and avoid this monthly razor tax.</li>
            <li> I really find it much better than the M3. You just have to pass the blade less times on your skin than with M3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little bit expensive, but it worth it.</li>
            <li> The item itself is great.  The postage sucks.  It cost $50.00 for an order that cost $100.00.  The weight of the item could not have cost more than $15.00.  It was also send to me by Priority mail which I did not want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the future, I believe I will shop at regular stores, pay taxes and not be paying to put lots of extra money in someone&#x27;s pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I know is that a 1, 1 1/2 pound item does not cost $50.00 to mail!</li>
            <li> I always think they cost too much but they work better than any other blade I have found.  What else is there to say?</li>
            <li> Original blade lasted almost thrice the time than these. I guess power m3 is a better option atleast considering they have good replacement blades</li>
            <li> from previous history, i have purchased Gilette Fusion blade from amazon for a long time now. i order POWER by mistake. When ready to use them, discovered mistake. unable to return as of April due to 2 months of having them, unopened, but ready for use when needed. I do not have a Power Fusion so WASTE of my MONEY because of 60 day rule to return even unopened items. also restock fee, must pay own shipping/handling to return with only possibility of getting a partial refund..$29.00 LOST. :(  open items immediately to make sure they are correct and read fine print on return dates....</li>
            <li> These razors are fantastic but I never realized how much money I could be saving by switching to a comparable product. Gone are the days I payed an exorbitant amount of money for this pack. I cut down my expense to $36.00 a year by using &amp;#34;dollarshaveclub&amp;#34; service.</li>
            <li> If you still uses cartridges to shave yourself you must buy this pack its really really good. must have it.</li>
            <li> the blades are only copies i had a terrible time trying to shave with them</li>
            <li> Fusion power razor blades are great but very expensive.  I saved over $7 for the 8 pack through Amazon vs retail stores.</li>
            <li> Nice shave - like the price compared to the store price</li>
            <li> I received these blades Free from Gillette to try! I really liked the 5 blade technology as it gives you a nice clean shave. It gives my face a softness that I have never felt before. Thank you so much !</li>
            <li> Excellent blade but getting pricey.</li>
            <li> These blades are specifically designed for a close shave.  The blade life is admirable.  I go through about a blade per month.</li>
            <li> A rep-off!!! you pay a lot of money to get a bad quality blades. I have tried all the products Gillette produces and unfortunately they all are bad quality so expensive blades. Eventually, I went old school, safety razors are the best you&#x27;ll every get. try it and you&#x27;ll say GOD how didn&#x27;t know about these razors!</li>
            <li> A good shave but blades don&#x27;t last long enough to make up for high price.It shaves very smooth.I use it regularly.Would like to see them cheaper though.</li>
            <li> I first tried the fusion power razor, I thought it was great! But hold on I purchased the replacement blades and WOW!  They were terrible!!! they seemed really dull BEFORE I used them. I don&#x27;t know if Gillette is using the ole bait n switch or what, But my first blade lasted about 3 months and gave a great shave.  The replacements are garbage, don&#x27;t waste your money. Just my opinion.</li>
            <li> I am 71 years old and this is the best razor blade I have ever used. No nicks, no pulling and smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt!</li>
            <li> These razors are great.  They are the closest shave I have ever had.  They are definitely expensive but I believe you get what you pay for with these.  I usually go through one a week, shaving my head twice a week and face every day. I recieved these with a Gillette power razor for free to test and review.</li>
            <li> If you can find these things for any less than the normal price just get them. You&#x27;re going to need them anyways so just do it. Unless you have a straight razor this might be the closest shave you&#x27;ll get. Just remember to buy the holder....</li>
            <li> This is the first blade that does not cut and nick my face and leave me with sores or ingrown hairs. I don&#x27;t even have to be careful with this blade. And the fact that they always last 3 or 4 times as long as other blades makes them not nearly as expensive as you might think at first. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Would not use another product or another brand</li>
            <li> I received these Gillette Fusion Power Razor Blades to try free from Gillette. This is by far the closest shave yet. The blade is pretty big, but it glides smoothly. My only issue is the cost on these blades.</li>
            <li> TOO EXPENSIVE.....NO WORTH THE $$$$$....SCHICK HYDRO 5 IS A BETTER BANG FOR YOUR BUCK</li>
            <li> On time and a decent price.</li>
            <li> Best and smoothest shave I ever Had. The only thing wrong the better the shave the more expensive it gets. Thank goodness for Amazon. Nice blades!!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re razor blades and they work for the Gillete Fusion Power model. A fine replacement blade pack that works</li>
            <li> A VERY GOOD RAZOR AND THE PRICE IS RIGHT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT MORE CAN I SAY</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m cursed with sensitive skin and a tough beard.  I&#x27;ll break out or rash up if my skin gets irritated, so I have to carefully prep for shaving.  After years of trial and error, I&#x27;ve finally settled on a good shaving cream system: Cetaphil Skin Cleanser for a base, then Kiss My Face Moisture Shave as a supplement.  For post-shave comfort and to prevent breakouts, I use a product like Clean&amp;Clear Dual-Action Oil-Free moisturizing lotion.  However, the weak link up until now has been the actual shaver.  With the Gillette Fusion Power, I&#x27;ve finally found the right one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Gillette since they gave my unit free razors during the first Gulf War (I was in the Marines at the time).  They&#x27;ve gotten the job done, but a 3-blade system is ultimately inadequate for my beard and skin type.  It doesn&#x27;t take long for the blades to start cutting my face and neck, especially since I take forever to change blades.  I dreaded looking in a bathroom mirror at work and seeing dried blood spots (not to mention getting blood stains on my collar).  Electric shavers don&#x27;t work for me either - too hard on my skin, and I&#x27;d have a five-o&#x27;clock shadow around 2PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, when I saw Gillette touting their new 5-blade system, I gave it a shot.  I was initially skeptical about the powered aspect due to my issues with electric shavers.  But the Fusion Power is the happy exception.  At first I struggled a bit getting the battery cap off of the end.  But once I mastered that maneuver and got the battery in, I was set.  It takes one AAA-battery that seems to last a decent interval (the low-battery indicator is a nice touch).  And even if the Fusion Power runs out of juice, you can still shave with it.  The shaver glides over my face, and the vibration feels good - kind of like a pick-me-up in the morning.  The five blades really nail my beard, and even tough spots like my chin and jaw line remain cut-free.  I also like the one-blade trimmer on top - very handy for evening out my sideburns and zapping those stray whiskers right under my nostrils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is the expense of the blades.  But I can make them last a lot longer than the old 3-blade razors while still getting a great shave.  And most importantly, I rarely get those annoying cuts anymore (if I do, it&#x27;s more because of rushing or clumsiness than anything else).  Ultimately, the result is worth the higher price.  The Gillette Fusion Power is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Highly recommended.t my sideburns and zapping those stray whiskers right under my nostrils. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My only issue is the expense of the blades.

            <li> good product  easy to use</li>
            <li> Really like these blades.  Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> I have hated shaving my entire life and am delighted that one shaver has been invented that works so well. No pain, no blood, no effort. Blades last a long time.</li>
            <li> i really enjoy this product. i threw my m3power away as soon as i got this. 5 blades +1 is better than 3 &#x3D;P</li>
            <li> My first time using a powered stick razor.  I definitely get closer shaves when using the power in addition to the 5 blades.  The power is nothing more than a small vibrator motor, like a cell phone, but it provides a closer shave because you end up applying more pressure with slower strokes.  I used to get 2 or 3 days out of the Mach 3 before it was semi-dull.  I can get about a week of close shaves and an additional week of not-so-close shaves out of the Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the best razor I&#x27;ve ever had.  Also, the most expensive blades I&#x27;ve had to purchase but Amazon&#x27;s subscribe-and-save program is cheaper than Wal-Mart!</li>
            <li> This razor system does not give a close enough shave for me. The single blade on the back that is for sideburns and under the nose area does not seem to work at all. They may advertise the Fusion as having the closest shave you can get, but this was certainly not the case for me and I don&#x27;t think its the case for most people. Also, when I used it my skin became more irritated than it normally does with shaving. I now use the Norelco 8150XL electric shaver exclusively and it works like a charm every time.</li>
            <li> Like Homer Simpson, I too am a slave to the Gilette Corporation. Every new razor they come out with I try. It&#x27;s an addiction but I have never been disappointed. This razor gets a 4 of 5 from me because of the price of the blades. Seriously, I&#x27;ve had car payments lower than the cost of an 8-pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving with this razor is like shaving with a warm stick of butter, but with a closer shave. It&#x27;s close, comfortable, and luxurious. Treat yourself.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Replacement Cartridges, although very high per unit, were sold at the most reasonable price I&#x27;ve seen on the internet.</li>
            <li> After one shave, it is immediately apparent, the five smaller blades beat the 3 or 2 blade models, hands down. A move comfortable, smoother shave for me. I could hardly feel the silky way it removes hair. I had to check some of the strokes to see if anything was happening. I was a recent upgrade to Mach 3 and liked it a great deal. Fushion is quite a bit better. I was surprised. I like the reverse side feature of one blade for under the nose. All Gillette razors give you a shave, but if you are going to shave every day, this is the most comfortable and nicest feeling one.</li>
            <li> Until I tried Fusion catridges, I got decent shaves but not great.  I was always cutting myself atleast once a week, especially on my chin.  Now, I get the smooth shaves and I never cut myself.  I also think the shaves are closest to the skin that is possible for me.  Razors today are vastly superior to razors twenty years ago. I grew a beard for two years to avoid shaving.  It seems every 2-3 years, a new shaving product comes out that is much better.  I think Fusion is that product.  I like the power option as it seems my shaves are faster but maybe it is psychological. I like shaving now because of Fusion.</li>
            <li> Got a good price on these. Everyday pricing is way too high. Harry&#x27;s is a better deal as far as everyday pricing goes.</li>
            <li> When I purchased these they were such a good deal compared to the retail pricing. I use them on my legs, armpits as I am a lady and they make you silky smooth for at least 2 days which I have not found with other shavers.</li>
            <li> For years, I&#x27;ve been using cheap, reusable razors, including the Target brand triple blade models. I do not use shaving cream, as I find that I cut myself much more easily that way, and shave carefully to avoid razor burn. I would get 3-4 uses out of those nicer disposables before they stopped cutting the whiskers and started cutting my skin. I received a single Fusion razor for Christmas and decided to try it out. I was astounded at how well it shaved...and got at least EIGHT shaves out of it. When I did the math, the store brand razors were costing me $.30 per shave. I bought this 8 pack on Amazon, and these cost me less than $.40 per shave. SO WORTH IT. The vibration works wonders on the stubble and makes it easy to clean when finished. I&#x27;ll never go back to anything else.</li>
            <li> The razors work well and last me a long time. I shave every other day and usually get 2-3 weeks out of each blade.</li>
            <li> I use cordless shavers but they still leave some stubble so using this product dry, I complete the shave nice and smooth</li>
            <li> The Fusion does truly gives me the best shave ever, and I have a very thick beard, and I have to agree the blade on the back is useless.  One thing though, you have to be very careful.  One slip of the hand and BAM!  I&#x27;ve cut my lips 3 times now, twice bleeding profusely.  So be careful...</li>
            <li> The love of my life has always used this brand of shaver and when this newer model came out we bought it for an upgrade.  While it does shave close, for the first time ever my loves skin is ripped and cut up every single time.  So you need to think hard before this upgrade.  The model just before this new one worked very well.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price!! The M3&#x27;s do just as good and are a safe and reliable shave. Getting to be a rip off!!</li>
            <li> I keep a beard and mustache, so I just need a shaver to \\&quot;shape\\&quot; my facial hair. Trying to neaten the mustache with 3 blades is not really a viable option. So the extra blade on the back of the Fusion was what really got me interested. The main bit of shaving is smoother and seems faster, but probably not so much as worth an upgrade from a M3 Power. That said, a good blade shaves smooth and if you&#x27;ve ever tried using a disposable (cos you forgot to pack your  shaver), you&#x27;ll come to appreciate that gillette&#x27;s blades can last a very long time. The single blade on the reverse is an interesting feature, but only somewhat useful. I&#x27;d like to see gillette improve on it, but they probably can&#x27;t without making it less safe and in this litigious climate they probably prefer to err on the side of caution. That said, I can trim better with the single blade than with 3 (or 5) blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette probably hates customers like me. I use a cartridge for up to 6 months without replacement. Partly because I don&#x27;t shave everyday (when you have a beard, skip a day and it&#x27;s not really obvious). I&#x27;m still on the first cartridge so I can&#x27;t tell how dull it&#x27;s become compared to a new cartridge, but I still have no problems shaving (and it&#x27;s 4 months now). Maybe I&#x27;ll update this review when I change my first cartridge. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve changed cartridge/blades but only because the old blades look worn, but with the power on, it shaves as well as the new blade.</li>
            <li> Came fast from the supplier and my husband&#x27;s happy with the fusion power blades.  Great place to shop if you want to find a great deal on these.</li>
            <li> Yo llevo casi 2 a&amp;ntilde;os afeitandome con la Fusion Power y afirmo que es la mejor afeitadora del mundo. Yo uso cada cartucho 5 veces, y afeitan bien hasta el ultimo uso.</li>
            <li> I bought the Fusion Power because I am a huge Federer fan and he endorsed this product so I thought why the heck not!! I have a pretty sensitive skin and I thought that this product would work out great for me. I was right. I absolutely loved the product which is why I ordered this replacement cartridges pack from amazon. For some reason though, these blades feel different, and not in a good way. Compared to the blade that came with the razor, these blades are really bad. I still found a way to make these blades  work slightly better for me, but I was and am really disappointed. Maybe I got the bad ones or something, but do not buy this pack expecting it to work the same way as the one that came with the razor.....</li>
            <li> Last year I received a free Fusion handle and blade in the mail from Gillette. Tried it and got the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I immediately decided to switch from an older system that I had been using for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That sample Fusion blade lasted about 3 months (I kid you not) and I do have a heavy beard. Wow, I thought. These blades are expensive, but if I didn&#x27;t have to change them as often, it would actually cost less than I was paying for the Sensor refills. The great shaves I got from the Fusion really sold me on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased my first 4 pack locally and replaced the sample blade after it finally wore out. What the heck? After about a week the replacement blade was dull. I went through the 4 pack in about a month and bought a second pack at another retailer. Same thing. One week&#x3D;1 blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette must really think we&#x27;re stupid. Give the suckers a free sample that&#x27;s great and make them pay for crummy blades after they&#x27;ve committed to the system. Never again, Gillette.....I just ordered a Braun cordless from Amazon so you can just go pick someones else&#x27;s pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited: Any suckers our there still letting Gillette rip them off? Yeah, I guess so since they&#x27;re still in business. The Braun electric I mention above has recently been relegated to backup status to my Merkur double edge razor. Yep, one of those things like my dad used and that I learned to shave with. Blades cost about 7 cents each in bulk and last about a week. Let&#x27;s see...that a penny a shave for the blades plus a few cents worth of TOBS shave cream. Give it a try and tell Gillette what they can do with the Fusion.</li>
            <li> The razor is great.  Been using the Gillette Fusion Razor for about 4 to 5 years now - I don&#x27;t use anything else.  Gives a smooth shave day after day.  Gentle on the skin especially for people with sensitive skin.  Can be used multiple times before the head needs to be replaced.  An 8-pack should last a while.  Heads are easy to snap off and on.  I like the razor so much I have two - one in my travel kit.  You won&#x27;t go wrong with the Fusion Razor.</li>
            <li> Excellent sale and delivery.</li>
            <li> I like these razor blades but believe they are way overpriced. Buying them on line is the only way to save any money.</li>
            <li> Been using gillette forever now but stars knocked down for the insane price</li>
            <li> I ordered these replacement cartridges and the blades were dull.  The first shave was like a blade that I should have discarded.  I tried another one, same thing.  The price was right, but the shave would have been better with a dull steak knife.......</li>
            <li> I used there blades and after about two or three times it gets dull. To me I think these are a bootlegged blades.</li>
            <li> It was previously posted that Gillette uses better blades of their  sale on a purchase of new Fusion razor with extra blades to get one hooked into buying more replacements and then sells a lesser quality blade on one&#x27;s future purchase of more replacements. I had a weird feeling that the statement was correct. Later I  purchased a pack of 6 replacement blades and  noticed  a difference in shaving.&lt;br /&gt;The shave did not seem as close and smooth.  I actually bought another fusion razor on a great sale with extra cartridges and noticed the shave was much smoother and closer than the previous blades. Try it yourself but the initial blade is much better than the replacement cartridges.</li>
            <li> Very good quality blades.</li>
            <li> Got a great deal on these.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t expect anything less for the usual price.</li>
            <li> Item as described and shipped on time</li>
            <li> ok product doesnt give me that close of a shave but if you buy in bulk a good value on purchase</li>
            <li> Great blades and an amazing shave! The cartridge for the gilette fusion power razors has a precision blade that allows a more detailed shave without using multiple razors. The cartridge has a great life span, as I&#x27;ve used one cartridge for many shaves! I recieved the razor with blade free from gilette and will be purchasing again! The gentle vibration from the fusion power allow the blades to glide smoothly over skin without causing irritation!</li>
            <li> I received these free from Gillette to try.  I have used Gillette razors in the past and have always like the way they perform.  I would definitely recommend using these blades.</li>
            <li> These were knock offs and performed WORSE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total rip-off.  BOOO-HISSS</li>
            <li> I love these razors.  I get really close and neat shaves every time.</li>
            <li> One of the best product , arrived on timeOne of the best product , arrived on timeOne of the best product , arrived on time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette Fusion Power since its debut as a step up from my Gillette Mach 3 and since have not used anything else. I love the smooth shave that I receive from the blade and in over eight years, have only received two serious nicks, possibly from a defective cartridge. I shave both my head and face with this razor. Although Gillette has created fancier razor since this introduction, I&#x27;m sticking with what I&#x27;m confident in using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main problem that I was having was trying to catch the replacement cartridges at a reasonable price or on sale and Amazon.com became my sole source of purchasing there cartridges. I found that by subscribing for tri-annual shipment, I can save more money and since I don&#x27;t shave every day, I have a stockpile of replacement cartridges. I&#x27;d introduced my son to the Fusion Power last year and also sent two packs of cartridges, so I&#x27;ll become his supplier.</li>
            <li> This is a pricey subscription, but it is all my hubby uses....</li>
            <li> I paid about the same for these 8 cartridges as I would have for 4 in a regular store.  Brand new, unopened.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> I have had this razor forever and blades are a necessary evil. These are Gillette brand and work fine with my Fusion Power.</li>
            <li> Great price compared to the local drugstore.</li>
            <li> You save about $8.00 for 8blades, and if your like me in the military saving 5 days out of the week this $8 adds up.  saving $48 a year</li>
            <li> I have always been a Gillette user but recently was given a specialty shaving system as a gift by my son. My only complaint about Gillette is the price for their replacement cartridges</li>
