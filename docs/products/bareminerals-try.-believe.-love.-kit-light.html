            <li>Great product, I ended up joining and becoming a member and have been using this product for over a year</li>
            <li>I love this thing!  </li>
            <li>This is so light and looks so great.</li>
            <li>Liked this mini kit.</li>
            <li>Would recommend for someone wanting a nice travel kit</li>
            <li>Brushes were nice.</li>
            <li>Have used and loved the original foundation and wanted to try the matte finish.</li>
            <li>Make-up is OK, but not the best natural foundation.</li>
            <li>I felt so wonderful, that you bare minerals.</li>
            <li>I am sure it works wonderful for those with beautiful, young, healthy skin, but it is not for those of us who are mature.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I never knew I had so many wrinkles until I tried this stuff.  </li>
            <li>The face brush is okay, but the brissels fall out every time I use it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the bronzer as well, it adds color without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li>The shade of this is more orange</li>
            <li>OK, ONE THING MOST GIRLS DON&#x27;T REALIZE IS FOR THIS PRODUCT TO DO ITS THING</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the perfect size especially since you get the original and the matte.</li>
            <li>I have tried other mineral foundations before and not been impressed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>so I use the \\&quot;light\\&quot; foundation or \\&quot;golden medium\\&quot; which has more yellowness in it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has good coverage and give you a natural look.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look so perfect just as long as you don&#x27;t use to much of it.</li>
            <li>I like it more than liquid concealer because this gives the more natural effect.</li>
            <li>It makes your face very natural-looking and it&#x27;s very light.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not the right shade for your skin tone!</li>
            <li>So much so, that people don&#x27;t know that I have any type of powder on my face. :)</li>
            <li>I am Asian and I&#x27;m fairly light-skinned</li>
            <li>For my daughters first makeup set!</li>
            <li>you&#x27;d want to look extra nice.</li>
            <li>I love bare minerals and now she does too!!</li>
            <li>What I love about this is it still covers zits or dark circles under the eyes and evens out your complexion, but it&#x27;s still super light</li>
            <li>then what I expected but the mineral veil is amazing.</li>
            <li>then I expected but they still work amazingly.</li>
            <li>Bought this make up because my son was getting married</li>
            <li>I love Bareminerals, but sellers should be specific about the sizes they are putting out there!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a small package but good amount of product to give a review.&lt;br</li>
            <li>is a good brand, but I have such dry skin</li>
            <li>, I have not broken out once since using this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much to say about this product since I don&#x27;t use it...</li>
            <li>so people can&#x27;t really tell you have makeup on.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do what the TV ads promote...and doesn&#x27;t come with \\&quot;how to apply\\</li>
            <li>,f I know nothing about cosmetics but as long as she loves it, Bare Minerals is getting to get my love.</li>
            <li>My mom is very sensitive with makeup because she produces so much oil</li>
            <li>Really covers up age spots and looks totally natural.</li>
            <li>I went back to my usual makeup after giving this a fair 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Love the product, but I was not prepared for just how small they are.</li>
            <li>I bought the light kit and it was way too dark!</li>
            <li>The different brushes are also fantastic, especially the smaller one for cover-up uses.</li>
            <li>natural look</li>
            <li>I really want my money back</li>
            <li>Natural stuff</li>
            <li>but I would definitely recommend to a Bare Minerals first timer.</li>
            <li>Repeat with the other side until you achieve the right conturing for the face.  </li>
            <li>I like the powder and Bare Minerals</li>
            <li>I bought this to give to someone as a gift, and it ended up being a super small size!  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love Love Love!!! I break out every time I put foundation on my face. I have heard of bareminerals for years and always wanted to try it to see if maybe it would work on me. I love it, I have not broken out once since using this product. I only put it on if I am going out with my boyfriend on a date or some place you&#x27;d want to look extra nice. I love it!!</li>
            <li> Liked this mini kit. The product was what was expected. Small in size but expected that. Would recommend for someone wanting a nice travel kit</li>
            <li> Well, I saw the infomercial and decided to give it a try.  I never knew I had so many wrinkles until I tried this stuff.  I am sure it works wonderful for those with beautiful, young, healthy skin, but it is not for those of us who are mature.  If you are over 50, stay away!</li>
            <li> Great product, I ended up joining and becoming a member and have been using this product for over a year</li>
            <li> I was looking for a change I foundation and thought I would try this one.  I like the powder and Bare Minerals is a good brand, but I have such dry skin, I can only use a few of them.  I would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> Have used and loved the original foundation and wanted to try the matte finish. Love the product, but I was not prepared for just how small they are. Way overpriced for what you get.</li>
            <li> A great product!!! Really covers up age spots and looks totally natural.</li>
            <li> Bought this make up because my son was getting married and I wanted to look my best. This is so light and looks so great. I didn&#x27;t feel as though I had a bunch of mud on, lol. I got so many compliments on how beautiful I looked that day. I felt so wonderful, that you bare minerals. You made my day. I felt beautiful all day!!!</li>
            <li> this is not what i thought it was..really small items i didnt think it was going to be like that..not happy with this item at all but some people might like it thou....powder doesnt stay on well either.</li>
            <li> I bought the light kit and it was way too dark! Plus, this kit doesn&#x27;t come with the warmth. I come with the two different types of foundation, but I wish it would have come with warmth instead of the matte foundation. Also, there are zero instructions so you have to look on youtube. The face brush is okay, but the brissels fall out every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much to say about this product since I don&#x27;t use it...but my wife is happier than I&#x27;ve ever seen her about this makeup!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried other mineral foundations before and not been impressed. Sooo happy I decided to try this kit!!! Bare minerals is way above any other makeup out there...liquid or mineral powder!! Kit contains plenty of product to try it out but I guarantee all you will need is one application to be hooked for life!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to give to someone as a gift, and it ended up being a super small size!  I could not give that away.  I also don&#x27;t recall seeing size specs on the item details.  I love Bareminerals, but sellers should be specific about the sizes they are putting out there!</li>
            <li> What I love about this is it still covers zits or dark circles under the eyes and evens out your complexion, but it&#x27;s still super light so people can&#x27;t really tell you have makeup on. I absolutely love the bronzer as well, it adds color without being overwhelming. The different brushes are also fantastic, especially the smaller one for cover-up uses.</li>
            <li> Pro:&lt;br /&gt;-Provides natural look&lt;br /&gt;-long lasting coverage&lt;br /&gt;-easy to use and blend&lt;br /&gt;-improved my skin even after removed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;-I was prepared for trial size, but these were smaller than expected&lt;br /&gt;-Be careful with the powder, it tries to come out all at once</li>
            <li> Loved the price of this demo-kit It lasted a lot longer than I expected it to. I like it more than liquid concealer because this gives the more natural effect. So much so, that people don&#x27;t know that I have any type of powder on my face. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small package but good amount of product to give a review.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been fighting with acne since 15 years, so leave home with out make up, it&#x27;s not an option.&lt;br /&gt;It has good coverage and give you a natural look.</li>
            <li> These products are nothing like advertised! Skins appearance is powdery and it DOES NOT cover blemishes or redness at all!! I went back to my usual makeup after giving this a fair 2 weeks. I had many people ask me if I wasn&#x27;t feeling well because my complexion looked so bad with Bare Minerals on :( I really want my money back</li>
            <li> I thought it would come in larger quantities for the price. Brushes were nice. Make-up is OK, but not the best natural foundation.</li>
            <li> Very small; color was not right. I have used the product in the past, however this was just a total disappointment.</li>
            <li> The shade of this is more orange then what I expected but the mineral veil is amazing. It makes my skin look so perfect just as long as you don&#x27;t use to much of it. When I first received it I was shocked by how small it was but now knowing how little you have to use it&#x27;s the perfect size especially since you get the original and the matte. The brushes are also a lot smaller then I expected but they still work amazingly. I don&#x27;t wear make-up often so this has lasted me a lot longer then the 30 days. I don&#x27;t think I would purchase this again but I would definitely recommend to a Bare Minerals first timer.</li>
            <li> Natural stuff,f I know nothing about cosmetics but as long as she loves it, Bare Minerals is getting to get my love.</li>
            <li> no problems with this shipment. got it for an xmas gift for my mother in law and have heard no complaints to this point</li>
            <li> everything is there to try this out and see if you like it.  compact so you can use as a travel kit also.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup often but when I do, BareMinerals is what I use.  I don&#x27;t have acne issues but I do have dark circles under the eyes and redness around crevices of the nose.  I love this thing!  It&#x27;s light and easy to use.  A little does go a long way because you shake a little bit out onto the cap then the fun begins.  You swirl, tap (excess powder) and buff all over the face.  OK, ONE THING MOST GIRLS DON&#x27;T REALIZE IS FOR THIS PRODUCT TO DO ITS THING, YOU HAVE TO DO YOUR JOB OF MOISTURIZING!  IF YOU GOT DRY SKIN AND IT&#x27;S FLAKING AND YOU BUFF THIS POWDER ON, IT&#x27;S NOT GOING TO WORK (SO IT&#x27;S NOT THE PRODUCT&#x27;S FAULT).  I am Asian and I&#x27;m fairly light-skinned so I use the \\&quot;light\\&quot; foundation or \\&quot;golden medium\\&quot; which has more yellowness in it.  After buffing the foundation, your face will be this blank canvas that needs color so the next step is to add color, which is the \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; jar (looks like a bronzer and everyone gets the same shade for this and the mineral veil).  I do the usual swirl, tap, buff and then I start at one half of my forehead on one side and then i swipe the brush downwards towards the cheek and then inwards towards nose and then out again and down towards the chin (like in a number 3 fashion).  Repeat with the other side until you achieve the right conturing for the face.  The last step is to swirl, tap, and buff the mineral veil to help set the makeup on and reduce shininess, I believe.  It makes your face very natural-looking and it&#x27;s very light.  My mom is very sensitive with makeup because she produces so much oil and this is the only product that doesn&#x27;t bother her.  There&#x27;s 2 lines for this product (reg. and then there&#x27;s the matte for people that are shine-prone).</li>
            <li> For my daughters first makeup set! I love bare minerals and now she does too!! Perfect starter size of products just in case it&#x27;s not the right shade for your skin tone! Now we know what to order for her when the time&lt;br /&gt;Comes!!!</li>
            <li> Thought this would be different than the makeup powder I use by cover girl, but it&#x27;s not. Doesn&#x27;t really do what the TV ads promote...and doesn&#x27;t come with \\&quot;how to apply\\&quot; information.</li>
