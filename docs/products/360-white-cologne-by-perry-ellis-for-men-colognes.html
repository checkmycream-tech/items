            <li>Good buy for me here.. and Fragrance.net shipped fast...</li>
            <li>Perry Ellis 360 White is a fantastic, sweet vanilla cologne perfect for any occasion!  </li>
            <li>and ohhhhhhh boy this is pretty nice</li>
            <li>it was so well liked the first time.</li>
            <li>I can tell u go to a department store and whiff away...but then returning to amazon u will just get a cheap version</li>
            <li>attentive to Cart</li>
            <li>The aroma is a bit light and rosy?  </li>
            <li>Received cologne in a timely manner, however the cologne box holder was cheap, the cologne fell out of the bottom of the holder and the lid to the holder</li>
            <li>AND THAT IT LAST FOR HOURS, SATISFIED CUSTOMER!!</li>
            <li>It is not too strong, and it doesn&#x27;t fade easily, just kinda calm and collective.</li>
            <li>I should have known better than to buy cologne without smelling it first.</li>
            <li>I have no idea, but I was pretty sure</li>
            <li>love it he does too smell very good and last all day long or more</li>
            <li>The Le Male had a pleasant lavender/vanilla/something-else smell.</li>
            <li>and it really smells good thanks</li>
            <li>Not overpowering, just the right scent!</li>
            <li>for 1/3 the price you get that great smell &amp; still have enough money for a hot date!&lt;br</li>
            <li>yes its true, It does smell like LE MALE.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>Anyone who wants that clean,just out of the shower scent try this,I have almost 50 bottles of cologne,49 too many.</li>
            <li>lo haria otra vez super bien voy hacerlo cuado tenga plata eso sera</li>
            <li>It does seem to fade a bit too quickly...</li>
            <li>Awesome clean scent, last a long time.</li>
            <li>I think that says something...that out of so many different colognes out there, he liked this one so much that he wanted it twice.</li>
            <li>i use to have the 360 red cologne, and to me this one is much better!</li>
            <li>I was going to get a new cologne for my husband when his was almost done with, and he liked this one that he had so much, that he said to buy it again.</li>
            <li>I would call it a softer scent, yet certainly still fit for a man.  </li>
            <li>Not real sure how to describe the smell other than it impressed me as something more of an effeminate scent.  </li>
            <li>He wears it everyday and it smells great on him.</li>
            <li>A great everyday office cologne.</li>
            <li>oh and 360 Red is nice as well</li>
            <li>I rarely ever review products, but I had to rate this cologne.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, smooth, elegant, not your normal every-day man smell.</li>
            <li>Very light sent and not an extreme masculine smell, which I love about it!</li>
            <li>This was a Christmas gift for dad, it&#x27;s one of his favorite scents and the Amazon Price was better than outlet store prices by a few bucks plus the convenience of not having to go to the mall.</li>
            <li>hands down one of the best fragrances I&#x27;ve had in a long time.....arrived on time....</li>
            <li>It smells very much like women&#x27;s vanilla musk.</li>
            <li>Love it my second bottle</li>
            <li>I pretty recommend it...</li>
            <li>I love it and would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>I had the bootleg version of this cologne and believe it or not it was incredible...</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact when I first put it on my 11 year olf daughter thought it was something she could wear.  </li>
            <li>Don&amp;#34;t know if this was sitting in a hot warehouse or is counterfeit.</li>
            <li>I hunted high and low for this specific scent, because it smells so great on my husband.  </li>
            <li>For a fresh clean scent check out Perry Ellis 360 Red.  </li>
            <li>this is another fine cologne that i used on a daily basis for business and pleasure</li>
            <li>A week or so later I was fine, so I sprayed some on a cloth.</li>
            <li>was to big and smashed in, the cologne bottle was fine and works and smells like it should.</li>
            <li>a must try if you like colognes as much as I do</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t really a &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>very much&lt;br</li>
            <li>however it does not have the impact as D&amp;G light blue or light blue living stromboli.</li>
            <li>I like it so much I purchased the one for women for myself.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Well, it is great for gift, but its smell is not attractive cologne in the market.</li>
            <li>Thanks anyway.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>After you put it on it stays on very well -</li>
            <li>He really likes the scent a lot.</li>
            <li>This is a light enough fragrance for a man</li>
            <li>my brother in law really liked the scent of it, and uses it to work everyday.</li>
            <li>The smell is surprising to me because I have tried a few other Perry Ellis colognes and liked them all, so I didn&#x27;t figure this was a big risk.  </li>
            <li>I like this because it is somewhat light and a little sweet...</li>
            <li>Its nice but the smell does not last that long.. maybe about 3 hours.</li>
            <li>the day version and black is more the night scent.</li>
            <li>Perry Ellis 360 White is my favorite for daily use.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Love this cologne for my hubby; so masculine yet so clean and subtle scent.</li>
            <li>smells like something very cheaap do not waste your time ore your money</li>
            <li>and it was in brand new condition</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very masculine but not in an over bearing way.</li>
            <li>It does smell exactly like it and for a third of the price.  </li>
            <li>been wanted to get this for a long time the price is just right</li>
            <li>you have ever smell LE MALE, you would know that its a great but expensive cologne.&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
            <li>soft scent not over bearing ,like polo.</li>
            <li>If looking for soft scent,this is for you.</li>
            <li>this cologne smells like dust do not waste your money on this cologne</li>
            <li>WOW and wowzer....</li>
            <li>.It&#x27;s great for the daytime weather work or casual and last over 6 hrs .</li>
            <li>Nice smell...common to a few other colognes on the market</li>
            <li>I have the PE 360 degree Red and Black and both are fine.</li>
            <li>The smell doesn&#x27;t last super long .. 4 hours max , but would definitely recommend it</li>
            <li>I usually use D&amp;G light blue for</li>
            <li>No matter how much my husband doused on himself the frgrance didn&#x27;t last and hour or less.</li>
            <li>The only bad review was from a student who thought it smelled like good smelling baby powder....</li>

            <li> love it he does too smell very good and last all day long or more</li>
            <li> The Le Male had a pleasant lavender/vanilla/something-else smell.</li>
            <li> and it really smells good thanks</li>
            <li> Not overpowering, just the right scent!</li>
            <li> for 1/3 the price you get that great smell &amp; still have enough money for a hot date!&lt;br</li>
            <li> yes its true, It does smell like LE MALE.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> Anyone who wants that clean,just out of the shower scent try this,I have almost 50 bottles of cologne,49 too many.</li>
            <li> lo haria otra vez super bien voy hacerlo cuado tenga plata eso sera</li>
            <li> It does seem to fade a bit too quickly...</li>
            <li> Awesome clean scent, last a long time.</li>
            <li> I think that says something...that out of so many different colognes out there, he liked this one so much that he wanted it twice.</li>
            <li> i use to have the 360 red cologne, and to me this one is much better!</li>
            <li> I was going to get a new cologne for my husband when his was almost done with, and he liked this one that he had so much, that he said to buy it again.</li>
            <li> I would call it a softer scent, yet certainly still fit for a man.  </li>
            <li> Not real sure how to describe the smell other than it impressed me as something more of an effeminate scent.  </li>
            <li> He wears it everyday and it smells great on him.</li>
            <li> A great everyday office cologne.</li>
            <li> oh and 360 Red is nice as well</li>
            <li> I rarely ever review products, but I had to rate this cologne.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, smooth, elegant, not your normal every-day man smell.</li>
            <li> Very light sent and not an extreme masculine smell, which I love about it!</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for dad, it&#x27;s one of his favorite scents and the Amazon Price was better than outlet store prices by a few bucks plus the convenience of not having to go to the mall.</li>
            <li> hands down one of the best fragrances I&#x27;ve had in a long time.....arrived on time....</li>
            <li> It smells very much like women&#x27;s vanilla musk.</li>
            <li> Love it my second bottle</li>
            <li> I pretty recommend it...</li>
            <li> I love it and would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I had the bootleg version of this cologne and believe it or not it was incredible...</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact when I first put it on my 11 year olf daughter thought it was something she could wear.  </li>
            <li> Don&amp;#34;t know if this was sitting in a hot warehouse or is counterfeit.</li>
            <li> I hunted high and low for this specific scent, because it smells so great on my husband.  </li>
            <li> For a fresh clean scent check out Perry Ellis 360 Red.  </li>
            <li> this is another fine cologne that i used on a daily basis for business and pleasure</li>
            <li> A week or so later I was fine, so I sprayed some on a cloth.</li>
            <li> was to big and smashed in, the cologne bottle was fine and works and smells like it should.</li>
            <li> a must try if you like colognes as much as I do</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t really a &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> very much&lt;br</li>
            <li> however it does not have the impact as D&amp;G light blue or light blue living stromboli.</li>
            <li> I like it so much I purchased the one for women for myself.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Well, it is great for gift, but its smell is not attractive cologne in the market.</li>
            <li> Thanks anyway.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> After you put it on it stays on very well -</li>
            <li> He really likes the scent a lot.</li>
            <li> This is a light enough fragrance for a man</li>
            <li> my brother in law really liked the scent of it, and uses it to work everyday.</li>
            <li> The smell is surprising to me because I have tried a few other Perry Ellis colognes and liked them all, so I didn&#x27;t figure this was a big risk.  </li>
            <li> I like this because it is somewhat light and a little sweet...</li>
            <li> Its nice but the smell does not last that long.. maybe about 3 hours.</li>
            <li> the day version and black is more the night scent.</li>
            <li> Perry Ellis 360 White is my favorite for daily use.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Love this cologne for my hubby; so masculine yet so clean and subtle scent.</li>
            <li> smells like something very cheaap do not waste your time ore your money</li>
            <li> and it was in brand new condition</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very masculine but not in an over bearing way.</li>
            <li> It does smell exactly like it and for a third of the price.  </li>
            <li> been wanted to get this for a long time the price is just right</li>
            <li> you have ever smell LE MALE, you would know that its a great but expensive cologne.&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
            <li> soft scent not over bearing ,like polo.</li>
            <li> If looking for soft scent,this is for you.</li>
            <li> this cologne smells like dust do not waste your money on this cologne</li>
            <li> WOW and wowzer....</li>
            <li> .It&#x27;s great for the daytime weather work or casual and last over 6 hrs .</li>
            <li> Nice smell...common to a few other colognes on the market</li>
            <li> I have the PE 360 degree Red and Black and both are fine.</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t last super long .. 4 hours max , but would definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> I usually use D&amp;G light blue for</li>
            <li> No matter how much my husband doused on himself the frgrance didn&#x27;t last and hour or less.</li>
            <li> The only bad review was from a student who thought it smelled like good smelling baby powder....</li>
            <li> The product is soft subtle and very pleasing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be curious whether or not other people have this experience with the PE White.</li>
            <li> The cost is low and it last all day long.</li>
            <li> It is almost an exact copy of JP Gaultier&#x27;s Le Male at less than half the price.  </li>
            <li> however, the fragrance does not last long.  </li>
            <li> I agree it does smell similar to 360 Black, but it&#x27;s much milder, little sweeter.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the maker has put out so many other varieties that this one is probably being phased out.  </li>
            <li> I really have not found one Perry Ellis I have not liked.</li>
            <li> When buying cologne it take so long for it to get to your house,</li>
            <li> Only thing I can possibly thing of that might be up to everyone&#x27;s taste, is that to some this can smell slightly feminine.  </li>
            <li> At least it wasn&#x27;t expensive only about $20 :)</li>
            <li> i was not impressed, it&#x27;s not a bad fragrance</li>
            <li> In the same realm, try Perry 360 Black and the \\&quot;New\\&quot; Perry Ellis.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few 360 in my day but never 360 White</li>
            <li> I get quite a few compliments from the opposite sex....bingo</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again although other men may like the smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an all day cologne,not like some of the colognes where you have to respray every few hours.</li>
            <li> If you like a very typical \\&quot;manly\\&quot; sent this may not be for you.  </li>
            <li> This smells stale if that is possible</li>
            <li> He has had Perry Ellis 18 in the past and it lasted longer, so we are re-ordering that when this is gone.</li>
            <li> With allergy season here, I could hardly smell anything.</li>
            <li> A very difficult product to obtain in local stores.</li>
            <li> so I was a little skeptical about this one, but he loves it.</li>
            <li> This was a blind buy for me</li>
            <li> This was a blind buy I decided to make based on the reviews and the fact that it smells like JPG.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a cold weather or evening/romantic cologne.</li>
            <li> Guys, if you want your woman to be unable to keep her hands off you, this is the one!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad or anything</li>
            <li> This is not a sporty smell, I have bad allergies &amp; this cologne does not bother my eyes or nose.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed</li>
            <li> Buy it,you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unsure whether I received a bad bottle, a knock-off, or what, but this smelled awful.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, I sprayed on a couple sprays and my wife said it smelled horrible.</li>
            <li> but this bottle was awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this scent. I agree it does smell similar to 360 Black, but it&#x27;s much milder, little sweeter. Can totally see what a youtube review said, it&#x27;s like the day version and black is more the night scent. Hope that helps!</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this cologne last year and now can&#x27;t find it in stores any longer.  Thank God for Amazon, so I stocked up!!  My husband gets so many compliments when he wears this fragrance.  Unfortunately the maker has put out so many other varieties that this one is probably being phased out.  Guess I&#x27;d better buy up all that Amazon&#x27;s got before any of you out there beat me to the punch!</li>
            <li> This was a blind buy for me I&#x27;ve had a few 360 in my day but never 360 White so I got this and ohhhhhhh boy this is pretty nice I have 92 colognes and this one stands out as one of my many favors a must try if you like colognes as much as I do oh and 360 Red is nice as well</li>
            <li> This smells stale if that is possible</li>
            <li> He is a very sweet fragrance and women love.</li>
            <li> boought this for my dad for christmas. it was wonderful and he loved it. i like the smell and it was in brand new condition</li>
            <li> Its not all that..the scent is light...not over powering....however, the fragrance does not last long.  I can tell u go to a department store and whiff away...but then returning to amazon u will just get a cheap version</li>
            <li> A very difficult product to obtain in local stores. Especially the larger size. Price is good and the shipping was excellent.</li>
            <li> If you like the La Male type of scent and want it for 1/3 the price just get Perry Ellis 360 White.  Identical all the way to the dry-down.  Outstanding projection and longevity.  No points for originality but many for affordability and being able to clone such an awesome scent.  Chick magnet with loads of powdery warm vanilla.  Definitely a cold weather or evening/romantic cologne. In the same realm, try Perry 360 Black and the \\&quot;New\\&quot; Perry Ellis.  For a fresh clean scent check out Perry Ellis 360 Red.  It smells similar to Aqua Di Gio, but lasts longer.</li>
            <li> People has mention that this cologne smell like Jean Paul Gaultier LE MALE.&lt;br /&gt;So I went to the mall to check it out for myself &amp; yes its true, It does smell like LE MALE.&lt;br /&gt;If you have ever smell LE MALE, you would know that its a great but expensive cologne.&lt;br /&gt;So for 1/3 the price you get that great smell &amp; still have enough money for a hot date!&lt;br /&gt;You will definitely get lots of compliments while wearing Perry Ellis 360 White.</li>
            <li> What are you wearing? This is the question I get asked every time I wear this cologne. I&#x27;m assuming they are asking because they like it :) This is my second bottle and I use it daily. It last about 3 months!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and will defiantly buy more!! It smells so good! I really have not found one Perry Ellis I have not liked.</li>
            <li> Love it my second bottle</li>
            <li> Nice baby powder scent</li>
            <li> I rarely ever review products, but I had to rate this cologne.  I hunted high and low for this specific scent, because it smells so great on my husband.  Guys, if you want your woman to be unable to keep her hands off you, this is the one!</li>
            <li> cologne smells delicious!!!! the cologne arrived within the estimated date and i will be buying from them again in the future.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for men... and very desire for women... I pretty recommend it... Its a very good cologne to feel good and masculine</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for dad, it&#x27;s one of his favorite scents and the Amazon Price was better than outlet store prices by a few bucks plus the convenience of not having to go to the mall.</li>
            <li> We cannot buy this product locally and it was by chance I looked for it.  My&lt;br /&gt;husband does not like many products on the market and very pleased I&lt;br /&gt;found it.  That makes me happy.  Duel win.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne for a quite a while. soft scent not over bearing ,like polo. I get quite a few compliments from the opposite sex....bingo</li>
            <li> Love this cologne for my hubby; so masculine yet so clean and subtle scent. And it lasts all day. If looking for soft scent,this is for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Perry Ellis 360 and took a chance on this fragrance. I was disappointed. I should have known better than to buy cologne without smelling it first. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad or anything but it isn&#x27;t really a &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; fragrance. It smells very much like women&#x27;s vanilla musk. I gave it to my niece.</li>
            <li> excellent product as it appears on the page and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;thank you very much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;more attentive to Cart</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Its nice but the smell does not last that long.. maybe about 3 hours. I have to spray alot . I was hoping for the same smell as obsession which is a wonderful smell. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again although other men may like the smell. I prefer a stronger smell then the one this has.</li>
            <li> this was recommended by several women i know. I usually use D&amp;G light blue for men.&lt;br /&gt;however i was not impressed, it&#x27;s not a bad fragrance however it does not have the impact as D&amp;G light blue or light blue living stromboli. The good part is the value, you get plenty for your money.</li>
            <li> Yuck! Smells like REALLY CHEAP women&#x27;s perfume (I.e. anything by Elizabeth Taylor)! This is not a smell for men period.</li>
            <li> Excellent fragrance period.</li>
            <li> When buying cologne it take so long for it to get to your house, this being my third fragrance I thought it would get better.</li>
            <li> Nice price for a top end product...amazon rocks with great deals like this one. No problems to report...I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Just got this today without ever smelling it before.... and did not like what I smelled after applying to my skin.  The aroma is a bit light and rosy?  Not real sure how to describe the smell other than it impressed me as something more of an effeminate scent.  The smell is surprising to me because I have tried a few other Perry Ellis colognes and liked them all, so I didn&#x27;t figure this was a big risk.  At least it wasn&#x27;t expensive only about $20 :)</li>
            <li> this is another fine cologne that i used on a daily basis for business and pleasure it smells great too</li>
            <li> Great Price........Great Scent</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband. He did not like the Reserved from Perry Ellis so I was a little skeptical about this one, but he loves it. He wears it everyday and it smells great on him. I like it so much I purchased the one for women for myself.</li>
            <li> Perry Ellis 360 White is a fantastic, sweet vanilla cologne perfect for any occasion!  It is almost an exact copy of JP Gaultier&#x27;s Le Male at less than half the price.  Also comes in a huge bottle, which is nice.  Only thing I can possibly thing of that might be up to everyone&#x27;s taste, is that to some this can smell slightly feminine.  It is a floral/vanilla fragrance, but smells very nice nonetheless.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unsure whether I received a bad bottle, a knock-off, or what, but this smelled awful. When it arrived, I sprayed on a couple sprays and my wife said it smelled horrible. With allergy season here, I could hardly smell anything. A week or so later I was fine, so I sprayed some on a cloth. I sprayed some Le Male (which everyone says PE 360 degree White smells like) on another cloth. The Le Male had a pleasant lavender/vanilla/something-else smell. The PE White, when I took a whiff, made me jerk my head back in surprise.There was an almost overpowering chemical smell to it... bug spray? solvent?... I have no idea, but I was pretty sure I didn&#x27;t want to spray it on myself. Given that I didn&#x27;t feel I could return something because &#x27;I didn&#x27;t like the smell&#x27;, I threw it away. I have the PE 360 degree Red and Black and both are fine. I&#x27;d be curious whether or not other people have this experience with the PE White.</li>
            <li> It is one of the best colognes I have owned! Ever since it has arrived, it has become my favorite! Very light sent and not an extreme masculine smell, which I love about it! Not overpowering, just the right scent!</li>
            <li> perrrrfect love thats smell</li>
            <li> this cologne smells like dust do not waste your money on this cologne smells like something very cheaap do not waste your time ore your money</li>
            <li> I was going to get a new cologne for my husband when his was almost done with, and he liked this one that he had so much, that he said to buy it again. I think that says something...that out of so many different colognes out there, he liked this one so much that he wanted it twice. I love the way it smells too :)</li>
            <li> Received cologne in a timely manner, however the cologne box holder was cheap, the cologne fell out of the bottom of the holder and the lid to the holder was to big and smashed in, the cologne bottle was fine and works and smells like it should.</li>
            <li> I love it. The person I bought it for loves it as well.. Price was Great. :) :) :) :)</li>
            <li> This smells great on a woman. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. 3 of my friends now wear it too.</li>
            <li> This was a blind buy I decided to make based on the reviews and the fact that it smells like JPG.  It does smell exactly like it and for a third of the price.  I love it and would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this scent the ladies love the smell of it also the price was excellent and the delivery was quick I would purchase another one soon</li>
            <li> Perry Ellis 360 White is my favorite for daily use. The cost is low and it last all day long. I get complements all the time.</li>
            <li> onald delgado Excellent muy bueno para comprar lo haria otra vez super bien voy hacerlo cuado tenga plata eso sera en seis meses</li>

            <li> Not the best , but is very good for the price. The smell doesn&#x27;t last super long .. 4 hours max , but would definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> he love it i love it, my husband bday gift, love it he does too smell very good and last all day long or more</li>
            <li> Smells great.  Has a nice, clean smell.  I love how affordable it is, and the packaging and presentation of the product.  It does seem to fade a bit too quickly... I only smell it on my husband for an hour or so.  He has had Perry Ellis 18 in the past and it lasted longer, so we are re-ordering that when this is gone.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t weared this since i bought it. smells like a girl cologne , and smell for like 30 min only!!</li>
            <li> muy buen producto el niño encantada con esto lo unico es que deberian envalarlo mas pequeño para que el envio no sea tan costoso</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE SENT AND THAT IT LAST FOR HOURS, SATISFIED CUSTOMER!!</li>
            <li> Nice smell...common to a few other colognes on the market</li>
            <li> I had the bootleg version of this cologne and believe it or not it was incredible...so I had to see just how good the original smell....WOW and wowzer....hands down one of the best fragrances I&#x27;ve had in a long time.....arrived on time....well packaged. ..great price....happy happy!</li>
            <li> very good product is just what I expected, for the price I paid I am satisfied with the purchase, and would recommend to buy!</li>
            <li> Well, it is great for gift, but its smell is not attractive cologne in the market. You pay what you get. Thanks anyway.</li>
            <li> Good buy for me here.. and Fragrance.net shipped fast... Happy customer here....:) Keep it up.. I&#x27;ll surely buy more.... Thanks</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents. I fell in love with this a decade ago, my wife loves it. It&#x27;s soft, smooth, elegant, not your normal every-day man smell. This is not a sporty smell, I have bad allergies &amp; this cologne does not bother my eyes or nose.</li>
            <li> It has a great evening smell...good for going out for dinner or so. It is not too strong, and it doesn&#x27;t fade easily, just kinda calm and collective.</li>
            <li> WOMAN TELL ALL THE TIME HOW GOOD IT SMELLS AND ASK ME WHAT IT IS, MY WIFE LOVE IT TOO</li>
            <li> the perfume was delivered on time. my brother in law really liked the scent of it, and uses it to work everyday. planning to buy the same for my dad too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard this smells similar to jean Paul so I took a chance on it and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed .It&#x27;s great for the daytime weather work or casual and last over 6 hrs .</li>
            <li> Excellent Product I like and has a great aroma retention is good to know that these perfumes are very good are the best</li>
            <li> If you like a very typical \\&quot;manly\\&quot; sent this may not be for you.  As a matter of fact when I first put it on my 11 year olf daughter thought it was something she could wear.  After you put it on it stays on very well - Just know it is a floral scent - Not woods or spice, etc...I have people ask me what it is...The only bad review was from a student who thought it smelled like good smelling baby powder....</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologne and it smells wonderful, everyone comments on it when he wears it. We received it in time for Christmas without a problem</li>
            <li> i use to have the 360 red cologne, and to me this one is much better! it just has a nice clean and mild scent, not to overpowering or anything and at a really good price too!</li>
            <li> Bought the as a Birthday  gift  because  it was so well liked the first time. Anther great Amazon purchase.</li>
            <li> Awesome clean scent, last a long time. I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my husband for his birthday. He really likes the scent a lot. Very nice manly scent without being too overpowering and strong.</li>
            <li> been wanted to get this for a long time the price is just right and it really smells good thanks</li>
            <li> Really great for the price!</li>
            <li> LOL at the title I chose, however, my dad always wore a fragrance that smelt as this one does. I didn&#x27;t know what this smelt like, until my dad sprayed it on my mum. Immediately we both recognized it. It&#x27;s very masculine but not in an over bearing way. Great for MEN. Don&#x27;t go buying this for you teenager now, he&#x27;s dealing with hormones as is.</li>
            <li> Ever since I have been using this cologne I have received nothing but glowing compliments.Women are saying \\&quot;boy what a beautiful scent,not over powering just clean\\&quot;.Anyone who wants that clean,just out of the shower scent try this,I have almost 50 bottles of cologne,49 too many.Everyone bought me colognes for Christmas and this is my go to cologne.When you sweat,trust me nobody sweats more than me, the scent does not go away it gets stronger but not over powering and you still smell nice and clean.It&#x27;s an all day cologne,not like some of the colognes where you have to respray every few hours.Just a couple of sprays and it&#x27;s goos all day.I love it.Buy it,you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The product is soft subtle and very pleasing. I have recieve many complements when using this product. I would recomend it.</li>
            <li> I like this because it is somewhat light and a little sweet... You can give it a couple of sprays without overpowering everyone around you.  I would call it a softer scent, yet certainly still fit for a man.  A great everyday office cologne.</li>
            <li> Dn&amp;#34;t know what happened with this order.This is a light enough fragrance for a man but this bottle was awful. No matter how much my husband doused on himself the frgrance didn&#x27;t last and hour or less. Don&amp;#34;t know if this was sitting in a hot warehouse or is counterfeit.</li>
