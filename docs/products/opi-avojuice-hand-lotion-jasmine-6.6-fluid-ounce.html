            <li>Absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>The lotion itself smells great ( a little bit like cotton candy to my boyfriend and I ).</li>
            <li>the product is very thick and feels wonderful on my skin.</li>
            <li>so then I can really shop a whole lot more.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Pretty positive this is a knock off.</li>
            <li>it helps to soften my hands instantly and the pleasant fruity smell lasts a long time....received the product in the time stated....</li>
            <li>The first thing I must explain is how amazingly fast this came to me.</li>
            <li>and it dries really fast.  </li>
            <li>a real co-incidence occured with my friend in idaho and me in florida.  </li>
            <li>Wish it were available in larger bottle.</li>
            <li>Very restorative hand lotion.  </li>

            <li>When I need to reorder, I plan on buying a bottle of Jasmine (this is the fragrance that I had boughten before), and I&#x27;ll try out a new fragrance.  </li>

            <li> Always very happy with Amazon! They always have great prices , I get my items as promised, before promised date. And I always get what I expect. Never have had a problem with Amazon. If the color of a item says its Blue, then that&#x27;s what I get Blue. ;) I just love Amazon. Need to get a better job so then I can really shop a whole lot more.</li>

            <li> I have never used lotion before that left my skin feeling this soft without being greasy. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I received a sample from my beautician for Christmas last year.  I really loved it.  I was getting low because I used it spareingly so I looked it up on your Website. Fragrances usually bother me but I liked this one so I ordered 2 bottles.  When I need to reorder, I plan on buying a bottle of Jasmine (this is the fragrance that I had boughten before), and I&#x27;ll try out a new fragrance.  I like the silky way it makes your hands feel. It also seems to work on my cuticles and isn&#x27;t oily so it doesn&#x27;t leave any smear marks and it dries really fast.  I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Great customer service! Arrived with a defect in the cap but as soon as I contacted the seller they sent me a new one! Lovely smell I just can&#x27;t get enough of!</li>
            <li> I just loved the feel and scent of this lotion, I will certainly be buying more in the future, I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have always gotten this lotion from stores and have loved it. The shipping was very quick. Impressed</li>
            <li> i bought this hand cream from amazon.  i was most pleased with the hand cream.  a friend  had given  me a sample size to try several months ago .  my friend is from idaho and i am from florida.  we all met at a dog show in texas.  i loved the product. but coul;dn&#x27;t find it anywhere in west palm beach, fl.now that i finally have my jasmine juice  i  find that i do not like the pump.  it takes several pumpings to get the cream (juice) up and out of the bottle.  the product is very thick and feels wonderful on my skin. i feel it is a design fault that the pump is not easier to use.i received another pump when i previously complained about the pump.  the replacement pump is the same as the original. made no difference.&lt;br /&gt;  a real co-incidence occured with my friend in idaho and me in florida.  we originally met in texas in MARCH.  after trying to find  the hand cream locally i also tried on line and couldn&#x27;t find it. i sort of gave up when  someone said try amazon. i did and lo and behold you had it. ordered it, received it .  i e mailed my friend in idaho to tell her i  finally  found the jasmine juice. she replied to me that i would soon have 2 bottles since she just found it on drugstore.com  . at least $2 cheaper than amazon!!!</li>
            <li> I used a friends before purschasing my own. The lotion leaves my hands feeling nice and smooth. You&#x27;ll need reapply after a few handwashes.</li>
            <li> Makes me smell like cotton candy!!!  I love this product, there are many different scents but this one is my favorite!!!</li>
            <li> I feel like you end up having to use it frequently. However it is nice, smooth,  and the smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li> Hydrates and softens without feeling greasy. Absorbs quickly. I don&#x27;t want to be without it!</li>
            <li> This lotion is quickly absorbed and smells delicious! It is not greasy.  Wish it were available in larger bottle. It goes quickly!</li>
            <li> Lovely aroma, silky texture, soaks in well and leaves skin feeling smooth. I knocked a star off only because it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like, especially on my hands. Otherwise, I love this product.</li>
            <li> Wife uses every night before bed, loves it.</li>
            <li> Nice scent.  Very restorative hand lotion.  Absorbs quickly.  Use at night; you will notice a difference in the morning.</li>
            <li> Pretty positive this is a knock off. I&#x27;ve bought this product before from a beauty supply store. What I received from my amazon order feels watered down and smells different. Disappointed.</li>
