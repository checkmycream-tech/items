            <li>I used one time and put in the freezer when have been for more than two weeks.</li>
            <li>It is one of the wider eye masks that has holes in front of the eyeball and the gel surrounds the Bottom and top of the eyelid.</li>
            <li>gift mask I got from a ebay seller for a $20 product was better than this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect little helper in the office for me.</li>
            <li>This mask does not turn rock-hard after being in the refrigerator, and it also feels comfortable without putting it in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li>This is really important for those like us who spend an excess amount of time in front of computer screens and reading/typing stuff.</li>
            <li>this mask is so cheap.</li>
            <li>It seems to work ok, but I only got one used out of it from placing it in warm water.</li>
            <li>I have not tried any eye mask before, since this mask is basic and with good price, I just gave it a try based on my friends suggestions.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it works well for my needs to cool my eyes before going to sleep.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a quick break for the eyes.</li>
            <li>As a stock broker, my eyes are really doing an important job every minute when I&#x27;m looking at the screen.</li>
            <li>I take vitamin and some supplements for eyes, but this is the most direct thing to use to relieve the sore eyes.</li>
            <li>I guess it should only be put in warm water.</li>
            <li>This mask is an inexpensive and useful solution for her problem.</li>
            <li>Try it and you will notice that it&#x27;s really effective in giving your eyes a refreshment in a short time!</li>
            <li>I just wish it covered a little bit broader area on the face to cover more of the under-eye area comfortably.  </li>
            <li>Like this product very much, I love the cold in my eyes, and makes me fall asleep very fast and relaxed!!!!!</li>
            <li>This eye mask works really well for me.</li>
            <li>The coldness is too intense</li>
            <li>The mask really does take off pressure from your eyes.</li>
            <li>but I found that its cool enough as it is even without refrigeration.</li>
            <li>I  use this eye mask mainly in the office.</li>
            <li>If you, too, has a job that requires a long time in front of computer screens, this is the right choice!</li>
            <li>I will be buying a few more of these</li>
            <li>but I typically only use it for hot massage for my eyes.</li>
            <li>Whenever I got tired, I just use it during my power nap and after that I feel very refreshing.</li>
            <li>Cheap but not worth it.  </li>
            <li>She usually feels much, much better after this process and looks completely refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>It has held up well with frequent use, though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not planning to use it frequently</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is that it doesn&#x27;t stay cool too long.  </li>
            <li>It really takes the tension off of your eyes after long usage.</li>
            <li>She often takes baths to refresh her body and spirit after a long day at work, but this doesn&#x27;t do much for her weary eyes.</li>
            <li>Very useful to keep your eyes closed at night, if they try to creep open and dry out!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried making it cool by putting in freezer for only a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>it costs less than 10 dollar and works really well for me.</li>

            <li> As a stock broker, my eyes are really doing an important job every minute when I&#x27;m looking at the screen. I take vitamin and some supplements for eyes, but this is the most direct thing to use to relieve the sore eyes. It&#x27;s very comfortable to put on and serves me well when I need to relax my eye area. I have recommended to my colleagues to get one of these. If you, too, has a job that requires a long time in front of computer screens, this is the right choice!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a comfortable mask and seems to be good quality. Instructions say to put it in the freezer but I found that its cool enough as it is even without refrigeration.</li>
            <li> It seems to work ok, but I only got one used out of it from placing it in warm water. When I placed it in the freezer for 30 minutes exactly, following the instructions, it busted! Gel was leaking out every where. I did get a refund from Amazon but since I had no time to send it back and had to pay for the return shipping (although it was to be refunded) I just threw it out. I guess it should only be put in warm water. Won&#x27;t be buying this again....</li>
            <li> I like to take naps during the lunch break, gives my eyes a good chance to rest and prepare for an afternoon&#x27;s work. My friend suggested to me to get one of these gel eye pads so my eyes can truly relax and rest. I decided to get one and yes, this definitely helps my eyes relax. it costs less than 10 dollar and works really well for me. I definitely recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> I ordered this eye mask for myself since I have sinus problems. I have not tried any eye mask before, since this mask is basic and with good price, I just gave it a try based on my friends suggestions. This mask does not turn rock-hard after being in the refrigerator, and it also feels comfortable without putting it in the refrigerator. I recommend this mask to anyone who still needs coolness and sinus pressure relief.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I need something to cover my eyes when taking a nap during the day and I saw the reviews for this and decided to order it,Im glad i got it,it is so soothing and cooling and it feels really comfortable over the eyes,this is a great product to have!</li>
            <li> This eye mask works very good.  I&#x27;ve only tried making it cool by putting in freezer for only a few minutes.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is that it doesn&#x27;t stay cool too long.  Maybe in refrigerator would be better.  anyway&lt;br /&gt;it works well for my needs to cool my eyes before going to sleep.</li>
            <li> This eye mask works really well for me. I use it during work and sometimes weekends when I stay in and spend a long time in front of the computer. It really takes the tension off of your eyes after long usage. I always feel refreshed after putting it on for twenty minutes or so. It&#x27;s like a quick break for the eyes. I will be buying a few more of these so I don&#x27;t have to carry them around from work to home. Really nice product!</li>
            <li> This thing didn&#x27;t bust after 30 mins in the freezer.  You may want to put it in the door, away from the colder parts just in case.  The coldness is too intense so we used a paper towel to offset..  it lasts about 5 mins until its about skin temperature</li>
            <li> Like this product very much, I love the cold in my eyes, and makes me fall asleep very fast and relaxed!!!!!</li>
            <li> I just wish it covered a little bit broader area on the face to cover more of the under-eye area comfortably.  It has held up well with frequent use, though.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive the style pictured. Not even close.</li>
            <li> This was a simple, &#x27;just because&#x27; gift for the lady friend. She often takes baths to refresh her body and spirit after a long day at work, but this doesn&#x27;t do much for her weary eyes. This mask is an inexpensive and useful solution for her problem. She takes a bath while the eye mask cools in the freezer. Once she&#x27;s done with the bath, she puts on some comfy clothes and lies on the couch with the mask and cover on for a bit. She usually feels much, much better after this process and looks completely refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: if it&#x27;s too cold or hot, I&#x27;d suggest placing a wash cloth between the mask and your face. It seemed to help her.</li>
            <li> Perfect little helper in the office for me. It helps me relax my eyes during breaks and recharges me for the afternoon. Its capable of both cold and hot use but I typically only use it for hot massage for my eyes. Try it and you will notice that it&#x27;s really effective in giving your eyes a refreshment in a short time!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B006R7HV2A Comfy Spa Gel Eye Mask]]....This is a great product for my eyes. Whenever I got tired, I just use it during my power nap and after that I feel very refreshing. It is really wonderful.</li>
            <li> I  use this eye mask mainly in the office. It&#x27;s a great help to just put it on during the break and have a quick nap. The mask really does take off pressure from your eyes. This is really important for those like us who spend an excess amount of time in front of computer screens and reading/typing stuff. Before I started using this eye mask, my eyes are sore and dry when I get home every night. Now it feels much better! Recommended!</li>
            <li> It got too cold in the freezer and after 2 uses it started leaking fluid. Cheap but not worth it.  Shipping alone was double the cost of mask.</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable on your nose&lt;br /&gt;Looks Cheap&lt;br /&gt;Gets too Cold-I put it in the fridge for about 5 minutes and it was freezing on my eyes and nose&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Redeeming qualities: If you can overlook the comfortableness and cheapness, the gel did feel good on my eyes</li>
            <li> Hard to use and small. I used one time and put in the freezer when have been for more than two weeks. I&#x27;m not planning to use it frequently</li>
            <li> I did not receive the mask in the picture but a totally different one that does not meet my needs.</li>
            <li> Item it&#x27;s not as pictured. It is one of the wider eye masks that has holes in front of the eyeball and the gel surrounds the Bottom and top of the eyelid. Not exactly what I thought I was getting.</li>
            <li> Great Mask!  Very useful to keep your eyes closed at night, if they try to creep open and dry out!</li>
            <li> The mask I received was not the one pictured but was a bigger mask. Not sure about ordering again will have to wait and see.</li>
            <li> this mask is so cheap. I CAN&#x27;T believe I just spent $8 on this and now I&#x27;m screwed because return it would cost me $5.50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gift mask I got from a ebay seller for a $20 product was better than this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;do not buy this! stay away!!</li>
