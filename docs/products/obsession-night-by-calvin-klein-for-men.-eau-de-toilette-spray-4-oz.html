            <li>The aroma of the &amp;#34;Night&amp;#34; version is very nice, its not as strong as the normal &amp;#34;Obsession&amp;#34; which doesn&#x27;t irritate the noses of those around you.</li>

            <li>Ladies, caution if you buy this for your man, be ready to pull chixx off him.</li>
            <li>so if anybody wants a practically brand new bottle of this, you can have mine.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed this cologne for several years and have received only compliments on it.  </li>

            <li> I got this as a gift for my husband.  It is musky, very masculine scent but not overpowering.  It is not the &#x27;just after a shower&#x27; clean daytime fragrance. Perfect for date night.</li>
            <li> As a GUIDO in NYC Im a cologne Connoisseur this stuff is excellent. Chix digg this cologne whether in an elevator or the supermarket. Guys, take it from the master, this stuff is GR8 but hard to find. Ladies, caution if you buy this for your man, be ready to pull chixx off him. This aint no High Karate. Guys, have fun &amp; enjoy the ride</li>
            <li> I had not seen this product before, but I am pleasantly surprised  with it&#x27;s great smell.</li>
            <li> This cologne is a BEAST! its just amazing! when i bought it i thought it would be nothing special, but damn was i wrong! Women LOVE this cologne! it has a great smeel, lasts long, and is at a Fair amount of money</li>
            <li> The aroma of the &amp;#34;Night&amp;#34; version is very nice, its not as strong as the normal &amp;#34;Obsession&amp;#34; which doesn&#x27;t irritate the noses of those around you. Its a &amp;#34;win&amp;#34; in my book. :)</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this cologne for several years and have received only compliments on it.  My wife especially likes this fragance on me.</li>
            <li> I ordered this cologne to convince my girlfriend that she would like it and I wasn&#x27;t wrong.  She loves it!!  This cologne has always been a winner for a night out in town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note... I ordered the same product on Amazon through FragranceNet and it &amp;#34;did not&amp;#34; meet expectations (water-downed and did not last).  Please order through NobleMart as the fragrance lasted the whole night with its original scent.</li>
            <li> Calvin Klein did it this time with this cologne i love it you could smell it from far miles and the price was great .</li>
            <li> It is perfect i love it</li>
            <li> My wife loves it; that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for my friend, he liked the smell, so far so good. But the was a bit long delivery issue.</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks. I&#x27;ve used this once so if anybody wants a practically brand new bottle of this, you can have mine.</li>
            <li> This fragrence smells nothing like regular Obsession, which i don&#x27;t like at all. I&#x27;ve owned Night before and got such a good deal i couldn&#x27;t pass it up. My girlfriend loves the smell and when it&#x27;s gone i will reorder. Great smell that lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> noted change of address and placed the order. never received the package. charged close to 80 bucks for this. very disappointed. there is no link to even report that the product was not received....these are exactly the times i stop using amazon and go to a store or do without if i cannot. i am just going to restrict my amazon experience to downloadble software. good bye.</li>
            <li> my Lady LOVES me with this on.</li>
            <li> Bought a couple of bottles to stash away. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> A Christmas gift for my husband who likes the warmer,spicier scents. This smells really good and was a good price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Excelente aroma, es bastante durable de 6 a 7 horas en promedio me ha durado, la presentaci√≥n del embace es  muy agradable, lo uso con frecuencia para el trabajo y me va muy bien,</li>
            <li> This EDT has a very strong aroma and you can use by day, as well as at night. I recommend it and without reservations.  I no like it very much.</li>
            <li> very low scent that further dissipates within 1-hour.  I think there is a variety of better colognes that can be obtained within similar price range.  I won&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells great, soft, penetrating and very quality at a very good price. I recommend this perfume for quality and pleasant smell.</li>
