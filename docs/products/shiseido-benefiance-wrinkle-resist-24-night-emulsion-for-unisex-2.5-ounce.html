            <li>She raves about it, and is very happy we can get products for less than at the high-end skincare counters.  </li>
            <li>I find this product helpful with moisturizing but have yet to notice any differnce in the fine lines around my mouth.</li>
            <li>Shiseido is a favorite of my wife and never a disappointment.</li>

            <li>Amazing, it works on wrinkles and fine lines, makes you look younger</li>
            <li>Last 2014, I decided to give try again since many people this brand is great for Asian skin.</li>

            <li>I gave 5 stars on this because it was a great price, came on time and was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Ever since I used this product my skin felt more smooth and not dry.</li>

            <li>It is a night cream for normal to combination good skin is quite smooth, with little product is sufficient.</li>
            <li>After 2.5 weeks, I see my skin starts getting much softer and it glows!</li>
            <li>Soft touch to the skin , smooth.</li>
            <li>Thanks a bunch!</li>
            <li>The smell is just delightful and not heavy like other similar products out there.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how they do it, but I love the fact that I can find an outstanding product like this one for $20 less than if I bought the same exact item at Macy&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>without that eye-burning spf this night emulsion is so gentle it will not sting you even if you accidently get it in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a light-weight evening moisturizer which absorbs into the skin fairly fast.  </li>
            <li>I would not use this for summer since it will make my skin very oily</li>
            <li>delivered very sooner than  the estimated date.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfy</li>
            <li>She certainly doesn&#x27;t look 81 years old!</li>
            <li>Another high quality product from Shiseido, my skin has been transformed.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m turning 30, and have recently moved to Los Angeles, been wearing make up lots for work, so my skin has been suffered so much from sun/pollution and starts to show lines and large pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and had the opportunity to ask for a sample of several of their day and night cream products to try it on first.</li>
            <li>Does not seem to work any better than any other cream, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>I tried this  high quality brand four years ago but the product got my skin turned to red</li>
            <li>No other product I have used has ever had this effect!</li>
            <li>I am very picky in what to put on my skin (we only have one skin) especially on my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other Shiseido products for quite some time and have found them to be very beneficial for my skin.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m lucky enough to have no red skin like in the past product.</li>

            <li> without that eye-burning spf this night emulsion is so gentle it will not sting you even if you accidently get it in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great reason plus it is a superior moisturizer and twice as effective when the balancing enriched toner is applied first after cleansing. Salesmen constantly think I am in my forties but next month I will be 64,&lt;br /&gt;If your lotion says on the label avoid eye area then it should not be on your face at all.</li>
            <li> My mom has been using this Shiseido line for many, many years.  She raves about it, and is very happy we can get products for less than at the high-end skincare counters.  She like the way it makes her skin feel and appear.  She certainly doesn&#x27;t look 81 years old!</li>

            <li> I bought this for my wife because of what it was promoted to do. From what I am hearing, it is doing what I paid for.</li>

            <li> It is a night cream for normal to combination good skin is quite smooth, with little product is sufficient. I Love the face of this brand.</li>
            <li> I started using this cream 2 - 2.5 weeks ago, and didn&#x27;t want to write a review until I \\&quot;see\\&quot; the changes. I use this product and the eye cream. I was told to keep the eye cream in the fridge for better result, but I store them both in the fridge cos I like the cool feeling of the cream when I put it on my face :). I am blessed with very great Asian skin (thank you Mom!!), no zits/ achenes, just freckles. But I&#x27;m turning 30, and have recently moved to Los Angeles, been wearing make up lots for work, so my skin has been suffered so much from sun/pollution and starts to show lines and large pores.&lt;br /&gt; After 2.5 weeks, I see my skin starts getting much softer and it glows! I am very picky in what to put on my skin (we only have one skin) especially on my face. And i&#x27;m not saying this cream will work on everyone&#x27;s face. But it works wonder for mine and I definitely give it two thumbs up and would buy it again! &lt;3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shiseido Benefiance WrinkleResist24 Intensive Eye Contour Cream Eye Puffiness Treatments&lt;br /&gt;Shiseido Shiseido Benefiance Wrinkleresist24 Night Emulsion</li>
            <li> Nice, but my husband is allergic to the smell.  Does not seem to work any better than any other cream, especially for the price.  I&#x27;ll stick with Oil of Olay&#x27;s Regenerist.</li>
            <li> Love this. It&#x27;s the same as the product sold in the mall or at shiseido stores. Just sold for a more awesome price!</li>
            <li> Love this product , less expensive through this store then Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Wife bought this and uses it at night.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> Amazing, it works on wrinkles and fine lines, makes you look younger</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I have only been using this a few days, but I notice the difference.  My skin is more even, softer and just feels healthy.  I have combination skin, and so far this feels like a perfect fit.  I will update if anything changes.</li>
            <li> I use it also for the day because it has no sun screen (I am allergic ti sun screen)</li>
            <li> After one week of use the results are already amazing...already getting complements on my skin! It has surpassed my expectations! No other product I have used has ever had this effect!</li>
            <li> love this beauty product line. I have very sensitive skin and had the opportunity to ask for a sample of several of their day and night cream products to try it on first.

            <li> Ik ben erg tevreden over dit product, het voed de huid terwijl ik slaap.&lt;br /&gt;Wat wil je nog meer van een nightcreame</li>
            <li> I bought this bottle at Macys store. I tried this  high quality brand four years ago but the product got my skin turned to red so I stop since then. Last 2014, I decided to give try again since many people this brand is great for Asian skin. It is now winter season in DC and I&#x27;m lucky enough to have no red skin like in the past product. However, I do have some residue oil on my face in the morning (not much, and maybe because I have 3 layers of skin care products on my face to protect my skin from being dry in winter).&lt;br /&gt;I may use this product again for winter seasons. I would not use this for summer since it will make my skin very oily (I have combination skin in summer and dry skin in winter).</li>
            <li> Another high quality product from Shiseido, my skin has been transformed.  No skincare line is a miracle worker, but my skin has improved exponentially.</li>
            <li> Just received this product this last week, put it on,it was like silk . I just love the product .  Soft touch to the skin , smooth.</li>
            <li> Expensive but a lovely product.</li>
            <li> I am afraid I am addicted. This feels amazing on my skin. My makeup goes over it very smooth and evenly. I also use it at night.</li>
            <li> This is surprisingly effective, but not thick or greasy. It glides on and stays on all night, much different from other moisturizers that disappear after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for thirty years!</li>

            <li> 20 year usage, love this product</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and have used this product for a short period of time. I&#x27;ve used other Shiseido products for quite some time and have found them to be very beneficial for my skin. I find this product helpful with moisturizing but have yet to notice any differnce in the fine lines around my mouth. I&#x27;m hoping after a few weeks I&#x27;ll see the same type of improvements that I&#x27;ve noticed with my other Shiseido products.</li>
            <li> I have used Shiseido products for more than 10 years and the results have been great.  I get many compliments on my youthful looking skin. The night emulsion is fantastics and feels very comfortable before going to bed.</li>
