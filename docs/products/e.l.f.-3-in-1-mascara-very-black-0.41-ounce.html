            <li>Excellent Seller....</li>
            <li>Great Product!</li>
            <li>The best thing about this mascara is probably the brush.</li>
            <li>This is the BEST mascara out there.</li>
            <li>I am considering using it just for that purpose, since it does that beautifully.</li>
            <li>It just great</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>buts its really great tho</li>
            <li>I say try it, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>Stays great and makes my eyes look amazing.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this mascara!</li>
            <li>Its good product, good service, and easy to use</li>
            <li>I like the kind of natural look and this is perfect!!</li>
            <li>Just love the way it separates and define my eye lashes.  </li>
            <li>anyway is ok.</li>
            <li>Used it everday and it was ok.</li>
            <li>Love the product but the stopper on the tube, to keep the mascara from all coming out, doesn&#x27;t stay on it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>but can be used until I buy something better.</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>The wand is probably my favorite part.  </li>
            <li>like those formula and brushes better.</li>
            <li>Such a great price...love e.l.f.!</li>
            <li>Takes a lot of application to get the full use of it and the issues is when I get some in my eyes it burns me so had to stop using it!</li>
            <li>Hands down best mascara ever.</li>
            <li>Giving this sticky, tacky mess of a mascara one star because the brush is awesome.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a natural look, this is a good choice since it darkens and defines lashes in just one or 2 coats.</li>
            <li>the other hand, I really love the ball on the end of the brush for getting the lower lashes, it does a great job.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a waterproof formula as it washed off pretty easily.</li>
            <li>I think this mascara does ok, a decent job.</li>
            <li>I love the way this makes my lashes look and at $3 a tube, I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a very natural mascara, I would recommend this one, but most of you (me included) are not, so I suggest you move on.</li>
            <li>it really makes them stand out; I really like the volume it gives my top lashes.</li>
            <li>The brush is great; it evenly coats, gets in the hard to get areas, fans out my lashes, makes them look larger, and even makes them appear more &amp;#34;curled&amp;#34; upward.</li>
            <li>But this one is very decent too, and just $3 on the ELF website.</li>
            <li>I really like e.l.f.</li>
            <li>I do think it gives you length, but just not as much fullness and</li>
            <li>In fact, that&#x27;s all it really does.</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>It is a bit wet to start and takes extra time to build, but that&#x27;s a very miniscule issue compared to the good things.</li>
            <li>It stays on great and doesn&#x27;t flake or smear if I wear it a long time or get a little sweaty.</li>
            <li>The mascara itself is very wet, and the most noticeable thing it does for your lashes is darken them.</li>
            <li>Flexible, sphered end and decent bristles</li>
            <li>I was  expecting a little more from this mascara.</li>
            <li>What it did give me was long, full, defined lashes.</li>
            <li>Usually my favorite mascara, but the last bottle received was almost totally empty when I opened it.</li>
            <li>I guess it did the job it says it would but dried out very quickly.</li>
            <li>I gave it a 4 star because it only comes in black and I love brown mascara &amp; it is SUPER hard to get off</li>
            <li>It is buildable though for more dramatic looks.</li>

            <li> I really like the small end for my bottom lashes</li>

            <li> However, I think that it&#x27;s a bit too wet and that, especially with a second coat, it makes my lashes stick together some.</li>
            <li> The bottle was empty.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd mascara I have ever tossed, next to Loreal False Fiber Lash mascara (both recent)</li>
            <li> highly recommended, I&#x27;ve gotten compliments about my lashes and people thought they were false lashes.</li>
            <li> I literally threw my other 4 mascara&#x27;s away and just use this one.  </li>
            <li> EMPTY!</li>
            <li> The results I received when I had had enough were not good.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;but has a Little brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> would like a Little</li>
            <li> This mascara flakes a little</li>
            <li> , clumps a little, disappoints a little...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a huge investment if you end up not liking it.</li>
            <li> Watered down and very messy.</li>
            <li> Having tried this, I&#x27;d still stick to my Essence Crazy Volume (pink packaging), L&#x27;Óreal Voluminous Black or L&#x27;Óreal Double Extend - i</li>
            <li> The color is def &#x27;Very Black&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Simlpy black and thick..</li>
            <li> Lengthens and gives volume without being excessive, or overdone.</li>
            <li> In fact, it withstood me crying!</li>
            <li> I mean for $3?  </li>
            <li> but the formula is wet, hard to build, tacky, sticky and awful!</li>
            <li> I just used this yesterday and was not impressed !  </li>
            <li> I find the brush to be difficult to handle with the ball on the end.  </li>
            <li> Bad bad bad bad baf</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t wish upon my worst enemy.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t give me any awful allergic reaction either.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Just love the way it separates and define my eye lashes.  I recommend to friends and family . It just great</li>
            <li> I just used this yesterday and was not impressed !  I find the brush to be difficult to handle with the ball on the end.  The results I received when I had had enough were not good.  Will definitely not buy again and probably will toss the mascara !</li>
            <li> Giving this sticky, tacky mess of a mascara one star because the brush is awesome. Flexible, sphered end and decent bristles but the formula is wet, hard to build, tacky, sticky and awful! I bought it for 3 bucks at Walmart and upon two applications I threw it away, cleaned the brush and have been using it on my eyebrows. I really like e.l.f. lengthening mascara that I bought for a dollar, and bought this thinking it would be awesome. Not even close! This is the 2nd mascara I have ever tossed, next to Loreal False Fiber Lash mascara (both recent) and I have been using mascara for 20+ years. Wouldn&#x27;t wish upon my worst enemy.</li>
            <li> Hands down best mascara ever. I like the kind of natural look and this is perfect!! I gave it a 4 star because it only comes in black and I love brown mascara &amp; it is SUPER hard to get off lol. Lengthens and gives volume without being excessive, or overdone. This brush literally coats every lash in mascara. I literally threw my other 4 mascara&#x27;s away and just use this one.  I mean for $3?  Best value there is. DO NOT buy ELF Cosmetics on Amazon, it is ALL WAY CHEAPER on their website.</li>
            <li> Its good product, good service, and easy to use&lt;br /&gt;but has a Little brush.&lt;br /&gt;I would like a Little big.&lt;br /&gt;But anyway is ok.</li>
            <li> I guess it did the job it says it would but dried out very quickly. Used it everday and it was ok.</li>
            <li> It was all dryed up in tube. Could not use do I three it away. Bad bad bad bad baf</li>
            <li> Love the product but the stopper on the tube, to keep the mascara from all coming out, doesn&#x27;t stay on it so I have to hold it and get it all over my fingers to keep from losing all the mascara.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this mascara! highly recommended, I&#x27;ve gotten compliments about my lashes and people thought they were false lashes. the brush can be intimidating but it&#x27;s what makes the lashes pop!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  This mascara flakes a little, clumps a little, disappoints a little...ya know.  Not quality stuff but can be used until I buy something better.</li>
            <li> like the e l f products</li>
            <li> Love it... Simlpy black and thick..</li>
            <li> I really like the small end for my bottom lashes it really makes them stand out; I really like the volume it gives my top lashes. great product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is at target for 3$$$$  buts its really great tho</li>
            <li> Excellent Seller....Great Product!</li>
            <li> Watered down and very messy.</li>
            <li> Could not get use to the brush .</li>
            <li> The bottle was empty. EMPTY! Not even a brush or any makeup.</li>
            <li> The wand is probably my favorite part.  The tip is rounded so it helps a lot.  The color is def &#x27;Very Black&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I think this mascara does ok, a decent job. However, I think that it&#x27;s a bit too wet and that, especially with a second coat, it makes my lashes stick together some. It may be my lashes which are neither very long, very thick or very curved - just pretty average. I do think it gives you length, but just not as much fullness and separation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I really love the ball on the end of the brush for getting the lower lashes, it does a great job. I am considering using it just for that purpose, since it does that beautifully. Having tried this, I&#x27;d still stick to my Essence Crazy Volume (pink packaging), L&#x27;Óreal Voluminous Black or L&#x27;Óreal Double Extend - i like those formula and brushes better. But this one is very decent too, and just $3 on the ELF website.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this mascara is probably the brush. It&#x27;s made of still plastic bristles, with a ball on the end to comb out clumps. That&#x27;s one plus to this mascara. There are zero clumps at all.  The mascara itself is very wet, and the most noticeable thing it does for your lashes is darken them. In fact, that&#x27;s all it really does. It darkens lashes and defines them, but provides zero volume and length. If you&#x27;re looking for a very natural mascara, I would recommend this one, but most of you (me included) are not, so I suggest you move on.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara. It is a bit wet to start and takes extra time to build, but that&#x27;s a very miniscule issue compared to the good things. If you&#x27;re looking for a natural look, this is a good choice since it darkens and defines lashes in just one or 2 coats. It is buildable though for more dramatic looks. It doesn&#x27;t clump, doesn&#x27;t flake, doesn&#x27;t give me raccoon eyes. In fact, it withstood me crying! I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a waterproof formula as it washed off pretty easily. It didn&#x27;t give me any awful allergic reaction either. What it did give me was long, full, defined lashes. Overall, I&#x27;d definitely repurchase, especially for the price! I got mine at Target for $3 bucks. It&#x27;s overpriced here on Amazon, but if Amazon drops the price below $3, Target will honor the price listed here! I say try it, it&#x27;s a great product. It&#x27;s not a huge investment if you end up not liking it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the wand but it helps your eyelashes pop</li>
            <li> I was  expecting a little more from this mascara. Takes a lot of application to get the full use of it and the issues is when I get some in my eyes it burns me so had to stop using it!</li>
            <li> Usually my favorite mascara, but the last bottle received was almost totally empty when I opened it. Ugh......</li>
            <li> I purchased this from the elf website and I got it 3 days later. I love the way this makes my lashes look and at $3 a tube, I will definitely be buying more. It stays on great and doesn&#x27;t flake or smear if I wear it a long time or get a little sweaty. The brush is great; it evenly coats, gets in the hard to get areas, fans out my lashes, makes them look larger, and even makes them appear more &amp;#34;curled&amp;#34; upward.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST mascara out there. Stays great and makes my eyes look amazing. Such a great price...love e.l.f.!</li>
