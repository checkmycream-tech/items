            <li> The color for the pink one is a LOT darker than I was expecting. I was expecting a soft maybe baby pink color and it ended up being dark redish hot pink..... at least the design of it is cute or else  I would probably hate it. Other than that, it fits my tablet pretty well.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 for my granddaughters. Mine came in earlier because they were in stock. Mine was for a samsung, theirs was an rca. Great to know they have sizes to fit all tablets. I live mine. Like the magnetic closure.</li>
