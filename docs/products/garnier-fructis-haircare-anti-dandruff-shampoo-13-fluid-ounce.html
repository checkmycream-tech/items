            <li>this works perfectly to take care of that problem.....</li>
            <li>Best shampoo for dandruff and itchy scalp!</li>
            <li>Excellent anti-dandruff capability is a necessity.</li>
            <li>Good product!</li>
            <li>The cent of Garnier Fructis is very pleasant way better than the smell of tar like some dandruff shampoos in the market, this shampoo deserves the best merits and deserves and award!</li>
            <li>but works great.  </li>
            <li>This is a really good dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li>I used to use Neutrogena&#x27;s Triple Moisture product and miss the scalp tingle, but apart from that I find this a good substitute.</li>
            <li>Use a good conditioner to balance off.</li>
            <li>Love Garnier products and this one is also great.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find it in stores, so I am so glad to find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li>I have always been complemented for having nice hair but my fight against dandruff was always a challenge, I have been recommended shampoos by dermatologists</li>
            <li>thanks Garnier Fructis for this wonderful product!.</li>
            <li>and she realizes that this is the best product she has ever used so far.</li>
            <li>This cannot be safe for color treated hair, but it isn&#x27;t supposed to be.    </li>
            <li>I love both of these products but have some advice for those who want to extend time between washing your hair but have dandruff</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>yes - if you have flakes because it works a lot better than leading brands (aka H&amp;S).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll order more</li>
            <li>my scalp was actually clean and stayed that way for days!</li>
            <li>Does the job, leaves hair clean and scalp exfoliated!  </li>
            <li>Fabulous product that does what it claims</li>
            <li>I found them here and ordered two&lt;br /&gt;the only product that does a great job on my dandruff</li>
            <li>It gives oily hair a clean squeaky feel.</li>
            <li>Its grainy texture helps clean out the fungus legions which cause dandruff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve definitely switched over from H&amp;S for good.</li>
            <li>I have been using Garnier Fructis Anti-dandruff Intense Cleanse Shampoo for a few months now and without a doubt is the best shampoo I have ever used</li>
            <li>Great product, exactly as described and came quicker than expected as well</li>
            <li>Intense Clean* shampoo removes all junk from the hair that weighs it down...without stripping the hair.</li>
            <li>Ok, but back to the product at hand, loved the smell, product felt odd to&lt;br /&gt;put in hair</li>
            <li>Cleans intensely as the name says!</li>
            <li>(Dont be scared at first).</li>
            <li>The first time I used this shampoo, I was ready to return it right away...</li>
            <li>However, they are not joking when they say it is intense.</li>
            <li>I just try to keep it at the roots, but if you have really oily hair all the time you may really like this.</li>
            <li>I also wanted to say that you can get this much cheaper elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used both the Anti-Dandruff Intense Cleanse and the Mint Cleanse.  </li>
            <li>If your flakes aren&#x27;t really noticeable, then maybe you dont need it</li>
            <li>Resulting hair is much cleaner and lighter than anything else.</li>
            <li>Does not leave a residue when many other products do.</li>
            <li>Certainly does Keep the flakes away after only one week of using it for the first time.</li>
            <li>The cleansing beads really help and my hair is soft after using.</li>
            <li>I decided to use this shampoo a few more times to test it...</li>
            <li>but I think this product is going right back to the store.</li>
            <li>It is still a new product and there are a lot of coupons out there for it.</li>
            <li>I have distressed hair that I use other special hair care products on</li>
            <li>I can never use Garnier Fructis, but was pleasenly surprised that the smell of the&lt;br /&gt;product didn&#x27;t want to make me barf.</li>
            <li>I have a highly sentive nose, and the worst&lt;br /&gt;part of it that I can like a product and use it for awhile then all the sudden</li>
            <li>Garnier Fructis is the only shampoo I can feel comfortable to recommend to anybody, I can wear black shirts now without worrying about dandruff flakes on my shirt.</li>
            <li>then i put my conditioner on and my hair went back to normal...</li>

            <li> then i put my conditioner on and my hair went back to normal...</li>
            <li> I finally found the right shampoo for me, but now it&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
            <li> This is the only dandruff shampoo that controls my sons&#x27; dry scalp and flakes in the winter.  </li>
            <li> This product matches all competing dandruff shampoos as it has the same active ingredient at the same percentage, so you&#x27;re getting a standard dandruff fighting shampoo here.    </li>
            <li> it dried my hair out so much in the shower and made it so rough that even the water couldn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find in stores, but well worth it!</li>
            <li> hair is dry</li>
            <li> It was impossible for me to find this product any more or any where</li>
            <li> , I never get to finish a bottle of anti-danfruff Shampoo in the past because I could not use it for very long when I would get the flakes build up again, I have used just about any other commercial brands from Head and Shoulders, Selsun Blue, Nizoral, T-gel Nutragina,Nexxus, Clairol Herbal Essences, Jason, Person &amp; Covey, Theraneem Organix etc</li>
            <li> For me, I apply it directly to my scalp and massage in the beads for at least 10 seconds in each area then rinse out and apply my conditioner to the rest of my hair.  </li>
            <li> The granules scrub my scalp and seem to get my hair cleaner than other shampoos.  </li>
            <li> and they would work for a little while.   </li>
            <li> and i think it was a little drier, but nothing that conditioner didn&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> and frankly they were not only disappointing but a big waste of money.</li>
            <li> I could not use this everyday as it would strip my hair.</li>
            <li> If your kids waste shampoo like mine do, hide this for yourself.  </li>
            <li> these brands worked just for a few days or the results were not very good</li>
            <li> I have a hard to control dandruff....</li>
            <li> so it is hard to do that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But if anyone has a serious dandruff problem, this is the solution.  </li>
            <li> The little beads are a bit weird and take a while to rinse out of my hair, but my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch after I use this.  </li>
            <li> but overall nothing bad happened to my hair</li>
            <li> I wanted a anti-dandruff shampoo that didn&#x27;t smell so bad or dry your hair out, but still worked.</li>
            <li> Expensive stuff</li>
            <li> Too bad Garnier has discontinued this shampoo. :(  </li>

            <li> I have a hard to control dandruff....this works perfectly to take care of that problem.....recommend to others with same problem.....will reorder again!</li>
            <li> This is a really good dandruff shampoo. It gives oily hair a clean squeaky feel. It works well on the dandruff problem.</li>
            <li> I TRIED THIS SHAMPOO, I HAVE 4A/B HAIR. IT DRIES OUT MY HAIR AND TANGLES IT UP.  THE DANDUFF KEEPS COMING BACK. IT CLEANS YOUR HAIR, BUT DOESNT HELP IT. THE BEADS IN THE SHAMPOO CAN ACTUALLY STICK UP IN YOUR HAIR TOO</li>
            <li> I have always been complemented for having nice hair but my fight against dandruff was always a challenge, I have been recommended shampoos by dermatologists and they would work for a little while.   I have been using Garnier Fructis Anti-dandruff Intense Cleanse Shampoo for a few months now and without a doubt is the best shampoo I have ever used, I never get to finish a bottle of anti-danfruff Shampoo in the past because I could not use it for very long when I would get the flakes build up again, I have used just about any other commercial brands from Head and Shoulders, Selsun Blue, Nizoral, T-gel Nutragina,Nexxus, Clairol Herbal Essences, Jason, Person &amp; Covey, Theraneem Organix etc none of these shampoo worked for me on permanent basis these brands worked just for a few days or the results were not very good and frankly they were not only disappointing but a big waste of money. Garnier Fructis is the only shampoo I can feel comfortable to recommend to anybody, I can wear black shirts now without worrying about dandruff flakes on my shirt. I recommended it to a friend of mine who had suffer from dryness on the scalp and after a week or so of using she sent me an email to thank me for recommending this shampoo to her and she realizes that this is the best product she has ever used so far. The cent of Garnier Fructis is very pleasant way better than the smell of tar like some dandruff shampoos in the market, this shampoo deserves the best merits and deserves and award! thanks Garnier Fructis for this wonderful product!.</li>
            <li> I use this for scalp buildup since I can get a bit flakey over time. It has beads in it and it has a real gritty feel, but I like that for my scalp and it washes out well. This product matches all competing dandruff shampoos as it has the same active ingredient at the same percentage, so you&#x27;re getting a standard dandruff fighting shampoo here.    However, they are not joking when they say it is intense. I could not use this everyday as it would strip my hair. I just try to keep it at the roots, but if you have really oily hair all the time you may really like this. This cannot be safe for color treated hair, but it isn&#x27;t supposed to be.    I also wanted to say that you can get this much cheaper elsewhere. It is still a new product and there are a lot of coupons out there for it. I got it for about 1.60 at my local grocery store after using a 1 dollar off coupon.</li>
            <li> I finally found the right shampoo for me, but now it&#x27;s hard to find. I got some on Amazon, but the supply is short.</li>
            <li> Helps with my dandruff while not drying out my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both the Anti-Dandruff Intense Cleanse and the Mint Cleanse.  I have distressed hair that I use other special hair care products on and I also have curly hair and dandruff.  I love both of these products but have some advice for those who want to extend time between washing your hair but have dandruff so it is hard to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These two shampoo&#x27;s have invigorating beads and I suggest only apply to the scalp and not the rest of the hair.  For me, I apply it directly to my scalp and massage in the beads for at least 10 seconds in each area then rinse out and apply my conditioner to the rest of my hair.  I don&#x27;t have to use this every time I wash my hair but maybe around once or twice a week.  My husband uses it on a regular basis and his dandruff is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I don&#x27;t think this stuff can be beat.</li>
            <li> This *Intense Clean* shampoo removes all junk from the hair that weighs it down...without stripping the hair. The end result is extra body with no frizz--no conditioner required.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try it probably in a couple of months. I hope it will work well, I need on that stops the itch and cleans well.</li>
            <li> This is the only dandruff shampoo that controls my sons&#x27; dry scalp and flakes in the winter.  It&#x27;s difficult to find in stores, but well worth it!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I wish I could still purchase it.  Why oh why was it discontinued ?  (pout)</li>
            <li> The little beads are a bit weird and take a while to rinse out of my hair, but my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch after I use this.  I used to use Neutrogena&#x27;s Triple Moisture product and miss the scalp tingle, but apart from that I find this a good substitute.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo for dandruff and itchy scalp! The cleansing beads really help and my hair is soft after using. I can&#x27;t find it in stores, so I am so glad to find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Love Garnier products and this one is also great. I wanted a anti-dandruff shampoo that didn&#x27;t smell so bad or dry your hair out, but still worked. This one does the trick!</li>
            <li> Good product! Dont understand why we cant find it in the stores anymore!</li>
            <li> I can never use Garnier Fructis, but was pleasenly surprised that the smell of the&lt;br /&gt;product didn&#x27;t want to make me barf. I have a highly sentive nose, and the worst&lt;br /&gt;part of it that I can like a product and use it for awhile then all the sudden I&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t. Ok, but back to the product at hand, loved the smell, product felt odd to&lt;br /&gt;put in hair and I felt like it wasn&#x27;t suding. Then all the sudden you feel like&lt;br /&gt;your scalp is burning, even my face and shoulders felt like they were burning.&lt;br /&gt;Even now that I washed it out I still feel the tingle and I&#x27;m not liking it, once&lt;br /&gt;my hair is dry I will have to see how it feels and how my scalp is to make a finale&lt;br /&gt;decision, but I think this product is going right back to the store.</li>
            <li> Cleans intensely as the name says! Use a good conditioner to balance off. Certainly does Keep the flakes away after only one week of using it for the first time.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product that does what it claims -- problem is company has either discontinued product is almost iimpossible to find.</li>
            <li> Great product, exactly as described and came quicker than expected as well</li>
            <li> The first time I used this shampoo, I was ready to return it right away...it dried my hair out so much in the shower and made it so rough that even the water couldn&#x27;t help. then i put my conditioner on and my hair went back to normal...and when I got out, yes! my scalp was actually clean and stayed that way for days! I decided to use this shampoo a few more times to test it...and yes, it kept scaring me in the shower but overall nothing bad happened to my hair and i think it was a little drier, but nothing that conditioner didn&#x27;t fix. Would I recommend it ? yes - if you have flakes because it works a lot better than leading brands (aka H&amp;S). If your flakes aren&#x27;t really noticeable, then maybe you dont need it but if they are then use it because it keeps flakes away for days in between washes. I&#x27;ve definitely switched over from H&amp;S for good. (Dont be scared at first).</li>
            <li> Expensive stuff but works great.  If your kids waste shampoo like mine do, hide this for yourself.  But if anyone has a serious dandruff problem, this is the solution.  Its grainy texture helps clean out the fungus legions which cause dandruff.</li>
            <li> The granules scrub my scalp and seem to get my hair cleaner than other shampoos.  Excellent anti-dandruff capability is a necessity.</li>
            <li> It was impossible for me to find this product any more or any where&lt;br /&gt;then I found them here and ordered two&lt;br /&gt;the only product that does a great job on my dandruff&lt;br /&gt;and when I&#x27;m out I&#x27;ll order more</li>
            <li> Does not leave a residue when many other products do. Resulting hair is much cleaner and lighter than anything else.</li>
            <li> Does the job, leaves hair clean and scalp exfoliated!  Too bad Garnier has discontinued this shampoo. :(  Bring it back Garnier!!!</li>
