            <li>Good job</li>
            <li>Good quality case and instruments.  </li>
            <li>Basically, it was designed to give the allusion of having a good amount of quality with it, yet</li>
            <li>/&gt;Functional wise, I would give it a 70% rating.</li>

            <li>Very reasonably priced for all the items included, great gift idea as well!</li>
            <li>I get to keep everything I need in a nice case.</li>
            <li>I will say that the items do seem to be of nice quality, but, I didn&#x27;t get what I was expecting or wanting.</li>
            <li>Looks nice</li>
            <li>After looking for a nice nail set that was also functional, of quality, and inexpensive I ran across these.</li>
            <li>This product would make a nice gift for either a man or a woman.</li>
            <li>Nice variety of nail care</li>
            <li>The leather case is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>All the pieces are there, the case is nice.  </li>
            <li>Nice set of tools.  </li>
            <li>This is a really nice set.</li>
            <li>This was a great product for me when I needed a quick manicure on the go and did not have time to hit a nail salon.</li>
            <li>great product and shipped fast!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Customer service is remarkably courteous and truly outstanding.</li>
            <li>kind of okay.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves this set and the quality is off the charts good!  </li>
            <li>The tools are very strong and I love the case.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to give my husband a very much needed manicure lol</li>
            <li>These were very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I would not advise others to purchase these as they feel very cheap and do not do the job I was looking for....</li>
            <li>Very light weight and has all the essentials you need to do your nails</li>
            <li>The fit and finish are excellent and the stainless-steel is of a high caliber--given the price of the set.</li>
            <li>Everything looked good on this one and all the parts that are in there are very sharp and work perfectly.</li>
            <li>and i really love it.</li>
            <li>I can fix my nails at home and don&#x27;t need to go to nail salon any more.</li>
            <li>The case is protective and handsome.  </li>
            <li>but I have had better clipers.</li>
            <li>and this has everything to do that and more....</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say the case is cute or fashion forward, but does it need to be for the price?</li>
            <li>But, for the price I&#x27;m glad I received quality tools which I would rather have than a quality case.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>This stocking stuffer was so appropriate</li>
            <li>For starters, I&#x27;m not even sure what some of the items in the case do.</li>
            <li>The clippers, both fingernail and toenail clippers look stylish and nice, but the fingernail clipper feels a bit cheap.</li>
            <li>It looks like a better quality product in the images compared to what is delivered.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, there is a good reason it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>If the interior compartment had some more forethought in it</li>
            <li>The quality of the material is good although I would have liked to have it in stainless steel.</li>
            <li>All in all its a pretty good set.</li>
            <li>containing an incredible assortment of personal hygiene implements.</li>
            <li>the price, and the compact that keeps it all straight this was a good buy.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find that they are very nice quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I wanted some nice nail tools but wasn&#x27;t willing to spend a fortune.</li>
            <li>Handling of the tools is easy and comfortable on the hand.</li>
            <li>but I did, and I am glad - the items that need to be sharp - are, and it is easy to handle - it is a nice easy to carry around case that everything fits nicely into.  </li>
            <li>It has all the tools you need in a nice carrying case, couldn&#x27;t ask for much else.</li>
            <li>a dont feel smooth.</li>
            <li>Utensils are cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>It is a sturdy set with many useful accessories.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;couldn&#x27;t replace it or refund it since the order was filled by Amazon.\\</li>
            <li>and this is definitely a great product for those looking for some basic grooming implements.</li>
            <li>The metal is high quality and the case is nice and sturdy.  </li>
            <li>It works well in my purse and is easily accessible...</li>
            <li>In general a good product.</li>
            <li>Love these tools, they are sharp and good quality.</li>
            <li>These are great - sharp, precise, good quality (seem like they will last a while).</li>
            <li>Even straight would be better than concave.  </li>
            <li>If you try to call and complain, you will not get an answer and you cannot leave a message because the mailbox is full.  </li>
            <li>Fast ship, just as described I would get this again if I had to for sure</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent price, stylish and full set of tools.  </li>
            <li>This kit is adequate.  </li>
            <li>The vinyl will tear apart rather quickly.</li>
            <li>If you want high quality, spend more.</li>
            <li>Overall a great value in a manicure \\&quot;gift set.\\&quot; Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>A large selection of clippers to choose from and each tool is precise.</li>
            <li>It is made of cheap, very flexible metal, probably aluminum, which is unfinished.</li>
            <li>Really would recommend this over the cheap ones you may find at Target, Walmart, or others.</li>
            <li>Not at all worth the cost.  </li>
            <li>The tools inside the nice case are NOT the same ones that were pictured on the website or even the box the set arrived in.</li>
            <li>I ordered this because it looked sturdy, I liked the simple tan case, and it looked like something</li>
            <li>and it would easily be worth 2-3 times that amount.</li>
            <li>But the clippers feel cheap, I like your basic CVS ones better.</li>
            <li>The individual pieces are sturdy and handy when doing nails.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>The item arrived super fast, but, as soon as I opened the case</li>
            <li>this incredible set is at our side all the time, being used at least once a day!</li>
            <li>I like this kit very much.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how fast it came!</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Broke before first use.  </li>
            <li>It was a very personalized gift!</li>
            <li>I cut myself twice when I first used it.</li>
            <li>I would have rated it higher.</li>
            <li>The other tools are nice enough - but you could probably get the same or better if you buy a better nail kit.</li>
            <li>It comes in such a cute, expensive looking case, it contains a lot of different tools to help you achieve a great mani/pedi, and the price is amazing for what you get.</li>
            <li>This is my first real manicure set and it has all the tools I need.  </li>
            <li>I had this nail kit for a long time and it&#x27;s quality is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>Cheap, but you get what you pay for apparently.</li>
            <li>Not top of the line, but for the price it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>All the pieces are exactly as pictured and are quite strong and look like a brushed stainless steel material.</li>
            <li>Very sharp, nice looking and work well.</li>
            <li>a easy open and close case it all comes in...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone interested in home manicure/pedicure sets.</li>
            <li>The tools look very durable.  </li>
            <li>the case has held up very well.</li>
            <li>Given as gift and recipient appreciated the product.  </li>
            <li>up close, absolutely none.</li>
            <li>For the money I really don&#x27;t think you can beat this.</li>
            <li>the file isn&#x27;t very efficient.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not smooth and kind of shabby.</li>
            <li>He likes it very much, the look of it is very masculine and the case looks like a wallet.</li>
            <li>I do love the tools for getting under your cuticles and places that are hard to keep clean....</li>
            <li>Very cheap, and not worth the money.</li>
            <li>i chose only four stars because the only thing that is kind of flimsy is the tweezer other than that, i actually think the rest of the items are nice and well made.</li>
            <li>I was able to clean up with fine emery cloth without disrupting the cutting surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise</li>
            <li>the toenail clippers broke (that is, the metal of the main pin fatigued and snapped).  </li>
            <li>The quality of the tools inside are decent in consideration of the price.  </li>
            <li>all the tools inside which is the main reason I am giving it three stars.  </li>
            <li>personally think that it was made in the most cost-effective way possible, thus leaving the customer with a poor-quality, poor-value product.</li>
            <li>They are decent.</li>
            <li>For the price, this set is decent.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>executive look, and high quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I needed a new nail set, and I love angled cuticle trimmers that are  similar to regular nail clippers which this set has.</li>
            <li>if one likes to keep there finger nails clean and groomed i do recommend this and for the price that i spent i totally think it was worth it, also fast shipping</li>
            <li>Overall I can&#x27;t complain, worth the money I&#x27;d say.  </li>
            <li>It works, mostly, but not something you would buy to have for any longer than a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The tools in this set are cheap - the clippers are not sharp enough, the metal has uncomfortably rough edges even, and the whole thing looks very chincy in person.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy this for myself, I instead bought it for my little brother who wants to be in the Navy, and he has to keep his nails clean.</li>
            <li>That said, the rest of the tools seem to be holding up, and case is pretty solid.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even know what half of the things in the case are for but the ones I use work great and for the price, its hard to beat.</li>
            <li>It sounds dumb I know, but I kind of wish there were some sort of instructions to at indicate what the devices do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- I was relunctant to get a new set, our old - old one did almost everything -</li>
            <li>THE NAIL CARE PRODUCTS ARE SO LARGE FOR THE CASE THAT THE CASE CAN&#x27;T CLOSE PROPERLY.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this set.</li>
            <li>the case is soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>The pocket size is small and easily carried around in your bag.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend this particular product.</li>
            <li>The case is kind of weird looking and the leather pieces that hold the tools in a little on the cheap side</li>
            <li>Brand new, this has gashes and marks, in the metal, somehow which were obviously unintentional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was given no other information on replacing it.  </li>
            <li>The only small gripes I have are that the case itself is so full that is rarely stays closed and</li>
            <li>This particular item is difficult to find in most retail outlets.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to explain, but they pretty much suck.</li>
            <li>I swear I&#x27;ve seen them selling these same sets at various street markets in asia for only a couple bucks, very tourist-trap kinds of places where I wouldn&#x27;t count on anything like this to be quality.  </li>
            <li>They cut kind of weird</li>
            <li>Some of the tools are great, but some have dull blades that don&#x27;t cut cleanly, and some have bad hinges.</li>
            <li>This item is garbage, the tools are mediocre at best and the case is of poor quality.  </li>
            <li>these are not sharp and the case doesn&#x27;t close all the way, not to mention it looks different than pictured.</li>
            <li>i had other nail clippers and had trouble clipping off the nail but with the clippers that came in the case worked perfectly fine for me.</li>

            <li> Nice set of tools.  </li>
            <li> This is a really nice set.</li>
            <li> This was a great product for me when I needed a quick manicure on the go and did not have time to hit a nail salon.</li>
            <li> great product and shipped fast!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Customer service is remarkably courteous and truly outstanding.</li>
            <li> kind of okay.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves this set and the quality is off the charts good!  </li>
            <li> The tools are very strong and I love the case.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to give my husband a very much needed manicure lol</li>
            <li> These were very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I would not advise others to purchase these as they feel very cheap and do not do the job I was looking for....</li>
            <li> Very light weight and has all the essentials you need to do your nails</li>
            <li> The fit and finish are excellent and the stainless-steel is of a high caliber--given the price of the set.</li>
            <li> Everything looked good on this one and all the parts that are in there are very sharp and work perfectly.</li>
            <li> and i really love it.</li>
            <li> I can fix my nails at home and don&#x27;t need to go to nail salon any more.</li>
            <li> The case is protective and handsome.  </li>
            <li> but I have had better clipers.</li>
            <li> and this has everything to do that and more....</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say the case is cute or fashion forward, but does it need to be for the price?</li>
            <li> But, for the price I&#x27;m glad I received quality tools which I would rather have than a quality case.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> This stocking stuffer was so appropriate</li>
            <li> For starters, I&#x27;m not even sure what some of the items in the case do.</li>
            <li> The clippers, both fingernail and toenail clippers look stylish and nice, but the fingernail clipper feels a bit cheap.</li>
            <li> It looks like a better quality product in the images compared to what is delivered.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, there is a good reason it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> If the interior compartment had some more forethought in it</li>
            <li> The quality of the material is good although I would have liked to have it in stainless steel.</li>
            <li> All in all its a pretty good set.</li>
            <li> containing an incredible assortment of personal hygiene implements.</li>
            <li> the price, and the compact that keeps it all straight this was a good buy.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find that they are very nice quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I wanted some nice nail tools but wasn&#x27;t willing to spend a fortune.</li>
            <li> Handling of the tools is easy and comfortable on the hand.</li>
            <li> but I did, and I am glad - the items that need to be sharp - are, and it is easy to handle - it is a nice easy to carry around case that everything fits nicely into.  </li>
            <li> It has all the tools you need in a nice carrying case, couldn&#x27;t ask for much else.</li>
            <li> a dont feel smooth.</li>
            <li> Utensils are cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> It is a sturdy set with many useful accessories.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;couldn&#x27;t replace it or refund it since the order was filled by Amazon.\\</li>
            <li> and this is definitely a great product for those looking for some basic grooming implements.</li>
            <li> The metal is high quality and the case is nice and sturdy.  </li>
            <li> It works well in my purse and is easily accessible...</li>
            <li> In general a good product.</li>
            <li> Love these tools, they are sharp and good quality.</li>
            <li> These are great - sharp, precise, good quality (seem like they will last a while).</li>
            <li> Even straight would be better than concave.  </li>
            <li> If you try to call and complain, you will not get an answer and you cannot leave a message because the mailbox is full.  </li>
            <li> Fast ship, just as described I would get this again if I had to for sure</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent price, stylish and full set of tools.  </li>
            <li> This kit is adequate.  </li>
            <li> The vinyl will tear apart rather quickly.</li>
            <li> If you want high quality, spend more.</li>
            <li> Overall a great value in a manicure \\&quot;gift set.\\&quot; Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> A large selection of clippers to choose from and each tool is precise.</li>
            <li> It is made of cheap, very flexible metal, probably aluminum, which is unfinished.</li>
            <li> Really would recommend this over the cheap ones you may find at Target, Walmart, or others.</li>
            <li> Not at all worth the cost.  </li>
            <li> The tools inside the nice case are NOT the same ones that were pictured on the website or even the box the set arrived in.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because it looked sturdy, I liked the simple tan case, and it looked like something</li>
            <li> and it would easily be worth 2-3 times that amount.</li>
            <li> But the clippers feel cheap, I like your basic CVS ones better.</li>
            <li> The individual pieces are sturdy and handy when doing nails.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> The item arrived super fast, but, as soon as I opened the case</li>
            <li> this incredible set is at our side all the time, being used at least once a day!</li>
            <li> I like this kit very much.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how fast it came!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Broke before first use.  </li>
            <li> It was a very personalized gift!</li>
            <li> I cut myself twice when I first used it.</li>
            <li> I would have rated it higher.</li>
            <li> The other tools are nice enough - but you could probably get the same or better if you buy a better nail kit.</li>
            <li> It comes in such a cute, expensive looking case, it contains a lot of different tools to help you achieve a great mani/pedi, and the price is amazing for what you get.</li>
            <li> This is my first real manicure set and it has all the tools I need.  </li>
            <li> I had this nail kit for a long time and it&#x27;s quality is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> Cheap, but you get what you pay for apparently.</li>
            <li> Not top of the line, but for the price it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> All the pieces are exactly as pictured and are quite strong and look like a brushed stainless steel material.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, nice looking and work well.</li>
            <li> a easy open and close case it all comes in...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for anyone interested in home manicure/pedicure sets.</li>
            <li> The tools look very durable.  </li>
            <li> the case has held up very well.</li>
            <li> Given as gift and recipient appreciated the product.  </li>
            <li> up close, absolutely none.</li>
            <li> For the money I really don&#x27;t think you can beat this.</li>
            <li> the file isn&#x27;t very efficient.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not smooth and kind of shabby.</li>
            <li> He likes it very much, the look of it is very masculine and the case looks like a wallet.</li>
            <li> I do love the tools for getting under your cuticles and places that are hard to keep clean....</li>
            <li> Very cheap, and not worth the money.</li>
            <li> i chose only four stars because the only thing that is kind of flimsy is the tweezer other than that, i actually think the rest of the items are nice and well made.</li>
            <li> I was able to clean up with fine emery cloth without disrupting the cutting surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise</li>
            <li> the toenail clippers broke (that is, the metal of the main pin fatigued and snapped).  </li>
            <li> The quality of the tools inside are decent in consideration of the price.  </li>
            <li> all the tools inside which is the main reason I am giving it three stars.  </li>
            <li> personally think that it was made in the most cost-effective way possible, thus leaving the customer with a poor-quality, poor-value product.</li>
            <li> They are decent.</li>
            <li> For the price, this set is decent.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> executive look, and high quality.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I needed a new nail set, and I love angled cuticle trimmers that are  similar to regular nail clippers which this set has.</li>
            <li> if one likes to keep there finger nails clean and groomed i do recommend this and for the price that i spent i totally think it was worth it, also fast shipping</li>
            <li> Overall I can&#x27;t complain, worth the money I&#x27;d say.  </li>
            <li> It works, mostly, but not something you would buy to have for any longer than a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The tools in this set are cheap - the clippers are not sharp enough, the metal has uncomfortably rough edges even, and the whole thing looks very chincy in person.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this for myself, I instead bought it for my little brother who wants to be in the Navy, and he has to keep his nails clean.</li>
            <li> That said, the rest of the tools seem to be holding up, and case is pretty solid.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know what half of the things in the case are for but the ones I use work great and for the price, its hard to beat.</li>
            <li> It sounds dumb I know, but I kind of wish there were some sort of instructions to at indicate what the devices do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - I was relunctant to get a new set, our old - old one did almost everything -</li>
            <li> THE NAIL CARE PRODUCTS ARE SO LARGE FOR THE CASE THAT THE CASE CAN&#x27;T CLOSE PROPERLY.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this set.</li>
            <li> the case is soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> The pocket size is small and easily carried around in your bag.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this particular product.</li>
            <li> The case is kind of weird looking and the leather pieces that hold the tools in a little on the cheap side</li>
            <li> Brand new, this has gashes and marks, in the metal, somehow which were obviously unintentional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was given no other information on replacing it.  </li>
            <li> The only small gripes I have are that the case itself is so full that is rarely stays closed and</li>
            <li> This particular item is difficult to find in most retail outlets.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to explain, but they pretty much suck.</li>
            <li> I swear I&#x27;ve seen them selling these same sets at various street markets in asia for only a couple bucks, very tourist-trap kinds of places where I wouldn&#x27;t count on anything like this to be quality.  </li>
            <li> They cut kind of weird</li>
            <li> Some of the tools are great, but some have dull blades that don&#x27;t cut cleanly, and some have bad hinges.</li>
            <li> This item is garbage, the tools are mediocre at best and the case is of poor quality.  </li>
            <li> these are not sharp and the case doesn&#x27;t close all the way, not to mention it looks different than pictured.</li>
            <li> i had other nail clippers and had trouble clipping off the nail but with the clippers that came in the case worked perfectly fine for me.</li>
            <li> I replaced the clippers with some other clippers and now my set is complete.  </li>
            <li> It was also pretty cheap and ugly looking.</li>
            <li> It is small, compact, but smartly outfitted.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made, the scissors fell apart, the clippers are useless, and the other tools are not sharp or solid.</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to get to USA though.</li>
            <li> I can deal with both of these minor issues.</li>
            <li> No matter how you push on the two half&#x27;s, it springs back open.  </li>
            <li> because of the case have not lost a single item.</li>
            <li> The manicure parts were loose and I have no idea where each item goes.&lt;br /&gt;These were purchased for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> Took a very long time for delivery, from China!</li>
            <li> The case is red and black and the pieces inside seen chintzy.</li>
            <li> The instruments are sharp enough to cut the nails, but not too sharp to hurt your skin.</li>
            <li> The manicure case I received was black with a red stripe across it.</li>
            <li> The case he got though was black with a red stripe running diagonally across it.</li>
            <li> The tools are solid and heavy and the clippers are well made.</li>
            <li> the case came sooner than expected too</li>
            <li> After a week of so of use, the clasp on the case stopped holding it closed.</li>
            <li> Everything is sharp, well-made, and durable.</li>
            <li> The scissors and clippers are still sharp.</li>
            <li> so, it was expected!</li>
            <li> four stars because the tools were sharp from casting marks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite sharp.</li>
            <li> Sadly, the nail clippers are pretty crappy - all of them.</li>
            <li> The other one the \\&quot;leather\\&quot; is tearing away.  </li>
            <li> the clippers are a little rough...</li>
            <li> It works for what little amount I use it.</li>
            <li> The case is a little cheezee with the strap and interior.</li>
            <li> When using the clippers, the levers would bend before cutting through the nail and the blades on the toenail clipper was concave instead of convex.  </li>
            <li> The case is firm on the inside and the clasp is quite well made.</li>
            <li> cuts instead of firm ones.</li>
            <li> if it where shinny and not the dull sharp look I&#x27;d give 4 stars...</li>
            <li> i am super disappointed.  </li>
            <li> A couple of the small innards have broken, but only from use, and it doesn&#x27;t affect performance.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give 5 stars if it where in another case color...or at least had a black option....</li>
            <li> The whole set is in bad quality.</li>
            <li> They look dignified but don&#x27;t cut as well as some I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I never did like thin imitation leather.</li>
            <li> And the cutting tool is not sharp.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t just clip cleanly as absurd and a little picky as that sounds.</li>
            <li> the nail clippers were very dull.  </li>
            <li> Pure crap!</li>
            <li> The case is too thin and the clasp is too flimsy.  </li>
            <li> Both cases came to me with broken latches.</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied, a product of bad quality.</li>
            <li> Also, the levers ends are squared instead of rounded making the corners press into my fingertips uncomfortably.  </li>
            <li> wtf</li>
            <li> Just received the set today, and I am already disappointed by the poor quality of this.</li>
            <li> Too bad the provided carrying case does not close.  </li>
            <li> I was so disappointed by the quality that I don&#x27;t even have the energy to try to return it for a refund.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> love the great price, great product. I get to keep everything I need in a nice case. Works like a charm. Nothing beats it</li>
            <li> Yes, the case itself is an eyesore. But the stuff inside is great. Everything is sharp, well-made, and durable. Great for the price.</li>
            <li> this incredible set is at our side all the time, being used at least once a day!</li>
            <li> This particular item is difficult to find in most retail outlets. The fit and finish are excellent and the stainless-steel is of a high caliber--given the price of the set. Overall a great value in a manicure \\&quot;gift set.\\&quot; Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I like this kit very much. It contains everything you can ever imagine for your nail care. The pocket size is small and easily carried around in your bag.</li>
            <li> hola hace ya tiempo que encargue este articulo y no me a llegado quisiera saber porque y asi como este tengo varios que estan en las misma situcion</li>
            <li> This kit arrived promptly, and I am very happy with it.  It is packaged beautifully, and the quality is much better than anything I found around my shopping area for the price.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product, I can go everywhere with it. The price is very good and i really love it.</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied, a product of bad quality. I put 2 stars for all categories. I have not recommended this product to my friends</li>
            <li> I was going to give this four stars, but after not a lot of use. the toenail clippers broke (that is, the metal of the main pin fatigued and snapped).  I feel like that shouldn&#x27;t have happened.  That said, the rest of the tools seem to be holding up, and case is pretty solid.  This kit is adequate.  I wish the it were a bit sturdier.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how fast it came! The tools are very strong and I love the case. I can&#x27;t wait to give my husband a very much needed manicure lol</li>
            <li> realmente es un grupo muy completo. para una manicura perfecta.. no le hace falta nada más. compacto para viajar.  practico y sencillo</li>
            <li> When using the clippers, the levers would bend before cutting through the nail and the blades on the toenail clipper was concave instead of convex.  Even straight would be better than concave.  Also, the levers ends are squared instead of rounded making the corners press into my fingertips uncomfortably.  I don&#x27;t recommend the kit.</li>
            <li> The manicure set is perfect. It is small, compact, but smartly outfitted. The manicure instruments are of excellent quality. The case is lovely, and it comes packaged in an attractive gift box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer service is remarkably courteous and truly outstanding.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to get a set I could use on myself, as well as my boys, age 3 and 3 months. This set ended up in my recycling bin. It is garbage. Cheaply made, the scissors fell apart, the clippers are useless, and the other tools are not sharp or solid. Do not waste your money on this set. I was so disappointed by the quality that I don&#x27;t even have the energy to try to return it for a refund.</li>
            <li> These were very cheaply made. I would not advise others to purchase these as they feel very cheap and do not do the job I was looking for....</li>
            <li> Inferior quality, do not recommend purchasing.  Not at all worth the cost.  If you try to call and complain, you will not get an answer and you cannot leave a message because the mailbox is full.  Shame on you Amazon!</li>
            <li> The tools are good and completed. I can fix my nails at home and don&#x27;t need to go to nail salon any more.</li>
            <li> Overall I can&#x27;t complain, worth the money I&#x27;d say.  It has all the tools you need in a nice carrying case, couldn&#x27;t ask for much else.</li>
            <li> This item is garbage, the tools are mediocre at best and the case is of poor quality.  Within a month the case fell apart and now it&#x27;s just a big conglomerate of utensils taking up space in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> this was actually a gift to my mom.  last summer they lost everything in a monumental flood and who doesn&#x27;t need a manicure kit on a regular basis!  she said it is just perfect and the tools are quality, and it is a perfect size.</li>
            <li> The quality of the tools inside are decent in consideration of the price.  The case doesn&#x27;t closed up completely with all the tools inside which is the main reason I am giving it three stars.  I was going to get it as a gift now, I feel like I have to keep it because of the case.</li>
            <li> The manicure set is well made with a couple of extra tools that have come in handy.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again or recommend this item to anyone. Took a very long time for delivery, from China!</li>
            <li> I got this kit over a year ago and it&#x27;s still being used.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, and the compact that keeps it all straight this was a good buy.</li>
            <li> This looks like it will be a very nice set.  The tools look very durable.  I purchased these for boys in college.</li>
            <li> This set is very handy to throw in an overnight bag or throw in your purse and take with you. Very light weight and has all the essentials you need to do your nails all in one spot. Very reasonably priced for all the items included, great gift idea as well!</li>
            <li> containing an incredible assortment of personal hygiene implements. I will buy this brand again. Beautiful, useful, well-made and a great value</li>
            <li> Perfect size great quality. I have had it for about a year now. I have used almost all of the tools inside. the case has held up very well. because of the case have not lost a single item. Great quality great price</li>
            <li> this set has all the bells and whistles for do-it-yourself nail care - I was relunctant to get a new set, our old - old one did almost everything - but I did, and I am glad - the items that need to be sharp - are, and it is easy to handle - it is a nice easy to carry around case that everything fits nicely into.  good buy!</li>
            <li> This is the best set I have found - for almost any price.  I have bought much more expensive sets and they did not have the quality that this set has. I highly recommend this for anyone interested in home manicure/pedicure sets.</li>
            <li> i work abroad and this comes with me everywhere i go. executive look, and high quality. i recommend it for everyones suitcase for the airplane, but DONT bring this in your carry on bag. TSA thinks nail clippers are weapons of mass destruction.</li>
            <li> these are not sharp and the case doesn&#x27;t close all the way, not to mention it looks different than pictured.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 years now. The scissors and clippers are still sharp. The case is protective and handsome.  A couple of the small innards have broken, but only from use, and it doesn&#x27;t affect performance.  This is a solid buy.</li>
            <li> The item arrived super fast, but, as soon as I opened the case I was disappointed. The tools inside the nice case are NOT the same ones that were pictured on the website or even the box the set arrived in. Also, the box was busted open. I will say that the items do seem to be of nice quality, but, I didn&#x27;t get what I was expecting or wanting.</li>
            <li> I like it because it has every piece of a nail set that I wanted in a nail set but the quality is somewhat crappy.  I guess that&#x27;s what you get for the cost.  It works for what little amount I use it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because it looked sturdy, I liked the simple tan case, and it looked like something my friend would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came in an envelope with a box that was messed up and would not close. The case is red and black and the pieces inside seen chintzy. The clasp on the case will not stay closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not order this product again. Very cheap, and not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and what came was a 10 piece electronic candle set! wtf Now i have to go through all the hassle of returning it and i still dont have what i need. Good job</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  Good quality case and instruments.  Given as gift and recipient appreciated the product.  Arrived on promised schedule</li>
            <li> Looks nice but I have had better clipers. They cut kind of weird a dont feel smooth. Its like they need to be polished. I guess it matchs its price tag. I would try another set before this one.</li>
            <li> This item was intended as a gift.  The receiver seemed to greatly appreciate it and it will get a lot of use.</li>
            <li> Just received the set today, and I am already disappointed by the poor quality of this. Basically, it was designed to give the allusion of having a good amount of quality with it, yet up close, absolutely none. It is made of cheap, very flexible metal, probably aluminum, which is unfinished. Brand new, this has gashes and marks, in the metal, somehow which were obviously unintentional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Functional wise, I would give it a 70% rating. It works, mostly, but not something you would buy to have for any longer than a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally think that it was made in the most cost-effective way possible, thus leaving the customer with a poor-quality, poor-value product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not giving 3 stars because I dont like this item, I do like it! ....its just not a five star product...no biggie...you can&#x27;t complain when its so inexpensive.....I do love the tools for getting under your cuticles and places that are hard to keep clean....I like neat toes and this has everything to do that and more....the clippers are a little rough...only by texture tho....not a shiny metal...it reminds me of the army...but a easy open and close case it all comes in...I wouldn&#x27;t say the case is cute or fashion forward, but does it need to be for the price? It works well in my purse and is easily accessible...I would buy it again....I&#x27;m happy with it....if it where shinny and not the dull sharp look I&#x27;d give 4 stars...I&#x27;d give 5 stars if it where in another case color...or at least had a black option....but china made, and fair...</li>
            <li> They look dignified but don&#x27;t cut as well as some I have used in the past. In general a good product. It takes a long time to get to USA though.</li>
            <li> This was a great product for me when I needed a quick manicure on the go and did not have time to hit a nail salon.</li>
            <li> I debated on whether I should give this  3 or 4 stars.  It&#x27;s a decent price, stylish and full set of tools.  Some of the tools are great, some seem chincy. All in all its a pretty good set.</li>
            <li> Love these tools, they are sharp and good quality. The case is starting to fall apart, so that&#x27;s a bummer. But, for the price I&#x27;m glad I received quality tools which I would rather have than a quality case.</li>
            <li> This is my first real manicure set and it has all the tools I need.  The metal is high quality and the case is nice and sturdy.  I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> These are great - sharp, precise, good quality (seem like they will last a while). Really would recommend this over the cheap ones you may find at Target, Walmart, or others.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter to go along with all the mani/pedi stuff she got for Christmas and this set is wonderful.  It comes in such a cute, expensive looking case, it contains a lot of different tools to help you achieve a great mani/pedi, and the price is amazing for what you get.</li>
            <li> I would buy one of these again. It took quite a while to get here. I knew it was coming from HK though so, it was expected!</li>
            <li> THE CASE IS LARGER THAN PICTURED AND THE CASE IS A DIFFERENT COLOR. THE NAIL CARE PRODUCTS ARE SO LARGE FOR THE CASE THAT THE CASE CAN&#x27;T CLOSE PROPERLY. AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE BOXES THE CASE CAME IN WERE SPLIT OPENED BECAUSE THE CASE CAN&#x27;T CLOSE PROPERLY</li>
            <li> This product arrived promptly. After looking for a nice nail set that was also functional, of quality, and inexpensive I ran across these. I am extremely pleased. the case is soft to the touch. It feels like some type of foam padding underneath the leather (or what seems to be leather). The case is firm on the inside and the clasp is quite well made. All the pieces are exactly as pictured and are quite strong and look like a brushed stainless steel material. This product would make a nice gift for either a man or a woman.</li>
            <li> I wanted some nice nail tools but wasn&#x27;t willing to spend a fortune. I figured based on the price that these would just be kind of okay. I was surprised to find that they are very nice quality. The case is kind of weird looking and the leather pieces that hold the tools in a little on the cheap side but the tools themselves are great. Very sharp, nice looking and work well. For the money I really don&#x27;t think you can beat this. I think it was about $12 or so shipped when I bought it and it would easily be worth 2-3 times that amount.</li>
            <li> Got mine yesterday after waiting 4 weeks after ordering.  Broke before first use.  Utensils are cheaply made.  Do not recommend buying.  Pure crap!</li>
            <li> Received this as a gift from my husband. It is a sturdy set with many useful accessories. The tools are solid and heavy and the clippers are well made. So far, with the couple of times I have used it, it is a great product that keeps my nails looking great!</li>
            <li> This stocking stuffer was so appropriate and I included a note in his stocking that he would get a manicure and pedicure.  It was a very personalized gift!</li>
            <li> We returned this item-the packaging was torn and the cases did not lock well. In addition the color ordered was the color received. In addition the tools did not appear to be very good quality for the money.</li>
            <li> Nice variety of nail care products.&lt;br /&gt;Only four stars because the tools were sharp from casting marks. I was able to clean up with fine emery cloth without disrupting the cutting surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it&#x27;s a set everyone can find a tool for their needs.</li>
            <li> For starters, I&#x27;m not even sure what some of the items in the case do. It sounds dumb I know, but I kind of wish there were some sort of instructions to at indicate what the devices do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for the critique. The clippers, both fingernail and toenail clippers look stylish and nice, but the fingernail clipper feels a bit cheap. I don&#x27;t have claws for nails or anything like that, but both do not clip all that well. They are decent. They don&#x27;t just clip cleanly as absurd and a little picky as that sounds. The cuticle device works well. It&#x27;s quite sharp. I cut myself twice when I first used it. No big deal. I&#x27;d rather have it sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, I paid $12 for this. You get what you pay for. It looks like a better quality product in the images compared to what is delivered.</li>
            <li> The leather case is a nice touch. The kit does include a variety of nail care from the standard nail cutter, filer, and ingrown nail cutter. The instruments are sharp enough to cut the nails, but not too sharp to hurt your skin. The quality of the material is good although I would have liked to have it in stainless steel. Handling of the tools is easy and comfortable on the hand. For the price, it is a great deal.</li>
            <li> There are three pictures of this item in this listing, all showing a brownish case. The manicure case I received was black with a red stripe across it. It was also pretty cheap and ugly looking. Returned.</li>
            <li> These are all sturdy and well built for me, does a great job, heck I don&#x27;t even know what half of the things in the case are for but the ones I use work great and for the price, its hard to beat.</li>
            <li> The whole set is in bad quality. They&#x27;re not smooth and kind of shabby. And the cutting tool is not sharp.</li>
            <li> I had this nail kit for a long time and it&#x27;s quality is outstanding.  You have just about everything you need to take care of your nails and I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> price is good, but he clippers don&#x27;t clip well. the clippers don&#x27;t clip all the way across the nail. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again,</li>
            <li> The fit and finish of the tools is very good. A large selection of clippers to choose from and each tool is precise. The only small gripes I have are that the case itself is so full that is rarely stays closed and the file isn&#x27;t very efficient. I can deal with both of these minor issues.</li>
            <li> The tools in this set are cheap - the clippers are not sharp enough, the metal has uncomfortably rough edges even, and the whole thing looks very chincy in person.  I swear I&#x27;ve seen them selling these same sets at various street markets in asia for only a couple bucks, very tourist-trap kinds of places where I wouldn&#x27;t count on anything like this to be quality.  Regret buying this one.</li>
            <li> All the pieces are there, the case is nice.  But the clippers feel cheap, I like your basic CVS ones better.</li>
            <li> Nice set of tools.  Too bad the provided carrying case does not close.  The case is too thin and the clasp is too flimsy.  No matter how you push on the two half&#x27;s, it springs back open.  I emailed the company and received a prompt reply saying they \\&quot;couldn&#x27;t replace it or refund it since the order was filled by Amazon.\\&quot;  I contacted Amazon, and to their credit they, refunded the money and did not ask for the item back.  I was given no other information on replacing it.  I guess that&#x27;s why the only picture is of the case open!</li>
            <li> great product and shipped fast!! A+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this for myself, I instead bought it for my little brother who wants to be in the Navy, and he has to keep his nails clean. He likes it very much, the look of it is very masculine and the case looks like a wallet. The case he got though was black with a red stripe running diagonally across it.</li>
            <li> Both cases came to me with broken latches. The manicure parts were loose and I have no idea where each item goes.&lt;br /&gt;These were purchased for Christmas gifts. How do I resolve this problem.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I needed a new nail set, and I love angled cuticle trimmers that are  similar to regular nail clippers which this set has. Sadly, the nail clippers are pretty crappy - all of them. They don&#x27;t work that well. Where the cutters should come together and cut, doesn&#x27;t seem to have enough pressure. They make &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; cuts instead of firm ones. It&#x27;s hard to explain, but they pretty much suck. The other tools are nice enough - but you could probably get the same or better if you buy a better nail kit.</li>
            <li> Great selection of tools, all built/made to feel durable and of good quality. Add in the low price and this is definitely a great product for those looking for some basic grooming implements.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, there is a good reason it&#x27;s cheap. The vinyl will tear apart rather quickly. I regret purchasing these for gifts one year.</li>
            <li> i chose only four stars because the only thing that is kind of flimsy is the tweezer other than that, i actually think the rest of the items are nice and well made. i had other nail clippers and had trouble clipping off the nail but with the clippers that came in the case worked perfectly fine for me. if one likes to keep there finger nails clean and groomed i do recommend this and for the price that i spent i totally think it was worth it, also fast shipping the case came sooner than expected too</li>
            <li> I purchase 2 of these one for my teenage daughter and one for myself.  The clasp on one doesn&#x27;t even latch.  The other one the \\&quot;leather\\&quot; is tearing away.  This is the way they were shipped to us.  Quality is not what it was stated to be.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> iT WAS NICELY PACKAGED AND CAME QUICKLY AT A GREAT PRICE,  GOOD QUALITY AND WITH ALL THE RIGHT&lt;br /&gt;TOOLS TO DO THE JOB.</li>
            <li> just as it looks great!!!! Fast ship, just as described I would get this again if I had to for sure</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful set.  It&#x27;s compact and easy to use.  The individual pieces are sturdy and handy when doing nails.  I am very happy with the set and would recomend it to any one.  Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> After a week of so of use, the clasp on the case stopped holding it closed. Some of the tools are great, but some have dull blades that don&#x27;t cut cleanly, and some have bad hinges. Cheap, but you get what you pay for apparently.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves this set and the quality is off the charts good!  Beautiful case and &#x27;precision&#x27; made tools.  Definitely recommend this particular product.</li>
            <li> It is convenient to use, and very good at cleaning my face. I like it! I will recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Not top of the line, but for the price it&#x27;s good. If you want high quality, spend more. For the price, this set is decent.</li>
            <li> The clippers fell apart, but I like the set.  I replaced the clippers with some other clippers and now my set is complete.  for the the price for this set, I didn&#x27;t mind adding different clippers.</li>
            <li> the clippers don&#x27;t actually work and will tear at your nails and the items seem to bulge the case in some areas. DONT BUY THIS!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a really nice set. The price is wonderful and the case is quite neat. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> the nail clippers were very dull.  i am super disappointed.  i would not recommend to anyone.  I will not purchase from this company.</li>
            <li> Everything looked good on this one and all the parts that are in there are very sharp and work perfectly. The case is a little cheezee with the strap and interior. I never did like thin imitation leather. If the interior compartment had some more forethought in it I would have rated it higher.</li>
