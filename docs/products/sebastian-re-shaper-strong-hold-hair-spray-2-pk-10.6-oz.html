            <li>I spend  because they last longer and perform wonderfully!</li>
            <li>I have tried many and this is one of the better ones.  </li>
            <li>I normally love this product, so I h</li>
            <li>I love the product, One can of spray does not spray</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for many years.  </li>
            <li>My wife loves it and it was so easy to purchase it online.</li>
            <li>Shipped very quickly as well.</li>
            <li>My salon stopped carrying the line so am super glad to have found a seller on Amazon that is easy to work with</li>
            <li>Fantastic hairspray, holds but lets your hair move as well, it&#x27;s overly strong.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, go to the Sebastian website and buy the original product if you are in a state where it is sold.  </li>
            <li>Love it so much that I bought two of them...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many others and keep coming back to this one.  </li>
            <li>they are worth each dollar</li>
            <li>Sebastian had to stop making original Shaper hairspray products when the East Coast banned certain ingredients contained within.  </li>
            <li>This hairspray is just right.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for many years and no other brand of hairspray can compare.</li>
            <li>Hot water fixes it right up.</li>
            <li>Anyone out there who tries this probably likes the product, but I love it!  </li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair and by the end of the a 12 hours shift, it doesn&#x27;t do any better holding than most over the counter products.</li>
            <li>First off, one of the cans wont even spray.  </li>
            <li>What I love about this spray is that I use it not only as a hairspray but as a styling spray as well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sporadic, but I buy multiple cans at a time as I&#x27;ve had that experience more than once.  </li>
            <li>and it ships FAST!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who wants a hold that is pliable but not sticky (even in humid conditions!)</li>
            <li>Outside of getting a straightening treatment at upwards of $250 to $600, this is an easy, temporary fix.  </li>
            <li>It really held my style as I wanted it to.</li>
            <li>Pus, it was much cheaper than the stores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the extra $5.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this spray several times before, and this was the first time I have a problem with the spray.</li>
            <li>Finally an aerosol hairspray that really holds my hair in place all day!  </li>
            <li>It has the right amount of hold that keeps my hair stiff but doesn&#x27;t leave it crusty.</li>

            <li> It is a little tacky before it dries but after that I have a very natural looking hold.</li>
            <li> When I was a young woman, hairspray felt a little like glue and was used to keep beehive hairdos in place through hurricane winds (no A/C in cars, for instance).  </li>
            <li> Just got my crazy hair straightened, so I might not need this product any more.  </li>
            <li> Buy 6, as long as you are at it.  </li>
            <li> It holds up well too for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands over the years and always go back to this.</li>
            <li> I noticed other reviewers having the same problem.</li>
            <li> Second, it weighs your hair down</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is Sebastian is infamous for a less than stellar nozzle on their hairspray cans.  </li>
            <li> The others either don&#x27;t hold well enough, or are too stiff.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use any other product to get my hair styled the way I like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had ANY other hairspray work against humidity, sweat and heat like this one does.  </li>
            <li> and you have to keep letting off of it and then pressing down again</li>
            <li> It is a little sticky, but I can handle that for the quality it delivers.</li>
            <li> It is stiff, but if something is going to withstand Louisiana humidity, it will have to be stiff.  </li>
            <li> I think it may have been related to the extreme cold temperatures that it had to travel in to get to me.</li>
            <li> Not really sure that I like this product.</li>
            <li> If it does, its a small amount</li>
            <li> thick and sticky.</li>
            <li> And send one to me :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a deal breaker, but it is annoying.  </li>

            <li> Not really sure that I like this product. I have fine thin hair and by the end of the a 12 hours shift, it doesn&#x27;t do any better holding than most over the counter products. It also makes my hair feel like straw.</li>
            <li> Love this product and will definitley buy it again.</li>
            <li> Fantastic hairspray, holds but lets your hair move as well, it&#x27;s overly strong.</li>
            <li> thick and sticky. I do not like this Sebastian product</li>
            <li> Best hair spray ever! I have been using this for many years and no other brand of hairspray can compare. I have tried other brands over the years and always go back to this. It is a little tacky before it dries but after that I have a very natural looking hold. You can still run your fingers through your hair.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hairspray.  I&#x27;ve tried many, many others and keep coming back to this one.  The others either don&#x27;t hold well enough, or are too stiff.  This hairspray is just right.  The only reason I knocked a star off is the can itself.  For whatever reason, it has a sticky residue on the outside of it.  It&#x27;s not a deal breaker, but it is annoying.  Occasionally, the nozzle will stick or develop a coating over it. Hot water fixes it right up.</li>
            <li> It really held my style as I wanted it to.</li>
            <li> First off, one of the cans wont even spray.  If it does, its a small amount and you have to keep letting off of it and then pressing down again and you don&#x27;t get enough to do anything.  Second, it weighs your hair down and then I did not notice that it did anything different for the humidity than my regular hair spray.  Wont order ever again.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and it was so easy to purchase it online. Pus, it was much cheaper than the stores.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, great product. Have used it for years and will order it agin. Very good in humid weather. I don&#x27;t have to use any other product to get my hair styled the way I like it.</li>
            <li> What I love about this spray is that I use it not only as a hairspray but as a styling spray as well.  Whether I&#x27;m using a curling iron or a flat iron, this works well with both - just spray a section, style and go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a must!!!!</li>
            <li> Just got my crazy hair straightened, so I might not need this product any more.  HOWEVER!!!!  If I had NOT had it done, this is the GO TO  hairspray for humidity.  I&#x27;ve never had ANY other hairspray work against humidity, sweat and heat like this one does.  It is stiff, but if something is going to withstand Louisiana humidity, it will have to be stiff.  Outside of getting a straightening treatment at upwards of $250 to $600, this is an easy, temporary fix.  Really outstanding.</li>
            <li> Great price, better than I can get anywhere in CT.</li>
            <li> These products are great! just love them! they are worth each dollar I spend  because they last longer and perform wonderfully!</li>
            <li> If you want a hairspray that isn&#x27;t sticky and your hair can still move, this is the product for you!  I have tried many and this is one of the better ones.  Hopefully they keep it on the market for a while, without changing it.</li>
            <li> This is the best hairspray I have found. It has the right amount of hold that keeps my hair stiff but doesn&#x27;t leave it crusty. The smell is good too. My husband likes it also.</li>
            <li> I normally love this product, so I h This time when it came, it would not spray.  I think it may have been related to the extreme cold temperatures that it had to travel in to get to me.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this spray several times before, and this was the first time I have a problem with the spray. I noticed other reviewers having the same problem. I am finding it a nuisance to try and unclog it every time I spray, but will just persevere for now.</li>
            <li> I love the product, One can of spray does not spray</li>
            <li> Sebastian had to stop making original Shaper hairspray products when the East Coast banned certain ingredients contained within.  Sebastian Re-Shaper was born.  It isn&#x27;t even close to the same product.  When I was a young woman, hairspray felt a little like glue and was used to keep beehive hairdos in place through hurricane winds (no A/C in cars, for instance).  This product could give \\&quot;Hairnet\\&quot; a run for its money.  You couldn&#x27;t get a comb or brush through this stuff if your modeling career depended on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So - if you want hair that feels like a helmet, or you need to hold your style in place while sky-diving - buy this product.  Otherwise, go to the Sebastian website and buy the original product if you are in a state where it is sold.  If you aren&#x27;t, talk one of your friends or relatives in a sold-in state into taking delivery for you and go pick it up - or send them $5 to forward the package to your home.  It&#x27;s worth the extra $5. Buy 6, as long as you are at it.  And send one to me :(</li>
            <li> This hairspray is great because it&#x27;s not too sticky but holds well and you can still brush through your hair after you spray it on.  It holds up well too for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray! and you can&#x27;t beat this two for one deal. Shipped very quickly as well. great product.</li>
            <li> The hair spray is good, what you expect. The seller shipping them wrapped in bubble paper with an adhesive backing. The glue from the back simply does not come off the can. They need to fix that. However, I did complain to seller and they returned my money. So the seller is truly excellent and very responsive.</li>
            <li> Finally an aerosol hairspray that really holds my hair in place all day!  Love it so much that I bought two of them...</li>
            <li> This hair spray is excellent if you like it to stay were you spray it. It is a little sticky, but I can handle that for the quality it delivers.</li>
            <li> Anyone out there who tries this probably likes the product, but I love it!  I&#x27;ve been using this for many years.  The only issue I have is Sebastian is infamous for a less than stellar nozzle on their hairspray cans.  It&#x27;s sporadic, but I buy multiple cans at a time as I&#x27;ve had that experience more than once.  My salon stopped carrying the line so am super glad to have found a seller on Amazon that is easy to work with and it ships FAST!  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who wants a hold that is pliable but not sticky (even in humid conditions!)</li>
            <li> The best hairspray that holds strong without a tacky feeling. An excellent product for a very reasonable price. Great stuff</li>
