            <li>Some came out nice, some were too thin and one of the piece has a pierce in it but</li>
            <li>I was super surprised at how small they really are compared to the pictures.</li>
            <li>They are really thick and will not rip easily.</li>
            <li>the molds were just too small and did not really put in the definition og what it was making and that made it hard to paint if your not using color acrylic, I did however found it good to use when your using acrylic color gel.</li>

            <li> , all received well, just don&#x27;t like that they sit so flat on the nail,</li>

            <li> ordered it a long time ago</li>

            <li> Will order other items from them again.</li>
            <li> The mold kit is too thin and not deep enough to make any art...</li>
            <li> besides that a waste of money..</li>
            <li> its like the molds are too small.</li>
            <li> The forms were way too small to do anything with.</li>
            <li> but they are a tad bit too small.</li>
            <li> Ill buy different designs in future,again from this company !</li>
            <li> I found that some were to thin to use.</li>
