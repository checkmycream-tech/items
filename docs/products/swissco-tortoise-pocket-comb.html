            <li>I also bought 3 of the Kent brand, and even though the Kent comb is better than most, these are better than the Kents when you have them side by side</li>
            <li>I favor this more compact length.  </li>

            <li> , I bought 4 other similar combs.  </li>

            <li> and they sold out the American worker down the river.</li>
            <li> After 2 or 3 days in my back pocket they snap in half.  </li>

            <li> Pocket comb that fits in your pocket and looks fancy...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU HAVE ARRIVED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this if you want a small pocket comb you can actually fit in your pocket wearing tighter jeans and pants (no I am not a hipster).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How it&#x27;s handmade plastic I will never know...but she&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> I have only used all fine tooth combs for years, and could no longer find them locally, I ordered one of these and a couple ACE brand ones, the ACE ones are now made out of a brittle plastic and the teeth are sharp. This comb cost about double the price of the ACE comb, but you can see and feel the differance in quality. Plus the tortoise shell color is kind of cool. Well worth the price. I also bought 3 of the Kent brand, and even though the Kent comb is better than most, these are better than the Kents when you have them side by side</li>
            <li> This is the best comb I&#x27;ve ever had. I had one for about three years before I had to replace it. In my back pocket every day, in a hot sweaty metal fab shop. Used with heavy pomade and other hair agents,,,,,, just amazing, well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The item itself is well made and if I had the right hair and tiny fingers it would have been perfect, However,the item I ordered was to be a seven inch comb. The item I received was a 4 inch comb. I returned it for a replacement with a note and the original order and the item I received back was another 5 inch comb. I did not pursue it further but I will not order from this company again.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent comb.  The price is high for a comb but well worth it.  It will last for a long time and is very smooth on the scalp.</li>
            <li> Great price and nice product. Teeth on the comb rounded, unlike most combs that are sharp. Quick service and well packaged.</li>
            <li> This color comb is almost impossible to find now days. This one is made from a heavy weight plastic which will hold up to back pants pocket use. Also nicely finished. Will order a back up.</li>
            <li> I like these handmade combs so much that I ordered several more (moustache and dressing combs).  Although I&#x27;m not a rich man, having this comb in my pocket makes me feel like one.  You just have to hold it to appreciate the workmanship and quality.  A must for those who appreciate quality without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> wish it had wider teeth.</li>
            <li> This comb is great for its purpose assuming I would carry it around with me in my back pocket, but I was concerned I would lose it so she stays in the drawer in her protective cover.</li>
            <li> Great  pocket  comb....take it to work  to fix my hair....and works great ..the needles don&#x27;t bend and neither poke my head I bought three  just incase I lose one.....or two</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how comfortable this comb is to use.  I will never buy any  other type. I did not realize that the Goody combs I had been using were just not as comfortable as they should have been.</li>
            <li> 2015 March 16:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparison of 5 Tortise Shell Pocket Combs:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a search to find a replacement for the poor quality Conair tortise shell pocket combs that I find in my local drugstore, I bought 4 other similar combs.  Here is a comparison of all 5:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Group 1 - Cheapest and lowest quality:&lt;br /&gt;  A) Conair&lt;br /&gt;  B) Caravan France&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Group 2 - Midrange price and medium quality:&lt;br /&gt;  A) Caravan France, De Luxe, Hand Finished&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Group 3 - Highest price and best quality&lt;br /&gt;  A) Swissco, Hand Made&lt;br /&gt;  B) Kent Hand Made, Sawcut, OT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1A. Conair ($2.49 US) (Fine/Coarse Teeth).  At 4 7/8th inches (very close to 5), it is the 2nd longest after the Caravan models.  The Conair ties with the Caravan France for the sharpest teeth.  They can scratch the scalp.  The Conairs are very brittle.  After 2 or 3 days in my back pocket they snap in half.  For this reason I have to consider them disposable.  So although the cost per comb is the lowest, I go through a lot of them and so they are actually rather expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1B. Caravan France ($3.00 US) (Fine/Coarse teeth or All teeth medium).  At 5 1/2 inches, this comb and the other Caravan are longest of the 5.  The teeth appear very similar to those of the Conair and feel similarly sharp on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2A. Caravan France De Luxe Hand Finished Pocket Comb, Model No. 90391 ($7.00 US) (Fine/Coarse Teeth). Same length as the other Caravan model (5 1/2 in.).  This comb is more comfortable on the scalp than1A and 1B but is sharper feeling than 3A and 3B.  These combs have the best tortise shell coloring and marbling of the 5 types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3A. Swissco ($7.50) (All teeth medium). 4 5/8th inches, the 3rd longest.  The teeth are noticably more comfortable on the scalp than the Group 1 &amp; Group 2 combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3B. Kent ($9.00 US) (Fine/Coarse Teeth).  At 4 3/8th inches this is the shortest of the 5.  I favor this more compact length.  Very similar to the Swissco with it&#x27;s more comfortable teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All are very close in width: about 1 1/4 inches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on my small sampling of only 1 or 2 combs of each type, the coloring and marbling of the tortise shell is best on the Caravan France De Luxe Hand Finished.  The coloring and marbling on the other 4 is all about the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: The combs in each group are very similar.  As you might expect, for the most part, the quality improves as the price increases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation: If you haver read this far you probably want a decent comb. In that case case, skip Group 1.  Unless you lose your pocket combs a lot, choose a comb from Group 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you add in shipping charges, a comb which is priced a dollar or two less than another, may actually cost more in total.wissco with it&#x27;s more comfortable teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All are very close in width: about 1 1/4 inches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on my small sampling of only 1 or 2 combs of each type, the coloring and marbling of the tortise shell is best on the Caravan France De Luxe Hand Finished.

            <li> I know what you are thinking... A combs a comb. Wrong. Well kind of wrong. This is really sturdy and you actually feel like you are holding something. Unlike most other combs I have had, this doesnt feel like I could easily break it if I dropped it.</li>
            <li> This is my new go-to comb since greed took over ACE and they sold out the American worker down the river. Took me way too long to find this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comb is a really nice replacement, although not as large as the ACE I used to use. It doesn&#x27;t tear, rip, scratch, scrape, or otherwise lacerate the scalp like the chinese ACE combs do. I haven&#x27;t used this one long enough to see how well it holds up, but none of my combs, even the American ACE I was so fond of didn&#x27;t last forever since I carried them in my back pocket on my pants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comb could be a little larger, but other than that it&#x27;s a really great comb.</li>
            <li> If you may say a comb is beautiful this one qualifies and the prices is very reasonable just hope it doesn&#x27;t break</li>
            <li> What can I say?  It&#x27;s a comb... but a well made comb, and I carry it in my pocket every day.  Would recommend it for hair or in my case, for beard combing throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Very nicely finished, wouldn&#x27;t change a thing. Expensive but worth it, should last a long time.</li>
            <li> If you think a comb is just a comb, you need to try this.  I wanted something that would comb smoothly and evenly, without pointing tines that could dig into my scalp.  This comb is a beauty.  I had each member of my family try it and each said &amp;#34;Wow!  I want one of these!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I had previously been using a wal-mart cheapo comb and I didn&#x27;t that this $7 one would offer any advantages over it but it actually did. I find that less detritus gets stuck in the teeth, it has a flatter aspect, I like the turtle shell effect. 4 stars because I still don&#x27;t understand why a piece of  plastic has to be $7.</li>
