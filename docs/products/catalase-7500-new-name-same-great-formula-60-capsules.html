            <li>I don&#x27;t know why amazon.com is selling this item because it surely does not work to change gray hair growth.</li>

            <li> I have been using this product as well as the shampoo/conditioner for a little over a month.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> DO NOT buy this and waste</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> This product did NOT work for me-don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This is useless as Catalase is broken down in the digestive system long before it might possibly reach hair follicles.</li>
            <li> My advice is give it at least three months or don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I take 2 capsules with a bottle of lukewarm water mix with a tablespoon of blackstrap molasses and wheatgrass powder, together with biotin and B complex, altogether.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A total waste of money! I used this product religiously for 3 months and NOTHING happened. My hair is as grey as it ever was! So disappointing.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 4th bottle and have seen no sign of my hair returning to its natural color at the root.  Product claims results will be visible after 90 days of use and I&#x27;m working n 120 days!</li>
            <li> It is a slow process but at 55 years old I see clear strands of new black hair appearing on the sides of my face near my sideburns where they used to be white. A slow process that has taken a year but it appears to be working.</li>
            <li> I´m just started&lt;br /&gt;I don´t know if it works&lt;br /&gt;I hope it does</li>
            <li> I can truly say that this product has definitely helped with my gray hair! My hair dresser even made a comment on how much my hair has improved. I  couldn&#x27;t help but share my secret with her! I take 3 pills in the morning and 3 pills in the evening.</li>
            <li> I have used 6 bottles of this religiously and it had zero effect. No grays turned dark. Grays kept multiplying at usual or in fact at a faster rate (yes strange!!). This is a real review unlike some others here; look at my older reviews of other gray hair products. DO NOT buy this and waste money.&lt;br /&gt;I will never recommend this to anyone. It is a scam.</li>
            <li> My hair has gone from snow white to the reddish brown it was before I turned gray !</li>
            <li> No comment @ this moment koz I did not see any change....</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything that I could see even after the recommended 3 months</li>
            <li> I have been taking Go Away Gray for three years.My hair was totally white. My natural red hair has returned in the back and is slowly returning near my face. I am pleased with the result. The new improved formula has speeded the process.&lt;br /&gt;AH Wooster, OH</li>
            <li> I have been using this product as well as the shampoo/conditioner for a little over a month.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell if there has been any improvement, though my girlfriend says she definitely sees a minor change.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve decided to continue the regimen and will report after 3 months.</li>
            <li> Husband swears by these products, but as the &#x27;&#x27;observer&#x27;&#x27;....I see NO difference.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the addition of more catalase made me nervous and irritable.</li>
            <li> This is useless as Catalase is broken down in the digestive system long before it might possibly reach hair follicles.</li>
            <li> This product Did not work  and i used the shampoo conditioner and pills  for two months&lt;br /&gt;WASTE OF MONEY</li>
            <li> I tried 2bottles plus now. Can feels it increases the volume of my hair. Didnt spot any grey hair now after using. I take 2 capsules with a bottle of lukewarm water mix with a tablespoon of blackstrap molasses and wheatgrass powder, together with biotin and B complex, altogether.</li>
            <li> Didn &#x27;t see the gray go away</li>
            <li> I have taken 3 bottles as directed for the past 3 months with no positive results. This product did NOT work for me-don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> My Wife uses it. She has some color to her white hair. She continues to use it. I have white hair and beard,I just live with it.</li>
            <li> I use Go Away Gray Capsules, Shampoo and Conditioner.  I have lost all of the gray hair and now my hair looks darker with highlights.  My hairdresser has commented on how young my hair looks.  I recently recommended these products to my niece who already had almost a full head of salt&amp;pepper hair; she is 20 years younger then I am and looks much older because of her gray hair.  I am sure she will begin using these products soon.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell a whole lot, been taking 4 months.</li>
            <li> Tried first two months with friends leftovers and bought more to continue process. It did not work for me or my friend. I don&#x27;t know why amazon.com is selling this item because it surely does not work to change gray hair growth. Also, to maintain the restored color, you would have to keep taking this for the rest of your life. Some ingredients can cause serious health issues, such as an overdose of copper or manganese.</li>
            <li> Works!  And has more Catalase than other brands.</li>
            <li> I took this literally for months. It did absolutely nothing for reversing, or preventing new grays from coming in. It did however make my hair thicker and brought in a lot of &amp;#34;baby hair&amp;#34; in the front. If it were not so costly I would continue taking it for that reason.</li>
            <li> Tried it for several months no change.</li>
            <li> Have used it for a month now and didnt see any effect</li>
            <li> Yes it did., it is a fine product.</li>
            <li> Gradually works after taking for 4-6 weeks. Never full hair color but better than white.</li>
            <li> Think it works.  I was just starting to notice a few grays due to stress, but now I am not noticing any.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered fast. I have been using for three months and my hair is starting to show signs of returning back to the original color. I&#x27;m very suspect about these natural cures but have to say this one seems to be working. I use the shampoo and conditioner along with the capsules. My advice is give it at least three months or don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> just ok,no real result&#x27;s?</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use this product because the first and only day I took it, I was unable to sleep.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 6 months with no results.  I know to have patience with dietary supplements, but this product should have shown some results by now (given the money I&#x27;ve be paying). I will continue to take 2 capsules everyday until this last bottle is empty. However, I&#x27;m so disappointed. I&#x27;m going to move on to another method (drinking beverages from a copper cup).</li>
            <li> The key with this product is continuous use. You can&#x27;t just use and be done with it. I have seen my grays not come in as fast though.</li>
