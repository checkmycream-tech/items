            <li>I liked this smell as well.</li>
            <li>received these products in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>received these products in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>Nice selection of scents.</li>
            <li>However, the product smelled so nice</li>
            <li>The result is a superior soap that&#x27;s healthier for your skin and better for our planet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each</li>
            <li>As a blogger I received a complementary sample of this product in exchange for my honest &amp; unbiased review.</li>
            <li>Nice soap.</li>
            <li>The result is a superior soap that&#x27;s healthier for your skin and better for our planet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each</li>
            <li>All of my opinions are 100% my own.  </li>
            <li>All of my opinions are 100% my own.  </li>
            <li>These soaps are creamy, they lather up really nicely</li>
            <li>Lavender is my favorite scent of the two because it is so relaxing to the senses, and my skin still smells amazing after the shower for many more hours to come!  </li>
            <li>Again, the ingredients were fantastic and I felt good about using this on my skin.</li>
            <li>set would be lovely in a gift basket as it comes beautifully wrapped in an organza bag (exactly as shown).</li>
            <li>The sampler makes a great gift too, all pretty in</li>
            <li>Luscious Lavender is my favorite scent of the two because it is so relaxing to the senses, and my skin still smells amazing after the shower for many more hours to come!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of soaps!  </li>
            <li>When I was sent these, I thought I wouldn&#x27;t be able to keep from inhaling the scent with my face in the bag, breathing in, breathing in.</li>
            <li>so you can try a number of blends to find your favorite (or in my case, that would be all of them).</li>
            <li>One of the things that I love about this soap were the ingredients.</li>
            <li>To me, lavender is my favorite smelling.</li>
            <li>It gives the nicest scent to your skin without overwhelming</li>
            <li>I love them all I don&#x27;t have a favorite.</li>
            <li>Many of the handmade gift sets arrive with each bar smelling like a combination of all the scents and with these that isn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
            <li>it overall a great buy!</li>
            <li>I sent a set to my friend&#x27;s Mom for her 97th birthday because she is in a care facility and can not have many items on her side of the room.  </li>
            <li>I love them and have made them my &amp;quot;Go-To-Gift&amp;quot; for my girlfriends who have everything.  </li>
            <li>I love that they are made in Newport Beach.  </li>
            <li>These soaps are infused with so many luxurious scents &amp; ingredients that you feel like a queen when you use them.</li>
            <li>but that was not my favorite of the bunch.</li>
            <li>My favorite ended up being the Sea Breeze.</li>
            <li>Samples last and are perfect to find your favorite one.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for in a soap?  </li>
            <li>Overall, these are wonderful soaps and</li>
            <li>and they have a lovely herbal scent.  </li>
            <li>It is scented with a blend of Lavender, Oakmoss and Fir.&lt;br /&gt;Golden Crown is considered Keomi&#x27;s Most Luxurious Soap.  </li>
            <li>The additional benefits are that they are vegan &amp; eco friendly for all of our animal &amp; earth activist princess friends as well!</li>
            <li>They seem very mild on my skin (but be sure to read the ingredients to ensure you are not using one that contains ingredients you react to).</li>
            <li>want to buy more just to be able to enjoy each and</li>
            <li>but i loved these came in a little elegant pouch great product to give out for party favors or gift</li>
            <li>It is also a nice treat for oneself if you are interested in trying four handmade soaps before choosing your favorite.</li>
            <li>Iâ€™m about ready to cry because these smell so good.</li>
            <li>Each soaps scent is unique and elegantly blended.</li>
            <li>Breeze - Refresh Your Skin like a Cool Sea Breeze!</li>
            <li>Breeze - Refresh Your Skin like a Cool Sea Breeze!</li>
            <li>Product arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>It was so fresh with the cleanest nicest most refreshing scent ever.</li>
            <li>In the shower they&#x27;ve got a really strong soothing scent, but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger afterwards.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to be totally honest with you, i&#x27;m not normally the kind of person who who even think about Organic soap BUT that being said, i gotta tell you, this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>My husband keeps asking me where  the new diffuser is because they smell so strong, in a good</li>
            <li>However, I used the Luscious Lavender with a body puff and it lathered just fine.  </li>
            <li>and I think the colors of each variety accurately reflects the intended scent.  </li>
            <li>I register for alerts and free samples.</li>
            <li>is, quite possibly, the finest soap you have ever experienced.</li>
            <li>you only do one thing in your life that brings your body and soul joy..</li>
            <li>I love that these soaps are 100% vegan, gluten free, cruelty free, sulfate/paraben/petrochemical-free, and contain no artificial fragrances or colors.  </li>
            <li>The soaps don&#x27;t over lather by themselves, but I think that&#x27;s because of being sulfate free.  </li>
            <li>All important things to me.</li>
            <li>I am constantly on the hunt of a great quality soap,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>Because I want to make sure that there are no additives, no colors, no preservatives and no artificial scents.  </li>

            <li>The complexity of each of the Pure Aromatherapy-grade Essential Oils adds something wonderful and unique to each bar.</li>
            <li>But I was pretty impressed to find out that not only the Keomi Skincare Organic Handmade Soaps have no preservatives, but they also contain no artificial colors or scents, sulfate free, nut free, and have no animal</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;I got free for exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The entire shower smelled amazing from the time those two bar of soaps entered my bathroom!  </li>
            <li>Each Soap is uniquely fragrant and smells</li>
            <li>Each Soap is uniquely fragrant and smells amazing!&lt;br</li>
            <li>These smell absolutely amazing, and there&#x27;s no artificial fragrances; this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>love handmade stuff, but I also love how professionally these are packaged.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t have an overly strong smell, like the lavender one, but it had a very gentle clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Packaging is sweet but will not buy again</li>
            <li>You will smell clean and fresh after using their bars of soap.  </li>

            <li>Our fine soaps are super-fatted and derive their beautiful rich sudsy lather naturally, leaving your skin clean and moisturized, supple and soft and never dried out.</li>
            <li>so I con not say much about it other than it smells incredible and arrived on time ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li>I loved that the soaps had a more natural smell and did not smell so generic like store brands tend to.</li>
            <li>All of those demands are pretty hard to find, and on top of all of that I am also looking for a great quality soap that is not too expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best of all, it does not bother my sensitive nose, which is a huge problem for me that I usually get from lotions and soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Individually they are quite lovely!</li>
            <li>I purchased a soap sample set for my very particular daughter who lives in a tiny apartment in NYC and she loved them.</li>
            <li>I received a gift set in a cute little silver mesh, drawstring bag from Keomi Skincare in exchange for my honest feedback and opinion.</li>
            <li>Golden Crown infused with calendula flowers and oils of orange, fir and frankincense.</li>
            <li>If you are a fan of Lush soaps then I would say that you will LOVE these.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The two soaps that I received were the Golden Crown and Luscious Lavender.  </li>
            <li>The Keomi Skincare soap comes in a variety of kinds, and you can purchase it right now on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I first received the Keomi Skincare Organic Handmade Soap- Set of Two in the box, I knew right away that that box contained soap, because I can smell the amazing scent from outside the box.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t have a strong smell at all, but left my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>All of the natural oils infused in each bar leave your skin so soft, I honestly don&#x27;t even need lotion afterwards.</li>
            <li>I would expect to find these in Whole Foods or Central Market, quite honestly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They smell good enough to eat and they leave your skin soft, pampered and relaxed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;They smell good enough to eat and they leave your skin soft, pampered and relaxed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>personal favorite is the Golden Crown.  </li>
            <li>I did like it very much</li>
            <li>Thanks Keomi !  </li>
            <li>I find many commercial soaps to be drying, but not these soaps.</li>
            <li>I am pretty picky and read every ingredient that is on that package.  </li>
            <li>If you like the smell of essential oils, you will love these.</li>
            <li>When I first received the package of the Sample Set of Handmade soap by Keomi, I could smell the wonderfulness of them.  </li>
            <li>skin will feel soft, smooth and silky after using this soap.  </li>
            <li>It felt just as good as the Green Tea Goddess soap</li>
            <li>Talk about an all natural fragrance that fills your entire bathroom for many weeks!  </li>
            <li>enjoy using handmade soaps because of the way they make my skin feel, the scents are amazing and they seem to last for a long time.</li>
            <li>The ingredients used are those I would feel comfortable using to make my own products including rich oils and butters (shea butter, coconut oil, olive oil, cocoa butter etc.), dead sea clay,  and essential</li>
            <li>Omg they smell so go and leave my skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I frequently make my own bath and body products such as melts, scrubs, and lotions.</li>
            <li>This will help the soap last longer, and help prevent it from becoming a liquid soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li>The scents did feature the aromatherapy benefits and helped to relax me as I took my shower since the scent was strong and lasting.</li>
            <li>But just because it smells great it doesn&#x27;t mean that it is high quality.  </li>
            <li>Pure oils, pure ingredients, pure everything.</li>
            <li>It is made with Pure Olive Oil, Avocado Oil, Safflower Oil, Coconut Oil, Palm Kernel Oil, Grape Seed Oil, Apricot and Rice Bran.  </li>
            <li>Made with Pure Olive Oil, Palm Oil, Sunflower Oil, Avocado Oil, Apricot Oil, Coconut Oil, Grape See Oil, Safflower Oil, Rice Bran and Cocoa Butter.  </li>
            <li>Another thing I love about these soaps is that they don&#x27;t melt away fast or dry out fast.</li>
            <li>Let your skin become silky soft by using these.skin will feel soft, smooth and silky after using this soap.  </li>
            <li>It felt like I was washing my hands with a gentle sunrise.</li>
            <li>this was a gentle soap.</li>
            <li>It really made it stand out.</li>
            <li>In the package together the 4 is a bit much &amp; not at all what I would recommend.</li>
            <li>In advance I expected the Luscious Lavender to be my favorite scent</li>
            <li>Currently Keomi is offering a 2 and 4 bar sample set for FREE.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is strongly recommended that when using Keomi&#x27;s soaps, that you store them in a dry place away from a stream of water or under a counter with metal pipes.  </li>
            <li>Amazing little soaps!</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed using these soaps and will definitely consider purchasing them again in the future.</li>
            <li>was expecting some cute little bars of soap you know the ones that don&#x27;t have a smell...</li>
            <li>These were all natural and my skin appreciated that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so the whole family loves using them: we even use them on the baby who has extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>(the one reason I&#x27;m not a huge fan of most body</li>
            <li>I live in Yorba Linda and come to Newport often as do all of my out of state guests which I have often.  </li>
            <li>every one of these power packed live renewing scents!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m telling you now, If you are reading this review..</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Soft!</li>

            <li>The All Natural, Organic ingredients ensure that our soap is gentle enough for people with skin sensitivities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>The one thing that jumped out at me immediately was how natural the ingredients were to each soap</li>
            <li>These are all natural no chemicals preservatives.</li>
            <li>My sample pack did contain some of each of the 4 scents that Keomi Skincare offers.</li>
            <li>but I was surprised.</li>
            <li>NATURAL by Keomi Skinc</li>
            <li>The soaps are naturally colored</li>
            <li>Help your skin stay young looking.  </li>
            <li>Let your skin become silky soft by using these.</li>
            <li>At first, the soap was a little hard to spread on a washcloth but after the first use, it spread so easily.</li>
            <li>They are also full size bars that last forever!(many soap sets have smaller sample-sized bars and charge the same amount as this set).</li>
            <li>The Golden Crown which was rich in a lemon scent, Green Tea Goddess which smelled like green tea and was very earthy, Luscious lavender which smelled like lavender, and sea breeze which was reminiscent of a day at the beach with the ocean-like notes to it.</li>
            <li>I really like these soaps especially the Green Tea Goddess and the Golden Crown.</li>
            <li>The other nice thing about these bars is that they are not drying to the skin, in fact I had less itchy &amp; dry skin than ever.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Golden Crown - Doubly Infused with Calendua &amp; White Tea Saponified Oils of Pure Olive, Palm Kernel, Avocado, Grapeseed &amp; Oleic Safflower, plus Shea Butter; Calendula &amp; White Tea Extracts; Oils of Orange, Rosewood &amp; Frankincense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The abundance of oils, the obvious care, the natural healing properties.....</li>
            <li>had the chance to try out four types: Luscious Lavender, Green Tea Goddess, Golden Crown, and Sea Breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luscious</li>
            <li>The set included four soaps: Green Tea Goddess, Luscious Lavender, Golden Crown and Sea Breeze.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would love to see these bar of soaps last a little longer, as they seemed to run out quicker than other soaps I have owned before.  </li>
            <li>They are moisturizing and do not dry my skin</li>
            <li>fine soaps are carefully crafted in small batches using the cold-process method to retain the benefits of the living oils.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These fine soaps are carefully crafted in small batches using the cold-process method to retain the benefits of the living oils.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not special really.</li>
            <li>She can try one at a time in her little soap dish (her bathroom is the size of a hall closet) and have a new one to try without waiting to go through a big old bar that gets all gummy and gross.</li>
            <li>The scents are a truly delicate blend of natural flowers &amp; herbs in a very pleasing medley.</li>

            <li> received these products in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Nice selection of scents.</li>

            <li> All of my opinions are 100% my own.  </li>
            <li> These soaps are creamy, they lather up really nicely</li>
            <li> Lavender is my favorite scent of the two because it is so relaxing to the senses, and my skin still smells amazing after the shower for many more hours to come!  </li>
            <li> Again, the ingredients were fantastic and I felt good about using this on my skin.</li>
            <li> set would be lovely in a gift basket as it comes beautifully wrapped in an organza bag (exactly as shown).</li>
            <li> The sampler makes a great gift too, all pretty in</li>
            <li> Luscious Lavender is my favorite scent of the two because it is so relaxing to the senses, and my skin still smells amazing after the shower for many more hours to come!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of soaps!  </li>
            <li> When I was sent these, I thought I wouldn&#x27;t be able to keep from inhaling the scent with my face in the bag, breathing in, breathing in.</li>
            <li> so you can try a number of blends to find your favorite (or in my case, that would be all of them).</li>
            <li> One of the things that I love about this soap were the ingredients.</li>
            <li> To me, lavender is my favorite smelling.</li>
            <li> It gives the nicest scent to your skin without overwhelming</li>
            <li> I love them all I don&#x27;t have a favorite.</li>
            <li> Many of the handmade gift sets arrive with each bar smelling like a combination of all the scents and with these that isn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
            <li> it overall a great buy!</li>
            <li> I sent a set to my friend&#x27;s Mom for her 97th birthday because she is in a care facility and can not have many items on her side of the room.  </li>
            <li> I love them and have made them my &amp;quot;Go-To-Gift&amp;quot; for my girlfriends who have everything.  </li>
            <li> I love that they are made in Newport Beach.  </li>
            <li> These soaps are infused with so many luxurious scents &amp; ingredients that you feel like a queen when you use them.</li>
            <li> but that was not my favorite of the bunch.</li>
            <li> My favorite ended up being the Sea Breeze.</li>
            <li> Samples last and are perfect to find your favorite one.</li>
            <li> What more could you ask for in a soap?  </li>
            <li> Overall, these are wonderful soaps and</li>
            <li> and they have a lovely herbal scent.  </li>
            <li> It is scented with a blend of Lavender, Oakmoss and Fir.&lt;br /&gt;Golden Crown is considered Keomi&#x27;s Most Luxurious Soap.  </li>
            <li> The additional benefits are that they are vegan &amp; eco friendly for all of our animal &amp; earth activist princess friends as well!</li>
            <li> They seem very mild on my skin (but be sure to read the ingredients to ensure you are not using one that contains ingredients you react to).</li>
            <li> want to buy more just to be able to enjoy each and</li>
            <li> but i loved these came in a little elegant pouch great product to give out for party favors or gift</li>
            <li> It is also a nice treat for oneself if you are interested in trying four handmade soaps before choosing your favorite.</li>
            <li> Iâ€™m about ready to cry because these smell so good.</li>
            <li> Each soaps scent is unique and elegantly blended.</li>

            <li> Breeze - Refresh Your Skin like a Cool Sea Breeze!</li>
            <li> Product arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> It was so fresh with the cleanest nicest most refreshing scent ever.</li>
            <li> In the shower they&#x27;ve got a really strong soothing scent, but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be totally honest with you, i&#x27;m not normally the kind of person who who even think about Organic soap BUT that being said, i gotta tell you, this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> My husband keeps asking me where  the new diffuser is because they smell so strong, in a good</li>
            <li> However, I used the Luscious Lavender with a body puff and it lathered just fine.  </li>
            <li> and I think the colors of each variety accurately reflects the intended scent.  </li>
            <li> I register for alerts and free samples.</li>
            <li> is, quite possibly, the finest soap you have ever experienced.</li>
            <li> you only do one thing in your life that brings your body and soul joy..</li>
            <li> I love that these soaps are 100% vegan, gluten free, cruelty free, sulfate/paraben/petrochemical-free, and contain no artificial fragrances or colors.  </li>
            <li> The soaps don&#x27;t over lather by themselves, but I think that&#x27;s because of being sulfate free.  </li>
            <li> All important things to me.</li>
            <li> I am constantly on the hunt of a great quality soap,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> Because I want to make sure that there are no additives, no colors, no preservatives and no artificial scents.  </li>
            <li> received this product for free in exchange for my review.  </li>

            <li> But I was pretty impressed to find out that not only the Keomi Skincare Organic Handmade Soaps have no preservatives, but they also contain no artificial colors or scents, sulfate free, nut free, and have no animal</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;I got free for exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The entire shower smelled amazing from the time those two bar of soaps entered my bathroom!  </li>
            <li> Each Soap is uniquely fragrant and smells</li>
            <li> Each Soap is uniquely fragrant and smells amazing!&lt;br</li>
            <li> These smell absolutely amazing, and there&#x27;s no artificial fragrances; this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> love handmade stuff, but I also love how professionally these are packaged.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have an overly strong smell, like the lavender one, but it had a very gentle clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Packaging is sweet but will not buy again</li>
            <li> You will smell clean and fresh after using their bars of soap.  </li>

            <li> so I con not say much about it other than it smells incredible and arrived on time ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> I loved that the soaps had a more natural smell and did not smell so generic like store brands tend to.</li>
            <li> All of those demands are pretty hard to find, and on top of all of that I am also looking for a great quality soap that is not too expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Best of all, it does not bother my sensitive nose, which is a huge problem for me that I usually get from lotions and soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Individually they are quite lovely!</li>
            <li> I purchased a soap sample set for my very particular daughter who lives in a tiny apartment in NYC and she loved them.</li>
            <li> I received a gift set in a cute little silver mesh, drawstring bag from Keomi Skincare in exchange for my honest feedback and opinion.</li>
            <li> Golden Crown infused with calendula flowers and oils of orange, fir and frankincense.</li>
            <li> If you are a fan of Lush soaps then I would say that you will LOVE these.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The two soaps that I received were the Golden Crown and Luscious Lavender.  </li>
            <li> The Keomi Skincare soap comes in a variety of kinds, and you can purchase it right now on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I first received the Keomi Skincare Organic Handmade Soap- Set of Two in the box, I knew right away that that box contained soap, because I can smell the amazing scent from outside the box.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have a strong smell at all, but left my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> All of the natural oils infused in each bar leave your skin so soft, I honestly don&#x27;t even need lotion afterwards.</li>
            <li> I would expect to find these in Whole Foods or Central Market, quite honestly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They smell good enough to eat and they leave your skin soft, pampered and relaxed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;They smell good enough to eat and they leave your skin soft, pampered and relaxed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> personal favorite is the Golden Crown.  </li>
            <li> I did like it very much</li>
            <li> Thanks Keomi !  </li>
            <li> I find many commercial soaps to be drying, but not these soaps.</li>
            <li> I am pretty picky and read every ingredient that is on that package.  </li>
            <li> If you like the smell of essential oils, you will love these.</li>
            <li> When I first received the package of the Sample Set of Handmade soap by Keomi, I could smell the wonderfulness of them.  </li>
            <li> skin will feel soft, smooth and silky after using this soap.  </li>
            <li> It felt just as good as the Green Tea Goddess soap</li>
            <li> Talk about an all natural fragrance that fills your entire bathroom for many weeks!  </li>
            <li> enjoy using handmade soaps because of the way they make my skin feel, the scents are amazing and they seem to last for a long time.</li>
            <li> The ingredients used are those I would feel comfortable using to make my own products including rich oils and butters (shea butter, coconut oil, olive oil, cocoa butter etc.), dead sea clay,  and essential</li>
            <li> Omg they smell so go and leave my skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I frequently make my own bath and body products such as melts, scrubs, and lotions.</li>
            <li> This will help the soap last longer, and help prevent it from becoming a liquid soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li> The scents did feature the aromatherapy benefits and helped to relax me as I took my shower since the scent was strong and lasting.</li>
            <li> But just because it smells great it doesn&#x27;t mean that it is high quality.  </li>
            <li> Pure oils, pure ingredients, pure everything.</li>
            <li> It is made with Pure Olive Oil, Avocado Oil, Safflower Oil, Coconut Oil, Palm Kernel Oil, Grape Seed Oil, Apricot and Rice Bran.  </li>
            <li> Made with Pure Olive Oil, Palm Oil, Sunflower Oil, Avocado Oil, Apricot Oil, Coconut Oil, Grape See Oil, Safflower Oil, Rice Bran and Cocoa Butter.  </li>
            <li> Another thing I love about these soaps is that they don&#x27;t melt away fast or dry out fast.</li>
            <li> Let your skin become silky soft by using these.skin will feel soft, smooth and silky after using this soap.  </li>
            <li> It felt like I was washing my hands with a gentle sunrise.</li>
            <li> this was a gentle soap.</li>
            <li> It really made it stand out.</li>
            <li> In the package together the 4 is a bit much &amp; not at all what I would recommend.</li>
            <li> In advance I expected the Luscious Lavender to be my favorite scent</li>
            <li> Currently Keomi is offering a 2 and 4 bar sample set for FREE.  </li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is strongly recommended that when using Keomi&#x27;s soaps, that you store them in a dry place away from a stream of water or under a counter with metal pipes.  </li>
            <li> Amazing little soaps!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using these soaps and will definitely consider purchasing them again in the future.</li>
            <li> was expecting some cute little bars of soap you know the ones that don&#x27;t have a smell...</li>
            <li> These were all natural and my skin appreciated that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so the whole family loves using them: we even use them on the baby who has extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> (the one reason I&#x27;m not a huge fan of most body</li>
            <li> I live in Yorba Linda and come to Newport often as do all of my out of state guests which I have often.  </li>
            <li> every one of these power packed live renewing scents!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m telling you now, If you are reading this review..</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>

            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> The one thing that jumped out at me immediately was how natural the ingredients were to each soap</li>
            <li> These are all natural no chemicals preservatives.</li>
            <li> My sample pack did contain some of each of the 4 scents that Keomi Skincare offers.</li>
            <li> but I was surprised.</li>
            <li> NATURAL by Keomi Skinc</li>
            <li> The soaps are naturally colored</li>
            <li> Help your skin stay young looking.  </li>
            <li> Let your skin become silky soft by using these.</li>
            <li> At first, the soap was a little hard to spread on a washcloth but after the first use, it spread so easily.</li>
            <li> They are also full size bars that last forever!(many soap sets have smaller sample-sized bars and charge the same amount as this set).</li>
            <li> The Golden Crown which was rich in a lemon scent, Green Tea Goddess which smelled like green tea and was very earthy, Luscious lavender which smelled like lavender, and sea breeze which was reminiscent of a day at the beach with the ocean-like notes to it.</li>
            <li> I really like these soaps especially the Green Tea Goddess and the Golden Crown.</li>
            <li> The other nice thing about these bars is that they are not drying to the skin, in fact I had less itchy &amp; dry skin than ever.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Golden Crown - Doubly Infused with Calendua &amp; White Tea Saponified Oils of Pure Olive, Palm Kernel, Avocado, Grapeseed &amp; Oleic Safflower, plus Shea Butter; Calendula &amp; White Tea Extracts; Oils of Orange, Rosewood &amp; Frankincense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The abundance of oils, the obvious care, the natural healing properties.....</li>
            <li> had the chance to try out four types: Luscious Lavender, Green Tea Goddess, Golden Crown, and Sea Breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luscious</li>
            <li> The set included four soaps: Green Tea Goddess, Luscious Lavender, Golden Crown and Sea Breeze.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would love to see these bar of soaps last a little longer, as they seemed to run out quicker than other soaps I have owned before.  </li>
            <li> They are moisturizing and do not dry my skin</li>
            <li> fine soaps are carefully crafted in small batches using the cold-process method to retain the benefits of the living oils.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These fine soaps are carefully crafted in small batches using the cold-process method to retain the benefits of the living oils.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not special really.</li>
            <li> She can try one at a time in her little soap dish (her bathroom is the size of a hall closet) and have a new one to try without waiting to go through a big old bar that gets all gummy and gross.</li>
            <li> The scents are a truly delicate blend of natural flowers &amp; herbs in a very pleasing medley.</li>
            <li> Each soap is uniquely infused with a variety of Organic Herbs, Dead Sea Clay &amp; Salt, Seaweed and French Green Clay.</li>

            <li> In my little gift set, I received four different scented soaps: Sea Breeze, Golden Crown, Green Tea Goddess, and Luscious Lavender.  </li>
            <li> Plus, I noticed that the next day when I was ready to use the bar of soap again, it tends to stick pretty well to my shower caddy and is hard to pick up and use without trying harder than usual to &amp;#34;un-glue&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> One of the benefits of this set over other ones on Amazon is that the soaps are individually wrapped so they maintain their individual fragrances.</li>

            <li> I have noticed a big difference in my skin since switching to these soaps, no more dry, itchy skin after showers!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> To be fair, Keomi contacted me to say if I did not consider it an excellent product to contact them and I did. They offered a refund .&lt;br /&gt; Sending it back felt like a hassle&lt;br /&gt;Sample set or not, this should be advertised as soap slivers.&lt;br /&gt;So little soap is in the package. I suspect I can use a piece three times...maximum .&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is nice but nothing special&lt;br /&gt;Packaging is sweet but will not buy again</li>
            <li> Absolutely lovely product with beautiful packaging.  It arrived promptly and with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> When I was sent these, I thought I wouldn&#x27;t be able to keep from inhaling the scent with my face in the bag, breathing in, breathing in. Um, still kinda doin&#x27; it. Wow. These smell absolutely amazing, and there&#x27;s no artificial fragrances; this is the real deal. Pure oils, pure ingredients, pure everything.Everything comes from nature! All of the natural oils infused in each bar leave your skin so soft, I honestly don&#x27;t even need lotion afterwards. I have very sensitive skin and this is so soothing and calming. Where were these when i was covered in mosquito bites all summer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love handmade stuff, but I also love how professionally these are packaged. I would expect to find these in Whole Foods or Central Market, quite honestly. I&#x27;ve got Sea Breeze, which is scented with lavender, oak moss and fir. Golden Crown infused with calendula flowers and oils of orange, fir and frankincense. Green Tea Goddess with organic green tea, nettle, shavegrass, comfrey root and oils of clary sage, orange and clove. And the oh so Luscious Lavender with a blend of three lavenders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent clings oh so subtly to your skin, allowing you to reap the aromatherapy benefits but it doesn&#x27;t hit you over the head. The abundance of oils, the obvious care, the natural healing properties..... I can&#x27;t recommend these enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the sampler is a great place to start so you can try a number of blends to find your favorite (or in my case, that would be all of them). The sampler makes a great gift too, all pretty in it&#x27;s lil bag!</li>
            <li> The one thing that jumped out at me immediately was how natural the ingredients were to each soap I had the chance to try. The Keomi Skincare soap comes in a variety of kinds, and you can purchase it right now on Amazon. They offer gift sets and these would make PERFECT gift sets for Mother&#x27;s Day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the chance to try out four types: Luscious Lavender, Green Tea Goddess, Golden Crown, and Sea Breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luscious Lavender&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say this was one of the best smelling soaps of the bunch. It smelled like a wonderful lavender garden and it made bath time so relaxing to me. One of the things that I love about this soap were the ingredients. You won&#x27;t find any unnatural items in these soaps. These were all natural and my skin appreciated that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Green Tea Goddess&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved this on my skin the best! It didn&#x27;t have a strong smell at all, but left my skin feeling smooth. Another thing I love about these soaps is that they don&#x27;t melt away fast or dry out fast. I&#x27;m currently obsessed with green tea and love drinking this stuff (I swear it has kept away colds) and so why not put it on my skin?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Golden Crown&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was also a wonderful smelling soap. It felt like I was washing my hands with a gentle sunrise. Again, the ingredients were fantastic and I felt good about using this on my skin. It wasn&#x27;t harsh at all either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sea Breeze&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh this was a gentle soap. I liked this smell as well. It felt just as good as the Green Tea Goddess soap I especially loved though that this had olive oil as an ingredient. It really made it stand out. It didn&#x27;t have an overly strong smell, like the lavender one, but it had a very gentle clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall these are a must purchase for your own bathroom or if you want to make a lady in your life very happy. To me, lavender is my favorite smelling. It gives the nicest scent to your skin without overwhelming (the one reason I&#x27;m not a huge fan of most body washes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products in exchange for my honest review.

            <li> Amazing little soaps! Omg they smell so go and leave my skin feeling clean and soft. Give these a try!</li>
            <li> This product I got as a gift so I con not say much about it other than it smells incredible and arrived on time ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> Great soap! Nice selection of scents. Great customer service.</li>
            <li> I register for alerts and free samples. They smell really good I love them all I don&#x27;t have a favorite. Good quality soaps handcrafted. These are all natural no chemicals preservatives. I love this soap set! The scents are refreshing and delicious but not overbearing. They are gender neutral so the whole family loves using them: we even use them on the baby who has extremely sensitive skin. I have noticed a big difference in my skin since switching to these soaps, no more dry, itchy skin after showers! One of the benefits of this set over other ones on Amazon is that the soaps are individually wrapped so they maintain their individual fragrances. Many of the handmade gift sets arrive with each bar smelling like a combination of all the scents and with these that isn&#x27;t an issue. They are also full size bars that last forever!(many soap sets have smaller sample-sized bars and charge the same amount as this set). This set would make a great gift since it comes decoratively packaged. it overall a great buy! Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;I got free for exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> Love them !  I sent a set to my friend&#x27;s Mom for her 97th birthday because she is in a care facility and can not have many items on her side of the room.  I figured she could put them in her drawers with her clothes to make them smell good.  I sent them through Amazon so I did not physically see them.  I ordered a set for me to see what I sent.  I love them and have made them my &amp;quot;Go-To-Gift&amp;quot; for my girlfriends who have everything.  Perfect for travel too!  They are amazing !!!  Thank you.  I love that they are made in Newport Beach.  I live in Yorba Linda and come to Newport often as do all of my out of state guests which I have often.  Thanks Keomi !  Constance Bonanni</li>
            <li> My guests loved the product!</li>
            <li> Unlike some other soaps, these soaps are organic and you can see the natural ingredients within each soap. The Golden Crown which was rich in a lemon scent, Green Tea Goddess which smelled like green tea and was very earthy, Luscious lavender which smelled like lavender, and sea breeze which was reminiscent of a day at the beach with the ocean-like notes to it.The soaps were fairly smaller in size than those that you can purchase at the grocery store or beauty store and lasted about 7 days each. However, the product smelled so nice and it was a treat each time to use this product. At first, the soap was a little hard to spread on a washcloth but after the first use, it spread so easily. The scents did feature the aromatherapy benefits and helped to relax me as I took my shower since the scent was strong and lasting. I loved that the soaps had a more natural smell and did not smell so generic like store brands tend to. These soaps are great for treating yourself on those stressful days and feeling like you are at the spa.</li>
            <li> Product arrived very quickly. The soaps smell absolutely wonderful. I have not used any, as I purchased it as a gift. I&#x27;m sure that they are as wonderful as they smell.</li>
            <li> There is something truly indulgent feeling about a really good bath time product. It just makes you feel pampered &amp; cared for in a way that a regular plain bar of soap just doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m not saying that there&#x27;s anything wrong with a bar of ivory but it&#x27;s not special really. Keomi Skincare has just the solution with their handmade soaps. These soaps are infused with so many luxurious scents &amp; ingredients that you feel like a queen when you use them. The additional benefits are that they are vegan &amp; eco friendly for all of our animal &amp; earth activist princess friends as well! The specifics for these soaps are below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Organic Handmade Luxury Soap for Men &amp; Women&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is, quite possibly, the finest soap you have ever experienced. As part of the Keomi Skincare Signature Collection these truly superior handmade soaps are the epitome of Luxury! Each Soap is uniquely fragrant and smells amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our fine soaps are carefully crafted in small batches using the cold-process method to retain the benefits of the living oils. The soap&#x27;s base is a rich blend of over 10 USDA certified organic vegetable, fruit and seed oils, plus shea and cocoa butters. The complexity of each of the Pure Aromatherapy-grade Essential Oilsadds something wonderful and unique to each bar. The result is a superior soap that&#x27;s healthier for your skin and better for our planet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each Keomi Skincare soap is made by hand using only the highest quality ingredients. Each soap is uniquely infused with a variety of Organic Herbs, Dead Sea Clay &amp; Salt, Seaweed and French Green Clay. Our fine soaps are super-fatted and derive their beautiful rich sudsy lather naturally, leaving your skin clean and moisturized, supple and soft and never dried out. The All Natural, Organic ingredients ensure that our soap is gentle enough for people with skin sensitivities.&lt;br /&gt;The varieties are :&lt;br /&gt;Golden Crown , Sea Breeze, Luscious Lavender, Green Tea&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  Organic &amp; Vegan*  No Animal Testing&lt;br /&gt;*  No Colorants&lt;br /&gt;*  No Preservatives&lt;br /&gt;*  Sulphate Free&lt;br /&gt;*  No Petroleum Byproducts&lt;br /&gt;*  Nut Free&lt;br /&gt;*  No GMO&lt;br /&gt;*  Made in USA  &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this package arrived in the mail I was a bit confused as to the contents because I could actually smell it before I opened it. My sample pack did contain some of each of the 4 scents that Keomi Skincare offers. In the package together the 4 is a bit much &amp; not at all what I would recommend. The soaps are just all heavily scented as they should be so I would advise to using one of them at a time. Individually they are quite lovely! The scents are a truly delicate blend of natural flowers &amp; herbs in a very pleasing medley. If you are a fan of Lush soaps then I would say that you will LOVE these. In advance I expected the Luscious Lavender to be my favorite scent but I was surprised. I did like it very much but that was not my favorite of the bunch. My favorite ended up being the Sea Breeze. I was blown away by how amazing it smelled. I wanted to crawl into a big pillow of it! It was so fresh with the cleanest nicest most refreshing scent ever. I can not rave about this scent enough. The other nice thing about these bars is that they are not drying to the skin, in fact I had less itchy &amp; dry skin than ever. This stuff is really awesome! As a blogger I received a complementary sample of this product in exchange for my honest &amp; unbiased review. All thoughts &amp; opinions expressed here are mine &amp; mine alone.</li>
            <li> Nice soap. Samples last and are perfect to find your favorite one. I like em all.</li>
            <li> I got this for a friend and she loved it! She lived all the different types of soaps there were for her to try. They smell really good and leave the ski. Soft! Loved it!</li>
            <li> HANDMADE SOAP ORGANIC &amp; ALL NATURAL by Keomi Skinc&lt;br /&gt;Ok, This threw me for a loop!&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting some cute little bars of soap you know the ones that don&#x27;t have a smell...&lt;br /&gt;Well, Let me tell you I was WRONG!&lt;br /&gt;First the packaging was so sweet!&lt;br /&gt;It came in a little pouch and every one of these soaps smell AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t even pick just one I like because they all captivate my soul!&lt;br /&gt;I want to buy more just to be able to enjoy each and every one of these power packed live renewing scents!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m telling you now, If you are reading this review..&lt;br /&gt;If you only do one thing in your life that brings your body and soul joy.. then let it be buying this set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â€ª#â€Žnaturalskincareâ€¬ http://amzn.com/b00pefm5iq</li>
            <li> I received a gift set in a cute little silver mesh, drawstring bag from Keomi Skincare in exchange for my honest feedback and opinion. Inside the bag were 4 neatly wrapped soap bars.  These soaps are aromatherapy grade and if you smell them, you will see why.  They smell so wonderful. I love that these soaps are 100% vegan, gluten free, cruelty free, sulfate/paraben/petrochemical-free, and contain no artificial fragrances or colors.  What more could you ask for in a soap?  In my little gift set, I received four different scented soaps: Sea Breeze, Golden Crown, Green Tea Goddess, and Luscious Lavender.  Iâ€™m about ready to cry because these smell so good. Iâ€™m not even exaggerating.  The soaps are naturally colored and I think the colors of each variety accurately reflects the intended scent.  The soaps don&#x27;t over lather by themselves, but I think that&#x27;s because of being sulfate free.  However, I used the Luscious Lavender with a body puff and it lathered just fine.  Overall, these are wonderful soaps and this sample set is the perfect introduction to the company and would make a great gift for just about anyone.</li>
            <li> I received a homemade sample set of these Keomi soaps for review.  The set included four soaps: Green Tea Goddess, Luscious Lavender, Golden Crown and Sea Breeze. The sample set combined is similar to one generous block of soap with each soap being similar  sized to a &amp;#34;guest soap&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each soap is beautiful to look at and smells amazing. I find many commercial soaps to be drying, but not these soaps. They seem very mild on my skin (but be sure to read the ingredients to ensure you are not using one that contains ingredients you react to). I really like these soaps especially the Green Tea Goddess and the Golden Crown. Each soaps scent is unique and elegantly blended. I frequently make my own bath and body products such as melts, scrubs, and lotions. I have not yet made soap at home (though I did take a class in soap making). The ingredients used are those I would feel comfortable using to make my own products including rich oils and butters (shea butter, coconut oil, olive oil, cocoa butter etc.), dead sea clay,  and essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set would be lovely in a gift basket as it comes beautifully wrapped in an organza bag (exactly as shown). It is also a nice treat for oneself if you are interested in trying four handmade soaps before choosing your favorite. Each sample has lasted several showers and hand washes.</li>
            <li> Treat yourself and your skin to these amazing handmade soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy using handmade soaps because of the way they make my skin feel, the scents are amazing and they seem to last for a long time. All important things to me. It&#x27;s like a spa day just using specialty soaps.&lt;br /&gt;Recently I received a sample pack of soaps from the Keomi Signature Collection.

            <li> I am a huge fan of soaps!  Every time I walk around the mall I am looking for that little shop that carries specialty soaps, and I can smell the scent of the soaps from far away, which draws in each and every time.  I am constantly on the hunt of a great quality soap,&lt;br /&gt;and I am pretty picky and read every ingredient that is on that package.  Why?  Because I want to make sure that there are no additives, no colors, no preservatives and no artificial scents.  All of those demands are pretty hard to find, and on top of all of that I am also looking for a great quality soap that is not too expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first received the Keomi Skincare Organic Handmade Soap- Set of Two in the box, I knew right away that that box contained soap, because I can smell the amazing scent from outside the box.  But just because it smells great it doesn&#x27;t mean that it is high quality.  But I was pretty impressed to find out that not only the Keomi Skincare Organic Handmade Soaps have no preservatives, but they also contain no artificial colors or scents, sulfate free, nut free, and have no animal testing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire shower smelled amazing from the time those two bar of soaps entered my bathroom!  Talk about an all natural fragrance that fills your entire bathroom for many weeks!  Best of all, it does not bother my sensitive nose, which is a huge problem for me that I usually get from lotions and soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two soaps that I received were the Golden Crown and Luscious Lavender.  They both smell so delicious, and my sensitive skin absolutely loved them!  They are moisturizing and do not dry my skin whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love to see these bar of soaps last a little longer, as they seemed to run out quicker than other soaps I have owned before.  Plus, I noticed that the next day when I was ready to use the bar of soap again, it tends to stick pretty well to my shower caddy and is hard to pick up and use without trying harder than usual to &amp;#34;un-glue&amp;#34; them from the shower caddy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Luscious Lavender is my favorite scent of the two because it is so relaxing to the senses, and my skin still smells amazing after the shower for many more hours to come!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for my review.  All of my opinions are 100% my own.  I hope that this review was helpful in making your purchase decision.ious Lavender is my favorite scent of the two because it is so relaxing to the senses, and my skin still smells amazing after the shower for many more hours to come!

            <li> I&#x27;m going to be totally honest with you, i&#x27;m not normally the kind of person who who even think about Organic soap BUT that being said, i gotta tell you, this stuff is amazing.  The  picture is one of their lavender soaps and it&#x27;s beautiful, smells amazing and works just as good. If you&#x27;re looking for some amazing soap, this is the one</li>
            <li> These soaps are creamy, they lather up really nicely and they have a lovely herbal scent.  In the shower they&#x27;ve got a really strong soothing scent, but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger afterwards. If you like the smell of essential oils, you will love these. I really enjoyed using these soaps and will definitely consider purchasing them again in the future.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful thing to buy from a company that took the time to ask if their product satisfied my expectations. I purchased a soap sample set for my very particular daughter who lives in a tiny apartment in NYC and she loved them. She can try one at a time in her little soap dish (her bathroom is the size of a hall closet) and have a new one to try without waiting to go through a big old bar that gets all gummy and gross. (her words)&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again for myself from Keomi and would recommend them as a source for gifts.</li>
            <li> i was quiet impress with the quality i am not big on bar soaps but i loved these came in a little elegant pouch great product to give out for party favors or gift</li>
            <li> When I first received the package of the Sample Set of Handmade soap by Keomi, I could smell the wonderfulness of them.  Each bar is extremely aromatic.  My husband keeps asking me where  the new diffuser is because they smell so strong, in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sample Set contains 4 different scents.&lt;br /&gt;Sea Breeze. Refresh your skin with this bar of soap. It contains Pure Olive Oil, Palm Kernel Oil, Avocado, Grape Seed, and Coconut Oil, as well as Cocoa Butter, Dead Sea Salt and Dead Sea Clay, Seaweed.  It is scented with a blend of Lavender, Oakmoss and Fir.&lt;br /&gt;Golden Crown is considered Keomi&#x27;s Most Luxurious Soap.  It is made with Pure Olive Oil, Avocado Oil, Safflower Oil, Coconut Oil, Palm Kernel Oil, Grape Seed Oil, Apricot and Rice Bran.  Infused with Calendula Flowers, Oils of Orange, Fir and Frankincense.&lt;br /&gt;Luscious Lavender.  Relax and unwind with Lavender.

Keep them in a soap dish that drains, not pools.  And when using the soaps, don&#x27;t rub directly on body, but use a washcloth, hands or other material.  This will help the soap last longer, and help prevent it from becoming a liquid soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your skin will feel soft, smooth and silky after using this soap.  It is not drying at all.  The fragrance will linger on for awhile, so keep that in mind if you plan to use perfume afterwards.  You will smell clean and fresh after using their bars of soap.
