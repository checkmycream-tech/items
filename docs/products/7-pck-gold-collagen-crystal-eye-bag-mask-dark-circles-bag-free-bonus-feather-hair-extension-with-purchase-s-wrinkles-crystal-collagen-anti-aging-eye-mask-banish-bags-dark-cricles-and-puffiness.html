            <li>I just wonder how Amazon allowed this kind of business using their store front !!</li>
            <li>they would be very good if they were thicker.  </li>

            <li>didn&#x27;t see a difference in my under eye bags, but the pads did feel good and stuck on easy</li>
            <li>You put these gold tings under your eyes for 30 minutes, then bags, and sun damaged skin loooks sooooooooooooooo much better.  </li>
            <li>this worked better and faster.</li>
            <li>I got good results from the first time I used one.  </li>
            <li>Came on time, not expensive,  it feels good after the mask.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I could see the results quickly!</li>
            <li>did not understand what to do with free feathers, and why do I need it.</li>
            <li>I purchased these to compare with another product I have been using as an add on to my skin treatments, they really seemed to calm and smooth puffiness and add moisture to the eye area.  </li>
            <li>definitely worth trying...</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more and have told my friends to order them as well.</li>
            <li>I put it in the freeze for a few minutes for a good chills and apply for about 5 minutes.</li>

            <li>I would have had no clue what to do with these things if I didn&#x27;t go back to the original</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have an issue with dark circles, but I love the way my eyes feel after I use these.</li>
            <li>They say to keep on for thirty minutes but the first time I used them I didn&#x27;t think they did as much as the second time when I slept overnight with the eyemasks on.</li>

            <li> the others that I have used in the past were twice as thick and more &amp;#</li>
            <li> I was embarrased to go anywhere and wore my sunglasses indoors until the swelling finally went down</li>
            <li> the company SERIOUSLY needs a better English translator, Even when I put on my glasses and read directions with a magnifying glass I realized it wasn&#x27;t my eyes, it was the words... very poor translation.  </li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Really didn&#x27;t care about it but for price it was not that bad</li>
            <li> You just place them under your eyes and let them dissolve and then pull off the thin film residue.</li>
            <li> while they do the job, they are as thin as paper.  </li>
            <li> post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And although the ad stated there would be a bonus feather hair extension, it was not included :(</li>
            <li> but it might just be my skin :(</li>
            <li> I am so so disappointed the quility of the item I received and could not believe it was wrapped up in a kitch paper towel !!</li>

            <li> These are the best product I have ever used for eye puffiness.  I got good results from the first time I used one.  I put it in the freeze for a few minutes for a good chills and apply for about 5 minutes. It works well!</li>
            <li> I liked the results I got with this product.</li>
            <li> Maybe need to used this mask every time but from time to time no any results .</li>
            <li> I have 5-star rating because it worked well for me&lt;br /&gt;I liked everything abiout it&lt;br /&gt;I would recommen it to everybody</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t care about it but for price it was not that bad I still used it. But will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> They work alright. They don&#x27;t always stay on.</li>
            <li> These eye mask don&#x27;t include a lot of instructions but these work fantastically.  I will definitely be buying more and have told my friends to order them as well. You just place them under your eyes and let them dissolve and then pull off the thin film residue. They say to keep on for thirty minutes but the first time I used them I didn&#x27;t think they did as much as the second time when I slept overnight with the eyemasks on. Love these!</li>
            <li> I have been using collagen patches for years and these made the skin under my eayes turn red, swollen and they were on fire for over a week.  I was embarrased to go anywhere and wore my sunglasses indoors until the swelling finally went down and then my skin decided to peel...  BE CAREFUL with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried them twice for only a few minutes thinking it had to be something else but it was this product...</li>
            <li> not the best, not the worst.  they would be very good if they were thicker.  while they do the job, they are as thin as paper.  the others that I have used in the past were twice as thick and more &amp;#34;gel like&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The product came as described but the translation on the back was a riot... the company SERIOUSLY needs a better English translator, Even when I put on my glasses and read directions with a magnifying glass I realized it wasn&#x27;t my eyes, it was the words... very poor translation.  I would have had no clue what to do with these things if I didn&#x27;t go back to the original post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And although the ad stated there would be a bonus feather hair extension, it was not included :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t see a difference in my under eye bags, but the pads did feel good and stuck on easy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have an issue with dark circles, but I love the way my eyes feel after I use these. Totally refreshed.</li>
            <li> made me have a rash for a week straight but it might just be my skin :(</li>
            <li> Love this product! I use one pack 2x a day instead of only once. I could see the results quickly! Now if I wake up with puffy eyes I throw that on for 15-20mins and its all gone! Definitely buying these again</li>
            <li> I am a skin therapist.  I purchased these to compare with another product I have been using as an add on to my skin treatments, they really seemed to calm and smooth puffiness and add moisture to the eye area.  The feather hair extension is just a feather. lol.</li>
            <li> I like this product! AWESOME</li>
            <li> You put these gold tings under your eyes for 30 minutes, then bags, and sun damaged skin loooks sooooooooooooooo much better.  I have used Estee Lauder, Land Come, clinique, et. this worked better and faster.</li>
            <li> Came on time, not expensive,  it feels good after the mask.&lt;br /&gt;I did not understand what to do with free feathers, and why do I need it.</li>
            <li> Great product. Deliver on promises.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as I expected</li>
            <li> what a difference...my under eyes looks smoother and I noticed that it is less puffier than before...definitely worth trying... great product!!!!</li>
            <li> I am so so disappointed the quility of the item I received and could not believe it was wrapped up in a kitch paper towel !! But I am not going to return back though since the shipping fee was Just not worthed. I just wonder how Amazon allowed this kind of business using their store front !!</li>
