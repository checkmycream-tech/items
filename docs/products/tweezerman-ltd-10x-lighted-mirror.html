            <li>These things are great!</li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT!  </li>
            <li>Bright (very bright)</li>
            <li>Great for home and for travel.</li>
            <li>Used it two weeks ago and perfectly happy to have this while I travel.</li>
            <li>Just great for make up bag and travel.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I would like this mirror when it arrived - but it has come in very handy.</li>
            <li>I love it&lt;br /&gt;It´s the best mirror ever.</li>
            <li>The mirror works great and is a good quality.</li>
            <li>BRIGHTLY LIT and the magnifying is great.</li>
            <li>mirror is great, light is really bright.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>The light is perfect, you Don&#x27;t have to twist or turn your head to get the room light</li>
            <li>Effective close-up mirror for tweezing and inspecting mouth/teeth hygiene.  </li>
            <li>Nice sized.  </li>
            <li>Really handy.  </li>
            <li>; suction cups; bright light; batteries included.  </li>
            <li>I was so happy with the first ones I ordered these.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I missed being able to see things up close and love using my Tweezerman mirror.</li>
            <li>Not any more.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more for friends and family.</li>
            <li>The suction cups are about as trustworthy as most are...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>So compact yet powerful magnification, even better with the addition of the light.  </li>
            <li>light didn&#x27;t work, and mirrow is distorted.  </li>
            <li>The light flickers on and off or sometimes just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Seems cheaply made and doesn&#x27;t work as advertised.</li>
            <li>The mirror with light allows the smallest and thinnest of hairs to be seen.</li>
            <li>Four star rating because the light cuts in and out a lot, need to shake/jiggle it when you turn it on.</li>
            <li>One thing you do need to do is watch the angle you use, since you do not want the light to hit you in the eye.</li>
            <li>I find it helpful to also stick it on a window to get added light</li>
            <li>After I received my order, I discovered that batteries are already included and the mirror is good to go after removing the wedge of clear film in the bulb area.  </li>
            <li>This is a very powerful light so you can see everything on your face and skin.  </li>
            <li>the lighted 10x mirror was exactly what I wanted!!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s tiny - maybe good for putting in contacts or contact lens.  </li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of using it, you will be very happy you did not buy the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>I like the light very much</li>
            <li>I really like the compact size which makes it easy to take with you.</li>
            <li>light - might want to avoid staring directly at the light.  </li>
            <li>After 3 weeks of very gentle use the light snapped off from the main unit, and there is no way to fix it</li>
            <li>Great small size</li>
            <li>would say that the instructions for putting in the battery were not clear and when I finally found the screws - they were so smallish needed a magnifying glass to see them - which kind of defeats the purpose of the mirror!</li>
            <li>Combine this with Tweezerman LTD slant tweezers and you get great tools for those white and black hairs that pop up.</li>
            <li>Mirror very distorted.</li>
            <li>and it does its job very well.  </li>
            <li>Works better than any other travel mirror I have purchased.</li>
            <li>It is small enough to tuck away but has great</li>
            <li>second, the light was way to dim to be helpful.</li>
            <li>Amazing for eyebrows and great for travel when the lighting is horrible and the bathroom mirror is fogged up from showers...</li>
            <li>and thirdly, it would stick to the mirror for more than 5 seconds, and when we finally got it to stick the suction cups fell off the back.</li>
            <li>(which is what the original batteries say on them) and the purchased ones were SMALLER than the originals (even though they were labelled the same)</li>
            <li>first of all, if you actually want to see in the mirror it has to be like 2 inches from your face for it to be clear.</li>
            <li>Works well, just need to remember to turn the light off so the battery doesn&#x27;t wear down or the bulb dim.</li>
            <li>The selling point for me was the light and the magnification - and those are well supplied with this little mirror.</li>
            <li>Clear reflection with no distortion.  </li>
            <li>There is nothing about this mirror that is anywhere near 6.5 inches, except the card it is attached to.</li>
            <li>I think that two larger suction cups instead of 3 small ones would work better.</li>
            <li>Fabulous little compact mirror!</li>
            <li>Too small and the light doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>just right to see the hair only to loose it when you reach for the tweezers.</li>
            <li>The little light is held on by a tiny screw, and I was *very* careful with this product.</li>
            <li>I tried looking locally for great tweezers that would get those menacing little hairs, reading the packages, tilting them every which way to make sure they closed completely.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love it&lt;br /&gt;It´s the best mirror ever.No distorsion&lt;br /&gt;I bought extra ones for my friends&lt;br /&gt;They enyoy too&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time</li>
            <li> light didn&#x27;t work, and mirrow is distorted.  Will return.</li>
            <li> The mirror works great and is a good quality. The last mirror i had (not a tweezerman) had to be returned because the on off button would fall off. Anyway, I missed being able to see things up close and love using my Tweezerman mirror.</li>
            <li> I got this mirror for my mom for Christmas and I was completely disappointed. first of all, if you actually want to see in the mirror it has to be like 2 inches from your face for it to be clear. second, the light was way to dim to be helpful. and thirdly, it would stick to the mirror for more than 5 seconds, and when we finally got it to stick the suction cups fell off the back.</li>
            <li> This mirror came with only one suction cup (but 3 holes for suction cups) and the light was broken.  Safe to say I was pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> So compact yet powerful magnification, even better with the addition of the light.  Great for home and for travel.</li>
            <li> This is a very powerful light so you can see everything on your face and skin.  However, after 1 week I lost one suction cup.  After a one month, I am down to one remaining that I keep having to reattach.  I think that two larger suction cups instead of 3 small ones would work better.</li>
            <li> A suction cup was missing and the battery for the light was dead.  Not what I expect for the price.</li>
            <li> Junk. The light flickers on and off or sometimes just doesn&#x27;t work. Seems cheaply made and doesn&#x27;t work as advertised. Definitely not worth what I paid for it. Save your money.</li>
            <li> I love the mirror but the batteries are SO DIFFICULT to find when it&#x27;s time to replace. Bought LR 1130 (which is what the original batteries say on them) and the purchased ones were SMALLER than the originals (even though they were labelled the same) so therefore didn&#x27;t fit/work. ????????????</li>
            <li> Should have read the description carefully - it&#x27;s tiny - maybe good for putting in contacts or contact lens.  I kept it but it wasn&#x27;t what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other travel mirror I have purchased. Used it two weeks ago and perfectly happy to have this while I travel.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would like this mirror when it arrived - but it has come in very handy. It is small enough to tuck away but has great magnification!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that the instructions for putting in the battery were not clear and when I finally found the screws - they were so smallish needed a magnifying glass to see them - which kind of defeats the purpose of the mirror!</li>
            <li> Mirror very distorted. The light creates shadows where you dont need it making that part useless. Returned for something else.</li>
            <li> Product description says &amp;#34;2.8 x 3.7 x 6.5 inches&amp;#34;. There is nothing about this mirror that is anywhere near 6.5 inches, except the card it is attached to. If you only want to look at one eye at a time it&#x27;s fine. But if you want to see if your blush is even on both sides, it&#x27;s useless. I am sending it back.</li>
            <li> Amazing for eyebrows and great for travel when the lighting is horrible and the bathroom mirror is fogged up from showers...I can put my makeup on in the dark room! Love it!</li>
            <li> Combine this with Tweezerman LTD slant tweezers and you get great tools for those white and black hairs that pop up. The mirror with light allows the smallest and thinnest of hairs to be seen. I was so happy with the first ones I ordered these. The light is perfect, you Don&#x27;t have to twist or turn your head to get the room light just right to see the hair only to loose it when you reach for the tweezers. I tried looking locally for great tweezers that would get those menacing little hairs, reading the packages, tilting them every which way to make sure they closed completely. I would get them home and they may work for a short time but eventually I&#x27;m out looking for another one. Not any more. I have a travel set, a purse set, and a set in the bathroom. Mr.Tweezeman is my tweezers!</li>
            <li> I received this mirror in the packaging minus one suction cup. A waste of money.</li>
            <li> These things are great! Just great for make up bag and travel.</li>
            <li> Too small and the light doesn&#x27;t help. Decided to buy a larger one.</li>
            <li> Too small, view disorted from a distance, not good for applying makeup</li>
            <li> Effective close-up mirror for tweezing and inspecting mouth/teeth hygiene.  Four star rating because the light cuts in and out a lot, need to shake/jiggle it when you turn it on.</li>
            <li> Works well, just need to remember to turn the light off so the battery doesn&#x27;t wear down or the bulb dim. Must double-check that it is off as it has a tendency to &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; back on when you hit the switch to turn off.</li>
            <li> the lighted 10x mirror was exactly what I wanted!!  I really like the compact size which makes it easy to take with you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the mirror for 6 months or so.  I like the light very much and it does its job very well.  I rated 3 stars due to the price.  I&#x27;ve seen very similar items at drug/discount stores for much less.</li>
            <li> Fabulous little compact mirror! I will be purchasing more for friends and family.</li>
            <li> BRIGHTLY LIT and the magnifying is great. This one beats out the more expensive offerings on Amazon. One thing you do need to do is watch the angle you use, since you do not want the light to hit you in the eye. Once you get the hang of using it, you will be very happy you did not buy the more expensive brands. Having to wear readers, it is impossible to do a clean makeup job without a magnifier like this one.&lt;br /&gt;Very convenient for your purse, too!</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT!  NO TIME WASTED LOOKING FOR THOSE LITTLE HAIRS!</li>
            <li> Nice sized.  Clear reflection with no distortion.  Bright (very bright) light - might want to avoid staring directly at the light.  The suction cups are about as trustworthy as most are...they hold for awhile then fall off whatever it&#x27;s attached to.  The selling point for me was the light and the magnification - and those are well supplied with this little mirror.</li>
            <li> Just what I&#x27;ve been looking for!</li>
            <li> Really handy.  Great small size; suction cups; bright light; batteries included.  Because no battery details were included with the item description, I relied on the information from the Customer Question section and purchased the 2-pack LR1130 pack.  The customer said no batteries were included.  After I received my order, I discovered that batteries are already included and the mirror is good to go after removing the wedge of clear film in the bulb area.  Additionally, the package says to use AG10 batteries.</li>
            <li> mirror is great, light is really bright.  I find it helpful to also stick it on a window to get added light</li>
            <li> So disappointed! Tweezerman makes fantastic products, but unfortunately this isn&#x27;t one of them. The little light is held on by a tiny screw, and I was *very* careful with this product. After 3 weeks of very gentle use the light snapped off from the main unit, and there is no way to fix it (it&#x27;s a very fragile small piece of plastic that screwed onto the main body of the mirror).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a lot for me to write a bad review, but at this price I expected more than a handful of uses before it broke.</li>
