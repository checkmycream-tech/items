            <li>Incidentally, A Place of Beauty sent the two I ordered in the original box with the price sticker still on the box!</li>
            <li>This perfume is very light and clean.  </li>
            <li>If she would clean out her purse she would be able to find it quicker.</li>
            <li>This was the real deal (really Donna Karan Cashmere Mist), was as described, it smelled great, arrived promptly and safely, and worked as it was supposed to.</li>
            <li>Love the light, clean and \\&quot;warm\\&quot; scent of Donna Karan&#x27;s Cashmere Mist  and purchased two of these for stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li>Gives you that perfect little pick me up smell.  </li>
            <li>Light  usky smell that is never overpowering.i</li>
            <li>It fits in her purse and this is what she likes to wear and what I enjoy smelling.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume--light and fresh smelling.  </li>
            <li>The lid is secure so it doesn&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li>A boxed set of seven is $48.00 (at 6.86 each), and ships free from the Donna Karan website.</li>
            <li>My favorite perume and just the right size.  </li>
            <li>I am already going to order a few more to have on hand!!!  </li>
            <li>My daughter and I both enjoy wearing this scent, and that is rare!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a convenient spray with a light, fresh scent!</li>
            <li>The small size if perfect for traveling.  </li>
            <li>Small size but fits perfectly in my friends purse.  </li>
            <li>I am so excited about the travel size.  </li>
            <li>One is absolutely heaven and is exactly Donna Karan&#x27;s Cashmere Mist, my favorite fragrance !</li>
            <li>This is one of my absolute favorite scents, Cashmere Mist Eau De Parfum purse spray.</li>
            <li>While I love the smell of this and was happy to get it at such a great price, I was NOT happy that the perfume had been USED.  </li>
            <li>fresh, clean and not too sweet.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Soft, pretty and sexy!  </li>
            <li>It holds about 2-weeks worth of Cashmere Mist (if used everyday) and worked great.  </li>
            <li>My wife wanted to take her favorite Eau De Parfum on a trip, yet didn&#x27;t want to risk breaking her larger spray container in her luggage.  </li>
            <li>So soft and clean.</li>
            <li>it is a soft fragrance and not too sweet.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this product to anybody who loves the Cashmere Mist fragrance and wants to get it at an affordable price.</li>
            <li>Really fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I ordered this as a purse spray to carry with me at all times and it works very well when you need to freshen up.  </li>
            <li>I do think it&#x27;s a little over priced, but the packaging was very nice and a personal touch.</li>
            <li>It is tiny enough to fit in my wristlet.  </li>
            <li>I ended up buying a full size bottle and plan on buying some of the other items in this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>&quot; I would have realized that the vendor \\&quot;A Place of Beauty\\&quot; divided a boxed set and is selling each little spray atomizer at more than twice the retail cost if the vials were sold individually.  </li>
            <li>It is also available from other major department stores for the same manufacturer&#x27;s retail price.</li>
            <li>They came in similar packaging, and both bottles are exactly the same.</li>
            <li>and its small enough to fit in your purse</li>
            <li>Subtle, yet strong.</li>
            <li>I thought it was worth the price even though it&#x27;s a small amount.</li>

            <li> I love this fragrance, but was a little disappointed that it didn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way because it comes in a concentrated form.  </li>
            <li> It also lasted a bit longer than I expected it to, which was a plus!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is pretty expensive for a room deodorantizer.</li>

            <li> The other, smells awful.</li>
            <li> It has a very faint odor, not very good, but I can tell it is an attempt to be Cashmere Mist, but it&#x27;s awful.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m stuck with the bad one and out of the money.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>

            <li> exactly what I ordered smells simply wonderful. The eau de parfum is definitely my choice i would recommend it above the eau de toilet.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect size to carry around a lovely scent. I will probably purchase again. I do think it&#x27;s a little over priced, but the packaging was very nice and a personal touch.</li>
            <li> Awesome fragrance. Perfect size to keep in your purse for a quick spritz. Light  usky smell that is never overpowering.i simply can&#x27;t get enough of it.</li>
            <li> My wife wanted to take her favorite Eau De Parfum on a trip, yet didn&#x27;t want to risk breaking her larger spray container in her luggage.  This purse-sized spray proved just the trick.  It holds about 2-weeks worth of Cashmere Mist (if used everyday) and worked great.  We haven&#x27;t tried to reload it (most purse sprays are not reusable).  Expensive for the amount of Cashmere Mist it contains, yet cheap insurance against an unpleasant mishap that could put a serious damper on a vacation.  I also received 5 stars from my wife for purchasing this for her.  Thanks Amazon.com.  :)</li>
            <li> At first, I was a bit apprehensive, fearing I would be disappointed due to the low price of the item (even if it is only a travel size, I expected it to be more expensive).

Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Bought this small purse spray after smelling it in an insert in a magazine!  I absolutely love this fragrance it is a soft fragrance and not too sweet.  I have compliments on it all the time!  I ended up buying a full size bottle and plan on buying some of the other items in this fragrance.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Really fast shipping. Very pleased. This is going to be a great Birthday gift for a friend of mine. Just what she wanted.</li>
            <li> This is one of my absolute favorite scents, Cashmere Mist Eau De Parfum purse spray. I have the larger bottle of this scent, but wanted one for my purse. This Parfum Rocks. I purchased it at Amazon.com</li>
            <li> Love this smell. So soft and clean. I would buy it again. My husband loves the smell of this perfume on me.</li>
            <li> While I love the smell of this and was happy to get it at such a great price, I was NOT happy that the perfume had been USED.  1/4 of the bottle was missing.  This is not really acceptable, in addition to being not hygenic AT ALL.</li>
            <li> The product was smaller then I realized .And the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last as long as the lotion I had given to me as a gift.The only consultation is that I didn&#x27;t pay a lot for it.</li>
            <li> i just love the smell of it, and its not over powering!! and its small enough to fit in your purse</li>
            <li> I know this has been around for a while, but I&#x27;ve just discovered it!  Soft, pretty and sexy!  So happy to find the purse size for my trial run!  Just love it!</li>
            <li> It fits in her purse and this is what she likes to wear and what I enjoy smelling.  If she would clean out her purse she would be able to find it quicker.</li>

            <li> A very great size for your purse . Awesome scent very nice. Will make me purchase a bigger size of perfume, the next time around.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume--light and fresh smelling.  The small size if perfect for traveling.  The lid is secure so it doesn&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PURCHASE. IT IS NOTHING LIKE THE DEPARTMENT STORES.</li>
            <li> Will order more. This is an awesome fragrance...fresh, clean and not too sweet.  DKC arrived promptly, packaged nicely and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Bought for a friend for Christmas.  Small size but fits perfectly in my friends purse.  And the scent is incredible!  I thought it was worth the price even though it&#x27;s a small amount.</li>
            <li> Love the light, clean and \\&quot;warm\\&quot; scent of Donna Karan&#x27;s Cashmere Mist  and purchased two of these for stocking stuffers. My daughter and I both enjoy wearing this scent, and that is rare!  Arrived after Christmas which was okay, but had I done my \\&quot;homework\\&quot; I would have realized that the vendor \\&quot;A Place of Beauty\\&quot; divided a boxed set and is selling each little spray atomizer at more than twice the retail cost if the vials were sold individually.  A boxed set of seven is $48.00 (at 6.86 each), and ships free from the Donna Karan website. It is also available from other major department stores for the same manufacturer&#x27;s retail price. Incidentally, A Place of Beauty sent the two I ordered in the original box with the price sticker still on the box!</li>
            <li> The fragrance is not the same as the DK Cashmere Mist.  Wasn&#x27;t a good purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not purchase again. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this scent. One of the best I&#x27;ve ever owned. Subtle, yet strong. Sophisticated scent for any woman.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, but was a little disappointed that it didn&#x27;t last very long.  It seemed to evaporate, because I only used it three times and it was empty.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for my purse &amp; travelling.</li>
            <li> My favorite perume and just the right size.  Fits in your purse, clutch, or even a pocket.  A little goes a long way because it comes in a concentrated form.  This perfume is very light and clean.  Now I have it in a travel size.  I am already going to order a few more to have on hand!!!  This is a must buy!! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kathryn</li>
            <li> Great to have this fragrance at your fingertips. Smells wonderful!! I&#x27;ve told everyone to try it. Will deffinately buy again.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites just got portable in a sturdy glass container.  Great purse and travel size.  The roller is great.</li>
            <li> Having my fall signature scent in my purse, brightens my day.  It is tiny enough to fit in my wristlet.  Awesome!</li>
            <li> I can take it with me, or not. It&#x27;s just a convenient spray with a light, fresh scent! Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought two of these at the same time, for about the same price, from different vendors. They came in similar packaging, and both bottles are exactly the same. The problem I have is, I threw all of the packaging away and filed the shipping papers away before I opened either one up. BIG MISTAKE !!! One is absolutely heaven and is exactly Donna Karan&#x27;s Cashmere Mist, my favorite fragrance ! Smells magnificent !  The other, smells awful. I can&#x27;t say that it has gone to alcohol, because that is not what I smell. It has a very faint odor, not very good, but I can tell it is an attempt to be Cashmere Mist, but it&#x27;s awful. Now I don&#x27;t know which bottle came from which vendor so I&#x27;m stuck with the bad one and out of the money. I&#x27;d so love to return it but can&#x27;t. I learned a valuable lesson here.</li>
            <li> The scent last and is not over powering  I like this one for travel so I dont leave my perfume anywhere because people wont give it back. LOL</li>
            <li> I have been using for years.  Love the scent - not overpowering.  I am so excited about the travel size.  I have one in my gym bag, one at work, and another for travel.  This is perfect and I highly recommend.  Also love the deodorant.  Got as a gift and will give to others.</li>
