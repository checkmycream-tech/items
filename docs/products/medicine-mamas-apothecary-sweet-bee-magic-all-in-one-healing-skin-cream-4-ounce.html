            <li>And way better value - win!</li>
            <li>I saw this on Amazon as a lightning deal and was impressed by how many people were buying it.</li>
            <li>This balm is magic and perfect for me.</li>
            <li>This balm is magic and perfect for me.</li>
            <li>I bought this cream for the good reviews it has.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear any foundation or makeup now (&amp; surprisingly I haven&#x27;t had any pimples since using product...</li>
            <li>This is good</li>
            <li>It is a good product.  </li>
            <li>Good purchase.</li>
            <li>It is good, not greasy or oily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, it is a good product.</li>
            <li>Price is good</li>
            <li>it does a good job healing my skin.</li>
            <li>and I had read that it was good for it.  </li>
            <li>It works great on its own</li>
            <li>Like most people as they age I wasn&#x27;t very happy with the lines developing along my top lip</li>
            <li>My skin feels moist and looks very healthy...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, the moisturizing part of the deal was superb but it wasn&#x27;t worth the breakout.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love these products!</li>
            <li>Love it !</li>
            <li>Love it !</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>the magic of honey!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>After using this product, my heals have never been better !</li>
            <li>it really is magical in it&#x27;s healing and soothing capacity!</li>
            <li>Almost bought Egyptian magic until I looked on this site!</li>
            <li>Glad I did!</li>
            <li>(Having been dealing with this since I was a child, I have sampled most products on the market!)</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Very unusual skin cream but very effective!  </li>
            <li>Great moisturizer and is diminishing fine lines and clearing my complexion.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Nice organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>Like I said, it&#x27;s cheaper than Egyptian Magic but not as good.</li>
            <li>Best for my winter skin - very cost effective.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;We even started to use it as a diaper rash cream for my son who is very allergic to Desitin and it has been wonderful.</li>
            <li>Loving it as a lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t nice to us either.  </li>
            <li>I am also using this during post laser treatments and seems to do a nice job of healing.  </li>
            <li>Just as good or better than the Egyptian stuff.  </li>
            <li>I am always searching for products to help my elderly mother and dad, and to use with my dogs, as well as for my own use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I feel they are responsible and sincere to deliver best in the market.</li>
            <li>Goes on nice and smooth and feels good.</li>
            <li>I bought this because another review said it was as good as Egyptian Magic, but I should have known better.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Bee Magic!</li>
            <li>This takes a good 10-15 minutes to soak in, but in the evenings that&#x27;s just fine.  </li>
            <li>and my skin is in the best shape it has been since my early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>So amazing :-)</li>
            <li>By far the best skincare product that I have found for my hands during the winter.</li>
            <li>I did switch brands when Egyptian Magic raised their prices but both work amazingly well.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I&#x27;m thrilled with the many</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s more effective.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE it, and the price is alot better than egyptian magic, and the ingredients are organic, could you ask for a better product!!</li>
            <li>Amazing product for winter, better than any lotion you have, and better than Egyptian Magic if you have tried that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This cream is very rich and creamy and helps with cracked skin, but it&#x27;s really good only for the roughest parts - heels and elbows because it&#x27;s so rich, but works great !</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer as a NIGHT moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s ok, I can survive with this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Magic.</li>
            <li>but I personally love that feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Should be refrigerated for the most part because it&#x27;s way too mushy if you don&#x27;t&lt;</li>
            <li>This is not a product that can be used if you are touching things or don&#x27;t want people to know you are greased up.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a balm.</li>
            <li>I like this better as it isn&#x27;t as oily.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Please watch their company video to get more inform-</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>I love that it also comes in a stick for use on-the-go.</li>
            <li>But I have to write more words.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product!</li>
            <li>I also use it as \\&quot;magic cream\\&quot; on my kids&#x27; owies :)</li>
            <li>I am not a fan of the Egyptian Magic smell</li>
            <li>so to me, Bee Magic is a no brainer.</li>
            <li>Egyptian magic didn&#x27;t have any smell to it.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve seen a lot of reviewers compare this as the cheaper version of Egyptian Magic and because of that I decided to order both and compare.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t my favorite scent</li>
            <li>Its not egyptian magic, but it sure is easier to apply.</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>Does not work any better then blistex.</li>
            <li>I love the texture for my hands and feet.</li>
            <li>I never used Egyptian magic so I cannot make a comparison between the two.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels better than ever.</li>
            <li>so I suspect that it&#x27;s someone whose lying and probably isn&#x27;t truthful.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>Great price, fast delivery - thank you Amazon</li>
            <li>but I love her and have got her out of the nursing home twice and still have her at home.</li>
            <li>Maybe it is that the consistency is more oily.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to order more of this product.</li>
            <li>I love using this cream for my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not a silver bullet, but it does help more than anything else I&#x27;ve yet to try.</li>
            <li>I use it everywhere, but the most striking change is around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>This formula is perhaps almost identical to Egyptian Magic Skin Cream but at about 75% the price.  </li>
            <li>but i think my skin feels softer and looks more radiant.</li>
            <li>my cats love it too.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I have used Egyptian Magic.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and I carry it everywhere.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to my friends :)</li>
            <li>I had no idea I was about to fall in love with a jar.</li>
            <li>I found much more than that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You get the idea - I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product because I was considering buying Egyptian Magic and thought this organic alternative would be better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I ended up returning the cream to Amazon and picked up some Egyptian Magic at Costco.  </li>
            <li>first problem that I had with this item was that it doesn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I think this is a pretty good product for the price</li>
            <li>Its better than Egyptian Magic cream available in the market.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best used in winter or for VERY dry skin.</li>
            <li>So glad I had gotten sweet Bee Magic</li>
            <li>I decided to buy both the Sweet Bee Magic and Egyptian Magic for comparison.  </li>
            <li>It washed out each time which is good since it is very greasy.  </li>
            <li>I got this from Whole Foods because someone Amazon reviewer said this is just as good as Egyptian Magic (which was what I wanted to get originally).</li>
            <li>non-greasy, smooth, great for sensitive skin and cuticles.</li>
            <li>Well, it might be fragrance free but the natural smell of the product isn&#x27;t great at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong so you&#x27;ll see that you need to wait</li>
            <li>I like the Sweet Bee, but found that it was way greasier than the Egyptian Magic and took a bit longer to penetrate the skin.  </li>
            <li>The Sweet Bee was more like butter out of the refrigerator for 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I would choose Egyptian Magic over Sweet Bee.  </li>
            <li>The Sweet Bee Magic:</li>
            <li>Most lip balms make my mouth break out, esp ones with shea butter and sweet almond oil.</li>
            <li>the smell is not the most pleasing but it is not bad as a substitute..</li>
            <li>just fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I love it and the mild smell does not bother me.</li>
            <li>The balm took away most of the pain, healed the blisters, and tremendously softened the skin which had turned to leather.</li>
            <li>A clerk at Whole Foods recommended this to me, and I am so glad!</li>
            <li>I bought this product based on the many positive reviews and was pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>The press about this product is accurate.  </li>
            <li>with free shipping-</li>
            <li>I use it everyday as a moisturizer and it&#x27;s heals and perfectly moisturizes.</li>
            <li>will naturally be compared to the better known Egyptian Magic, and I will tell you that I prefer Bee Magic for its consistency and smell.</li>
            <li>Heals burns, gives glowing skin, fragrance free...</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>But, once again- it is absolutely fabulous for your feet, and hands.</li>
            <li>I want to say this is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Nothing at all in comparison to Egyptian Magic which is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>this stuff is great, especially for the winter.</li>
            <li>I love putting it on at night to let it work its magic, but I am very shiny in the morning.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It might be good for use on pets as well since it is all natural, but I will have to do some more research on that first.</li>
            <li>And  I am not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li>Its more like a salve than a lotion &amp; is pretty soothing.but a tad waxy.</li>
            <li>I hope that someone who may have the same problem I had with the laser hair removal burns will see this and know to buy it and BELIEVE in its magic healing ! :)</li>
            <li>A little goes a longggg way of this great cream (or more like ointment).  </li>
            <li>Similar to Egyptian Magic (I can&#x27;t tell the diff, except this is better priced), try Sweet Bee Magic.  </li>
            <li>I love that this product is all natural, but have to say I still prefer Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li>It light cream after cleaning my face I love it some much</li>
            <li>Also, great for any dry skin areas ( or areas with fungus ).  </li>
            <li>I am a senior citizen with dry skin and this product helps greatly.</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin in winter.</li>
            <li>It has kept my skin looking great during the dry indoor winter air.</li>
            <li>It is great for chaffed, dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Sweet Bee Magic did not make me break out and seemed to lighten sun spots (although that could be my imagination because I like the stuff so much).</li>
            <li>Great for healing cracked heals and rough elbows.</li>
            <li>Healed so much quicker than most I have seen on others!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I decided because this was such a good deal to order through Amazon instead.</li>
            <li>then a layer of the sweet bee.  </li>
            <li>But I really do think my face looks better</li>
            <li>But overall it&#x27;s a good moisturizer to put on your knees, arms, and even rashes and things of that nature.</li>
            <li>I love it so much that I use it on my arms and legs as well.</li>
            <li>The consistency isn&#x27;t really a cream, it&#x27;s more of a creamy ointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this product because Egyptian magic cost too much.</li>
            <li>I saw this product in the healthfood store I was shopping at and figured I would give it a try (the word MAGIC sold me, as I think I really needed a miracle for my wounds)</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product - it runs a close second to Egyptian Magic but definitely a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li>It is quickly absorbed and spreads over the skin smoothly.</li>
            <li>bought this on a whim because I am very attuned to bee products and the ingredients looked lovely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d trade all the shea butter, cocoa butter and sweet almond oil on the planet for one jar of honey</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried the product and have had NO bad experiences.</li>
            <li>Clears up any redness very quickly and is safe and natural to use on my baby.</li>
            <li>and I can assure you this is the most clean, organic and natural product available in today market.</li>
            <li>I have tried Egyptian Magic before, and it really didn&#x27;t do much for me (expensive too!); however, this bee magic is amazing and the price is great!</li>
            <li>but I think the Egyptian Magic seems to linger on the skin long as a barrier and seems more smooth..</li>
            <li>It went on feeling super greasy</li>
            <li>This product is similar to the Argan Infinity Cream; the cream is definitely more oily and has a better smell.</li>
            <li>Delivery is quick too</li>
            <li>My daughter has a mild case of eczema and I have a mild case of chronic plaque psoriasis on one knee and my elbow.</li>
            <li>while my skin is still damp, I rub a 1/2-pea-sized amount of this quickly between the pads of all 8 fingers, then press all across my face, including my undereyes and lips.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m just lucky I guess), and this product helps with that as well.</li>
            <li>Tried it on my baby&#x27;s mild eczema and it did nothing.  </li>
            <li>it soaks in fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>also love having a balm that I can use for my big dogs that is absolutely safe if ingested.</li>
            <li>I am a new fan of Medicine Mama&#x27;s Sweet Bee Magic Skin Cream.</li>
            <li>Medicine Mama&#x27;s product had a superior consistency (creamy and easily spreadable) and has less of a beeswax smell.</li>
            <li>This product is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>My skin is very dry so after I wash my face at night, while it is still damp, I apply a good moisturizer</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s good for very dry skin, but don&#x27;t get it if you have combination or oily skin</li>
            <li>Great for skin problems, a a little will go along ways.  </li>
            <li>My face still feels freshly moisturized in the morning</li>
            <li>worth every penny and a jar goes a looooonnnnnng way.</li>
            <li>I am in my mid 30&#x27;s and have tried many different products and love this one the most.</li>
            <li>It is really worth the price.</li>
            <li>whats better is its all natural</li>
            <li>This product is useful for almost anything that itches.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s all natural and erases dryness.</li>
            <li>This was my first order and won&#x27;t be my last, I love this cream!  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping though, thanks!</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s very well worth the wait!</li>
            <li>I put on at night right before bed as a nighttime moisturizer.</li>
            <li>But, with all of the positive reviews you may want to try it for yourself!</li>
            <li>I usually make my own cream mixture which is better than this.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it is not organic, but there was a marked difference with the Egyptian Magic cream.  </li>
            <li>It also seems to penetrate better than balms that can kind of sit on top of the skin, and has no fillers or creepy stuff in it.</li>
            <li>so I can only imagine how much more effective it would be if I applied it regularly.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use a tiny tiny amount and rub between hands to warm and distribute, then press onto your face.</li>
            <li>a night time moisturizer and my skin is so smooth and soft!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smooth on like so many other creams.  </li>
            <li>For those wondering, yea - this is Egyptian Magic with organic ingredients and no cult following.</li>
            <li>I wish I were as excited about this skin cream as most of the other reviewers.  </li>
            <li>It does go on greasy at first, but it will absorb.</li>
            <li>I first got it</li>
            <li>I put some on my face the first night I got it</li>
            <li>Also, my toddler got a bit of a heat-rash during a very humid heatwave and this product got rid of his heat-rash overnight!</li>
            <li>Hope this helps - go to their website to get first 10% off</li>
            <li>and I thought at first I would not care for it.</li>
            <li>All in One works pretty well.</li>
            <li>This is the first thing that I can tell a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li>Better than Vaseline for the same uses.  </li>
            <li>It has helped his eczema so much!  </li>
            <li>I have recommended to various family and friends and they also love it.</li>
            <li>I have purchased it twice, and the second purchase was for a greater quantity.</li>
            <li>Since my first tests, I now think of honey balm first when something comes</li>
            <li>Very moisturising, but too oily, cannot touch the keyboard right after using it</li>
            <li>Because of it&#x27;s use on sensitive skin and pure ingredients, I figured it would be fragrance free.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t attest to any magical properties (like making age spots vanish over night or completely erasing old scars) but for what it does, it does well.</li>
            <li>I first came across this product during sampling beauty products at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>You can use this product pretty much anywhere on your body.</li>
            <li>healthy for the skin and lasts on the skin surface a long time !  </li>
            <li>It was easy to scoop out, but left my skin feeling a bit greasy.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care much for the scent of Sweet Bee either, smelled a bit like an old closet.  </li>
            <li>In the morning my skin is super soft.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a heavier face cream, or have severely dry skin you will love this.</li>
            <li>Love this to sooth and comfort dry itchy eczema.  </li>
            <li>A long time user of Egyptian Magic, the Sweet Bee MAgic is a nice and less expensive substitute, and is on par with Egyptian Magic - they apear amost identical in their consistency, scent and feel.</li>
            <li>This is really more like a balm than a cream with a very waxy/ greasy texture that does rub in as long as you don&#x27;t over do it.</li>
            <li>If you use it quickly, you can probably skip this step but if you get the big jar and keep it around or use sparingly, try the frig thing to keep it fresh and active.balm, and now use nothing else.</li>
            <li>As long as you have realistic expectations and are looking for an alternative to Egyptian Magic, you&#x27;ve found it in this salve.</li>
            <li>but this really gets into my skin, works wonders on may face as I use it every night.  </li>
            <li>and I feel very oily after using it.  </li>
            <li>Nothing has worked so fast or so well.&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li>Nothing really gets rid of them</li>
            <li>really badly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind it too much</li>
            <li>It has made my skin so much softer and nicer---</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I read another review that was really helpful about this product before I purchased it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s greasy ( just really rub it in) and</li>
            <li>I am very please with this product and will recomend it to anyone who might ask.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and I think its emollient quality is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Try it  I use it for every thing and it appears to really work ..</li>
            <li>It is very greasy</li>
            <li>But have gotten into routine of washing then applying and allowing to absorb... and it really has not been an issue.</li>
            <li>put on cuts or burns, I dont see much of a change and the way it melts is ok.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So much like the title, it has a soothing balm effect on the skin, could be used for all over moisturizer or to heal dry/damaged skin.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps best on hands and body during the cold weather.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much either.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>I really like this balm, its not a cream, I like the balm consistency.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this balm, it works!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really helped heal them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can really work it into your skin.  </li>
            <li>Not only have I seen improvement in my face (balance in my skin and evenness), but I have also been using this as a elbow/knee moisturizer and it works fabulously.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gets oily if you use it too much on the face</li>
            <li>It keeps my face moist for the rest of the day and if you don&#x27;t use too much</li>
            <li>it is very moisturizing, as it is almost oily as it is applied to the skin...</li>
            <li>It moisturizes, and is incredibly gentle.  </li>
            <li>but I needed FAST healing.  </li>
            <li>I have put it on burns and cuts and they heal fast.  </li>
            <li>Really good!&lt;br /&gt;I think my mom used it all,</li>
            <li>It feels very greasy in skin.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>it really doesn&#x27;t make your skin greasier than it normally</li>
            <li>Its more like a salve than a lotion and is very soothing.although a little waxy.</li>
            <li>This product is far superior to the other brand which makes a similar product, and cheaper.</li>
            <li>But I feel if you have new stretch marks that are coming in, it would work really well in getting rid of them.</li>
            <li>Good size of product which should last for a long time since a small dab spreads easily.</li>
            <li>only reason I can be so hard on this item is because I am comparing to the original Egyptian magic which really does do everything it says!</li>
            <li>It does make skin soft, so it&#x27;s a good moisturizer, just not for the face (at least for me).</li>
            <li>I have a nervous habit called \\&quot;skin picking\\&quot; which is a form of OCD: if there is anything that doesn&#x27;t feel smooth on me, I pick at it via subconscious action to make it go away.</li>
            <li>I went to Whole Foods a few weeks ago to get some Egyptian Magic to try on my son&#x27;s eczema.  </li>
            <li>Females can safely use it in female places for healing especially.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I really like that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>I really like it is 100% natural</li>
            <li>soft, goes too fast, smells yukky.  </li>
            <li>After the third night my daughter brought over two homeopathic remedies for me to try, and Wala, the ithing stopped for a few hours, when I was told to take another 3 pellets each time the itch returned, the swelling got much better, and my arm now feels normal again, no thanks to Sweet Bee Magic., and again I&#x27;m told only unopened products can be returned.  </li>
            <li>I normally have tons of breakouts).</li>
            <li>So pricing is pretty much the same for this and the Josie Maran cream.</li>
            <li>It is very greasy and can be used only at night and if you have a more mature and dry skin.</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;bee cream&amp;#34; is amazing for dry feet, nighttime face moisturizer, and general deep moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I put this on right before bed last night and this morning the silvery scales almost all disapeared.</li>
            <li>First of all, the consistency of this cream is more like a salve and it takes a little longer for the product to be absorbed into the skin than with a typical cream.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve learned to live with it.</li>
            <li>I also used it for the healing of a new tattoo, and my tattoo is doing wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used holistic products for over 20 years and continually try new ones.</li>
            <li>but when I go without, my face gets super dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>I scraped my upper lip once after a face first fall onto concrete</li>
            <li>The burns were fading fast and after a week and a half or so of using this product, they were pretty much GONE!  </li>
            <li>Yes, it is a little greasy when you first apply it, but it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>also have Keratosis pilaris, the tiny red bumps that many people get on the back of their arms.</li>
            <li>After a couple minutes your skin is so soft!</li>
            <li>It made both ultra soft!</li>
            <li>Forget the Neosporin or similar products - try this first</li>
            <li>If you use it quickly, you can probably skip this step but if you get the big jar and keep it around or use sparingly, try the frig thing to keep it fresh and active.</li>
            <li>I put it on scars (old and new) and they vanish.  </li>
            <li>It is sticky but worth to use for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>tried it first on areas of my lower legs which had developed red spots after hormonal therapy.</li>
            <li>and I find Bee Magic to be similar but far less noticeable</li>
            <li>Even if it does not clear your skin like it did for me, it has so many other uses, including scar treatment, stretch marks, cuticle cream, elbow/knee cream, lip balm, eyelashes, under eye puffiness, etc.</li>
            <li>We have used this product on many things like bug bite, dry skin, and any other skin irritant.</li>
            <li>The Egyptian Magic was more solid and firm with a consistency of a hard frozen stick of butter.  </li>
            <li>My acne prone skin has been clear, and I am always getting asked what I use for under eye cream.</li>
            <li>Helps clear up zits and bug bites.  </li>
            <li>But once rub it in your skin stays soft and glowing all day.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 30s and still get acne in my &amp;#34;T-zone&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>only thing I don&#x27;t like much is the smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 30 and just started getting frequent acne breakouts.</li>
            <li>I figured I would try this stuff out on it and wouldn&#x27;t you know, they have almost completely gone away after a couple weeks.</li>
            <li>I got this based on the reviews and because it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>I might be young again....</li>
            <li>The greasiness is a side effect of it being all natural, in my experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li>His skin stays soft, undamaged and not irritated.</li>
            <li>With my stretch marks, they have faded some but my stretch marks are fairly old</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll completely disappear.</li>
            <li>Based on the reviews I thought this would be my &amp;#34;magic cream&amp;#34; in a bottle, but it did not meet my expectations as far as a face cream.</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft and nourished.</li>
            <li>This is cheaper and so far is working.</li>
            <li>but I like natural products; it might not appeal to everyone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also seen my skin acne reduce and some of my old scars are going away.</li>
            <li>Now that I use this before going to bed, my hands are completely clear and so soft.  </li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s smoothing them out and softening the texture of my injured</li>
            <li>As a result, I never got an answer as to whether I received old, spoiled product, or if the rancid oil smell is what the cream is supposed to smell like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>spend a few extra bucks and get egyptian magic...</li>
            <li>So far works exactly the same, and it looks and smells the same.  </li>
            <li>I missed a spot on my back this summer when applying sunblock and it got pretty red.</li>
            <li>I ordered the 4 oz from the web because our local Whole Foods stopped carrying it and only carry the other product - Egyptian Magic which happens to be WAY more expensive.</li>
            <li>Oh, I had such high hopes for this skin cream.</li>
            <li>Now for the biggest reason why I&#x27;ve stuck with it so long is that with a combination of sunscreen and weekly exfoliation, this stuff really helped with my acne scars and icepick scars.</li>
            <li>Pure ingredients and go a very long way.</li>
            <li>Nice balm overall, a little thick and sticky at first, but it does seem to soak in so to say.</li>
            <li>Try applying daily to cold sore locations as preventative - it works great for</li>
            <li>It works really, really well for that dry winter skin</li>
            <li>burns - this cream gave instant pain relief and promoted fast healing where prior to using the cream there had been no healing.</li>
            <li>the cream soaked completely into my skin after several minutes, leaving my skin soft and not overly</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend if you are going the natural route as well!</li>
            <li>I still have a few picked wounds around my fingers, but they are substantially less than they were, since it moisturizes my skin so much better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried thus far.</li>
            <li>Also as a general moisturizer and healing</li>
            <li>My skin is so sensitive and this skin cream is the only thing that is smoothing it.</li>
            <li>Sweet Bee is less expensive than Egyptian Magic, but if you go to Costco...</li>
            <li>I had too many dark spots on my face near the chin area and chicks due to breakouts and other carelessness (not removing make up on time).</li>
            <li>+ at Whole Foods or any other retailer, and truly heals your skin ailments.</li>
            <li>really wanted to like the Medicine Mama&#x27;s Sweet Bee Magic, but without a reply from the manufacturer as to whether my experience was typical of the product or if I just received a bad batch, I cannot recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I paid around $25 for the 4oz jar of this and think it will last me a long time; product was normally $29.99</li>
            <li>I am not a big fan of covering up my skin flaws with make up, I believe in a natural way to enhance my facial features.</li>
            <li>using it as a first layer before I apply make up, I use it through out the day on my hands, legs, lips and face- its little oily</li>
            <li>On a hot day it can get a little greasy, but it also makes your skin glow.</li>
            <li>I learned all the details from Whole Foods and other online research !</li>
            <li>If I try using less, I feel like I am pulling my skin too much to get coverage.  </li>
            <li>i have extremely dry and sensitive skin and this product addresses that without any harmful chemicals, i would def recommend</li>
            <li>I have dry, acne prone, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t break my skin out and has completely cleared up the dry patches I get around my eyes and mouth.  </li>
            <li>A surprising healing from nasty cow parsnip blisters was enjoyed by my chiropractor.  </li>
            <li>It is thick but melts into your skin fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>It has really helped with my eczema in conjunction with African black soap.</li>
            <li>The next morning, my face felt so soft and no new pimples.</li>
            <li>An employee at Whole Foods showed me this product and said it is essentially the same for half the price.  </li>
            <li>My hands will get very dry and irritated in the winter, but when I use this product it keeps my hands moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>Its thick enough to be an adequate eye cream and yet absorbent enough to be a daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>little greasy but absorbs fast and the skin is softer after couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great face cream...</li>
            <li> it is great for your feet and cuticles.  </li>
            <li> Great product for winter weather to help keep skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> Love it!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recommend!  Very nice product.</li>
            <li> This product is so amazing!</li>
            <li> AMAZING!</li>
            <li> And way better value - win!</li>
            <li> I saw this on Amazon as a lightning deal and was impressed by how many people were buying it.</li>
            <li> This balm is magic and perfect for me.</li>
            <li> This balm is magic and perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream for the good reviews it has.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear any foundation or makeup now (&amp; surprisingly I haven&#x27;t had any pimples since using product...</li>
            <li> This is good</li>
            <li> It is a good product.  </li>
            <li> Good purchase.</li>
            <li> It is good, not greasy or oily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, it is a good product.</li>
            <li> Price is good</li>
            <li> it does a good job healing my skin.</li>
            <li> and I had read that it was good for it.  </li>
            <li> It works great on its own</li>
            <li> Like most people as they age I wasn&#x27;t very happy with the lines developing along my top lip</li>
            <li> My skin feels moist and looks very healthy...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, the moisturizing part of the deal was superb but it wasn&#x27;t worth the breakout.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love these products!</li>
            <li> Love it !</li>
            <li> Love it !</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> the magic of honey!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> After using this product, my heals have never been better !</li>
            <li> it really is magical in it&#x27;s healing and soothing capacity!</li>
            <li> Almost bought Egyptian magic until I looked on this site!</li>
            <li> Glad I did!</li>
            <li> (Having been dealing with this since I was a child, I have sampled most products on the market!)</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Very unusual skin cream but very effective!  </li>
            <li> Great moisturizer and is diminishing fine lines and clearing my complexion.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Nice organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> Like I said, it&#x27;s cheaper than Egyptian Magic but not as good.</li>
            <li> Best for my winter skin - very cost effective.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;We even started to use it as a diaper rash cream for my son who is very allergic to Desitin and it has been wonderful.</li>
            <li> Loving it as a lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t nice to us either.  </li>
            <li> I am also using this during post laser treatments and seems to do a nice job of healing.  </li>
            <li> Just as good or better than the Egyptian stuff.  </li>
            <li> I am always searching for products to help my elderly mother and dad, and to use with my dogs, as well as for my own use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I feel they are responsible and sincere to deliver best in the market.</li>
            <li> Goes on nice and smooth and feels good.</li>
            <li> I bought this because another review said it was as good as Egyptian Magic, but I should have known better.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Bee Magic!</li>
            <li> This takes a good 10-15 minutes to soak in, but in the evenings that&#x27;s just fine.  </li>
            <li> and my skin is in the best shape it has been since my early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> So amazing :-)</li>
            <li> By far the best skincare product that I have found for my hands during the winter.</li>
            <li> I did switch brands when Egyptian Magic raised their prices but both work amazingly well.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I&#x27;m thrilled with the many</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s more effective.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE it, and the price is alot better than egyptian magic, and the ingredients are organic, could you ask for a better product!!</li>
            <li> Amazing product for winter, better than any lotion you have, and better than Egyptian Magic if you have tried that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This cream is very rich and creamy and helps with cracked skin, but it&#x27;s really good only for the roughest parts - heels and elbows because it&#x27;s so rich, but works great !</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer as a NIGHT moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s ok, I can survive with this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Magic.</li>
            <li> but I personally love that feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Should be refrigerated for the most part because it&#x27;s way too mushy if you don&#x27;t&lt;</li>
            <li> This is not a product that can be used if you are touching things or don&#x27;t want people to know you are greased up.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a balm.</li>
            <li> I like this better as it isn&#x27;t as oily.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Please watch their company video to get more inform-</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> I love that it also comes in a stick for use on-the-go.</li>
            <li> But I have to write more words.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I also use it as \\&quot;magic cream\\&quot; on my kids&#x27; owies :)</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of the Egyptian Magic smell</li>
            <li> so to me, Bee Magic is a no brainer.</li>
            <li> Egyptian magic didn&#x27;t have any smell to it.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve seen a lot of reviewers compare this as the cheaper version of Egyptian Magic and because of that I decided to order both and compare.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t my favorite scent</li>
            <li> Its not egyptian magic, but it sure is easier to apply.</li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> Does not work any better then blistex.</li>
            <li> I love the texture for my hands and feet.</li>
            <li> I never used Egyptian magic so I cannot make a comparison between the two.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels better than ever.</li>
            <li> so I suspect that it&#x27;s someone whose lying and probably isn&#x27;t truthful.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast delivery - thank you Amazon</li>
            <li> but I love her and have got her out of the nursing home twice and still have her at home.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is that the consistency is more oily.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to order more of this product.</li>
            <li> I love using this cream for my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not a silver bullet, but it does help more than anything else I&#x27;ve yet to try.</li>
            <li> I use it everywhere, but the most striking change is around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> This formula is perhaps almost identical to Egyptian Magic Skin Cream but at about 75% the price.  </li>
            <li> but i think my skin feels softer and looks more radiant.</li>
            <li> my cats love it too.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I have used Egyptian Magic.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and I carry it everywhere.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to my friends :)</li>
            <li> I had no idea I was about to fall in love with a jar.</li>
            <li> I found much more than that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You get the idea - I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I was considering buying Egyptian Magic and thought this organic alternative would be better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I ended up returning the cream to Amazon and picked up some Egyptian Magic at Costco.  </li>
            <li> first problem that I had with this item was that it doesn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I think this is a pretty good product for the price</li>
            <li> Its better than Egyptian Magic cream available in the market.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best used in winter or for VERY dry skin.</li>
            <li> So glad I had gotten sweet Bee Magic</li>
            <li> I decided to buy both the Sweet Bee Magic and Egyptian Magic for comparison.  </li>
            <li> It washed out each time which is good since it is very greasy.  </li>
            <li> I got this from Whole Foods because someone Amazon reviewer said this is just as good as Egyptian Magic (which was what I wanted to get originally).</li>
            <li> non-greasy, smooth, great for sensitive skin and cuticles.</li>
            <li> Well, it might be fragrance free but the natural smell of the product isn&#x27;t great at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong so you&#x27;ll see that you need to wait</li>
            <li> I like the Sweet Bee, but found that it was way greasier than the Egyptian Magic and took a bit longer to penetrate the skin.  </li>
            <li> The Sweet Bee was more like butter out of the refrigerator for 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I would choose Egyptian Magic over Sweet Bee.  </li>
            <li> The Sweet Bee Magic:</li>
            <li> Most lip balms make my mouth break out, esp ones with shea butter and sweet almond oil.</li>
            <li> the smell is not the most pleasing but it is not bad as a substitute..</li>
            <li> just fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I love it and the mild smell does not bother me.</li>
            <li> The balm took away most of the pain, healed the blisters, and tremendously softened the skin which had turned to leather.</li>
            <li> A clerk at Whole Foods recommended this to me, and I am so glad!</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the many positive reviews and was pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> The press about this product is accurate.  </li>
            <li> with free shipping-</li>
            <li> I use it everyday as a moisturizer and it&#x27;s heals and perfectly moisturizes.</li>
            <li> will naturally be compared to the better known Egyptian Magic, and I will tell you that I prefer Bee Magic for its consistency and smell.</li>
            <li> Heals burns, gives glowing skin, fragrance free...</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> But, once again- it is absolutely fabulous for your feet, and hands.</li>
            <li> I want to say this is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Nothing at all in comparison to Egyptian Magic which is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> this stuff is great, especially for the winter.</li>
            <li> I love putting it on at night to let it work its magic, but I am very shiny in the morning.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It might be good for use on pets as well since it is all natural, but I will have to do some more research on that first.</li>
            <li> And  I am not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> Its more like a salve than a lotion &amp; is pretty soothing.but a tad waxy.</li>
            <li> I hope that someone who may have the same problem I had with the laser hair removal burns will see this and know to buy it and BELIEVE in its magic healing ! :)</li>
            <li> A little goes a longggg way of this great cream (or more like ointment).  </li>
            <li> Similar to Egyptian Magic (I can&#x27;t tell the diff, except this is better priced), try Sweet Bee Magic.  </li>
            <li> I love that this product is all natural, but have to say I still prefer Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li> It light cream after cleaning my face I love it some much</li>
            <li> Also, great for any dry skin areas ( or areas with fungus ).  </li>
            <li> I am a senior citizen with dry skin and this product helps greatly.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin in winter.</li>
            <li> It has kept my skin looking great during the dry indoor winter air.</li>
            <li> It is great for chaffed, dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Sweet Bee Magic did not make me break out and seemed to lighten sun spots (although that could be my imagination because I like the stuff so much).</li>
            <li> Great for healing cracked heals and rough elbows.</li>
            <li> Healed so much quicker than most I have seen on others!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I decided because this was such a good deal to order through Amazon instead.</li>
            <li> then a layer of the sweet bee.  </li>
            <li> But I really do think my face looks better</li>
            <li> But overall it&#x27;s a good moisturizer to put on your knees, arms, and even rashes and things of that nature.</li>
            <li> I love it so much that I use it on my arms and legs as well.</li>
            <li> The consistency isn&#x27;t really a cream, it&#x27;s more of a creamy ointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this product because Egyptian magic cost too much.</li>
            <li> I saw this product in the healthfood store I was shopping at and figured I would give it a try (the word MAGIC sold me, as I think I really needed a miracle for my wounds)</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product - it runs a close second to Egyptian Magic but definitely a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li> It is quickly absorbed and spreads over the skin smoothly.</li>
            <li> bought this on a whim because I am very attuned to bee products and the ingredients looked lovely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d trade all the shea butter, cocoa butter and sweet almond oil on the planet for one jar of honey</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried the product and have had NO bad experiences.</li>
            <li> Clears up any redness very quickly and is safe and natural to use on my baby.</li>
            <li> and I can assure you this is the most clean, organic and natural product available in today market.</li>
            <li> I have tried Egyptian Magic before, and it really didn&#x27;t do much for me (expensive too!); however, this bee magic is amazing and the price is great!</li>
            <li> but I think the Egyptian Magic seems to linger on the skin long as a barrier and seems more smooth..</li>
            <li> It went on feeling super greasy</li>
            <li> This product is similar to the Argan Infinity Cream; the cream is definitely more oily and has a better smell.</li>
            <li> Delivery is quick too</li>
            <li> My daughter has a mild case of eczema and I have a mild case of chronic plaque psoriasis on one knee and my elbow.</li>
            <li> while my skin is still damp, I rub a 1/2-pea-sized amount of this quickly between the pads of all 8 fingers, then press all across my face, including my undereyes and lips.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m just lucky I guess), and this product helps with that as well.</li>
            <li> Tried it on my baby&#x27;s mild eczema and it did nothing.  </li>
            <li> it soaks in fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> also love having a balm that I can use for my big dogs that is absolutely safe if ingested.</li>
            <li> I am a new fan of Medicine Mama&#x27;s Sweet Bee Magic Skin Cream.</li>
            <li> Medicine Mama&#x27;s product had a superior consistency (creamy and easily spreadable) and has less of a beeswax smell.</li>
            <li> This product is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry so after I wash my face at night, while it is still damp, I apply a good moisturizer</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s good for very dry skin, but don&#x27;t get it if you have combination or oily skin</li>
            <li> Great for skin problems, a a little will go along ways.  </li>
            <li> My face still feels freshly moisturized in the morning</li>
            <li> worth every penny and a jar goes a looooonnnnnng way.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid 30&#x27;s and have tried many different products and love this one the most.</li>
            <li> It is really worth the price.</li>
            <li> whats better is its all natural</li>
            <li> This product is useful for almost anything that itches.  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s all natural and erases dryness.</li>
            <li> This was my first order and won&#x27;t be my last, I love this cream!  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping though, thanks!</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s very well worth the wait!</li>
            <li> I put on at night right before bed as a nighttime moisturizer.</li>
            <li> But, with all of the positive reviews you may want to try it for yourself!</li>
            <li> I usually make my own cream mixture which is better than this.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is not organic, but there was a marked difference with the Egyptian Magic cream.  </li>
            <li> It also seems to penetrate better than balms that can kind of sit on top of the skin, and has no fillers or creepy stuff in it.</li>
            <li> so I can only imagine how much more effective it would be if I applied it regularly.</li>
            <li> Be sure to use a tiny tiny amount and rub between hands to warm and distribute, then press onto your face.</li>
            <li> a night time moisturizer and my skin is so smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smooth on like so many other creams.  </li>
            <li> For those wondering, yea - this is Egyptian Magic with organic ingredients and no cult following.</li>
            <li> I wish I were as excited about this skin cream as most of the other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> It does go on greasy at first, but it will absorb.</li>
            <li> I first got it</li>
            <li> I put some on my face the first night I got it</li>
            <li> Also, my toddler got a bit of a heat-rash during a very humid heatwave and this product got rid of his heat-rash overnight!</li>
            <li> Hope this helps - go to their website to get first 10% off</li>
            <li> and I thought at first I would not care for it.</li>
            <li> All in One works pretty well.</li>
            <li> This is the first thing that I can tell a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> Better than Vaseline for the same uses.  </li>
            <li> It has helped his eczema so much!  </li>
            <li> I have recommended to various family and friends and they also love it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased it twice, and the second purchase was for a greater quantity.</li>
            <li> Since my first tests, I now think of honey balm first when something comes</li>
            <li> Very moisturising, but too oily, cannot touch the keyboard right after using it</li>
            <li> Because of it&#x27;s use on sensitive skin and pure ingredients, I figured it would be fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t attest to any magical properties (like making age spots vanish over night or completely erasing old scars) but for what it does, it does well.</li>
            <li> I first came across this product during sampling beauty products at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> You can use this product pretty much anywhere on your body.</li>
            <li> healthy for the skin and lasts on the skin surface a long time !  </li>
            <li> It was easy to scoop out, but left my skin feeling a bit greasy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care much for the scent of Sweet Bee either, smelled a bit like an old closet.  </li>
            <li> In the morning my skin is super soft.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a heavier face cream, or have severely dry skin you will love this.</li>
            <li> Love this to sooth and comfort dry itchy eczema.  </li>
            <li> A long time user of Egyptian Magic, the Sweet Bee MAgic is a nice and less expensive substitute, and is on par with Egyptian Magic - they apear amost identical in their consistency, scent and feel.</li>
            <li> This is really more like a balm than a cream with a very waxy/ greasy texture that does rub in as long as you don&#x27;t over do it.</li>
            <li> If you use it quickly, you can probably skip this step but if you get the big jar and keep it around or use sparingly, try the frig thing to keep it fresh and active.balm, and now use nothing else.</li>
            <li> As long as you have realistic expectations and are looking for an alternative to Egyptian Magic, you&#x27;ve found it in this salve.</li>
            <li> but this really gets into my skin, works wonders on may face as I use it every night.  </li>
            <li> and I feel very oily after using it.  </li>
            <li> Nothing has worked so fast or so well.&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li> Nothing really gets rid of them</li>
            <li> really badly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind it too much</li>
            <li> It has made my skin so much softer and nicer---</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I read another review that was really helpful about this product before I purchased it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s greasy ( just really rub it in) and</li>
            <li> I am very please with this product and will recomend it to anyone who might ask.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> and I think its emollient quality is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Try it  I use it for every thing and it appears to really work ..</li>
            <li> It is very greasy</li>
            <li> But have gotten into routine of washing then applying and allowing to absorb... and it really has not been an issue.</li>
            <li> put on cuts or burns, I dont see much of a change and the way it melts is ok.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So much like the title, it has a soothing balm effect on the skin, could be used for all over moisturizer or to heal dry/damaged skin.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps best on hands and body during the cold weather.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much either.</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> I really like this balm, its not a cream, I like the balm consistency.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this balm, it works!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really helped heal them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can really work it into your skin.  </li>
            <li> Not only have I seen improvement in my face (balance in my skin and evenness), but I have also been using this as a elbow/knee moisturizer and it works fabulously.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gets oily if you use it too much on the face</li>
            <li> It keeps my face moist for the rest of the day and if you don&#x27;t use too much</li>
            <li> it is very moisturizing, as it is almost oily as it is applied to the skin...</li>
            <li> It moisturizes, and is incredibly gentle.  </li>
            <li> but I needed FAST healing.  </li>
            <li> I have put it on burns and cuts and they heal fast.  </li>
            <li> Really good!&lt;br /&gt;I think my mom used it all,</li>
            <li> It feels very greasy in skin.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> it really doesn&#x27;t make your skin greasier than it normally</li>
            <li> Its more like a salve than a lotion and is very soothing.although a little waxy.</li>
            <li> This product is far superior to the other brand which makes a similar product, and cheaper.</li>
            <li> But I feel if you have new stretch marks that are coming in, it would work really well in getting rid of them.</li>
            <li> Good size of product which should last for a long time since a small dab spreads easily.</li>
            <li> only reason I can be so hard on this item is because I am comparing to the original Egyptian magic which really does do everything it says!</li>
            <li> It does make skin soft, so it&#x27;s a good moisturizer, just not for the face (at least for me).</li>
            <li> I have a nervous habit called \\&quot;skin picking\\&quot; which is a form of OCD: if there is anything that doesn&#x27;t feel smooth on me, I pick at it via subconscious action to make it go away.</li>
            <li> I went to Whole Foods a few weeks ago to get some Egyptian Magic to try on my son&#x27;s eczema.  </li>
            <li> Females can safely use it in female places for healing especially.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really like that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> I really like it is 100% natural</li>
            <li> soft, goes too fast, smells yukky.  </li>
            <li> After the third night my daughter brought over two homeopathic remedies for me to try, and Wala, the ithing stopped for a few hours, when I was told to take another 3 pellets each time the itch returned, the swelling got much better, and my arm now feels normal again, no thanks to Sweet Bee Magic., and again I&#x27;m told only unopened products can be returned.  </li>
            <li> I normally have tons of breakouts).</li>
            <li> So pricing is pretty much the same for this and the Josie Maran cream.</li>
            <li> It is very greasy and can be used only at night and if you have a more mature and dry skin.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;bee cream&amp;#34; is amazing for dry feet, nighttime face moisturizer, and general deep moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I put this on right before bed last night and this morning the silvery scales almost all disapeared.</li>
            <li> First of all, the consistency of this cream is more like a salve and it takes a little longer for the product to be absorbed into the skin than with a typical cream.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve learned to live with it.</li>
            <li> I also used it for the healing of a new tattoo, and my tattoo is doing wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used holistic products for over 20 years and continually try new ones.</li>
            <li> but when I go without, my face gets super dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> I scraped my upper lip once after a face first fall onto concrete</li>
            <li> The burns were fading fast and after a week and a half or so of using this product, they were pretty much GONE!  </li>
            <li> Yes, it is a little greasy when you first apply it, but it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> also have Keratosis pilaris, the tiny red bumps that many people get on the back of their arms.</li>
            <li> After a couple minutes your skin is so soft!</li>
            <li> It made both ultra soft!</li>
            <li> Forget the Neosporin or similar products - try this first</li>
            <li> If you use it quickly, you can probably skip this step but if you get the big jar and keep it around or use sparingly, try the frig thing to keep it fresh and active.</li>
            <li> I put it on scars (old and new) and they vanish.  </li>
            <li> It is sticky but worth to use for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> tried it first on areas of my lower legs which had developed red spots after hormonal therapy.</li>
            <li> and I find Bee Magic to be similar but far less noticeable</li>
            <li> Even if it does not clear your skin like it did for me, it has so many other uses, including scar treatment, stretch marks, cuticle cream, elbow/knee cream, lip balm, eyelashes, under eye puffiness, etc.</li>
            <li> We have used this product on many things like bug bite, dry skin, and any other skin irritant.</li>
            <li> The Egyptian Magic was more solid and firm with a consistency of a hard frozen stick of butter.  </li>
            <li> My acne prone skin has been clear, and I am always getting asked what I use for under eye cream.</li>
            <li> Helps clear up zits and bug bites.  </li>
            <li> But once rub it in your skin stays soft and glowing all day.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30s and still get acne in my &amp;#34;T-zone&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> only thing I don&#x27;t like much is the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 and just started getting frequent acne breakouts.</li>
            <li> I figured I would try this stuff out on it and wouldn&#x27;t you know, they have almost completely gone away after a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> I got this based on the reviews and because it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> I might be young again....</li>
            <li> The greasiness is a side effect of it being all natural, in my experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> His skin stays soft, undamaged and not irritated.</li>
            <li> With my stretch marks, they have faded some but my stretch marks are fairly old</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll completely disappear.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews I thought this would be my &amp;#34;magic cream&amp;#34; in a bottle, but it did not meet my expectations as far as a face cream.</li>
            <li> Skin feels soft and nourished.</li>
            <li> This is cheaper and so far is working.</li>
            <li> but I like natural products; it might not appeal to everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also seen my skin acne reduce and some of my old scars are going away.</li>
            <li> Now that I use this before going to bed, my hands are completely clear and so soft.  </li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s smoothing them out and softening the texture of my injured</li>
            <li> As a result, I never got an answer as to whether I received old, spoiled product, or if the rancid oil smell is what the cream is supposed to smell like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> spend a few extra bucks and get egyptian magic...</li>
            <li> So far works exactly the same, and it looks and smells the same.  </li>
            <li> I missed a spot on my back this summer when applying sunblock and it got pretty red.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 4 oz from the web because our local Whole Foods stopped carrying it and only carry the other product - Egyptian Magic which happens to be WAY more expensive.</li>
            <li> Oh, I had such high hopes for this skin cream.</li>
            <li> Now for the biggest reason why I&#x27;ve stuck with it so long is that with a combination of sunscreen and weekly exfoliation, this stuff really helped with my acne scars and icepick scars.</li>
            <li> Pure ingredients and go a very long way.</li>
            <li> Nice balm overall, a little thick and sticky at first, but it does seem to soak in so to say.</li>
            <li> Try applying daily to cold sore locations as preventative - it works great for</li>
            <li> It works really, really well for that dry winter skin</li>
            <li> burns - this cream gave instant pain relief and promoted fast healing where prior to using the cream there had been no healing.</li>
            <li> the cream soaked completely into my skin after several minutes, leaving my skin soft and not overly</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend if you are going the natural route as well!</li>
            <li> I still have a few picked wounds around my fingers, but they are substantially less than they were, since it moisturizes my skin so much better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried thus far.</li>
            <li> Also as a general moisturizer and healing</li>
            <li> My skin is so sensitive and this skin cream is the only thing that is smoothing it.</li>
            <li> Sweet Bee is less expensive than Egyptian Magic, but if you go to Costco...</li>
            <li> I had too many dark spots on my face near the chin area and chicks due to breakouts and other carelessness (not removing make up on time).</li>
            <li> + at Whole Foods or any other retailer, and truly heals your skin ailments.</li>
            <li> really wanted to like the Medicine Mama&#x27;s Sweet Bee Magic, but without a reply from the manufacturer as to whether my experience was typical of the product or if I just received a bad batch, I cannot recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I paid around $25 for the 4oz jar of this and think it will last me a long time; product was normally $29.99</li>
            <li> I am not a big fan of covering up my skin flaws with make up, I believe in a natural way to enhance my facial features.</li>
            <li> using it as a first layer before I apply make up, I use it through out the day on my hands, legs, lips and face- its little oily</li>
            <li> On a hot day it can get a little greasy, but it also makes your skin glow.</li>
            <li> I learned all the details from Whole Foods and other online research !</li>
            <li> If I try using less, I feel like I am pulling my skin too much to get coverage.  </li>
            <li> i have extremely dry and sensitive skin and this product addresses that without any harmful chemicals, i would def recommend</li>
            <li> I have dry, acne prone, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t break my skin out and has completely cleared up the dry patches I get around my eyes and mouth.  </li>
            <li> A surprising healing from nasty cow parsnip blisters was enjoyed by my chiropractor.  </li>
            <li> It is thick but melts into your skin fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> It has really helped with my eczema in conjunction with African black soap.</li>
            <li> The next morning, my face felt so soft and no new pimples.</li>
            <li> An employee at Whole Foods showed me this product and said it is essentially the same for half the price.  </li>
            <li> My hands will get very dry and irritated in the winter, but when I use this product it keeps my hands moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> Its thick enough to be an adequate eye cream and yet absorbent enough to be a daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> little greasy but absorbs fast and the skin is softer after couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> And this was a HUGE bonus: The day I purchased this product I was starting to get a cold sore, I put this on it &amp; it was completely gone 2 days later</li>
            <li> I have a extra extra dry skin.</li>
            <li> there are any concerns about greasiness, the trick is to use a small amount, melt it between your hands and gently pat it onto your skin.</li>
            <li> I hope they keep making it for a long time, because I&#x27;ve made it a daily ritual.</li>
            <li> have also used it as the following: minor burn salve, sunburn relief, mosquito bite treatment on my kids, hand cream, cuticle cream, lip balm, and foot cream.</li>
            <li> Only a pea sized amount stretches a long way</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s manageable and melts in after a while, but can feel thick at first on your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time, although I usually just buy it at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> This has dramatically helped with my skin that is dry from turning on all of the heaters.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is of beeswax, very simple and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> In fact, after only a few days, my face had completely cleared.</li>
            <li> A few days after receiving the product, I got a few insect bites on my right forearm.  </li>
            <li> A very tiny amount goes a VERY long way!</li>
            <li> It took me a minute to figure out how little is needed - even though I am a balm and salve user generally - this just goes a lot further than anything else I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> really helps with acne redness at least for me.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend it as a day moisturizer because it does not completely absorb in to my skin</li>
            <li> have even used on my dogs for minor skin infections.</li>
            <li> I expected a balm that might be helpful for the occasional scrape or rash for myself or my dogs.</li>
            <li> And it just feels right when you apply a thin layer to your face and neck.  </li>
            <li> If you do use it on your face, do it sparingly or alternate with other creams as it can block the pores.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on dry skin patches and had no change.  </li>
            <li> A friend recommended this for my dry skin and it.</li>
            <li> I put it on everything now- bug bites, cuts, cuticles, dry skin.</li>
            <li> This product cleared up the dry skin on my face after ONE day and ONE time use.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> also use it for abrasions, dry skin, lip balm...</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel hydrated and plump and soothed, I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I get dry itchy rashes on occasion).</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve applied this cream over dry patches and scratches that are healing.  </li>
            <li> I use it everywhere that is dry or has patches of ezcema.</li>
            <li> My wife uses it on her dry skin on her hands and face and loves it.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;ll last a long time because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> She is a stroke victim, Has copd, and dementia</li>
            <li> It works for scars, rough skin, healing minor cuts etc...</li>
            <li> Does not have a strong odor; mild smell nothing awful.</li>
            <li> Helps heal dry skin but works on cuts, too!  </li>
            <li> The following night I put it on again, but there were no longer any typical sunburn issues.</li>
            <li> and it seems like it is helping to make my smaller lines less visible.  </li>
            <li> This is the same thing for half the price.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my shins as they are very dry and itchy this winter.  </li>
            <li> When I opened it I immediately noticed it was a different color than my previous containers, almost a green color instead of yellow.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little.</li>
            <li> Other creams are always dry out within an hour but not this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After this lovely discovery, my elderly mother broke out in Shingles which can be extremely painful and debilitating for seniors.</li>
            <li> You might never be able to pry this stuff out of my cold dead hands.</li>
            <li> I am still getting acne just before my cycle, but that is expected for me.</li>
            <li> I even used it on rough heels and saw results in one day.</li>
            <li> The cream has a curious smell and it feels a bit grainy to me.</li>
            <li> This is not really a cream.</li>
            <li> I recently got laser hair removal and had one really bad session where I was left with many small reddish marks all over my legs, stomach, and bikini area!  </li>
            <li> It does however leave the skin soft and with a subtle glow.</li>
            <li> Also has a faint smell, which I think smells a little bit like a mild version of play-dough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way for this product.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> , a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this stuff!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it compares to all of the anti moisturizers out there, but it seems to do the same job.</li>
            <li> This fixed several weird rough patches of skin that other products had zero effect on.</li>
            <li> No more upper arm skin rough/bumps.</li>
            <li> Extremely moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers about the smell</li>
            <li> I use it on my rashes when they hurt (due to allergies -</li>
            <li> I say listen to all the other posters.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes were brittle due to mascara use but after applying this cream, I noticed they were fuller, longer, darker, etc.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with eczema for the past 8 months and had to give up all sorts facial products including eye creams.</li>
            <li> note: due to the ingredients, esp.</li>
            <li> note: due to the ingredients, esp.</li>
            <li> You can use a little bit at a time, as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d started to get wrinkles around my eyes and had some slight irritations due to eczema</li>
            <li> , I just tap a little under my eyes in the morning and any dry spots followed with a little blush &amp; bronzer.</li>
            <li> so I suspect it&#x27;s someone who wants to harm the company and seem to not care that their posting is defamatory and wrong.</li>
            <li> Absorption takes longer than your traditional products (i think so at least)</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> the olive oil, I keep only a small amount in a separate jar for everyday use.</li>
            <li> the olive oil, I keep only a small amount in a separate jar for everyday use.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the same luxurious, thick feeling that EM has, and it hasn&#x27;t made any difference to my acne or my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Used it around my eyes and as a moisturizer from my neck down, and lips before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money and definitely not true to the reviews.</li>
            <li> We live in a cold climate that is dry due to the house furnace.</li>
            <li> skin seems softer and less wrinkled.  </li>
            <li> When putting on my BB makeup in the morning it&#x27;s as if my skin has a slight glow/dewy look and</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a slight smell</li>
            <li> Also heals slight skin irritations.</li>
            <li> And half the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather odd that they posted for both products after supposedly having an issue with one canister</li>
            <li> after a few days/weeks of use this will fix some skin issues especially dry skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in my slight breakout problem, but it also doesn&#x27;t over-dry my skin or make it feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I am not good with regimens and dont use it daily</li>
            <li> It took about 6 months to get rid of the worst marks, and within a year the icepick scars are pretty much unnoticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hope it heals my cracked hands soon because it is a little pricey.</li>
            <li> Yes it is a little greasy-</li>
            <li> give it a little time to soak in.</li>
            <li> As described, paste, a little greasy if not rubbed in well.</li>
            <li> but I still dab a little on in the morning before I put on my suncrean.</li>
            <li> I have tried applying it in the morning followed by my loose powder, but I felt it made my powder look too thick.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just a little messy and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I feel it may be too heavy to use in summer.  </li>
            <li> was a few bucks cheaper</li>
            <li> I would recommend using it in the night if you are not comfortable to use it during the day for a start.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see the results in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It took a few weeks to do its thing.</li>
            <li> a few weeks now)I use it on my face, arms, and places where I have stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product to moisturize my skin and reduce wrinkles without feeling heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years now.</li>
            <li> and I liberally applied it on the wound everyday.</li>
            <li> I immediately sent her some balm, and her Shingles sores faded away and left no pain behind.  </li>
            <li> I got sunburm/rug burn (from my Gi)/whatsoever sensitivity issue, and there are a few pretty bad spots on my neck, which almost looked like they were scaling.</li>
            <li> I use it on my under-eye area, my cheeks if they get chapped or break out, my lips, raw knuckles, healing scrapes, practically everywhere.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how it works in a few months!  </li>
            <li> (I usually have them for 7days).</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a small price compared to what it has done for my skin.</li>
            <li> I am not sure I can identify the difference without comparison with a \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely natural and there is nothing artificial about it.</li>
            <li> Usually I have hangnails and cracks all over my hands this time of year.  </li>
            <li> When I opened the jar, I immediately noticed an off smell, but decided to try a small sample on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a hard time finding a cream that I could use around my eyes and on my face</li>
            <li> I applied this product generously in the affected areas at least twice a day, and I swear I noticed a difference within 3 days...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as thick or goopy as Vaseline.</li>
            <li> but you will have to take 5 mins to slowly massage your body.</li>
            <li> purchased this cream in a desperate attempt save my face which is combination oily and dry.</li>
            <li> Seriously, buy it.</li>
            <li> Since the majority of dry skin issues are around my cuticles, my fingernails usually look extremely painful because they are almost always bleeding as a result of my picking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m nervous about using lotions because they all seem to make it worse</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tired it for anything else yet.</li>
            <li> Everything I put on it seems to evaporate in thin air.  </li>
            <li> Yuck on those ingredients - they do not work at all for me and just make any problem worse.</li>
            <li> For 4oz, and 27.00 dollars, yes it is expensive-</li>
            <li> Horrible smell, is it possible that it is &#x27;spoiled&#x27; ?</li>
            <li> it unfortunately caused my acne-prone skin to break out on my cheeks and forehead.</li>
            <li> so you cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> No offensive rancid odor, just a faint neutral scent, and</li>
            <li> I put a thicker layer around my eyes, mouth, and forehead before bed and then apply a very thin layer in the mornings before I put on my sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Husband has terribly dry hands, they crack something terrible.</li>
            <li> It was a nightmare- looked like chicken pox.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not that bad at all.</li>
            <li> It also smelled bad, not at all like honey like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> His hands are improving, not cracking so badly</li>
            <li> Has bad taste also.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t as bad as some of the horror photos I have seen online</li>
            <li> Although it smells a bit like play-dough, I don&#x27;t have any bad reaction to the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> and I was so worried that this was my worst idea ever.</li>
            <li> you are just glopping it onto your face, it will feel disgusting.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> A little goes a long way with this stuff!  It works really, really well for that dry winter skin but I feel it may be too heavy to use in summer.  We&#x27;ll see how it works in a few months!  It does feel a bit greasy so you can&#x27;t use a lot when applying.  But once rub it in your skin stays soft and glowing all day.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I was using coconut oil for a while on my face but this really gets into my skin, works wonders on may face as I use it every night.  I even put it on my callused feet.</li>
            <li> The best moisturizer I have ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried them all!</li>
            <li> I love that this product is all natural, but have to say I still prefer Egyptian Magic. Quick shipping though, thanks!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome for your skin!</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT moisturizer for the price. I use it all over my body and face, and it does the trick for everything. I&#x27;m not sure how it compares to all of the anti moisturizers out there, but it seems to do the same job.</li>
            <li> A little goes a longggg way of this great cream (or more like ointment).  I have been using especially around my eyes and  skin seems softer and less wrinkled.  Good size of product which should last for a long time since a small dab spreads easily.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer as a NIGHT moisturizer.  I do not recommend it as a day moisturizer because it does not completely absorb in to my skin and I feel very oily after using it.  If I try using less, I feel like I am pulling my skin too much to get coverage.  I love putting it on at night to let it work its magic, but I am very shiny in the morning.  I have tried applying it in the morning followed by my loose powder, but I felt it made my powder look too thick.  I am in my early 30s and still get acne in my &amp;#34;T-zone&amp;#34; the week before my period....this moisturizer did not worsen or cure my problem.  My skin feels moist and looks very healthy...I am still getting acne just before my cycle, but that is expected for me.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful stuff. It took me a minute to figure out how little is needed - even though I am a balm and salve user generally - this just goes a lot further than anything else I&#x27;ve used. It also seems to penetrate better than balms that can kind of sit on top of the skin, and has no fillers or creepy stuff in it. Pure ingredients and go a very long way. For those wondering, yea - this is Egyptian Magic with organic ingredients and no cult following. And way better value - win!</li>
            <li> I wish I were as excited about this skin cream as most of the other reviewers.  I&#x27;ve used it on dry skin patches and had no change.  I&#x27;ve used it as face moisturizer and to me it feels slimy and greasy.  My husband tried it on his eczema and it didn&#x27;t give him any relief either.  But, with all of the positive reviews you may want to try it for yourself!</li>
            <li> I bought this cream for the good reviews it has. And  I am not disappointed at all. I love this cream.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived on time, very good package.&lt;br /&gt;A little greasy but absorbs fast and the skin is softer after couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like much is the smell. But it&#x27;s ok, I can survive with this.&lt;br /&gt;Is a very good cream and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this product. I love it! It is all I use on my face. My acne prone skin has been clear, and I am always getting asked what I use for under eye cream. It does go on greasy at first, but it will absorb. Use sparingly in the morning and let it absorb or rub in well if you wear foundation. I don&#x27;t, I just tap a little under my eyes in the morning and any dry spots followed with a little blush &amp; bronzer. I slather it on at night though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also great on sunburns! I missed a spot on my back this summer when applying sunblock and it got pretty red. I put it on before bed and when I got up the next day. The following night I put it on again, but there were no longer any typical sunburn issues. And it never peeled. Healed so much quicker than most I have seen on others!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have even used on my dogs for minor skin infections. This product truly is the greatest, I never go without!!</li>
            <li> I have a extra extra dry skin. Other creams are always dry out within an hour but not this one. It is sticky but worth to use for my dry skin. I already finished 2 of them and will keep order it. I also like it&#x27;s ingridents.</li>
            <li> Great for face and Keratosis pilaris&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this cream in a desperate attempt save my face which is combination oily and dry. I&#x27;m 30 and just started getting frequent acne breakouts. I&#x27;m nervous about using lotions because they all seem to make it worse but when I go without, my face gets super dry and flaky. I can&#x27;t win. I read a review that someone else used it on acne prone skin and figured I would give it a try. It went on feeling super greasy and I was so worried that this was my worst idea ever. Not at all! The next morning, my face felt so soft and no new pimples. In fact, after only a few days, my face had completely cleared. Magic. Nothing has worked so fast or so well.&lt;br /&gt;BUT WAIT! THERE&#x27;S MORE!!&lt;br /&gt;I also have Keratosis pilaris, the tiny red bumps that many people get on the back of their arms. Nothing really gets rid of them but I&#x27;ve learned to live with it. I figured I would try this stuff out on it and wouldn&#x27;t you know, they have almost completely gone away after a couple weeks. I am not good with regimens and dont use it daily so I can only imagine how much more effective it would be if I applied it regularly.</li>
            <li> I use this a lot in my house. Great on cuts, rashes, chapped lips &amp; under the eyes.</li>
            <li> I use this instead of diaper rash cream.  Works awesome!</li>
            <li> It light cream after cleaning my face I love it some much</li>
            <li> This product is $30+ at Whole Foods or any other retailer, and truly heals your skin ailments. Definitely recommend if you are going the natural route as well!</li>
            <li> I ordered this just after reading of its, merits, one of which was treating insect bites of all sorts.  A few days after receiving the product, I got a few insect bites on my right forearm.  So glad I had gotten sweet Bee Magic, so I used it liberally and it did nothing.  I was up for several nights as my arm swelled, got very red and itched constantly.  After the third night my daughter brought over two homeopathic remedies for me to try, and Wala, the ithing stopped for a few hours, when I was told to take another 3 pellets each time the itch returned, the swelling got much better, and my arm now feels normal again, no thanks to Sweet Bee Magic., and again I&#x27;m told only unopened products can be returned.  Guess I shouldn&#x27;t be ordering this type of thing from Amazon.</li>
            <li> A multitude of uses. Helps heal dry skin but works on cuts, too!  Keeps infection at bay.  Love these products!</li>
            <li> The product is GREAT as a body MOISTURIZER but nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;It was either this or the Egyptian Magic(another brand with supposedly the same ingredients that I have yet to try)&lt;br /&gt;This was a few bucks cheaper so I thought I&#x27;d try it.&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers mention how it&#x27;s helped them with stretch marks and acne scars, which I think is all BS.&lt;br /&gt;When I first got it I used it on my acne prone/acne scarred face and it made me break out really badly.&lt;br /&gt;Again, the moisturizing part of the deal was superb but it wasn&#x27;t worth the breakout.&lt;br /&gt;So instead I religiously used this on my stretch marks, but it didn&#x27;t lighten at all.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I just use it as a body moisturizer after my showers. Leaves you feeling a bit waxy and extra hydrated but I personally love that feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Should be refrigerated for the most part because it&#x27;s way too mushy if you don&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend hates the smell and says it smells funky. I don&#x27;t mind it too much but it&#x27;s one of those acquired, nature type of aroma.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews I have to say I feel doped.  This is INCREDIBLY GREASY.  I put some on my face the first night I got it and I had to change my pillow case the next morning.  I tried it on my hands the next evening.  I had to change our sheets the next morning!  This is not a product that can be used if you are touching things or don&#x27;t want people to know you are greased up.  Not worth the money and definitely not true to the reviews.</li>
            <li> WOW!!! Got it for a good friend recovering from radiation treatment of the upper lip - painful radiation burns - this cream gave instant pain relief and promoted fast healing where prior to using the cream there had been no healing.</li>
            <li> Wonderful all purpose product. Despite the oil content, it has done wonders for my acne-prone skin. It does everything the description claims.</li>
            <li> This product is so amazing! I bought it when it went on sale at my local Sprouts supermarket, but when I run out of this I would probably pay retail for it. I think it&#x27;ll last a long time because a little goes a long way. It has made my skin so much softer and nicer---I don&#x27;t wear any foundation or makeup now (&amp; surprisingly I haven&#x27;t had any pimples since using product...I normally have tons of breakouts). And this was a HUGE bonus: The day I purchased this product I was starting to get a cold sore, I put this on it &amp; it was completely gone 2 days later (I usually have them for 7days). Also, my toddler got a bit of a heat-rash during a very humid heatwave and this product got rid of his heat-rash overnight! I&#x27;m so impressed with this product, I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I got this based on the reviews and because it&#x27;s all natural. I like the consistency of the product. It&#x27;s not as thick or goopy as Vaseline. It&#x27;s more like a balm. I use it on my face, neck and hands. I have combination normal/oily skin and have had no problems with this product. It does help with skin texture. I put on at night right before bed as a nighttime moisturizer. When putting on my BB makeup in the morning it&#x27;s as if my skin has a slight glow/dewy look and my makeup seems to set better.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a slight smell but it&#x27;s not that bad at all. I purchased this product at Sprouts and plan on using from now on in combination with my Josie Maran Argan Oil and Josie Maran Argan Infinity Cream. This product is similar to the Argan Infinity Cream; the cream is definitely more oily and has a better smell. I like this better as it isn&#x27;t as oily. A little goes a long way for this product. I paid around $25 for the 4oz jar of this and think it will last me a long time; product was normally $29.99 but Sprouts had all of their beauty products on sale at 25% off when I purchased. So pricing is pretty much the same for this and the Josie Maran cream. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love it ! Love it ! Love it. I first came across this product during sampling beauty products at Whole Foods. I am not a big fan of covering up my skin flaws with make up, I believe in a natural way to enhance my facial features. I had too many dark spots on my face near the chin area and chicks due to breakouts and other carelessness (not removing make up on time). I have been using this product from last 1.5 years and I can assure you this is the most clean, organic and natural product available in today market. Please watch their company video to get more inform- I researched about the company and I feel they are responsible and sincere to deliver best in the market. For 4oz, and 27.00 dollars, yes it is expensive- but once you start noticing the difference ! I bet you will be hooked-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I using it as a first layer before I apply make up, I use it through out the day on my hands, legs, lips and face- its little oily but you will have to take 5 mins to slowly massage your body. I would recommend using it in the night if you are not comfortable to use it during the day for a start. Its better than Egyptian Magic cream available in the market.I learned all the details from Whole Foods and other online research ! Hope this helps - go to their website to get first 10% off and once you sign up they have big sales every two weeks or so- with free shipping- ( if you don&#x27;t have amazon prime) and they will also send you samples with your purchase. Delivery is quick too</li>
            <li> Horrible smell, is it possible that it is &#x27;spoiled&#x27; ? I had to use my mouth to breath if I put it on my face!</li>
            <li> This was my first order and won&#x27;t be my last, I love this cream!  It was recommended by a local store I shop in but they were out of stock so I found it here and decided to order some and try it.  Best cream ever!</li>
            <li> Nice balm overall, a little thick and sticky at first, but it does seem to soak in so to say.</li>
            <li> I like it. We&#x27;ll see the results in a few weeks. I might be young again....I wish.</li>
            <li> Product can appear a bit greasy on the skin if not used sparingly. It does however leave the skin soft and with a subtle glow. Also heals slight skin irritations. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer and is diminishing fine lines and clearing my complexion. This is my second order.</li>
            <li> Great for skin problems, a a little will go along ways.  Helps clear up zits and bug bites.  Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I have patch of eczema, and this cream helps a lot! I hope they keep making it for a long time, because I&#x27;ve made it a daily ritual.</li>
            <li> I use this at night on my face, legs and arms. We live in a cold climate that is dry due to the house furnace. It&#x27;s great, but too oily for day time wear under makeup!</li>
            <li> I use this for mosquito bites, burns, tattoo healing, and lip balm. Amazing stuff!!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Bee Magic! I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time, although I usually just buy it at Whole Foods. I decided because this was such a good deal to order through Amazon instead. When I opened it I immediately noticed it was a different color than my previous containers, almost a green color instead of yellow. It also smelled bad, not at all like honey like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Goes on nice and smooth and feels good. Nice organic ingredients. I hope it heals my cracked hands soon because it is a little pricey.</li>
            <li> This fixed several weird rough patches of skin that other products had zero effect on. It took a few weeks to do its thing.</li>
            <li> I read another review that was really helpful about this product before I purchased it. Like I said, it&#x27;s cheaper than Egyptian Magic but not as good. It&#x27;s greasy ( just really rub it in) and the smell is not the most pleasing but it is not bad as a substitute..</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I&#x27;ve been using for a month now and my skin is in the best shape it has been since my early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Yes it is a little greasy- give it a little time to soak in. After a couple minutes your skin is so soft! It has really helped with my eczema in conjunction with African black soap. My skin looks great!  I love this stuff! So amazing :-)</li>
            <li> AMAZING! A friend recommended this for my dry skin and it. is. incredible! I put it on everything now- bug bites, cuts, cuticles, dry skin. I even use it on my pup whose been having skin issues! I will buy for the rest of my life!</li>
            <li> Best for my winter skin - very cost effective.  This can be used on hands, feet, elbows - even face.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I use it everyday as a moisturizer and it&#x27;s heals and perfectly moisturizes. I&#x27;ll continue to use this.</li>
            <li> We just received this yesterday - both my daughter and I have skin conditions I thought this would be helpful with after reading some reviews. My daughter has a mild case of eczema and I have a mild case of chronic plaque psoriasis on one knee and my elbow. I put this on right before bed last night and this morning the silvery scales almost all disapeared. I am very please with this product and will recomend it to anyone who might ask.</li>
            <li> Wonderful BEES. I love them. SOOTHING THE IRRITATION IN ANKLES.</li>
            <li> We have used this product on many things like bug bite, dry skin, and any other skin irritant. It works well in reducing swelling and sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We even started to use it as a diaper rash cream for my son who is very allergic to Desitin and it has been wonderful. Clears up any redness very quickly and is safe and natural to use on my baby.</li>
            <li> This product is far superior to the other brand which makes a similar product, and cheaper. Medicine Mama&#x27;s product had a superior consistency (creamy and easily spreadable) and has less of a beeswax smell. This &amp;#34;bee cream&amp;#34; is amazing for dry feet, nighttime face moisturizer, and general deep moisturizer.  It&#x27;s best used in winter or for VERY dry skin. I love that it also comes in a stick for use on-the-go. Love it!!</li>
            <li> A repeat customer says it all.  But I have to write more words. non-greasy, smooth, great for sensitive skin and cuticles.</li>
            <li> Love this! All organic ingredients...love it as a nightcream, body moisturizer, i even use it instead of pomade for  my hair</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product! I bought it as a night time moisturizer and my skin is so smooth and soft! Yes, it is a little greasy when you first apply it, but it absorbs quickly. The greasiness is a side effect of it being all natural, in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used it as the following: minor burn salve, sunburn relief, mosquito bite treatment on my kids, hand cream, cuticle cream, lip balm, and foot cream. I also use it as \\&quot;magic cream\\&quot; on my kids&#x27; owies :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably always have a jar of this around from now on!</li>
            <li> By far the best skincare product that I have found for my hands during the winter. My hands will get very dry and irritated in the winter, but when I use this product it keeps my hands moisturized and soft. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> First of all, the consistency of this cream is more like a salve and it takes a little longer for the product to be absorbed into the skin than with a typical cream. I happen to like this and I think its emollient quality is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;This will naturally be compared to the better known Egyptian Magic, and I will tell you that I prefer Bee Magic for its consistency and smell. I am not a fan of the Egyptian Magic smell and I find Bee Magic to be similar but far less noticeable (ie unpleasant).&lt;br /&gt;And the price? Well, it&#x27;s way cheaper- so to me, Bee Magic is a no brainer.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy both the Sweet Bee Magic and Egyptian Magic for comparison.  I like the Sweet Bee, but found that it was way greasier than the Egyptian Magic and took a bit longer to penetrate the skin.  The Egyptian Magic was more solid and firm with a consistency of a hard frozen stick of butter.  You need to scoop a bit and put some on the back of your hand and basically melt it by rubbing it before applying to skin.  The Sweet Bee was more like butter out of the refrigerator for 10 minutes.  It was easy to scoop out, but left my skin feeling a bit greasy. I hope that makes sense with the butter analogy.  I didn&#x27;t care much for the scent of Sweet Bee either, smelled a bit like an old closet.  Egyptian magic didn&#x27;t have any smell to it.  Overall both products have the same ingredients, but the amounts of each probably varies.  I would choose Egyptian Magic over Sweet Bee.  Sweet Bee is less expensive than Egyptian Magic, but if you go to Costco...they&#x27;re selling a 4 oz and a 2 oz together for the price of 29.99, so it comes out about the same if you get it there.  Hope this info helps.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a chamois  anti- chaffing cream for bicycling.  Seemed to do the trick  just fine. It washed out each time which is good since it is very greasy.  Haven&#x27;t tired it for anything else yet.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my face, neck, elbows and hands, it works great.  This product is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> Try it  I use it for every thing and it appears to really work ..no infex0ctions quicker healing.. yadda yadda</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry so after I wash my face at night, while it is still damp, I apply a good moisturizer then a layer of the sweet bee.  My face still feels freshly moisturized in the morning and it seems like it is helping to make my smaller lines less visible.  It is very greasy but it&#x27;s a small price compared to what it has done for my skin.</li>
            <li> This cream is very rich and creamy and helps with cracked skin, but it&#x27;s really good only for the roughest parts - heels and elbows because it&#x27;s so rich, but works great !</li>
            <li> This is good but I think the Egyptian Magic seems to linger on the skin long as a barrier and seems more smooth..</li>
            <li> The consistency is a bit greasy and I thought at first I would not care for it. But have gotten into routine of washing then applying and allowing to absorb... and it really has not been an issue. I do feel my skin has improved in both color and overall appearance.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve seen a lot of reviewers compare this as the cheaper version of Egyptian Magic and because of that I decided to order both and compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first problem that I had with this item was that it doesn&#x27;t smell good. Because of it&#x27;s use on sensitive skin and pure ingredients, I figured it would be fragrance free. Well, it might be fragrance free but the natural smell of the product isn&#x27;t great at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When put on cuts or burns, I dont see much of a change and the way it melts is ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I can be so hard on this item is because I am comparing to the original Egyptian magic which really does do everything it says! Heals burns, gives glowing skin, fragrance free...etc....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: spend a few extra bucks and get egyptian magic...</li>
            <li> My husband uses this for the tattoo he is getting done, in stages, on his back. His skin stays soft, undamaged and not irritated. The ink isn&#x27;t drawn out by the cream either. It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the results. Its more like a salve than a lotion &amp; is pretty soothing.but a tad waxy. I&#x27;d recommend keeping it in the fridge so that it doesn&#x27;t degrade. I&#x27;d give 4.5 stars but since that&#x27;s not an option, 5.</li>
            <li> So much like the title, it has a soothing balm effect on the skin, could be used for all over moisturizer or to heal dry/damaged skin.  The jelly propolis/honey properties contain anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties.  And it just feels right when you apply a thin layer to your face and neck.  You just feel protected.  Its thick enough to be an adequate eye cream and yet absorbent enough to be a daily moisturizer.  I consider this as a necessary element of my all-natural anti-sulfate beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> Have been using for about 3 weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;After washing, I spray with the Alaffia Coconut Water Toner then, while my skin is still damp, I rub a 1/2-pea-sized amount of this quickly between the pads of all 8 fingers, then press all across my face, including my undereyes and lips.  This takes a good 10-15 minutes to soak in, but in the evenings that&#x27;s just fine.  In the morning my skin is super soft.  This has dramatically helped with my skin that is dry from turning on all of the heaters.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is of beeswax, very simple and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;Also great on my elbows.  Loving it as a lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;Will be purchasing this again!&lt;br /&gt;I only wish it wasn&#x27;t *quite* so greasy.  It&#x27;s manageable and melts in after a while, but can feel thick at first on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are just glopping it onto your face, it will feel disgusting.  Be sure to use a tiny tiny amount and rub between hands to warm and distribute, then press onto your face.</li>
            <li> As described, paste, a little greasy if not rubbed in well.</li>
            <li> the magic of honey! this product changed my life, i will not find myself without it! i use it everywhere on my body to moisturize and nourish. it works well on both my babies skin too</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t my favorite scent but it is great for skin and feet.  No more upper arm skin rough/bumps.</li>
            <li> It is a good product.  It works well.</li>
            <li> Its not egyptian magic, but it sure is easier to apply. LOVE LOVE LOVE it, and the price is alot better than egyptian magic, and the ingredients are organic, could you ask for a better product!!</li>
            <li> Husband has terribly dry hands, they crack something terrible. I saw this on Amazon as a lightning deal and was impressed by how many people were buying it. I took a chance and bought it, and my husband has been using it every night. His hands are improving, not cracking so badly and he seems to like it. Good purchase.</li>
            <li> And half the price. I have scaly, peeling skin on my eyelids. This product cleared up the dry skin on my face after ONE day and ONE time use. I also have psoriasis on my legs (I&#x27;m just lucky I guess), and this product helps with that as well. Amazing product for winter, better than any lotion you have, and better than Egyptian Magic if you have tried that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Misc details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes in a jar, in a balm-like form. You can use a little bit at a time, as a little goes a long way. Could be described as oily, once it goes on your skin (I have never had a break-out from this product and I am acne prone). Also has a faint smell, which I think smells a little bit like a mild version of play-dough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love it and the mild smell does not bother me. I use it on my feet, face, and legs. You can use this product pretty much anywhere on your body. Love.</li>
            <li> The Sweet Bee Magic: All in One works pretty well. I&#x27;ve been using it on a regular basis since I got it.(It&#x27;s been a few weeks now)I use it on my face, arms, and places where I have stretch marks. I&#x27;ve noticed that my face looks smoother, brighter, and looks healthier. Although, when I put the cream on my face, it goes on a bit oily. And my skin is already somewhat oily so I have been breaking out some. But I really do think my face looks better so I&#x27;ll still use it on my face. With my stretch marks, they have faded some but my stretch marks are fairly old so I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll completely disappear. But I feel if you have new stretch marks that are coming in, it would work really well in getting rid of them. But overall it&#x27;s a good moisturizer to put on your knees, arms, and even rashes and things of that nature. I think it&#x27;s a great buy, and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin.  Everything I put on it seems to evaporate in thin air.  This is the first thing that I can tell a noticeable difference.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Purchased this as the cure for my chapped lips...and I still have chapped lips. Does not work any better then blistex. Has bad taste also. This product is over priced in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I just got this item tonight, and I started using it.  It is good, not greasy or oily. My skin was peeling off this winter, now I am waiting for the result after using this product.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  ONLY use alittle on your face ... it&#x27;s enough ...  it does the trick !  Also great to use for massage .... healthy for the skin and lasts on the skin surface a long time !  Also, great for any dry skin areas ( or areas with fungus ).  I had cracked skin along the back of my heals.  After using this product, my heals have never been better !</li>
            <li> Tried it on my baby&#x27;s mild eczema and it did nothing.  The smell isn&#x27;t nice to us either.  It was too oily for us.</li>
            <li> Bit greasy feeling but I think that&#x27;s the point! I had a rash that I applied this to (on a whim) and very impressed with the improvement. I am a senior citizen with dry skin and this product helps greatly. I even used it on rough heels and saw results in one day. I ordered it for a friend also - I think she will like this as well as the Merle Norman product she uses now.</li>
            <li> we&#x27;ve been using this product for years - nothing beats it for getting rid of diaper rash! also use it for abrasions, dry skin, lip balm...it really is magical in it&#x27;s healing and soothing capacity! worth every penny and a jar goes a looooonnnnnng way.</li>
            <li> i have extremely dry and sensitive skin and this product addresses that without any harmful chemicals, i would def recommend</li>
            <li> Very moisturising, but too oily, cannot touch the keyboard right after using it</li>
            <li> I am a new fan of Medicine Mama&#x27;s Sweet Bee Magic Skin Cream. A long time user of Egyptian Magic, the Sweet Bee MAgic is a nice and less expensive substitute, and is on par with Egyptian Magic - they apear amost identical in their consistency, scent and feel. I use it on craked and damaged skin and it performs like a charm. I can&#x27;t attest to any magical properties (like making age spots vanish over night or completely erasing old scars) but for what it does, it does well. As long as you have realistic expectations and are looking for an alternative to Egyptian Magic, you&#x27;ve found it in this salve. I recommend it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews I thought this would be my &amp;#34;magic cream&amp;#34; in a bottle, but it did not meet my expectations as far as a face cream. I love the texture for my hands and feet. I would not necessarily put this on my face as it is a bit to greasy for me. It did not irritate my skin but it feels like Vaseline. If you are looking for a heavier face cream, or have severely dry skin you will love this. As for me with combination-sensitive skin, I will stick to using something else. But, once again- it is absolutely fabulous for your feet, and hands. It made both ultra soft!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product to moisturize my skin and reduce wrinkles without feeling heavy or greasy. This product does both. On a hot day it can get a little greasy, but it also makes your skin glow. I love it so much that I use it on my arms and legs as well. A little goes a long way. Sweet Bee Magic did not make me break out and seemed to lighten sun spots (although that could be my imagination because I like the stuff so much). I am in my mid 30&#x27;s and have tried many different products and love this one the most. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Extremely moisturizing. Skin feels soft and nourished. Great for dry skin in winter.</li>
            <li> The consistency isn&#x27;t really a cream, it&#x27;s more of a creamy ointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend using this on your face if you have oily or acne-prone skin like I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it is a good product. I use it as an eye cream at night, and a lip balm during the day. Also as a general moisturizer and healing cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might be good for use on pets as well since it is all natural, but I will have to do some more research on that first.</li>
            <li> Quality Enriched cream like u expect to include (by name of product) with not a lot of additives. Jus need alittle goes along way. Price is good</li>
            <li> Love this to sooth and comfort dry itchy eczema.  I put it on 2-3 times a day for best results.  I really like that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> The cream has a curious smell and it feels a bit grainy to me. One customer left a one star review, saying theirs was rancid. I am not sure I can identify the difference without comparison with a \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; one.  This is not really a cream. It is very greasy and can be used only at night and if you have a more mature and dry skin. Perhaps best on hands and body during the cold weather. I never used Egyptian magic so I cannot make a comparison between the two.  I usually make my own cream mixture which is better than this.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for about a month now. My skin feels better than ever. I&#x27;m hoping it will help even my skin tone too. It doesn&#x27;t take much either. Almost bought Egyptian magic until I looked on this site! Glad I did! This is cheaper and so far is working.</li>
            <li> I really like it but I like natural products; it might not appeal to everyone. Its more like a salve than a lotion and is very soothing.although a little waxy. I keep it in the refrigerator because it is organic and I don&#x27;t want it to degrade.</li>
            <li> I really like this balm, its not a cream, I like the balm consistency. Been using it for 2 weeks. Used it around my eyes and as a moisturizer from my neck down, and lips before I go to bed. I don&#x27;t use it on my face as it does not say its non-comedegnic or anti acneic, don&#x27;t want to take the chance to find out. It makes my skin feel hydrated and plump and soothed, I have dry skin. I agree with other reviewers about the smell but it goes away seconds after it is applied. Use it over my excema ointment on my upper arms. I really like it is 100% natural, a little goes a long way. I highly recommend this balm, it works!</li>
            <li> I want to say this is a fantastic product. I&#x27;ve always had a hard time finding a cream that I could use around my eyes and on my face and I&#x27;ve started to use this one. It&#x27;s strong so you&#x27;ll see that you need to wait but it DOES absorb into your skin. I find that my body soaks it all in and it definitely has made a big difference in my skin texture. I&#x27;d started to get wrinkles around my eyes and had some slight irritations due to eczema and I started to put this around my eyes and the wrinkles have vanished and the irritation is gone now. I&#x27;ve also seen my skin acne reduce and some of my old scars are going away. I ordered the 4 oz from the web because our local Whole Foods stopped carrying it and only carry the other product - Egyptian Magic which happens to be WAY more expensive. Frankly, I&#x27;ll be happy to wait and order it through the web and all they did was lose the opportunity to sell it to me. I also like the fact that I can get a 4 oz bottle. I use it on my rashes when they hurt (due to allergies - I get dry itchy rashes on occasion). It&#x27;s really helped heal them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note, the person who posted that this product has chemicals is ignorant. It&#x27;s completely natural and there is nothing artificial about it. They&#x27;ve posted two postings - both for the 2 oz and 4 oz so I suspect it&#x27;s someone who wants to harm the company and seem to not care that their posting is defamatory and wrong. It&#x27;s rather odd that they posted for both products after supposedly having an issue with one canister so I suspect that it&#x27;s someone whose lying and probably isn&#x27;t truthful. I say listen to all the other posters. We&#x27;ve tried the product and have had NO bad experiences. You won&#x27;t regret your purchase. This company listens and even posts responses to products as they care for their customers.</li>
            <li> soft, goes too fast, smells yukky.  Nothing at all in comparison to Egyptian Magic which is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> ...my friend says it is great. Bought it based on the reviews when I bought a similar product. She says it great.</li>
            <li> Very unusual skin cream but very effective!  It doesn&#x27;t smooth on like so many other creams.  This is thicker.  You can really work it into your skin.  And the best part?  NO GREASY, STINKY, RESIDUE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s been a god-send this winter!  Usually I have hangnails and cracks all over my hands this time of year.  Now that I use this before going to bed, my hands are completely clear and so soft.  My husband has started using it, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve applied this cream over dry patches and scratches that are healing.  So far, it&#x27;s smoothing them out and softening the texture of my injured skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend!  Very nice product.</li>
            <li> My skin can&#x27;t get enough of this cream.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. My skin just drinks it up. Great price, fast delivery - thank you Amazon</li>
            <li> Works very good on my wife&#x27;s underarms.  She is a stroke victim, Has copd, and dementia but I love her and have got her out of the nursing home twice and still have her at home.</li>
            <li> Similar to Egyptian Magic (I can&#x27;t tell the diff, except this is better priced), try Sweet Bee Magic.  Very good product.  Rather similar to a petroleum jelly, seals in moisture, but is organic and not a petroleum-based product.</li>
            <li> Oh, I had such high hopes for this skin cream. I used it as a face moisturizer in the AM and PM and in about 3 days it unfortunately caused my acne-prone skin to break out on my cheeks and forehead. I now only use around my eyes at night. It does make skin soft, so it&#x27;s a good moisturizer, just not for the face (at least for me).</li>
            <li> My daughter encouraged me to try this, after she used it for months for herself and her infant daughter. Awesome all-purpose moisturizing/healing ointment. A very tiny amount goes a VERY long way!</li>
            <li> I have tried Egyptian Magic before, and it really didn&#x27;t do much for me (expensive too!); however, this bee magic is amazing and the price is great! Maybe it is that the consistency is more oily. I have dry, acne prone, sensitive skin. I can&#x27;t wait to order more of this product. Not only have I seen improvement in my face (balance in my skin and evenness), but I have also been using this as a elbow/knee moisturizer and it works fabulously. I love using this cream for my eyelashes. My eyelashes were brittle due to mascara use but after applying this cream, I noticed they were fuller, longer, darker, etc. I definitely recommend it and if the only thing holding you back from purchasing this product is whether or not it will work for your face, I suggest buying it. Even if it does not clear your skin like it did for me, it has so many other uses, including scar treatment, stretch marks, cuticle cream, elbow/knee cream, lip balm, eyelashes, under eye puffiness, etc. (the list goes on).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product. Seriously, buy it.</li>
            <li> I have a nervous habit called \\&quot;skin picking\\&quot; which is a form of OCD: if there is anything that doesn&#x27;t feel smooth on me, I pick at it via subconscious action to make it go away. Since the majority of dry skin issues are around my cuticles, my fingernails usually look extremely painful because they are almost always bleeding as a result of my picking. A clerk at Whole Foods recommended this to me, and I am so glad! I still have a few picked wounds around my fingers, but they are substantially less than they were, since it moisturizes my skin so much better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried thus far. (Having been dealing with this since I was a child, I have sampled most products on the market!) I also used it for the healing of a new tattoo, and my tattoo is doing wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a silver bullet, but it does help more than anything else I&#x27;ve yet to try.</li>
            <li> I use this at night as a face lubricant. It only takes a little. It also is great for bug bites and itching.</li>
            <li> I got this from Whole Foods because someone Amazon reviewer said this is just as good as Egyptian Magic (which was what I wanted to get originally). It doesn&#x27;t seem to help with my acnes (I guess it&#x27;s just hormonal issue I am having) but it does a good job healing my skin. I got sunburm/rug burn (from my Gi)/whatsoever sensitivity issue, and there are a few pretty bad spots on my neck, which almost looked like they were scaling. I started rubbing this cream on my neck every mornig and night and my neck is healed now and even the lines on my neck are noticeably lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets oily if you use it too much on the face but I still dab a little on in the morning before I put on my suncrean. It keeps my face moist for the rest of the day and if you don&#x27;t use too much it really doesn&#x27;t make your skin greasier than it normally is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think this is a pretty good product for the price and I have recommended it to people who are having some skin issues.</li>
            <li> This is like liquid gold!  It works for scars, rough skin, healing minor cuts etc... It is really worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years now. I did switch brands when Egyptian Magic raised their prices but both work amazingly well. I scraped my upper lip once after a face first fall onto concrete and I liberally applied it on the wound everyday. By the end of a week, the wound was gone and left no scar! I also apply it around my eyes and my once nonexistent lower lashes are now longer than before. Now for the biggest reason why I&#x27;ve stuck with it so long is that with a combination of sunscreen and weekly exfoliation, this stuff really helped with my acne scars and icepick scars. It took about 6 months to get rid of the worst marks, and within a year the icepick scars are pretty much unnoticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there are any concerns about greasiness, the trick is to use a small amount, melt it between your hands and gently pat it onto your skin. Absorption takes longer than your traditional products (i think so at least) but I think it&#x27;s very well worth the wait!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to decide whether or not I like this product...it is very moisturizing, as it is almost oily as it is applied to the skin...but it&#x27;s just a little messy and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed any \\&quot;magic\\&quot; yet, either, but, I also haven&#x27;t had an allergic reaction to it, either!</li>
            <li> The press about this product is accurate.  I use it everywhere, but the most striking change is around my eyes.  It moisturizes, and is incredibly gentle.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I use it on everything. I have like five bottles ,and I keep them everywhere I use this on my skin, on eczema, on burns, on everything...hair too. It&#x27;s awesome!!!</li>
            <li> This formula is perhaps almost identical to Egyptian Magic Skin Cream but at about 75% the price.  So far works exactly the same, and it looks and smells the same.  Just another version of an Olive Oil, Bee pollen cream.  Solid at room temp, melts on contact with body heat.  Better than Vaseline for the same uses.  Great face cream... after a few days/weeks of use this will fix some skin issues especially dry skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because Egyptian magic cost too much. it had the same ingredients so i decided to give it a try. this stuff is great, especially for the winter. i don&#x27;t have problematic skin so i cant speak for acne treatment. but i think my skin feels softer and looks more radiant. whats better is its all natural so you cant go wrong. my cats love it too. they always try to eat it out the jar. some advice though...use it only at night. i find when i wear it in the day it attracts bees.</li>
            <li> I recently got laser hair removal and had one really bad session where I was left with many small reddish marks all over my legs, stomach, and bikini area!  It was a nightmare- looked like chicken pox.  it wasn&#x27;t as bad as some of the horror photos I have seen online but I was nervous that they would never heal or go away.  The salon assured me they would but I needed FAST healing.  I saw this product in the healthfood store I was shopping at and figured I would give it a try (the word MAGIC sold me, as I think I really needed a miracle for my wounds)... I applied this product generously in the affected areas at least twice a day, and I swear I noticed a difference within 3 days...especially in the morning after having applied at night.  The burns were fading fast and after a week and a half or so of using this product, they were pretty much GONE!  I believe in this a lot, and am planning on getting another jar.  I hope that someone who may have the same problem I had with the laser hair removal burns will see this and know to buy it and BELIEVE in its magic healing ! :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  it is great for your feet and cuticles.  I use it on my shins as they are very dry and itchy this winter.  I am also using this during post laser treatments and seems to do a nice job of healing.  If I have a blemish coming on, I dab this on at night and it is gone in the morning!!!  It is thick but melts into your skin fairly quickly.  I will not be without this product.  Heals cuts and scrapes beautifully.</li>
            <li> I bought this because another review said it was as good as Egyptian Magic, but I should have known better. It doesn&#x27;t have the same luxurious, thick feeling that EM has, and it hasn&#x27;t made any difference to my acne or my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  I have used Egyptian Magic.  This is the same thing for half the price.  They&#x27;re identical, from what I can tell.  Who cares though, this works.  I put it on scars (old and new) and they vanish.  I have put it on burns and cuts and they heal fast.  I have put it on blemishes and they&#x27;re gone overnight.  My friend bought some and puts it on the wrinkles on her face and she swears they&#x27;re disappearing.  A jar of this will always be in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I use it on my under-eye area, my cheeks if they get chapped or break out, my lips, raw knuckles, healing scrapes, practically everywhere. it soaks in fairly quickly. Although it smells a bit like play-dough, I don&#x27;t have any bad reaction to the ingredients. I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in my slight breakout problem, but it also doesn&#x27;t over-dry my skin or make it feel greasy. I will buy this again when I run low.</li>
            <li> Great for healing cracked heals and rough elbows.</li>
            <li> Really good!&lt;br /&gt;I think my mom used it all, so time to buy another!&lt;br /&gt;It really helps with acne redness at least for me.</li>
            <li> I went to Whole Foods a few weeks ago to get some Egyptian Magic to try on my son&#x27;s eczema.  He has terrible flare-ups and I had read that it was good for it.  An employee at Whole Foods showed me this product and said it is essentially the same for half the price.  I have not been disappointed.  It has helped his eczema so much!  It works great on its own but I have found if I pair it with some Sovereign Colloidal Silver the combo works faster.  I have also started using it on my face.  I put a thicker layer around my eyes, mouth, and forehead before bed and then apply a very thin layer in the mornings before I put on my sunscreen.  It doesn&#x27;t break my skin out and has completely cleared up the dry patches I get around my eyes and mouth.  It also appears to be fading some of my acne scars.  If it starts erasing my wrinkles I&#x27;ll probably start bathing in it but I&#x27;m still patiently waiting on those results.  Nevertheless, I&#x27;m thrilled with the many uses it has and plan to always keep it on hand.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with eczema for the past 8 months and had to give up all sorts facial products including eye creams. My skin is so sensitive and this skin cream is the only thing that is smoothing it. I use it everywhere that is dry or has patches of ezcema. It moisturizes and seals the eczema medications so it&#x27;s more effective. I have recommended to various family and friends and they also love it. People might think it&#x27;s greasy if they don&#x27;t properly melt the cream on their hand before putting it on. I love this product and I carry it everywhere.</li>
            <li> I do notice an improvement in my skins overall appearance. Like most people as they age I wasn&#x27;t very happy with the lines developing along my top lip and I can definitely see an improvement. This is really more like a balm than a cream with a very waxy/ greasy texture that does rub in as long as you don&#x27;t over do it. A small amount goes a long way. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It has kept my skin looking great during the dry indoor winter air. No breakout problems at all. I use it as a facial cream. I am so glad I discovered this product!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product - it runs a close second to Egyptian Magic but definitely a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the many positive reviews and was pleased with the product. It is quickly absorbed and spreads over the skin smoothly. Texture reminds me of a salve. Does not have a strong odor; mild smell nothing awful. Great product for winter weather to help keep skin moisturized. I would recommend it to my friends :)</li>
            <li> This product is useful for almost anything that itches.  I also use it as a night cream on the lines around my eyes.  Only a pea sized amount stretches a long way so the jar lasts quite awhile.  It is great for chaffed, dry skin.  I have purchased it twice, and the second purchase was for a greater quantity.</li>
            <li> Good product! Sent to my grandkids to help with winter time itchiness.</li>
            <li> Very good moisturizer. I love that it&#x27;s all natural and erases dryness.</li>
            <li> Just as good or better than the Egyptian stuff.  My wife uses it on her dry skin on her hands and face and loves it.</li>
            <li> I have used holistic products for over 20 years and continually try new ones. I am always searching for products to help my elderly mother and dad, and to use with my dogs, as well as for my own use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this on a whim because I am very attuned to bee products and the ingredients looked lovely. I had no idea I was about to fall in love with a jar. You might never be able to pry this stuff out of my cold dead hands. I expected a balm that might be helpful for the occasional scrape or rash for myself or my dogs. I found much more than that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it first on areas of my lower legs which had developed red spots after hormonal therapy. They had been immune to everything both topical and internal that I tried. I applied the balm daily for about two weeks before I noticed the spots were fading. It took around 90 days for them to disappear completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After this lovely discovery, my elderly mother broke out in Shingles which can be extremely painful and debilitating for seniors. I immediately sent her some balm, and her Shingles sores faded away and left no pain behind.  Try applying daily to cold sore locations as preventative - it works great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it for lip balm, and now use nothing else. This balm is magic and perfect for me. If you do use it on your face, do it sparingly or alternate with other creams as it can block the pores.  Since my first tests, I now think of honey balm first when something comes up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now can&#x27;t think of all the times I&#x27;ve reached for this or recommended it. A surprising healing from nasty cow parsnip blisters was enjoyed by my chiropractor.  The balm took away most of the pain, healed the blisters, and tremendously softened the skin which had turned to leather. Females can safely use it in female places for healing especially. I&#x27;ve used it for just about everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love having a balm that I can use for my big dogs that is absolutely safe if ingested. This helped me heal a cut pad on my big guy with no worries at all. Forget the Neosporin or similar products - try this first and you&#x27;ll probably throw all of those into the trash. You get the idea - I love this stuff. I would give it a double five stars if I could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final note: due to the ingredients, esp. the olive oil, I keep only a small amount in a separate jar for everyday use. The rest is kept in the frig until I need to refill my smaller jar. If you use it quickly, you can probably skip this step but if you get the big jar and keep it around or use sparingly, try the frig thing to keep it fresh and active.balm, and now use nothing else. Most lip balms make my mouth break out, esp ones with shea butter and sweet almond oil. Yuck on those ingredients - they do not work at all for me and just make any problem worse. This balm is magic and perfect for me. I&#x27;d trade all the shea butter, cocoa butter and sweet almond oil on the planet for one jar of honey balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final note: due to the ingredients, esp. the olive oil, I keep only a small amount in a separate jar for everyday use. The rest is kept in the frig until I need to refill my smaller jar. If you use it quickly, you can probably skip this step but if you get the big jar and keep it around or use sparingly, try the frig thing to keep it fresh and active.</li>
            <li> It feels very greasy in skin. I guess it&#x27;s good for very dry skin, but don&#x27;t get it if you have combination or oily skin</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I was considering buying Egyptian Magic and thought this organic alternative would be better.  When I opened the jar, I immediately noticed an off smell, but decided to try a small sample on my skin.  The product stayed quite greasy after applying and did not soak in.  I tried contacting both Planet Galaxy (the distributor) and the Medicine Mama company through Amazon, but the only response I got was from Amazon Customer Service offering me a return label to send the product back.  As a result, I never got an answer as to whether I received old, spoiled product, or if the rancid oil smell is what the cream is supposed to smell like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up returning the cream to Amazon and picked up some Egyptian Magic at Costco.  Unfortunately, it is not organic, but there was a marked difference with the Egyptian Magic cream.  No offensive rancid odor, just a faint neutral scent, and the cream soaked completely into my skin after several minutes, leaving my skin soft and not overly greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like the Medicine Mama&#x27;s Sweet Bee Magic, but without a reply from the manufacturer as to whether my experience was typical of the product or if I just received a bad batch, I cannot recommend this product.</li>
