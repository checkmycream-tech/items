            <li>I really liked this perfume, I had it tried once</li>

            <li>I talked to a girl i like and asked her if she liked my calone</li>
            <li>this is my favorite perfume, it smells so good, and its muscular perfume.</li>

            <li>Smells nice, but goes away quickly!</li>
            <li>girls love it ..</li>
            <li>It was one of the things he wanted most for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I love the fragance</li>
            <li>After a while a hint of amber becomes more pronounced.  </li>
            <li>a lot just wish it was more noticeable...or maybe it is</li>
            <li>I love this perfume since I smelled it in a Perfume store and bought it from Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>friends love it as well</li>
            <li>Glad I ordered it.....</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;First bottle bought on June 2012 had an outstanding scent duration and strength.&lt;br /&gt;2nd</li>
            <li>SO GLAD</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>love it.....</li>

            <li>Women love it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get too many compliments with it</li>
            <li>but I love the smell and wear it confidently.  </li>
            <li>i just recieve this perfume and also 3 more</li>
            <li>, you got to send things in a complete good status, because my money that I give you is in a good status.</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I ordered this...  </li>
            <li>...now I just need to smell it on him! :)</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s better than people say.</li>
            <li>I love colognes but this one lingers forever and stains all his clothes.</li>
            <li>love affair  with the scent has caused me to order a bottle in waiting.</li>
            <li>and i still love it</li>
            <li>This fragance is my favorite one.</li>
            <li>Just love it.</li>
            <li>l love it</li>
            <li>I love this cologne</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with the smell</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen people saying 1 Million is better, but I had a test of it</li>
            <li>The bottles last for ages too and look awesome, like Zippo lighters.</li>
            <li>Definitely a good buy if you want to smell like a manly man ;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved this fragrance, a classic and all time favorite by Paco Rabanne.</li>
            <li>Its very sweet, but I like it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very sweet but spicy smell</li>
            <li>Black xs is a already known and excellent perfum, but with the shower gel that came together is much better.</li>
            <li>but Black XS is a truly head turning, delicious &amp; extremely sexy scent.</li>
            <li>ItÂ´s original and is better than one million.  </li>
            <li>It smells okay, but nothing that gets the ladies excited when I wear it.  </li>
            <li>and it also was delivered very quickly, my girlfriend loves it</li>
            <li>The fragance is really attractive and very different from many others that are out there.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite fragrances, with good projection and longevity.&lt;br /&gt;Sweet and male, can find more information on Fragantica.com or Basenotes.com</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells incredible and is LONG LASTING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this product once on december 2011, it was fine at that time.  </li>
            <li>just what i expected, is get on time and is just beautiful and original botton line i love it</li>
            <li>Great purchase for christmast gift to your man or relative.</li>
            <li>(&lt;br /&gt;Smells cheap</li>
            <li>It is kind of flowered but absolute manly.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much, so I bought it again, but this time the product came opened</li>
            <li>arrived very well, nice fragance</li>
            <li>This cologne is just fantastic.</li>
            <li>Thank you Paco Rabanne and thank you seller for making this available.</li>
            <li>a woman i was on a date with liked it so much and asked if she could wear it</li>
            <li>and it smells like cheap aftershave.</li>
            <li>Not too sweet or too strong.</li>
            <li>Perfect for going out and for year round usage as well!</li>
            <li>It has a unique scent.</li>
            <li>Just smelling of alcohol and the smell does not last more than a minute, besides being a hazardous material, the law does not allow return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A clean floral, almost fruity scent that is not at all overbearing.  </li>
            <li>Its a shame because it does smell manly and pleasant at the same time, just not for me, or not the bottle I received</li>
            <li>but it actually came in the original box sealed up and everything..very good cologne..</li>
            <li>I wanted to return it, but I couldn&#x27;t, because of the special packaging and handling Amazon said they couldn&#x27;t provide.</li>
            <li>Im teaching them to be young men and its a nice scent</li>
            <li>/&gt;Considering this item does not apply for a return, I&#x27;ll get it at a store next time rather than playing with my luck to get a good bottle.</li>
            <li>What might be good for me, might as well be a total trash for another person.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic though, and worth reapplying.</li>
            <li>People notice the aroma,and if it is good enough for the Wayner</li>
            <li>then it is good enough for me.</li>
            <li>Nothing much to say about this parfume except I LOVE</li>
            <li>The fragrance is nice and soft.</li>
            <li>citrusy at the beginning, smells like strawberries, strong for the first hour, then throughout the day i pick up the scent from time to time...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good enough to be fresh and sweet.</li>
            <li>It was shipped to us quickly too .</li>
            <li>soon much even my friend said its strong.....</li>
            <li>Thank you soo much!!))))</li>
            <li>This is the best cologne i have ever tried and it had the real smell for such a low price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth buying.</li>
            <li>Packaging was nice, it was a male perfume</li>
            <li>wore the scent for the first time at work and the first person that I encounter was a male co-worker whose first words to me was, \\&quot;you smell good</li>
            <li>Well I was right.</li>
            <li>well worth the price that I bought another after receiving the first one.  </li>
            <li>Excellent fragance for special ocassions and night hangouts, It is not too much strong nor soft, is enough so anyone can notice it and last really long.</li>
            <li>They DO NOT smell the same but he like the one million more (which we went ahead and purchase)</li>
            <li>It was my first time purchasing cologne online and not smelling it first</li>
            <li>It smelled lovely, I gave it to my boyfriend as a birthday present</li>
            <li>it is very manly and everyone gives compliments and asks what it is!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s so striking you can instantly tell when someone&#x27;s wearing it.</li>
            <li>I would suggest trying it physically first before buying in case you might be &amp;#34;incompatible&amp;#34; as well.</li>
            <li>I find this one to be very unique, and a nice change from the countless other aquatics and floral scents that dominate the summer.</li>
            <li>It smells good, but the smell only last a couple minutes.</li>
            <li>Initially you will be hit with a very sweet (and synthetic) smell that reminds one of chololate covered strawberries.  </li>
            <li>ok ive yapped for too long</li>
            <li>The smell last pretty much and is strong</li>
            <li>This is something very particular, a eau de toilette.</li>
            <li>I SAVED SO MUCH MONEY</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Looks real.  </li>
            <li>It stays on your skin the whole day.</li>
            <li>i really like the smell.</li>
            <li>Very practical.</li>
            <li>this whole date thing works out</li>
            <li>so I couldn&#x27;t expect a very exhuberant presentation.</li>
            <li>I really thing its a knock-off</li>
            <li>This is why I give it 3 stars, because even though it doesn&#x27;t do much for me, it might for someone else.</li>
            <li>This cologne has longevity, projects well, so don&#x27;t spray too much.</li>
            <li>The perfect perfume for nightâ¦ Men need to have at least two perfumes, one for the day and the other one for the night.</li>
            <li>I have no doubt that this is authentic juice, but compared to my old bottle from three years ago, this new formula is a shadow of its former self.</li>
            <li>it took a little longer tha expected but did the job, great smell</li>
            <li>If your looking for a more versatile version of Black XS, try Armani Diamonds(Similar but easier on the nose).</li>
            <li>Perfect for young men, can&#x27;t go wrong with it !</li>
            <li>i received this product timely and as it id specified, it even has a strong smell that I was expecting from the other reviews, but for some reason it stops smelling a minute once it is out of the bottle, perhaps something incompatible with my physiology...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ever been near at a gig that smells absolutely gorgeous\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>GETS ALL THE HOT SEXY GUYS ROCKING HARD!</li>
            <li>This is definitely a going out to the pub, bar, club type of scent and, due to its projection, may be the better choice getting through all that smoke or even getting an eye from across the room.</li>
            <li>No regrets, the girls really like it.</li>
            <li>Have been using this fragrance for years, it is very different from others, subtle and a mix of fruity and floral scent, it had a good price</li>
            <li>Not sure what to think about this, especially since most of the reviews were positive.</li>
            <li>Ive been a huge fan of Black XS which i used to get while i was in S.Africa</li>
            <li>Xs certainly can be overbearing and syrupy, especially if overapplied.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my 14 year old son .</li>
            <li>i can smell it on my clothes the next day but the scent stays real close...</li>
            <li>Colognes smell different on each guy but for me I really like this fragrance.....</li>
            <li>latter part is very important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had no idea what I was getting myself into, but I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>It works well for someone trying to be a bit youthful but also a bit professional.</li>
            <li>I like a lot, the fragance continues from early morning to fall the day.</li>
            <li>Frequently I get compliments.</li>
            <li>I like the smell a lot, but it&#x27;s a little familiar.</li>
            <li>The black xs maintains the peculiar sweet fragance of Paco Rabanne.</li>
            <li>and the box it was all broken and scratched really the bottle it was fine,</li>
            <li>cologne please double check that its authentic or you will waste time and be disappointed like i was when i bought the D&amp;G original online but didn&#x27;t check to see if it was authentic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sweet fragance, however it is not strong to the point of causing headache.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unfortunate as of late that these designer brands are reformulating scents that were once marvelous.</li>
            <li>Its smell is a little bit sweet but soft at the same time.</li>
            <li>I first discovered Black XS when a girl I used to date used the For Her version</li>

            <li> However, when worn lightly, this is a very pleasant summertime scent.  </li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s nice and warm cologne!</li>
            <li> Ordered because of many good reviews, in fact its nothing good, nor me nor my bf liked it :</li>
            <li> I love the smell too!</li>
            <li> great smell, light scent, good for office, all the ladies at work love it as well.  </li>
            <li> It really smells incredible!</li>
            <li> My kind of scent.</li>
            <li> I really liked this perfume, I had it tried once</li>
            <li> attention was excellent and responsible</li>
            <li> He is using it more than One Mill and One Mill smell just as good</li>
            <li> I talked to a girl i like and asked her if she liked my calone</li>
            <li> this is my favorite perfume, it smells so good, and its muscular perfume.</li>
            <li> it was funny and attractive</li>
            <li> Smells nice, but goes away quickly!</li>
            <li> girls love it ..</li>
            <li> It was one of the things he wanted most for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I love the fragance</li>
            <li> After a while a hint of amber becomes more pronounced.  </li>
            <li> a lot just wish it was more noticeable...or maybe it is</li>
            <li> I love this perfume since I smelled it in a Perfume store and bought it from Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> friends love it as well</li>
            <li> Glad I ordered it.....</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;First bottle bought on June 2012 had an outstanding scent duration and strength.&lt;br /&gt;2nd</li>
            <li> SO GLAD</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> love it.....</li>
            <li> He enjoyed though.</li>
            <li> Women love it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get too many compliments with it</li>
            <li> but I love the smell and wear it confidently.  </li>
            <li> i just recieve this perfume and also 3 more</li>
            <li> , you got to send things in a complete good status, because my money that I give you is in a good status.</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I ordered this...  </li>
            <li> ...now I just need to smell it on him! :)</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s better than people say.</li>
            <li> I love colognes but this one lingers forever and stains all his clothes.</li>
            <li> love affair  with the scent has caused me to order a bottle in waiting.</li>
            <li> and i still love it</li>
            <li> This fragance is my favorite one.</li>
            <li> Just love it.</li>
            <li> l love it</li>
            <li> I love this cologne</li>
            <li> and I fell in love with the smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen people saying 1 Million is better, but I had a test of it</li>
            <li> The bottles last for ages too and look awesome, like Zippo lighters.</li>
            <li> Definitely a good buy if you want to smell like a manly man ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this fragrance, a classic and all time favorite by Paco Rabanne.</li>
            <li> Its very sweet, but I like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very sweet but spicy smell</li>
            <li> Black xs is a already known and excellent perfum, but with the shower gel that came together is much better.</li>
            <li> but Black XS is a truly head turning, delicious &amp; extremely sexy scent.</li>
            <li> ItÂ´s original and is better than one million.  </li>
            <li> It smells okay, but nothing that gets the ladies excited when I wear it.  </li>
            <li> and it also was delivered very quickly, my girlfriend loves it</li>
            <li> The fragance is really attractive and very different from many others that are out there.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite fragrances, with good projection and longevity.&lt;br /&gt;Sweet and male, can find more information on Fragantica.com or Basenotes.com</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells incredible and is LONG LASTING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this product once on december 2011, it was fine at that time.  </li>
            <li> just what i expected, is get on time and is just beautiful and original botton line i love it</li>
            <li> Great purchase for christmast gift to your man or relative.</li>
            <li> (&lt;br /&gt;Smells cheap</li>
            <li> It is kind of flowered but absolute manly.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much, so I bought it again, but this time the product came opened</li>
            <li> arrived very well, nice fragance</li>
            <li> This cologne is just fantastic.</li>
            <li> Thank you Paco Rabanne and thank you seller for making this available.</li>
            <li> a woman i was on a date with liked it so much and asked if she could wear it</li>
            <li> and it smells like cheap aftershave.</li>
            <li> Not too sweet or too strong.</li>
            <li> Perfect for going out and for year round usage as well!</li>
            <li> It has a unique scent.</li>
            <li> Just smelling of alcohol and the smell does not last more than a minute, besides being a hazardous material, the law does not allow return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A clean floral, almost fruity scent that is not at all overbearing.  </li>
            <li> Its a shame because it does smell manly and pleasant at the same time, just not for me, or not the bottle I received</li>
            <li> but it actually came in the original box sealed up and everything..very good cologne..</li>
            <li> I wanted to return it, but I couldn&#x27;t, because of the special packaging and handling Amazon said they couldn&#x27;t provide.</li>
            <li> Im teaching them to be young men and its a nice scent</li>
            <li> /&gt;Considering this item does not apply for a return, I&#x27;ll get it at a store next time rather than playing with my luck to get a good bottle.</li>
            <li> What might be good for me, might as well be a total trash for another person.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic though, and worth reapplying.</li>
            <li> People notice the aroma,and if it is good enough for the Wayner</li>
            <li> then it is good enough for me.</li>
            <li> Nothing much to say about this parfume except I LOVE</li>
            <li> The fragrance is nice and soft.</li>
            <li> citrusy at the beginning, smells like strawberries, strong for the first hour, then throughout the day i pick up the scent from time to time...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good enough to be fresh and sweet.</li>
            <li> It was shipped to us quickly too .</li>
            <li> soon much even my friend said its strong.....</li>
            <li> Thank you soo much!!))))</li>
            <li> This is the best cologne i have ever tried and it had the real smell for such a low price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth buying.</li>
            <li> Packaging was nice, it was a male perfume</li>
            <li> wore the scent for the first time at work and the first person that I encounter was a male co-worker whose first words to me was, \\&quot;you smell good</li>
            <li> Well I was right.</li>
            <li> well worth the price that I bought another after receiving the first one.  </li>
            <li> Excellent fragance for special ocassions and night hangouts, It is not too much strong nor soft, is enough so anyone can notice it and last really long.</li>
            <li> They DO NOT smell the same but he like the one million more (which we went ahead and purchase)</li>
            <li> It was my first time purchasing cologne online and not smelling it first</li>
            <li> It smelled lovely, I gave it to my boyfriend as a birthday present</li>
            <li> it is very manly and everyone gives compliments and asks what it is!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s so striking you can instantly tell when someone&#x27;s wearing it.</li>
            <li> I would suggest trying it physically first before buying in case you might be &amp;#34;incompatible&amp;#34; as well.</li>
            <li> I find this one to be very unique, and a nice change from the countless other aquatics and floral scents that dominate the summer.</li>
            <li> It smells good, but the smell only last a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> Initially you will be hit with a very sweet (and synthetic) smell that reminds one of chololate covered strawberries.  </li>
            <li> ok ive yapped for too long</li>
            <li> The smell last pretty much and is strong</li>
            <li> This is something very particular, a eau de toilette.</li>
            <li> I SAVED SO MUCH MONEY</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> Looks real.  </li>
            <li> It stays on your skin the whole day.</li>
            <li> i really like the smell.</li>
            <li> Very practical.</li>
            <li> this whole date thing works out</li>
            <li> so I couldn&#x27;t expect a very exhuberant presentation.</li>
            <li> I really thing its a knock-off</li>
            <li> This is why I give it 3 stars, because even though it doesn&#x27;t do much for me, it might for someone else.</li>
            <li> This cologne has longevity, projects well, so don&#x27;t spray too much.</li>
            <li> The perfect perfume for nightâ¦ Men need to have at least two perfumes, one for the day and the other one for the night.</li>
            <li> I have no doubt that this is authentic juice, but compared to my old bottle from three years ago, this new formula is a shadow of its former self.</li>
            <li> it took a little longer tha expected but did the job, great smell</li>
            <li> If your looking for a more versatile version of Black XS, try Armani Diamonds(Similar but easier on the nose).</li>
            <li> Perfect for young men, can&#x27;t go wrong with it !</li>
            <li> i received this product timely and as it id specified, it even has a strong smell that I was expecting from the other reviews, but for some reason it stops smelling a minute once it is out of the bottle, perhaps something incompatible with my physiology...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ever been near at a gig that smells absolutely gorgeous\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> GETS ALL THE HOT SEXY GUYS ROCKING HARD!</li>
            <li> This is definitely a going out to the pub, bar, club type of scent and, due to its projection, may be the better choice getting through all that smoke or even getting an eye from across the room.</li>
            <li> No regrets, the girls really like it.</li>
            <li> Have been using this fragrance for years, it is very different from others, subtle and a mix of fruity and floral scent, it had a good price</li>
            <li> Not sure what to think about this, especially since most of the reviews were positive.</li>
            <li> Ive been a huge fan of Black XS which i used to get while i was in S.Africa</li>
            <li> Xs certainly can be overbearing and syrupy, especially if overapplied.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my 14 year old son .</li>
            <li> i can smell it on my clothes the next day but the scent stays real close...</li>
            <li> Colognes smell different on each guy but for me I really like this fragrance.....</li>
            <li> latter part is very important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had no idea what I was getting myself into, but I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> It works well for someone trying to be a bit youthful but also a bit professional.</li>
            <li> I like a lot, the fragance continues from early morning to fall the day.</li>
            <li> Frequently I get compliments.</li>
            <li> I like the smell a lot, but it&#x27;s a little familiar.</li>
            <li> The black xs maintains the peculiar sweet fragance of Paco Rabanne.</li>
            <li> and the box it was all broken and scratched really the bottle it was fine,</li>
            <li> cologne please double check that its authentic or you will waste time and be disappointed like i was when i bought the D&amp;G original online but didn&#x27;t check to see if it was authentic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sweet fragance, however it is not strong to the point of causing headache.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate as of late that these designer brands are reformulating scents that were once marvelous.</li>
            <li> Its smell is a little bit sweet but soft at the same time.</li>
            <li> I first discovered Black XS when a girl I used to date used the For Her version</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give five stars is because it doesn&#x27;t last that long on me.</li>
            <li> Or perhaps it was not stored properly over a middle to long period of time, I cant say,</li>
            <li> lasts long enough, don&#x27;t want to overpower people all day...</li>
            <li> The PR XS is definitely the dark part of the day, especially for party.</li>
            <li> I have had the real one in the past and this one smells close but the scent only last a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> One spritz gets the job done and even after a long day at work, I can take off my clothes and catch just a hint of what I had applied long ago.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t believe I forgot the name, because that was the last question I expected to hear.</li>
            <li> In fact, I was at a gig a few months ago and a girl in front of me turned round and said \\&quot;You&#x27;re like the first guy</li>
            <li> It lacks the performance, depth, and overall quality of the initial black XS.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers, this perfume&#x27;s scent is nothing short of awesome!&lt;br /&gt;BUT...</li>
            <li> The cologne projects and lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> Not very much to say about it...</li>
            <li> Thumbs down, big time,</li>
            <li> /&gt;just want to flush down all of the content into the toilet</li>
            <li> utter waste.</li>
            <li> What a pity.</li>
            <li> is not what I expected</li>
            <li> I must say after reading the reviews about \\&quot;Black Xs\\&quot; and waiting what seemed a long time for Amazon shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> they didn&#x27;t carry this particular type and the few that i found were watered down and not authentic.</li>
            <li> This perfume is fake or is very spoiled!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually wear colognes as it is, especially one that I have never smelled before.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd small bottle now</li>
            <li> This is the worse smell ever - my teenage son received it as a present and it makes me think the one who offered it to him had something against him.</li>
            <li> The new black XS is a thin whisper.</li>
            <li> it is one of those love it or hate it scents).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the previous poster</li>
            <li> and I still have a half of the bottle because I don&#x27;t want run out of it.</li>
            <li> and I had him sniff both Paco Black XS &amp; One million and his comment was &amp;#34;they</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t stop sniffing the Black XS.</li>
            <li> some mornings I would notice him spraying from a Black bottle.  </li>
            <li> El perfume Black Xs huele muy bien y el efecto es muy duradero.</li>
            <li> y like black xs.</li>
            <li> A little sour on my skin</li>
            <li> now im having a little head ache,&lt;br</li>
            <li> This cologne is a little like Versace&#x27;s signature edt, but not the dreamer.</li>
            <li> Please dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> i wore it a few times and i have alot of women at my job</li>
            <li> It is either old or fake.  </li>
            <li> Again, don&#x27;t ask my opinion - I hate it, looks like a cheap smell.</li>
            <li> Not to sweet to be annoying though.</li>
            <li> Totally not satisfied with this cologne.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong either you&#x27;re buying it as present or for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
            <li> Product was not effective on me...</li>
            <li> When I wound down to make my payment, the girl at the window was like WHOA!!!</li>
            <li> both smell the same to me&amp;#34; BUZZZ wrong answer!</li>
            <li> I tell you seriously</li>
            <li> this is so frustrating and dissapointing.</li>
            <li> just got this bottle a few hours ago.&lt;br /&gt;it smells synthetic and sickly</li>
            <li> They sent me a completely fake perfume.</li>
            <li> i thought it was fake when i made the purchase..</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I did not get what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> IT MAKES EVERYONE GO CRAZY</li>
            <li> I bought this from Amazon.com, I saw the reviews and decided to buy, oh my god its a useless product, I am highly disappointed, dont buy this product.</li>
            <li> fake perfume smells like water with alcohol!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with it!</li>
            <li> This bottle even opens like a bad boy with its lighter-like lid.</li>
            <li> and u don&#x27;t get disappointed.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The roof has a very bad and sometimes shed</li>

            <li> I like the smell of this product .. and I have been buying it again and again .. i like it .. girls love it .. its a win win !</li>
            <li> smells good and good quality and good price</li>
            <li> Please dont waste your money. utter waste. I bought this from Amazon.com, I saw the reviews and decided to buy, oh my god its a useless product, I am highly disappointed, dont buy this product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful perfume. Smells great and the product is just as described. Great purchase for christmast gift to your man or relative.</li>
            <li> Excellent perfume.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate as of late that these designer brands are reformulating scents that were once marvelous. This one has not evaded the grasp of health and safety it seems. I have no doubt that this is authentic juice, but compared to my old bottle from three years ago, this new formula is a shadow of its former self. It lacks the performance, depth, and overall quality of the initial black XS. The new black XS is a thin whisper. It should be shouting in all its \\&quot;fruit-chouli\\&quot; splendor. What a pity.</li>
            <li> This is a delicious, bad-boy scent. Something that everyone notices at the bar and may even pass you a second time to immerse their olfactory senses in. This bottle even opens like a bad boy with its lighter-like lid. The cologne projects and lasts a very long time. This is definitely a going out to the pub, bar, club type of scent and, due to its projection, may be the better choice getting through all that smoke or even getting an eye from across the room.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite fragrances, with good projection and longevity.&lt;br /&gt;Sweet and male, can find more information on Fragantica.com or Basenotes.com</li>
            <li> Black xs is a already known and excellent perfum, but with the shower gel that came together is much better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the previous poster but I&#x27;ve always received a lot of compliments from the ladies in my University and around the office when I wear this thing. It really smells incredible!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 14 year old son . It smells great !! He was so happy with it . It was one of the things he wanted most for Christmas. It was shipped to us quickly too .</li>
            <li> perfect, I love it! the product is the same like the picture. I recomended buy it  I love the fragance</li>
            <li> This is one that I think everyone should try (TRY - not necessarily buy - it is one of those love it or hate it scents).  The bottle is well constructed and opens like a zippo lighter.&lt;br /&gt;Black Xs certainly can be overbearing and syrupy, especially if overapplied.  However, when worn lightly, this is a very pleasant summertime scent.  Initially you will be hit with a very sweet (and synthetic) smell that reminds one of chololate covered strawberries.  After a while a hint of amber becomes more pronounced.  This stuff projects well, and has excellent longevity.  I find this one to be very unique, and a nice change from the countless other aquatics and floral scents that dominate the summer.</li>
            <li> this stuff smells great...my go to fragrance now when i dont know what to wear..citrusy at the beginning, smells like strawberries, strong for the first hour, then throughout the day i pick up the scent from time to time...i can smell it on my clothes the next day but the scent stays real close...i like it a lot just wish it was more noticeable...or maybe it is but my nose just shuts if off after a while...will be buying it again though</li>
            <li> I love this perfume since I smelled it in a Perfume store and bought it from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;My friends love it as well, I bought this perfume in 2009 and I still have a half of the bottle because I don&#x27;t want run out of it. I think it&#x27;s one of the best of Paco Rabanne.</li>
            <li> Excelent product and delivery</li>
            <li> I brought this cologne for my kids Im teaching them to be young men and its a nice scent i wore it a few times and i have alot of women at my job ask me the name of this cologne.</li>
            <li> Colognes smell different on each guy but for me I really like this fragrance.....lasts long enough, don&#x27;t want to overpower people all day...a hint remains after 2-3 hours so it is good for me.  Glad I ordered it.....</li>
            <li> As other reviewers, this perfume&#x27;s scent is nothing short of awesome!&lt;br /&gt;BUT...&lt;br /&gt;First bottle bought on June 2012 had an outstanding scent duration and strength.&lt;br /&gt;2nd bottle bought on July 2013 does not even smell at all. You can only smell it for 5 minutes, after that the scent is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering this item does not apply for a return, I&#x27;ll get it at a store next time rather than playing with my luck to get a good bottle.</li>
            <li> Ordered because of many good reviews, in fact its nothing good, nor me nor my bf liked it :(&lt;br /&gt;Smells cheap</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS AWESOME I SAVED SO MUCH MONEY I RECOMMEND FOR FUTURE PURCHASES!!! 100% RELIABLE!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;M SO GLAD I FOUND IT!</li>
            <li> What a shame! This perfume is fake or is very spoiled! Is a mixture of lemon and alcohol! Very different from my last pot. I was injured! Never buy Perfume by Amazon!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  Looks real.  I have had the real one in the past and this one smells close but the scent only last a few minutes.  It is either old or fake.  I would stay away.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. Its smell is a little bit sweet but soft at the same time. It stays on your skin the whole day. It&#x27;s hard to find. I recommend it 100%</li>
            <li> My kind of scent. Ohh lalala...</li>
            <li> I always smell good but this, this just drives the ladies nuts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten A LOT of compliments while wearing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Girls, women, grandmas, everyone just smiling and happy when I walk by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe something to do with their hormonal cycle, I don&#x27;t claim to understand women!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else can I say?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that that&#x27;s enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells incredible and is LONG LASTING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That latter part is very important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That will easily last an entire day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it.....</li>
            <li> This is something very particular, a eau de toilette. What might be good for me, might as well be a total trash for another person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought as a gift for a friend of mine, he likes. Again, don&#x27;t ask my opinion - I hate it, looks like a cheap smell. He enjoyed though.</li>
            <li> I really liked this perfume, I had it tried once so i decided to buy it again, i recommend it</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give five stars is because it doesn&#x27;t last that long on me. The smell is fantastic though, and worth reapplying. Women love it.</li>
            <li> They sent me a completely fake perfume. Just smelling of alcohol and the smell does not last more than a minute, besides being a hazardous material, the law does not allow return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said before, this product is a steal!</li>
            <li> its great and delivered on time</li>
            <li> i really like the smell. It is kind of flowered but absolute manly. The smell last pretty much and is strong</li>
            <li> The product arrived perfect and in time.</li>
            <li> attention was excellent and responsible</li>
            <li> Great synthetic strawberry, syrupy blend.  A little sour on my skin but I apply sparingly. Girlfriend hates the stuff because of the sourness...lol so I don&#x27;t wear it around her.  Projection and longevity are great.  Definately a night out or clubbing scent.  Don&#x27;t get too many compliments with it but I love the smell and wear it confidently.  If your looking for a more versatile version of Black XS, try Armani Diamonds(Similar but easier on the nose).</li>
            <li> THE BEST SMELL IN THE WORLD!! GETS ALL THE HOT SEXY GUYS ROCKING HARD! LOL IT MAKES EVERYONE GO CRAZY</li>
            <li> Excellent fragance for special ocassions and night hangouts, It is not too much strong nor soft, is enough so anyone can notice it and last really long. I would recomend to prove it before buying it. No regrets, the girls really like it.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas present for my husband but before I made this purchase. We were at the perfume counter at the local mall and I had him sniff both Paco Black XS &amp; One million and his comment was &amp;#34;they both smell the same to me&amp;#34; BUZZZ wrong answer! They DO NOT smell the same but he like the one million more (which we went ahead and purchase) but I couldn&#x27;t stop sniffing the Black XS. I felt, this is his scent and I went ahead and purchase it. Well I was right. He is using it more than One Mill and One Mill smell just as good but Black XS is a truly head turning, delicious &amp; extremely sexy scent. S-E-X-Y!</li>
            <li> I like the smell a lot, but it&#x27;s a little familiar. I prefer one million.</li>
            <li> i just recieve this perfume and also 3 more i was so happy about it box looked great bottle also but at the time that i tried na na!!! fake perfume smells like water with alcohol! this is so frustrating and dissapointing.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells awesome.  I read all the reviews before purchasing and they were all in agreeance.  It was my first time purchasing cologne online and not smelling it first but I am glad I did!!!</li>
            <li> Its very sweet, but I like it. It goes great at night time.</li>
            <li> vendedor nÃ£o me entregou</li>
            <li> Very nice stuff !!! It has that fruity vibe with some amber and woody backround, smells very pleasant and inoffensive. Perfect for young men, can&#x27;t go wrong with it !</li>
            <li> I bought this product once on december 2011, it was fine at that time.  I liked it so much, so I bought it again, but this time the product came opened and the box it was all broken and scratched really the bottle it was fine, but I think that I was paying for everything.  The parfum within its box packaged in a good status. Not for this.  I tell you seriously, you got to send things in a complete good status, because my money that I give you is in a good status.</li>
            <li> excelente  producto quede a gusto  con la  calidad y la rapidez de la entrega espero poder efectuar mis  compras  este  a&amp;ntilde;o  con la misma eficiencia.</li>
            <li> it was so great and i love it. and i want another one in future like hugo and Davidoff  .</li>
            <li> Best ever I like this soon much even my friend said its strong.....love itðð»ðð»ðð»</li>
            <li> el producto es total mente recomendable llego a venezuela en excelente estado el vendedor confiable en tiempo y valor de producto.</li>
            <li> The roof has a very bad and sometimes shed</li>
            <li> Have been using this fragrance for years, it is very different from others, subtle and a mix of fruity and floral scent, it had a good price and it also was delivered very quickly, my girlfriend loves it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never met my bf who lives in Brazil, but I know what he smells like!  We have been chatting on Skype for 7 months now, and some mornings I would notice him spraying from a Black bottle.  Upon inquiry I discovered what he was using, so I knew I had to have it.  I&#x27;m glad that I ordered this...  I don&#x27;t usually wear colognes as it is, especially one that I have never smelled before.  I had no idea what I was getting myself into, but I was pleasantly surprised.  A clean floral, almost fruity scent that is not at all overbearing.  One spritz gets the job done and even after a long day at work, I can take off my clothes and catch just a hint of what I had applied long ago.  ...now I just need to smell it on him! :)</li>
            <li> just got this bottle a few hours ago.&lt;br /&gt;it smells synthetic and sickly sweet.&lt;br /&gt;and now im having a little head ache,&lt;br /&gt;just want to flush down all of the content into the toilet</li>
            <li> El perfume Black Xs huele muy bien y el efecto es muy duradero. Lo puedes usar a diario o para ocasiones especiales.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lo recomiendo.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT AS DESCRIBED, LOVE IT, SMELLS INCREDIBLE, GOOD PRICE.</li>
            <li> arrived very well, nice fragance</li>
            <li> El perfume estaba vencido.</li>
            <li> This cologne is excellent. It works well for someone trying to be a bit youthful but also a bit professional. Perfect for going out and for year round usage as well!</li>
            <li> The black xs maintains the peculiar sweet fragance of Paco Rabanne. I like a lot, the fragance continues from early morning to fall the day.</li>
            <li> My husband already loved this product and got it as a gift from me for Christmas - he loves it still!</li>
            <li> is not what I expected</li>
            <li> really good product and just what i expected, is get on time and is just beautiful and original botton line i love it</li>
            <li> Muy bueno, buen precio, no lo podia conseguir y el envio tardo lo acordado por la pagina, quedo satisfecho con la compra</li>
            <li> This cologne is just fantastic. It has a unique scent. Frequently I get compliments. The fragance is really attractive and very different from many others that are out there. It&#x27;s a sweet fragance, however it is not strong to the point of causing headache. I&#x27;ll definetely buy it again when I&#x27;m done with this bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the best cologne i have ever tried and it had the real smell for such a low price. Thank you soo much!!))))</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for my husband. He loved it. Every where he go someone ask him about his perfume.</li>
            <li> Loved it! Very practical. Not think it was so good, it&#x27;s better than people say. It&#x27;s worth buying.I indicated to several people.</li>
            <li> My second time using this cologne. I love love loooveee it!!! Turns heads. I was at the drive through at McDonald&#x27;s. When I wound down to make my payment, the girl at the window was like WHOA!!! What&#x27;s the name pf that cologne? You won&#x27;t believe I forgot the name, because that was the last question I expected to hear. BUY THIS COLOGNE!!!... Matter of fact, don&#x27;t buy it. I want to be the only man on earth wearing it. Thank you Paco Rabanne and thank you seller for making this available. I wish I could give you 100 stars.</li>
            <li> I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Totally not satisfied with this cologne. It smells good, but the smell only last a couple minutes. I wanted to return it, but I couldn&#x27;t, because of the special packaging and handling Amazon said they couldn&#x27;t provide. Not sure what to think about this, especially since most of the reviews were positive.</li>
            <li> Ive been a huge fan of Black XS which i used to get while i was in S.Africa and when i came to the US(ATL) they didn&#x27;t carry this particular type and the few that i found were watered down and not authentic. So i checked online and got myself one, yup it took a little longer tha expected but did the job, great smell and it took me back home and the compliments came flooding in too, heck last night a woman i was on a date with liked it so much and asked if she could wear it ha ha ha told her there is a female version of this which is sweeter and sexier,which i might have to buy her(if this whole date thing works out lol) but i was happy with this product and anyone who buts cologne please double check that its authentic or you will waste time and be disappointed like i was when i bought the D&amp;G original online but didn&#x27;t check to see if it was authentic. I will be getting my colognes from this store from now on as they stand by their product and u don&#x27;t get disappointed. ok ive yapped for too long but u get the excitement</li>
            <li> This is the worse smell ever - my teenage son received it as a present and it makes me think the one who offered it to him had something against him. I love colognes but this one lingers forever and stains all his clothes. Thumbs down, big time,</li>
            <li> I talked to a girl i like and asked her if she liked my calone and I spraied this on my hand and she went barbaric in class it was funny and attractive every guy should buy this if you want women to want you.</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s nice and warm cologne!</li>
            <li> The perfect perfume for nightâ¦ Men need to have at least two perfumes, one for the day and the other one for the night. The PR XS is definitely the dark part of the day, especially for party.</li>
            <li> I must say after reading the reviews about \\&quot;Black Xs\\&quot; and waiting what seemed a long time for Amazon shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I wore the scent for the first time at work and the first person that I encounter was a male co-worker whose first words to me was, \\&quot;you smell good, what is it\\&quot;?&lt;br /&gt;My love affair  with the scent has caused me to order a bottle in waiting.</li>
            <li> this perfum came just in time in excellent conditions.  ItÂ´s original and is better than one million.  I recommend this product</li>
            <li> muy serios con el envÃ­o, todo llegÃ³ al lugar de destino sin ninguna novedad, recomiendo este artÃ­culo a todos, muy seria la tienda a la que le hice la compra</li>
            <li> this is my favorite perfume, it smells so good, and its muscular perfume. this is my third time buying this perfume and i still love it</li>
            <li> Packaging was nice, it was a male perfume so I couldn&#x27;t expect a very exhuberant presentation. It smelled lovely, I gave it to my boyfriend as a birthday present and he loved it.</li>
            <li> This fragance is my favorite one. It&#x27;s good enough to be fresh and sweet. Not to sweet to be annoying though. Just love it.</li>
            <li> Excelente opciÃ³n. Muy producto.</li>
            <li> perfect smell, wonderful smell l love it l love it</li>
            <li> I was put on to this product when I worked security with Wayne Newton in Las Vegas. Every one asked him what he used and he told them Paco Rabanne products. This was an affordable one for me and well worth the price that I bought another after receiving the first one.  People notice the aroma,and if it is good enough for the Wayner then it is good enough for me. In fact all the products by Paco Rabanne are great. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Product was not effective on me... I would put some on to head to work, and about an hour or 2 after all scent was gone. I really thing its a knock-off</li>
            <li> Smells nice, but goes away quickly!</li>
            <li> great smell, light scent, good for office, all the ladies at work love it as well.  not to over powering</li>
            <li> totally recommend this product..i thought it was fake when i made the purchase..but it actually came in the original box sealed up and everything..very good cologne..</li>
            <li> Very good fragance, my son loves it, he uses this every day.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect gift ever! I will try all the collection.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne it is very manly and everyone gives compliments and asks what it is! GREAT product!!!</li>
            <li> I first discovered Black XS when a girl I used to date used the For Her version and I fell in love with the smell, it&#x27;s so striking you can instantly tell when someone&#x27;s wearing it. So I had to try the men&#x27;s version. I&#x27;m on my 3rd small bottle now and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. I&#x27;ve seen people saying 1 Million is better, but I had a test of it and it smells like cheap aftershave. It&#x27;s a very sweet but spicy smell and I&#x27;m always getting compliments from ladies when I have it on. In fact, I was at a gig a few months ago and a girl in front of me turned round and said \\&quot;You&#x27;re like the first guy I&#x27;ve ever been near at a gig that smells absolutely gorgeous\\&quot;. The bottles last for ages too and look awesome, like Zippo lighters.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it. I love the smell too! Definitely a good buy if you want to smell like a manly man ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this fragrance, a classic and all time favorite by Paco Rabanne. Can&#x27;t go wrong with it!</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim having never smelled it before.  It smells okay, but nothing that gets the ladies excited when I wear it.  Now mind you, each cologne will smell differently on each person and there is a variety of factors that effect the scent of the cologne on a person.  This is why I give it 3 stars, because even though it doesn&#x27;t do much for me, it might for someone else.</li>
            <li> Nothing much to say about this parfume except I LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells discreet and it lasts hole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong either you&#x27;re buying it as present or for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.</li>
            <li> Una fragancia muy propia y da una exclusividad, exelente para compartir una velada con amigos en lugares de buen ambiente</li>
            <li> Muy buena cumple con todo lo ofrecido por el proveedor, manejan buen tiempo de entrega, muy buen servicio y calidad.</li>
            <li> very good seeler. y like black xs. is a very good perfum. recomiendo totalmente al vendedor le doy 5 estrellas. llego a tiempo y en buen estado.</li>
            <li> This cologne has longevity, projects well, so don&#x27;t spray too much. This cologne is a little like Versace&#x27;s signature edt, but not the dreamer.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is nice and soft. Not too sweet or too strong. Just perfect! Not very much to say about it...</li>
            <li> i received this product timely and as it id specified, it even has a strong smell that I was expecting from the other reviews, but for some reason it stops smelling a minute once it is out of the bottle, perhaps something incompatible with my physiology... Or perhaps it was not stored properly over a middle to long period of time, I cant say, but unfortunately I did not get what I was expecting. I would suggest trying it physically first before buying in case you might be &amp;#34;incompatible&amp;#34; as well. Its a shame because it does smell manly and pleasant at the same time, just not for me, or not the bottle I received</li>
