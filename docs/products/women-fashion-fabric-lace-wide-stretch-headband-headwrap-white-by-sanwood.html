            <li>I dont love it, it is ok  but would like it to be better quality and make it smaller because it looks huge on my head lol.</li>

            <li>Runs big, but is very nice looking</li>
            <li>I was looking for a bright white.</li>
            <li>Wore it and it stays put for the most part and looks nice, but the shipping took SO SO long.</li>

            <li>Although that may seem like a long time, I&#x27;m patient so waiting wasn&#x27;t a problem especially after seeing how the headband fits just fine and how pretty it looks in person!</li>
            <li>A little big but works wonders, its so cute too!</li>
            <li>Very cute for teenage girls, but very tight.</li>
