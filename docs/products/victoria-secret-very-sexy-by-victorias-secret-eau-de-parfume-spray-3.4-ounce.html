            <li> I have been obsessed with Dream Angels Heavenly which is also from Victoria&#x27;s Secret, but I had been using is so long that I couldn&#x27;t even smell it on me anymore so I decided to try another perfume and I read all the great reviews on it.  Let me tell you, this smells SO GOOD!  It&#x27;s very strong so I only use a squirt or two.  Its really strong at first but then that first shock of smell goes away and its just perfect and it stays on you ALL DAY LONG!  Even after I take a shower at night, I can still smell it on my skin which is just fine with me.    This has definitely replaced Heavenly for me.  The bottle is cool too, there&#x27;s no cap to lose and it&#x27;s lasting me a very long time since it doesn&#x27;t take very much.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my son&#x27;s girlfriend.  She loved it.  It arrived in a timely manner. I would definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my ex-girlfriend one year for Christmas and it smells incredible.  I highly recommend this as a gift for Valentine&#x27;s Day or Christmas for the wife or girlfriend... trust me, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This perfume is atomic; I love it and use it all the time. Not only am I the only one who finds in succulent and sexy, but my boyfriend adores it and can&#x27;t get enough of me. Mmmm, cuddles &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> If you have never smelled this before, you are sincerely missing out! This perfume smells just like the description, Very Sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is perfect for every occasion, though I will usually wear this on nights I am going out to a club/ discotheque or when I want a self-confidence boost during the day. Not only does one to two squirts of this last all day, you don&#x27;t have to worry about reapplying later or losing the cap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it! And I recommend it to everyone &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> The smell of it makes me mad , This is what i think when i think love .. perfect for the one i love   Thanks</li>
            <li> Eh it is what it is! Got what I was supposed to I just ordered the wrong thing and tried to cancel it but wasn&#x27;t allowed !</li>
            <li> This is, in my opinion, the best smelling perfume that I have ever come across. My wife loves it and always is complimented when she wears it.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells amazing and the price it right. I have been using this same perfume but it use to come in a different packaging. I was very pleased to see that it was the same great product with an amazing scent. Great product at a reduced price!!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume soo much.It smells really sophisticated and sexy.Not too strong.[[ASIN:B000QD3HQK Victoria Secret Very Sexy By Victoria&#x27;s Secret  Eau-de-parfume Spray, 3.4-Ounce]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Very Sexy for the past 10 years. It&#x27;s the only perfume that I will wear. When my mom busted the bottle in the bathroom, I didn&#x27;t want to pay retail price for this -- so I came to Amazon! It came very fast and it was just what I had ordered. The scent is strong. All you need is one spray on your wrist, then rub it into your neck. Also, this 3.4 ounce bottle lasts very long! If this product ever got discontinued, I would be sad...</li>
            <li> I love this perfume I have worn it for years now and it is truly the best. Not to sweet not too musty just right!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this perfume...and was very excited to find such a good deal online! It smells absolutely amazing, and lasts all day.</li>

            <li> Its prolly the worst thing I&#x27;ve ever smelled its overpowering and makes me gag every time im need someone with it on</li>
            <li> THE TITLE IS DECEIVING, IT SAYS VERY SEXY BUT IT SHOULD BE VERY ALLURING, BECAUSE THE PERFUME JUST DRAWS YOU IN ... IT&#x27;S FRESH YET SUBTLE, NOT OVERPOWERING LIKE SOME OTHERS</li>
            <li> Excelente la mercanc&amp;iacute;a&lt;br /&gt;Llego en buen estado&lt;br /&gt;Llego a tiempo la mercanc&amp;iacute;a&lt;br /&gt;Recomiendo a este comprador&lt;br /&gt;Estoy muy contento con mi producto...</li>
            <li> My sister loves this perfume, and I was able to get it. I did and it made her day. Especially because I was able to hide the fact that I bought it. Better in a box with a lable to me...than the bag from the store.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I simple love the smell and would definitely be buying it again. It is a bit more expensive at the store itself and the one bought via amazon was equally good. I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife and she likes it. It&#x27;s a lil pricey but it is Victoria Secret right? Would be nice to see it about $5-$10 less.</li>
