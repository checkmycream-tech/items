            <li>:o)</li>
            <li>I tried the good hair day by Joan Rivers and it works great</li>
            <li>This does the trick so nicely!</li>
            <li>It is very good and easy to use!</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and the medium brown color blends perfectly with my hair.</li>
            <li>My wife is happy, and confident, and now she doesn&#x60;t have to worry about running out of this any more.&lt;br /&gt;  Great product.</li>
            <li>It comes with age and genes, it&#x27;s fairly common.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bottom line, even if guys don&#x27;t always say it, guys do want to look good.</li>
            <li>It looks that good.</li>
            <li>Good coverage for thinning hair.</li>
            <li>covers really good</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll just give it a fair rating.  </li>
            <li>It covers well and looks good.  </li>
            <li>He has graying brown hair and found that medium brown sprinkled from the container and then combed looks good and makes hair darker without the dyed blond- brown look you get with touch of gray</li>
            <li>time to get good at applying.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as reviewers told.</li>
            <li>I believe Toppik has their own product, but I&#x27;ve been happy just using the Frizz-Ease that was already in my cabinet.</li>
            <li>Good product, works well for the intended purpose.</li>
            <li>Good shipping service.</li>
            <li>After reading some of the good reviews, I wonder who wrote them.</li>
            <li>Works great, nice appearance.</li>

            <li>It blends in perfectly with the color of my hair, and it complements my hair&#x27;s natural luster as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fortunate to have a hair dresser friend that helped me formulate a good color mixture of a quality product, which I purchase from her salon</li>
            <li>a look like i have full hair !!</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and thinning in spots.  </li>
            <li>I recently found about Toppix, it does work and was thrilled to find it on Amazon for a great price!!</li>
            <li>The fibers are so fine it gives you great coverage &amp; is well worth the price!</li>
            <li>But also very important, you will regain confidence.</li>
            <li>This is great for if you want to thicken the look of your hair in certain areas.</li>

            <li>I have been using it for years and love the results it gives my hair.</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s got to be something better for the $$</li>
            <li>This provides coverage but viviscal hair fibers is MUCH better.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love, Love, LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>This truly does give you more peace of mind and confidence.</li>
            <li>Never could get top off to put spray applicator on to use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write many reviews but this product deserves one.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Just lean over the sink when using, spray hair with hairspray, wipe up sink &amp; GO:)</li>
            <li>; in my hair, love it</li>
            <li>a magic marker went over your roots</li>
            <li>Then, don&#x27;t even think about touching your head for the rest of the day or it&#x27;s going to migrate.</li>
            <li>The product is ok  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure what color to try</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I feel more confident and don&#x27;t feel like people are pitying me.</li>
            <li>style my hair (mostly) any way I want to.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this product.</li>
            <li>I love this I use it on my roots</li>
            <li>I feel it clog the pores of your scalp creating more bald spots.</li>
            <li>It clings to hair astonishingly well and will stay there for days if you don&#x27;t rinse it out.</li>
            <li>Have used many times and will continue to order.</li>
            <li>Like most guys with MPB, you learn to find ways to accept it, fight it as best you can, and ultimately deal with it.</li>
            <li>She is so glad she tried this product.</li>
            <li>over all it is better than wearing a wig.</li>
            <li>I do not write many reviews, but felt compelled to write this one based on the level of satisfaction I had with this product.</li>
            <li>I think its a better product for a guy who is loosing his hair on the top of his head.</li>
            <li>alot better.</li>
            <li>I Love this product..</li>
            <li>Great product, highly recommended!</li>
            <li>i have thinning hair on top of my head.</li>
            <li>i am so glad i found this product.</li>
            <li>makes me feel better about my self.</li>
            <li>I had some doubts when I first heard about this product, but it really is amazing!</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with the performance of Toppik</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell when I need more of it.  </li>
            <li>I am balding on the top, but I had an audition in which I had to appear 18.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Unsure about being able to swim with it though...</li>
            <li>I am a hairstylist and am very familiar with thinning problems.</li>
            <li>Good product over all this was the first one I ordered</li>
            <li>My very first application of Toppik was wonderful: it shook on easily, blended seamlessly into my roots, and covered up every bit of scalp.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get much more experience and accuracy if you do it that way, don&#x27;t just shake it on, it wont be accurate and it can look clumped if you just shake it on.</li>
            <li>But it works great, looks natural,</li>
            <li>but this helps alot just to make it ABIT better looking more full</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall and most importantly, I&#x27;ve had no irritation, burning, itching or any discomfort using Toppik.</li>
            <li>I do suggest you use the dispenser top that is available.</li>
            <li>It came today, i sprinkled it on, and suddenly my hair looks incredible.  </li>
            <li>Good product at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>cant believe the magic of this product .I would never be able to live without!!!!</li>
            <li>I have bought other hair filler products, but this is the best.</li>
            <li>The product itself is very effective, but I ordered from amazon.co.uk when I was living in London over the summer; the order was fulfilled by Toppik and the bottle I received felt significantly lighter than normal.</li>
            <li>is easy to use, stays all day.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and covers up the thin/balding areas well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to brush it out or wash it off.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and know one knows.</li>
            <li>Can be worn all day as they do not rub off easily even when your sweating.</li>
            <li>It is so easy -</li>
            <li>and this is so easy and does not feel like &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34</li>
            <li>works well and easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li>This is a decent product providing you stay in good weather conditions or indoors.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you get the right shade!</li>
            <li>I ordered the dark brown Toppix and that was the best match .</li>
            <li>I wore it with gel just fine</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t have thinning hair (yet), I do have rather fine hair</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone with thinning or fine hair.</li>
            <li>and frankly it&#x27;s worth having to clean my bathroom more often to have more confidence about my hair.  </li>
            <li>The product may be fine - I do not know as I tried to return it and now have something I do not want.</li>
            <li>it on works fine</li>
            <li>head looks much better with using Toppik.&lt;br /&gt;Really super produkt.</li>
            <li>Such a great product for anyone with fine hair.  </li>
            <li>As stated above, works great for thinning crowns.</li>
            <li>Important to spray with hairspray</li>
            <li>The fibers stay put through rainstorms, even light swimming.  </li>
            <li>Overall a great product to conceal thinning hair</li>
            <li>I have tried a few versions of this type of product and like this best.</li>
            <li>The concept is fabulous, as it fills in thinning spots at my temple.</li>
            <li>It helps cover the scalp lightly, but it also seems to dust off by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>For those of us with thinning hair, especially women, this stuff is really great.  </li>
            <li>Spritz just a bit of any cheap hairspray for staying power.  </li>
            <li>It fills the balding spots in, allowing you to feel comfortable with your thinning hair,.</li>
            <li>The only downside I have experienced is after having it on all day</li>
            <li>I lightly tap the area a couple of times and then spray hairspray on the area and it stays put for the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li>(I did purchase this product directly from the manufacturer but wanted to post a review on Amazon so others who also shop Amazon.com would know about my good experience).</li>
            <li>Great quality, better price than other brands.  </li>
            <li>but if you do, THIS REALLY HELPS!!!</li>
            <li>This is a product is a must own for guys with hair loss, I really can&#x27;t praise enough of how good this product is.</li>
            <li>But, in general it serves a good purpose.  </li>
            <li>I ordered for myself and was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>You most likely will fall in love!</li>
            <li>Using the medium brown &amp;#34;sprinkles&amp;#34; in the crown of my head and then brushing makes a significant difference in my looks.</li>
            <li>The medium brown is pretty dark and is perfect with my hair color.  </li>
            <li>Mission complete, more than satisfied.</li>
            <li>I have really thin hair on top and this works perfect covering the bald spots.</li>
            <li>This is a decent product, and fills in the bald spots for sure, but the dust comes off easy, and gets all over your pillow, and clothing.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve chosen to use this on special occasions only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quick, easy, economical way to &#x27;fill in&#x27; those thinning spots.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use it, sparingly, when I have the time to perfect the coverage, which is hardly ever.</li>
            <li>My husband uses it to cover the whole top of his head, which looks like brown fungus growing out of his hair.</li>
            <li>, it was like magic before my very eyes....</li>
            <li>I love this, it really works, It makes my hair look fuller.......</li>
            <li>She is a very attractive and outgoing woman, so when this came about, it was worrisome to her, to say the least.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using this product, however, makes my hair appear as full as it did when I was 18.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but no matter how I comb it, you can tell it&#x27;s thinned out.  </li>
            <li>This is a perfect product for anyone with fine and thin hair.  </li>
            <li>you keep washing hair after 5 days, you will notice the Toppik fibers forming a circle around hair follicles, this looks more obvious and by that time, you will need to add more Toppik to your hair!.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>no one can tell your hair is falling out or you have a bold spot..</li>
            <li>Its a quick fix between hair dying.</li>
            <li>Thinning hair especially for women is often an embarrassment and this product will help you feel more confident.  </li>
            <li>and I want to cry over what a tremendous difference it&#x27;s made.  </li>
            <li>Short of a future cure for baldness and perhaps some of the more advanced hair transplant therapies available, this is as good as it&#x27;s going to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finish styling and set your hair with a mild hairspray.</li>
            <li>, this product has definitely made me more self confident about my appearance.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 100% natural plant fibers, and it washes out very easily with shampoo.</li>
            <li>I sprinkled it on a male friend&#x27;s bald spot and it was amazing how it covered it right up!</li>
            <li>Great for special occasions or for everyday.</li>
            <li>Fast, easy application</li>
            <li>I have dark brown hair, but the medium-brown blends very nicely</li>
            <li>To sum up this product; it does exactly what it says it can do!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews of products, but felt compelled to share my thoughts on Toppik for those of you who are on fence about making a purchase.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an actual, natural way to use existing hairs to get great results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>For the price, I would have liked this product in a larger sized container.  </li>
            <li>do doubt it would work on hair that is thinning all over but would be worth a try.  </li>
            <li>Man, it was worth the bit of time it took to find it.</li>
            <li>more natural than a wig.</li>
            <li>I wore it to a party a few weeks ago and got home and noticed a  portion was rubbing off and wasn&#x27;t sure if it happened after the party or while I was still there and that kind of worried me.</li>
            <li>I do not know another product which surprised me more than Toppik Hair Fibers.  </li>
            <li>It completely colors in his bald spot on top.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works great but takes a few times to get to know the right amount</li>
            <li>Easy and pretty fast to use.</li>
            <li>RIGHT</li>
            <li>Trust me, if you do it correctly and do some styling, not only will you look like a million bucks, but you&#x27;ll feel like a new man and want to look that good all the time.</li>
            <li>I really like the way this product works fast and easily to hide the thinning spots in my hair.</li>
            <li>My only recommendation is if you have greying hair mixed in with brown on the sides you need to dye it to make the blending more effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried 3 different similar products &amp; this one by far stands out as the best.</li>
            <li>Also very important, it really does look natural, no one, and I guarantee no one will know your using it.</li>
            <li>I have little to moderate thinning and this covers it perfectly!  </li>
            <li>Using Toppik has had a huge pyschological impact on him because he is always ducking his head in front of any strong wind, constantly wearing hats when he is not using the product, and is constantly checking to make sure the fibres are in place.</li>
            <li>It truly does help one to feel more confident about a few  thinning &amp;#34;spots&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The product in itself is great -- a little dry, but it sure makes a difference to the volume of my hair.</li>
            <li>You might look in the mirror at home and think you look fine, but when you go outside in natural light, forget it!</li>
            <li>I have thinning hair on top and around my crown at the back.</li>
            <li>I found this out by accident after running some errands and was pretty embarrassed.</li>
            <li>I purchased the small size to make sure I&#x27;d like the product, but I&#x27;m  sure I will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li>The product is very helpful for us women!</li>
            <li>I tried Toppik for first time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty discouraging when your going out.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used this product.</li>
            <li>Since I color my hair, I use a darker shade at first and then a medium shade as the weeks go</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s perfectly balanced in such a small bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>I plan to get the spray applicator as they seems to help get it exactly where you want it to</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>I tell you, the first time I applied this product, combed it in and sprayed it</li>
            <li>but I think viviscal does it better and cheaper personally.</li>
            <li>It comes in lots of colors and is forgiving in terms of the shade not being EXACT to what you have.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>I would always use hair clips to conceal the top and back crown part of my scalp.</li>
            <li>We&#x60;l  be back for more.</li>
            <li>I suggest ordering the smallest amount to see if you like the color first.  </li>
            <li>just so&lt;br /&gt;you are aware.</li>
            <li>Have been using for several years now and am always pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Toppik!  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be able to work with the public without this product.  </li>
            <li>I put it on the very front where its really thin,and it would rub off quickly there.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product for thin hair, looks very natural</li>
            <li>simple, clean, effective and not obvious that it is there.</li>
            <li>its very true to color of hair, I also have golden highlights on med brn hair and went with base color of hair of med brn and perfect match!!!</li>
            <li>As other reviews have mentioned, it kind of looks like dirt on your scalp.  </li>
            <li>My hair is quite thin on the top and this nicely disguises it.  </li>
            <li>The front portion of my head where I usually part my hair was mildly thinner than I liked.</li>
            <li>Getting older is not for sissy my Mother always said and she is right.  </li>
            <li>(not sure how it will look under those bright lights, though).</li>
            <li>It also gets used a bit more as my grey roots start to show.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my mother recently and was so pleased to see how it changed her whole appearance, and gave her much needed confidence.</li>
            <li>Less is more in this case, and the best way to apply Toppik is by starting where your hair is currently growing and working within the hairline, not outside it.</li>
            <li>only thing I can add is that it would be safe to get a color one shade lighter than what you normally think to purchase.</li>
            <li>But I combine the red and med brown and it works fine.</li>
            <li>Not only is coverage better, you use less and you get more per bottle</li>
            <li>I think a finely ground coffee would do the same thing.</li>
            <li>I recommend it very highly.</li>
            <li>Once I have my hair styled and sprayed in place, I tilt my head back a little and lightly tap the container so that the fine particles land precisely where I want.  </li>
            <li>Good but hard to apply.</li>
            <li>I have never used a product like this before and quite frankly, did not have very high expectations that this product would really work.  </li>
            <li>it truly has given me such a huge boost in confidence....</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>This is just as described and works really well.</li>
            <li>Not so much for from hairlines.</li>
            <li>A real confidence booster.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;bond&amp;#34; to my hair at all.</li>
            <li>Toppik has really exacerbated his vanity about losing his hair.</li>
            <li>It really makes your hair fuller and fluffier.  </li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>Has save me lots of time and really like this product.</li>
            <li>It seem to be working very well covering up the thinning spot.</li>
            <li>It stays on really well</li>
            <li>Toppik has really improved my confidence....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real issue that guys deal with, believe me I&#x27;ve been there.</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise, it does just that.  </li>
            <li>It covers the areas where my hair is thinning and really makes it look fuller and thicker.</li>
            <li>matter how much i style my hair.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think much of it</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really use it all that often anyway.</li>
            <li>I use mine mostly on the top part of my head - from the hairline (bangs) back a few inches.</li>
            <li>Really fills it in and covers my scalp.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, just like I needed.</li>
            <li>This product absolutely makes your really look thicker and fuller.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed when I apply too much</li>
            <li>Well no one wants to have the issue of thinning hair</li>
            <li>Also, if I add too much it can cake on my scalp-</li>
            <li>, I really wish I had bought this then.</li>
            <li>and no matter what, it goes straight to the scalp.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>Great product for concealing areas of thin hair density, changing haircolor, or masking dermal scars after surgery.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, it really works.  </li>
            <li>This stuff looks like real hair.</li>
            <li>I started losing my hair when I was 19 (24 now), and it has been a very gradual process.</li>
            <li>While it doesn&#x27;t solve the problem of hair loss (I&#x27;ve found the Therapy G line to be helpful in that respect), it absolutely lessens the appearance.</li>
            <li>Grayce is a product that really works miracles for the purpose of temporally covering root growth.</li>
            <li>Really fills in the scalp area.  </li>
            <li>The product does not stay in your hair until washed out as they promise It  can Hide you thinning hair if it&#x27;s not too much</li>
            <li>Because of reviews I read from others, I have not used this product too much.  </li>
            <li>The color blends really well with my color - which is chestnut.  </li>
            <li>if i spray it light enough it is perfect coverage - just have a problem with getting it on thin enough.  </li>
            <li>I have thinning hair on most of the top of my head and noticed in pictures how thin it was getting.</li>
            <li>He was surprised how Toppik is just as good of quality as the more expensive one.</li>
            <li>If I keep my hair trimmed properly and brush and blow dry it carefully, I can get away the appearance of full coverage, but it&#x27;s gradually getting more and more</li>
            <li>There is a tool for that, but I choose to just be a bit more careful in applying it!</li>
            <li>It looks better than some of the other products I have tried which are like \\&quot;painting\\&quot; makeup on your scalp.</li>
            <li>I have lost a significant amount of weight and have suddenly started experiencing severe thinning, to the point that my scalp is visible all over.  </li>
            <li>I originally ordered the travel size and when I saw how well it worked, I ordered the larger size.  </li>
            <li>Fibers really make thinning male hair look full again.</li>
            <li>I have thinning hair at the top, and this product makes my hair look full and thick.</li>
            <li>Fantastic results with this product, have been using it for a long time.</li>
            <li>and it is more of a dark brown.</li>
            <li>but I found out my hair was more of a dark brown</li>
            <li>The medium brown was more of a dark brown on my medium brown hair.</li>
            <li>It is very useful to hide  grey roots  </li>
            <li>Color is more like black.</li>
            <li>In my case, less is more.  </li>
            <li>I have only a mild case of thinning hair.</li>
            <li>The main difference&lt;br /&gt;between</li>
            <li>I just ordered the hair spray by Toppik but after reading the reviews, most say it is the same as regular hair spray</li>
            <li>It takes some getting use to, it is easy to be heavy handed at first.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend purchasing the atomizer that you can screw on to the container.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I would highly reccomend this to anyone who has thinning hair.</li>
            <li>Her head is held high again,</li>
            <li>Then I spray with a little more hairspray and that&#x27;s it.  </li>
            <li>A friend of ours, who does hair, talked to her and on a visit to her shop, showed my wife this little bottle of magic.</li>
            <li>Based on other friend&#x27;s recommendation I bought this as a gift for a cousin, she loves it and says it is really easy to use and covers the gray roots well.  </li>
            <li>If you style and comb your hair and really combine your hair with the Toppik, it will look like your natural hair.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve aged my hair has gotten much thinner and areas are becoming bare.  </li>
            <li>I do not find the shaking to be messy at all, but again, I just use it on my part area at the top and along either side of my part.</li>
            <li>Maybe I should of ordered blonde to get the right color.</li>
            <li>This was recommended to me by the Bosley center after a hair transplant because you tend to lose some of your original hair in shock trauma.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about five years now, and cannot live without it.  </li>
            <li>In my experience, not a lot of people know about these kinds of concealers since they are fairly new, so no ones the wiser.</li>
            <li>I peel back just a small part of the sticker on top of the bottle and get just the right amount I need.</li>
            <li>so I tried it and was very surprised</li>
            <li>&quot; is actually dark brown, and \\&quot;Light</li>
            <li>When I decided to order it I was really not sure, but I used it and found it is working magically.</li>
            <li>Looks really natural!</li>
            <li>downside is the fine black powder all over the bathroom</li>
            <li>Unlike so many other products for MPB, this one actually lives up to its hype.</li>
            <li>I am a 45 year old female with moderate thinning, with the most obvious thinning in my part area.  </li>
            <li>I am a 39 yr old female with fine shedding hair and have tried chasing down the cause through many yrs old blood work and even a year of laser hair therapy with no success.</li>
            <li>I would call my thinness on the mild side and not necessary moderate at this point.  </li>
            <li>Also although a little light rain/mist/snow flurries do not displace.</li>
            <li>But the medium brown is a little too light for me.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had as much luck with it on over all thinning female hair, but it does what it says as far as covering bald spots.</li>
            <li>Toppik fills in those sparse areas and looks totally natural.  </li>
            <li>, i don&#x27;t think its for anyone who is balding completely it won&#x27;t work its for those who are thinning</li>
            <li>The claim that it can withstand rain or shine is a complete lie.</li>
            <li>and I feel old when I look in the mirror.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This isn&#x27;t like the old fashioned hair concealers of the 80s and 90s which was the equivalent of just spraying paint on your head.</li>
            <li>and  looks natural, match with my natural hair color.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>I am surprised at how well this product works to fill in the bald spots and make my hair look thicker.</li>
            <li>I remember looking at this product nearly a year ago and didn&#x27;t buy this because of the price</li>
            <li>and WOW.. I went to hairdressing school and know about all products having 3 hairdressers in the family</li>
            <li>Totally natural looking and undetectable.  </li>
            <li>I do not color my hair and this blends in well with my natural color.</li>
            <li>It looks incredibly natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost 72 years old.</li>
            <li>I tried another similar product that was  powder-like and was very inferior to Toppik.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very expensive and it raised my self confidence in ways I didn&#x27;t think possible.</li>
            <li>It is an incredible waste of money because this product would work only for people with very small bald spots.</li>
            <li>The product is so light of weight and the container is dark and offers no hint of when you&#x27;re getting low!  </li>
            <li>Really wish I had tried it a long time ago.</li>
            <li>I have long straight brown hair</li>
            <li>It is nice to go out in public and not worry about direct sunlight highlighting all my thin areas.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and wavy with lots of cowlicks in the back of my hair, which leaves a few areas where my scalp shows.  </li>
            <li>I really regret not knowing about this a long time ago!</li>
            <li>Next time, he wants to get the bigger bottle.</li>
            <li>It looks very natural, doesn&#x27;t rub off, and lasts until my next shampoo (3-4 days).</li>
            <li>My hair is no longer thin due to Toppix, I love the product, its the only I have found that really does what you see in the advertisement, thanks Toppix.</li>
            <li>Be it either in the face of friends, the work place, or trying to meet girls, hair loss can play a major factor in how someone is perceived towards others.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it on the front part of my hairline just above the forehead to cover my scalp just above my bangs.  </li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t really what I expected.</li>
            <li>, Toppik is an all natural fiber-based concealer that fills in existing hairs and provides a look of fullness and can bring the scalp back together where thinning or patches of baldness have parted the hairline.</li>
            <li>I really dont think this stuff will hold on after sweating or getting wet.</li>
            <li>: should you get a little on your hand, it&#x27;ll rinse right off.</li>
            <li>I use Toppik when I&#x27;m having a really thin hair day with too much scalp showing &amp; it gets me out the door quickly with confidence and undectable coverage.</li>
            <li>first tried applying the product to the roots of my hair like the pictures and instructions but it stuck to my scalp and looked rather odd.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes if I wear it in the morning, I notice that in the afternoon most of the product is gone and I can see my scalp again at least partially .  </li>
            <li>Instead of just accepting the fact that hair loss is natural and inevitable and that it doesn&#x27;t even bother me, my husband constantly obsesses over his hair.</li>
            <li>Be careful not to sprinkle too much because then it&#x27;s obvious you&#x27;re using something to cover the thinnest part.  </li>
            <li>I am a 34 year old female with moderate thinning on my scalp and crown.</li>
            <li>Toppik not only hides the scalp where hair is thin, but gives my hair better texture and volume.  </li>
            <li>My hairline has receded quit a bit, and now the area behind above my temples is fading out, and gradually receding more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had a high hair line, and as far as I can tell it has not receded, but I have much less density than I did about six years ago.</li>
            <li>The two times before that and one time since that I&#x27;ve purchased the bottle from a beauty store, it was heavier and lasted at least a full year.</li>
            <li>I am black and it works very well on my hair.</li>
            <li>The applicator will really help you use less product too, increasing the time between purchases.</li>
            <li>i notice it starts to look less real and rub off.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t try it the first time with only a few minutes before you have to rush out the door.</li>
            <li>I sprinkle a little in certain spots and it makes a world of difference in my appearance and my confidence.</li>
            <li>It really does help with the application process and eliminates mess.  </li>
            <li>Hard to get used to at first, but like it!</li>
            <li>This product makes my fine thin hair look and feel fuller.</li>
            <li>I have salt and pepper, thin fine hair cut in short layers.  </li>
            <li>IT REALLY COVERS LITTLE THIN PLACES WITH A FILL IN OF EXTREMELY LIGHT BROWN FIBERS</li>
            <li>This is more like BLack Black Black...</li>

            <li> :o)</li>
            <li> I tried the good hair day by Joan Rivers and it works great</li>
            <li> This does the trick so nicely!</li>
            <li> It is very good and easy to use!</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and the medium brown color blends perfectly with my hair.</li>
            <li> My wife is happy, and confident, and now she doesn&#x60;t have to worry about running out of this any more.&lt;br /&gt;  Great product.</li>
            <li> It comes with age and genes, it&#x27;s fairly common.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bottom line, even if guys don&#x27;t always say it, guys do want to look good.</li>
            <li> It looks that good.</li>
            <li> Good coverage for thinning hair.</li>
            <li> covers really good</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll just give it a fair rating.  </li>
            <li> It covers well and looks good.  </li>
            <li> He has graying brown hair and found that medium brown sprinkled from the container and then combed looks good and makes hair darker without the dyed blond- brown look you get with touch of gray</li>
            <li> time to get good at applying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as reviewers told.</li>
            <li> I believe Toppik has their own product, but I&#x27;ve been happy just using the Frizz-Ease that was already in my cabinet.</li>
            <li> Good product, works well for the intended purpose.</li>
            <li> Good shipping service.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the good reviews, I wonder who wrote them.</li>
            <li> Works great, nice appearance.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, i have good hair</li>

            <li> Love, love, this product!</li>
            <li> , I felt self conscious and this solved it perfectly.</li>
            <li> But, as far as it working, it is great!!!!!</li>
            <li> It blends in perfectly with the color of my hair, and it complements my hair&#x27;s natural luster as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fortunate to have a hair dresser friend that helped me formulate a good color mixture of a quality product, which I purchase from her salon</li>
            <li> a look like i have full hair !!</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and thinning in spots.  </li>
            <li> I recently found about Toppix, it does work and was thrilled to find it on Amazon for a great price!!</li>
            <li> The fibers are so fine it gives you great coverage &amp; is well worth the price!</li>
            <li> But also very important, you will regain confidence.</li>
            <li> This is great for if you want to thicken the look of your hair in certain areas.</li>

            <li> I have been using it for years and love the results it gives my hair.</li>

            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s got to be something better for the $$</li>
            <li> This provides coverage but viviscal hair fibers is MUCH better.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> This truly does give you more peace of mind and confidence.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews but this product deserves one.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Just lean over the sink when using, spray hair with hairspray, wipe up sink &amp; GO:)</li>
            <li> ; in my hair, love it</li>
            <li> a magic marker went over your roots</li>
            <li> Then, don&#x27;t even think about touching your head for the rest of the day or it&#x27;s going to migrate.</li>
            <li> The product is ok  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what color to try</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I feel more confident and don&#x27;t feel like people are pitying me.</li>
            <li> style my hair (mostly) any way I want to.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> I love this I use it on my roots</li>
            <li> I feel it clog the pores of your scalp creating more bald spots.</li>
            <li> It clings to hair astonishingly well and will stay there for days if you don&#x27;t rinse it out.</li>
            <li> Have used many times and will continue to order.</li>
            <li> Like most guys with MPB, you learn to find ways to accept it, fight it as best you can, and ultimately deal with it.</li>
            <li> She is so glad she tried this product.</li>
            <li> over all it is better than wearing a wig.</li>
            <li> I do not write many reviews, but felt compelled to write this one based on the level of satisfaction I had with this product.</li>
            <li> I think its a better product for a guy who is loosing his hair on the top of his head.</li>
            <li> alot better.</li>
            <li> I Love this product..</li>
            <li> Great product, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> i have thinning hair on top of my head.</li>
            <li> i am so glad i found this product.</li>
            <li> makes me feel better about my self.</li>
            <li> I had some doubts when I first heard about this product, but it really is amazing!</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with the performance of Toppik</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell when I need more of it.  </li>
            <li> I am balding on the top, but I had an audition in which I had to appear 18.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Unsure about being able to swim with it though...</li>
            <li> I am a hairstylist and am very familiar with thinning problems.</li>
            <li> Good product over all this was the first one I ordered</li>
            <li> My very first application of Toppik was wonderful: it shook on easily, blended seamlessly into my roots, and covered up every bit of scalp.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get much more experience and accuracy if you do it that way, don&#x27;t just shake it on, it wont be accurate and it can look clumped if you just shake it on.</li>
            <li> But it works great, looks natural,</li>
            <li> but this helps alot just to make it ABIT better looking more full</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall and most importantly, I&#x27;ve had no irritation, burning, itching or any discomfort using Toppik.</li>
            <li> I do suggest you use the dispenser top that is available.</li>
            <li> It came today, i sprinkled it on, and suddenly my hair looks incredible.  </li>
            <li> Good product at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> cant believe the magic of this product .I would never be able to live without!!!!</li>
            <li> I have bought other hair filler products, but this is the best.</li>
            <li> The product itself is very effective, but I ordered from amazon.co.uk when I was living in London over the summer; the order was fulfilled by Toppik and the bottle I received felt significantly lighter than normal.</li>
            <li> is easy to use, stays all day.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and covers up the thin/balding areas well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to brush it out or wash it off.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and know one knows.</li>
            <li> Can be worn all day as they do not rub off easily even when your sweating.</li>
            <li> It is so easy -</li>
            <li> and this is so easy and does not feel like &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34</li>
            <li> works well and easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li> This is a decent product providing you stay in good weather conditions or indoors.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you get the right shade!</li>
            <li> I ordered the dark brown Toppix and that was the best match .</li>
            <li> I wore it with gel just fine</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t have thinning hair (yet), I do have rather fine hair</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone with thinning or fine hair.</li>
            <li> and frankly it&#x27;s worth having to clean my bathroom more often to have more confidence about my hair.  </li>
            <li> The product may be fine - I do not know as I tried to return it and now have something I do not want.</li>
            <li> it on works fine</li>
            <li> head looks much better with using Toppik.&lt;br /&gt;Really super produkt.</li>
            <li> Such a great product for anyone with fine hair.  </li>
            <li> As stated above, works great for thinning crowns.</li>
            <li> Important to spray with hairspray</li>
            <li> The fibers stay put through rainstorms, even light swimming.  </li>
            <li> Overall a great product to conceal thinning hair</li>
            <li> I have tried a few versions of this type of product and like this best.</li>
            <li> The concept is fabulous, as it fills in thinning spots at my temple.</li>
            <li> It helps cover the scalp lightly, but it also seems to dust off by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> For those of us with thinning hair, especially women, this stuff is really great.  </li>
            <li> Spritz just a bit of any cheap hairspray for staying power.  </li>
            <li> It fills the balding spots in, allowing you to feel comfortable with your thinning hair,.</li>
            <li> The only downside I have experienced is after having it on all day</li>
            <li> I lightly tap the area a couple of times and then spray hairspray on the area and it stays put for the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li> (I did purchase this product directly from the manufacturer but wanted to post a review on Amazon so others who also shop Amazon.com would know about my good experience).</li>
            <li> Great quality, better price than other brands.  </li>
            <li> but if you do, THIS REALLY HELPS!!!</li>
            <li> This is a product is a must own for guys with hair loss, I really can&#x27;t praise enough of how good this product is.</li>
            <li> But, in general it serves a good purpose.  </li>
            <li> I ordered for myself and was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> You most likely will fall in love!</li>
            <li> Using the medium brown &amp;#34;sprinkles&amp;#34; in the crown of my head and then brushing makes a significant difference in my looks.</li>
            <li> The medium brown is pretty dark and is perfect with my hair color.  </li>
            <li> Mission complete, more than satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have really thin hair on top and this works perfect covering the bald spots.</li>
            <li> This is a decent product, and fills in the bald spots for sure, but the dust comes off easy, and gets all over your pillow, and clothing.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve chosen to use this on special occasions only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quick, easy, economical way to &#x27;fill in&#x27; those thinning spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use it, sparingly, when I have the time to perfect the coverage, which is hardly ever.</li>
            <li> My husband uses it to cover the whole top of his head, which looks like brown fungus growing out of his hair.</li>
            <li> , it was like magic before my very eyes....</li>
            <li> I love this, it really works, It makes my hair look fuller.......</li>
            <li> She is a very attractive and outgoing woman, so when this came about, it was worrisome to her, to say the least.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using this product, however, makes my hair appear as full as it did when I was 18.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but no matter how I comb it, you can tell it&#x27;s thinned out.  </li>
            <li> This is a perfect product for anyone with fine and thin hair.  </li>
            <li> you keep washing hair after 5 days, you will notice the Toppik fibers forming a circle around hair follicles, this looks more obvious and by that time, you will need to add more Toppik to your hair!.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> no one can tell your hair is falling out or you have a bold spot..</li>
            <li> Its a quick fix between hair dying.</li>
            <li> Thinning hair especially for women is often an embarrassment and this product will help you feel more confident.  </li>
            <li> and I want to cry over what a tremendous difference it&#x27;s made.  </li>
            <li> Short of a future cure for baldness and perhaps some of the more advanced hair transplant therapies available, this is as good as it&#x27;s going to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finish styling and set your hair with a mild hairspray.</li>
            <li> , this product has definitely made me more self confident about my appearance.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 100% natural plant fibers, and it washes out very easily with shampoo.</li>
            <li> I sprinkled it on a male friend&#x27;s bald spot and it was amazing how it covered it right up!</li>
            <li> Great for special occasions or for everyday.</li>
            <li> Fast, easy application</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair, but the medium-brown blends very nicely</li>
            <li> To sum up this product; it does exactly what it says it can do!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews of products, but felt compelled to share my thoughts on Toppik for those of you who are on fence about making a purchase.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an actual, natural way to use existing hairs to get great results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> For the price, I would have liked this product in a larger sized container.  </li>
            <li> do doubt it would work on hair that is thinning all over but would be worth a try.  </li>
            <li> Man, it was worth the bit of time it took to find it.</li>
            <li> more natural than a wig.</li>
            <li> I wore it to a party a few weeks ago and got home and noticed a  portion was rubbing off and wasn&#x27;t sure if it happened after the party or while I was still there and that kind of worried me.</li>
            <li> I do not know another product which surprised me more than Toppik Hair Fibers.  </li>
            <li> It completely colors in his bald spot on top.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works great but takes a few times to get to know the right amount</li>
            <li> Easy and pretty fast to use.</li>
            <li> RIGHT</li>
            <li> Trust me, if you do it correctly and do some styling, not only will you look like a million bucks, but you&#x27;ll feel like a new man and want to look that good all the time.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this product works fast and easily to hide the thinning spots in my hair.</li>
            <li> My only recommendation is if you have greying hair mixed in with brown on the sides you need to dye it to make the blending more effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 3 different similar products &amp; this one by far stands out as the best.</li>
            <li> Also very important, it really does look natural, no one, and I guarantee no one will know your using it.</li>
            <li> I have little to moderate thinning and this covers it perfectly!  </li>
            <li> Using Toppik has had a huge pyschological impact on him because he is always ducking his head in front of any strong wind, constantly wearing hats when he is not using the product, and is constantly checking to make sure the fibres are in place.</li>
            <li> It truly does help one to feel more confident about a few  thinning &amp;#34;spots&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The product in itself is great -- a little dry, but it sure makes a difference to the volume of my hair.</li>
            <li> You might look in the mirror at home and think you look fine, but when you go outside in natural light, forget it!</li>
            <li> I have thinning hair on top and around my crown at the back.</li>
            <li> I found this out by accident after running some errands and was pretty embarrassed.</li>
            <li> I purchased the small size to make sure I&#x27;d like the product, but I&#x27;m  sure I will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> The product is very helpful for us women!</li>
            <li> I tried Toppik for first time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty discouraging when your going out.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used this product.</li>
            <li> Since I color my hair, I use a darker shade at first and then a medium shade as the weeks go</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s perfectly balanced in such a small bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> I plan to get the spray applicator as they seems to help get it exactly where you want it to</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> I tell you, the first time I applied this product, combed it in and sprayed it</li>
            <li> but I think viviscal does it better and cheaper personally.</li>
            <li> It comes in lots of colors and is forgiving in terms of the shade not being EXACT to what you have.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I would always use hair clips to conceal the top and back crown part of my scalp.</li>
            <li> We&#x60;l  be back for more.</li>
            <li> I suggest ordering the smallest amount to see if you like the color first.  </li>
            <li> just so&lt;br /&gt;you are aware.</li>
            <li> Have been using for several years now and am always pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Toppik!  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be able to work with the public without this product.  </li>
            <li> I put it on the very front where its really thin,and it would rub off quickly there.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for thin hair, looks very natural</li>
            <li> simple, clean, effective and not obvious that it is there.</li>
            <li> its very true to color of hair, I also have golden highlights on med brn hair and went with base color of hair of med brn and perfect match!!!</li>
            <li> As other reviews have mentioned, it kind of looks like dirt on your scalp.  </li>
            <li> My hair is quite thin on the top and this nicely disguises it.  </li>
            <li> The front portion of my head where I usually part my hair was mildly thinner than I liked.</li>
            <li> Getting older is not for sissy my Mother always said and she is right.  </li>
            <li> (not sure how it will look under those bright lights, though).</li>
            <li> It also gets used a bit more as my grey roots start to show.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my mother recently and was so pleased to see how it changed her whole appearance, and gave her much needed confidence.</li>
            <li> Less is more in this case, and the best way to apply Toppik is by starting where your hair is currently growing and working within the hairline, not outside it.</li>
            <li> only thing I can add is that it would be safe to get a color one shade lighter than what you normally think to purchase.</li>
            <li> But I combine the red and med brown and it works fine.</li>
            <li> Not only is coverage better, you use less and you get more per bottle</li>
            <li> I think a finely ground coffee would do the same thing.</li>
            <li> I recommend it very highly.</li>
            <li> Once I have my hair styled and sprayed in place, I tilt my head back a little and lightly tap the container so that the fine particles land precisely where I want.  </li>
            <li> Good but hard to apply.</li>
            <li> I have never used a product like this before and quite frankly, did not have very high expectations that this product would really work.  </li>
            <li> it truly has given me such a huge boost in confidence....</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> This is just as described and works really well.</li>
            <li> Not so much for from hairlines.</li>
            <li> A real confidence booster.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;bond&amp;#34; to my hair at all.</li>
            <li> Toppik has really exacerbated his vanity about losing his hair.</li>
            <li> It really makes your hair fuller and fluffier.  </li>
            <li> and it really works.</li>
            <li> Has save me lots of time and really like this product.</li>
            <li> It seem to be working very well covering up the thinning spot.</li>
            <li> It stays on really well</li>
            <li> Toppik has really improved my confidence....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a real issue that guys deal with, believe me I&#x27;ve been there.</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise, it does just that.  </li>
            <li> It covers the areas where my hair is thinning and really makes it look fuller and thicker.</li>
            <li> matter how much i style my hair.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think much of it</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really use it all that often anyway.</li>
            <li> I use mine mostly on the top part of my head - from the hairline (bangs) back a few inches.</li>
            <li> Really fills it in and covers my scalp.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, just like I needed.</li>
            <li> This product absolutely makes your really look thicker and fuller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed when I apply too much</li>
            <li> Well no one wants to have the issue of thinning hair</li>
            <li> Also, if I add too much it can cake on my scalp-</li>
            <li> , I really wish I had bought this then.</li>
            <li> and no matter what, it goes straight to the scalp.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> Great product for concealing areas of thin hair density, changing haircolor, or masking dermal scars after surgery.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it really works.  </li>
            <li> This stuff looks like real hair.</li>
            <li> I started losing my hair when I was 19 (24 now), and it has been a very gradual process.</li>
            <li> While it doesn&#x27;t solve the problem of hair loss (I&#x27;ve found the Therapy G line to be helpful in that respect), it absolutely lessens the appearance.</li>
            <li> Grayce is a product that really works miracles for the purpose of temporally covering root growth.</li>
            <li> Really fills in the scalp area.  </li>
            <li> The product does not stay in your hair until washed out as they promise It  can Hide you thinning hair if it&#x27;s not too much</li>
            <li> Because of reviews I read from others, I have not used this product too much.  </li>
            <li> The color blends really well with my color - which is chestnut.  </li>
            <li> if i spray it light enough it is perfect coverage - just have a problem with getting it on thin enough.  </li>
            <li> I have thinning hair on most of the top of my head and noticed in pictures how thin it was getting.</li>
            <li> He was surprised how Toppik is just as good of quality as the more expensive one.</li>
            <li> If I keep my hair trimmed properly and brush and blow dry it carefully, I can get away the appearance of full coverage, but it&#x27;s gradually getting more and more</li>
            <li> There is a tool for that, but I choose to just be a bit more careful in applying it!</li>
            <li> It looks better than some of the other products I have tried which are like \\&quot;painting\\&quot; makeup on your scalp.</li>
            <li> I have lost a significant amount of weight and have suddenly started experiencing severe thinning, to the point that my scalp is visible all over.  </li>
            <li> I originally ordered the travel size and when I saw how well it worked, I ordered the larger size.  </li>
            <li> Fibers really make thinning male hair look full again.</li>
            <li> I have thinning hair at the top, and this product makes my hair look full and thick.</li>
            <li> Fantastic results with this product, have been using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> and it is more of a dark brown.</li>
            <li> but I found out my hair was more of a dark brown</li>
            <li> The medium brown was more of a dark brown on my medium brown hair.</li>
            <li> It is very useful to hide  grey roots  </li>
            <li> Color is more like black.</li>
            <li> In my case, less is more.  </li>
            <li> I have only a mild case of thinning hair.</li>
            <li> The main difference&lt;br /&gt;between</li>
            <li> I just ordered the hair spray by Toppik but after reading the reviews, most say it is the same as regular hair spray</li>
            <li> It takes some getting use to, it is easy to be heavy handed at first.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend purchasing the atomizer that you can screw on to the container.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I would highly reccomend this to anyone who has thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Her head is held high again,</li>
            <li> Then I spray with a little more hairspray and that&#x27;s it.  </li>
            <li> A friend of ours, who does hair, talked to her and on a visit to her shop, showed my wife this little bottle of magic.</li>
            <li> Based on other friend&#x27;s recommendation I bought this as a gift for a cousin, she loves it and says it is really easy to use and covers the gray roots well.  </li>
            <li> If you style and comb your hair and really combine your hair with the Toppik, it will look like your natural hair.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve aged my hair has gotten much thinner and areas are becoming bare.  </li>
            <li> I do not find the shaking to be messy at all, but again, I just use it on my part area at the top and along either side of my part.</li>
            <li> Maybe I should of ordered blonde to get the right color.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by the Bosley center after a hair transplant because you tend to lose some of your original hair in shock trauma.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about five years now, and cannot live without it.  </li>
            <li> In my experience, not a lot of people know about these kinds of concealers since they are fairly new, so no ones the wiser.</li>
            <li> I peel back just a small part of the sticker on top of the bottle and get just the right amount I need.</li>
            <li> so I tried it and was very surprised</li>
            <li> &quot; is actually dark brown, and \\&quot;Light</li>
            <li> When I decided to order it I was really not sure, but I used it and found it is working magically.</li>
            <li> Looks really natural!</li>
            <li> downside is the fine black powder all over the bathroom</li>
            <li> Unlike so many other products for MPB, this one actually lives up to its hype.</li>
            <li> I am a 45 year old female with moderate thinning, with the most obvious thinning in my part area.  </li>
            <li> I am a 39 yr old female with fine shedding hair and have tried chasing down the cause through many yrs old blood work and even a year of laser hair therapy with no success.</li>
            <li> I would call my thinness on the mild side and not necessary moderate at this point.  </li>
            <li> Also although a little light rain/mist/snow flurries do not displace.</li>
            <li> But the medium brown is a little too light for me.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had as much luck with it on over all thinning female hair, but it does what it says as far as covering bald spots.</li>
            <li> Toppik fills in those sparse areas and looks totally natural.  </li>
            <li> , i don&#x27;t think its for anyone who is balding completely it won&#x27;t work its for those who are thinning</li>
            <li> The claim that it can withstand rain or shine is a complete lie.</li>
            <li> and I feel old when I look in the mirror.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This isn&#x27;t like the old fashioned hair concealers of the 80s and 90s which was the equivalent of just spraying paint on your head.</li>
            <li> and  looks natural, match with my natural hair color.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> I am surprised at how well this product works to fill in the bald spots and make my hair look thicker.</li>
            <li> I remember looking at this product nearly a year ago and didn&#x27;t buy this because of the price</li>
            <li> and WOW.. I went to hairdressing school and know about all products having 3 hairdressers in the family</li>
            <li> Totally natural looking and undetectable.  </li>
            <li> I do not color my hair and this blends in well with my natural color.</li>
            <li> It looks incredibly natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 72 years old.</li>
            <li> I tried another similar product that was  powder-like and was very inferior to Toppik.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very expensive and it raised my self confidence in ways I didn&#x27;t think possible.</li>
            <li> It is an incredible waste of money because this product would work only for people with very small bald spots.</li>
            <li> The product is so light of weight and the container is dark and offers no hint of when you&#x27;re getting low!  </li>
            <li> Really wish I had tried it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I have long straight brown hair</li>
            <li> It is nice to go out in public and not worry about direct sunlight highlighting all my thin areas.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and wavy with lots of cowlicks in the back of my hair, which leaves a few areas where my scalp shows.  </li>
            <li> I really regret not knowing about this a long time ago!</li>
            <li> Next time, he wants to get the bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> It looks very natural, doesn&#x27;t rub off, and lasts until my next shampoo (3-4 days).</li>
            <li> My hair is no longer thin due to Toppix, I love the product, its the only I have found that really does what you see in the advertisement, thanks Toppix.</li>
            <li> Be it either in the face of friends, the work place, or trying to meet girls, hair loss can play a major factor in how someone is perceived towards others.</li>
            <li> I mainly use it on the front part of my hairline just above the forehead to cover my scalp just above my bangs.  </li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t really what I expected.</li>
            <li> , Toppik is an all natural fiber-based concealer that fills in existing hairs and provides a look of fullness and can bring the scalp back together where thinning or patches of baldness have parted the hairline.</li>
            <li> I really dont think this stuff will hold on after sweating or getting wet.</li>
            <li> : should you get a little on your hand, it&#x27;ll rinse right off.</li>
            <li> I use Toppik when I&#x27;m having a really thin hair day with too much scalp showing &amp; it gets me out the door quickly with confidence and undectable coverage.</li>
            <li> first tried applying the product to the roots of my hair like the pictures and instructions but it stuck to my scalp and looked rather odd.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes if I wear it in the morning, I notice that in the afternoon most of the product is gone and I can see my scalp again at least partially .  </li>
            <li> Instead of just accepting the fact that hair loss is natural and inevitable and that it doesn&#x27;t even bother me, my husband constantly obsesses over his hair.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to sprinkle too much because then it&#x27;s obvious you&#x27;re using something to cover the thinnest part.  </li>
            <li> I am a 34 year old female with moderate thinning on my scalp and crown.</li>
            <li> Toppik not only hides the scalp where hair is thin, but gives my hair better texture and volume.  </li>
            <li> My hairline has receded quit a bit, and now the area behind above my temples is fading out, and gradually receding more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a high hair line, and as far as I can tell it has not receded, but I have much less density than I did about six years ago.</li>
            <li> The two times before that and one time since that I&#x27;ve purchased the bottle from a beauty store, it was heavier and lasted at least a full year.</li>
            <li> I am black and it works very well on my hair.</li>
            <li> The applicator will really help you use less product too, increasing the time between purchases.</li>
            <li> i notice it starts to look less real and rub off.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try it the first time with only a few minutes before you have to rush out the door.</li>
            <li> I sprinkle a little in certain spots and it makes a world of difference in my appearance and my confidence.</li>
            <li> It really does help with the application process and eliminates mess.  </li>
            <li> Hard to get used to at first, but like it!</li>
            <li> This product makes my fine thin hair look and feel fuller.</li>
            <li> I have salt and pepper, thin fine hair cut in short layers.  </li>
            <li> IT REALLY COVERS LITTLE THIN PLACES WITH A FILL IN OF EXTREMELY LIGHT BROWN FIBERS</li>
            <li> This is more like BLack Black Black...</li>
            <li> Just a few sprinkles on your bald or thinning spot, and it covers it with what looks like, real hair!&lt;br /&gt;The tony fibers bond to other nearby hair until they eventually fill in the entire spot, making it look like naturally grown hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these little fibers.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is that the product doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> My son-in-law uses it on the back of his head where he is getting thin and he looks like he grew a full head of hair.  </li>
            <li> Granted I still have hair and thankfully not full male pattern baldness, but as guy, most men in their mid-20s begin to thin out over time.</li>
            <li> Long review short</li>
            <li> It will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Got this for my bf who has been a long term user of a similar product called Caboki.</li>
            <li> So I washed, dried and arranged my hair like normal.  </li>
            <li> Toppik is one of the very few products that I have tried that really made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Choose a slightly darker shade than your hair to look natural.</li>
            <li> A little sprinkle directly to my scalp goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I just wish I would have discovered it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> This size lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> they sell the mascara wands for root touch ups that leave hair looking wet and totally noticable</li>
            <li> I completely style my hair and add a few shakes</li>
            <li> and my hair loss is quite minor.</li>
            <li> just tap a bit of the hair building fibers directly on to the thinning areas (just a couple shakes is all you need), and it thickens those trouble spots.</li>
            <li> I hope this product stays on the market for a long time.</li>
            <li> My hair is so thin and this product allows me to smile again.  </li>
            <li> I hold it up above the part, tip my head back slightly</li>
            <li> The Toppik blended right in and diffused the thin spot so my scalp didn&#x27;t show through.  </li>
            <li> And in the sun, it actually turns a pinkish red (he uses dark brown)!</li>
            <li> It gives the scalp a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; color to mask the white scalp due to thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair had been thinning in different areas due to stress.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s nothing different) and wash it every other day to help retain the color</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked it up on the Internet and found other testimonies of people experiencing the same thing.</li>
            <li> It works exactly as advertised and it is a big relief  for those who have thin or not much hair.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, but unfortunately I&#x27;ve hardly used it.  </li>
            <li> Also works like a dry shampoo as it thickens.</li>
            <li> I have become an expert in arranging my hair to cover the thin spots but lately it has become too challenging</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be a greaseball for a week or two, but once you reach an equilibrium, your hair will naturally be fuller, your scalp will be much healthier, and your hair loss will at the very least slow down considerably.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a spray instead of loose powder.</li>
            <li> My only regret is that it comes in such a small container.  </li>
            <li> Color was fine but it looked dirty on scalp.</li>
            <li> , I am really pleased and completely shocked at how well it works.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried applying it a few different ways (shaking, swirling, etc.).</li>
            <li> i have a litttle patch on the back of my head and thiss stuff after a few shakes takes care of biz.  </li>
            <li> color was not quite what I expected.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I dislike about it is after a few days of use there is a dusting or film of it all over my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> , Toppik doesnt look wet  or make your hair feel differant.</li>
            <li> Be careful putting it on as it may spill onto the counter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle product and wont bring your hair back altogether, but it will help you address those trouble areas and keep your hair looking fuller, longer.</li>
            <li> I would recommend applying this to your hair after blow-drying and partially styling your hair.</li>
            <li> This product really helps to camouflage the scalp when hair becomes thin.  </li>
            <li> Such a dark color, i have medium brown hair and this is like black.</li>
            <li> When my hair starts to show gray roots, I use Toppiks to cover the white hair in my part line and sprinkle it on a few other gray areas that would be seen.  </li>
            <li> But on the rare times, I wear my hair down, I will sprinkle a little of this over my thin spots.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way for me.</li>
            <li> As a semi-young female, it has been hard to accept thinning hair on my scalp but this product, combined with hairspray, really gives the illusion of hair in those thin spots.</li>
            <li> However, this may be due to brushing my hair after using Toppik.  </li>
            <li> If you use other hair sprays with it, it will make the product stay longer even.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to other people who might benefit from its&#x27; use.</li>
            <li> In my opinion it&#x27;s like any other hair product you might use before a night out</li>
            <li> I am an every other day shampooer and always have been.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> and I had to come review it in case there were other hopeless people out there wondering.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products that promised hair regrowth or body enhancement, but I never felt that those products truly lived up to their claims.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The thinness is apparent if I was to part my hair down the middle, if I comb over from the side it is sometimes still thin looking.  </li>
            <li> but when it finished within 3 months of moderate use, I KNEW I&#x27;d been sent a half empty, if not more, bottle.</li>
            <li> It was a little tough to get used to the application in the first few uses</li>
            <li> As a woman with very thin hair this is pretty nice.&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li> So far, I have not experienced the itchy scalp reported by others, but again, I don&#x27;t use this every day - maybe once every other week  - and i only use in small amounts.</li>
            <li> If used properly, it does exactly what it says and makes my thin hair look not so thin because my scalp isn&#x27;t quite so distinguished.  </li>
            <li> Either I am using the product wrong, or it does not do a thing, it does not really cover the bald spots, or you need so much, it starts pouring down your face.</li>
            <li> I definitely prefer Nanogen hair fibers, but this does the job and is far less expensive.</li>
            <li> No problems with color match (I am a dark brunette).</li>
            <li> I have med dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered Medium Brown, but it is really dark.  </li>
            <li> Could be color os too dark.</li>
            <li> I look younger by at least 10 years because I&#x27;ve continued coloring my hair medium brown; however, it&#x27;s getting thinner as I age</li>
            <li> The small container lasts a really long time too.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but this works very well to hide the slight thinning on my crown</li>
            <li> Even with a bit of wind or humidity, the hair fibers leak down the sides of his face, making it look like tar.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You shake it on the bald area, then you pat it down.</li>
            <li> and I NEVER wore my hair completely down.</li>
            <li> No more worrying about that little thin place, or having to part her hair on a certain side.</li>
            <li> This is a little heavy, and I find that I prefer Viviscal which is lighter and easier to fluff and distribute in the hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered black, but the color looks blue-ish</li>
            <li> so the sprinkles fall where I want them, and tap slightly.</li>
            <li> ; is a lot closer to black and might not blend as well).  </li>
            <li> It leaves a mess in the bathroom and on pillows and sheets.</li>
            <li> I have dark (thinning) hair and pale skin, and as soon as I apply this, it starts to settle out of my hair on to my scalp.  </li>
            <li> and I noticed that few of the product fell off my hair but never the less, it majority remained in there (for almost 3-4 days).</li>
            <li> to fix this, I use a little makeup</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the container!  </li>
            <li> Holding onto hope that my new thyroid meds will help my thinning, but if you&#x27;re very thin or balding, forget this one.</li>
            <li> I have very dark brown hair and a friend suggested I get the medium brown Toppik.</li>
            <li> It totally hides the thin hair I have.</li>
            <li> I purchased the medium brown a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> It definitely covers my scalp that shows through my thin hair.</li>
            <li> I am only 33 with thin hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not comfortable doing my hair and going out without it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not at all messy</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had any issue with it coming off from sweating or the everyday elements.</li>
            <li> (I am a female, and my hair had started to thin out to the point that it was already noticeable in my mid-20s).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product twice, and I already am feeling much less anxious about my thin scalp.</li>
            <li> People who know the way my hair usually looks cannot believe the difference that a few shakes of Toppik makes.  </li>
            <li> For the past few years I&#x27;ve had thinning hair along with receding hairline.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t believe it would work, but I  needed some really bad</li>
            <li> Sprinkle some on your balding area and Wala no more bald.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and cannot wait to walk out the door!</li>
            <li> Makes such a difference on my thin hair!</li>
            <li> : over the past 3 months I&#x27;ve noticed an increase in hair loss where I use this powder.</li>
            <li> I have small areas where I need coverage</li>
            <li> Not sure how to prevent that</li>
            <li> Sprinkle it on after styling in the areas that scalp shows, and no more shine.  </li>
            <li> Works well but is MESSY and will migrate to your forehead if you start sweating!  </li>
            <li> Expensive and a shaker only lasts me about 6 weeks...but at least few people know the amount of thinning hair I truly have since I use this product.  </li>
            <li> it would just be a small amount of dust that would come off.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very messy</li>
            <li> have always felt terribly ashamed about my thinning hair , resorting to shorter haircuts with as much layers as possible in an attempt to lessen the appearance of my thinning hair.</li>
            <li> To dull when you put it on</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to remove (fibers).</li>
            <li> I suffer from alopecia and have two spots on my head that are getting hard to cover.</li>
            <li> It helps thin hair look a little fuller naturaly.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t tried it before now because I was discouraged by some of the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> My complaint is with the seller, not the product.</li>
            <li> Be watchful of this; I don&#x27;t know if this is a common practice or not.</li>
            <li> Definitely at least try this product.</li>
            <li> and I now need to update my coloring on at least a 2 week basis.</li>
            <li> and my hair looked thick.  </li>
            <li> what a bit of thick hair will make you look and feel.  </li>
            <li> I look like I have thick hair on my crown.  </li>
            <li> I am in my late 30&#x27;s and my moderate thinning in my crown area makes me very insecure and self concious....</li>
            <li> My wife has a very small area of thinning at the front of her hair line.</li>
            <li> I have a very small area that I needed to cover.  </li>
            <li> The fibers themselves are very small and when applied to the scalp and hair, it fills in the color and the fibers cling to the hair without looking too thick or too thin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard some people have had bad reactions when using this, which may be possible, however, after a couple of months of using this, I haven&#x27;t had any problems.  </li>
            <li> I hardly leave the house without putting it in my hair!</li>
            <li> and I will keep using it as needed to fill in the weak spots in my hair.</li>
            <li> I got him this as a less expensive alternative,  and he loves it!</li>
            <li> (ive had thin hair since i was 18)</li>
            <li> I WEAR MY HAIR SHORT AND SHOW THE ROOT BASE SKIN COLOR.</li>
            <li> That spot on your head where the hair begins to thin out</li>
            <li> Covers the scalp where hair is thin.  </li>
            <li> poorly sealed so it got damp &amp;#34;before</li>
            <li> I recommended to people with thin hair.</li>
            <li> My hair has started to thin at my part</li>
            <li> and I am really thin on my crown, it helps to cover the problem spots.</li>
            <li> I hate that I&#x27;m a female with thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> Now I just sprinkle it on in the thin areas after I&#x27;ve styled it, pat it in, and hairspray it in place.  </li>
            <li> If you have thin hair, this product works.  </li>
            <li> If your a women with thin hair I would buy this product.</li>
            <li> Shake on liberally to the areas of your scalp that are noticeably thin, using your fingers to disperse the product throughout your hair.</li>
            <li> Because of the thin hair, even just after coloring, my scalp shows in the crown.</li>
            <li> secret, as my friend hair dresser</li>
            <li> I had thinning hair on my part really bad due to thyroid issues and it was driving me nuts..very noticible as for</li>
            <li> Instead of enhancing his look, Toppik makes his hair look incredibly fake and the fibers fall all over the place.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So rather than expensive hair restoration or expensive transplants</li>
            <li> Never looks fake or painted on.</li>
            <li> Then I sprinkled Toppik over the thin spots and: holy moly!  </li>
            <li> When I see others with thinning hair and scalp showing, I feel sorry for them and wish I could share the &amp;#34;sprinkles&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Very poor customer service on trying to return this product.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to people who has very thin hair.</li>
            <li> If you have thin/thinning hair it is especially hard for women of all ages to cope with this product helps to mask the scalp without coating the scalp with a dye.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not good。I don&#x27;t like it.feel too bad ,I don&#x27;t think so</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product really works. I am black and it works very well on my hair. I have thinning hair on top and around my crown at the back. It covers nicely (didn&#x27;t need to buy the Toppik hairspray) and it holds. Doesn&#x27;t come off on my pillow either.</li>
            <li> HEARD ABOUT THIS PRODUCT FORM A FAMOUS HOLLYWOOD HAIRSTYLIST...HE WAS NOT LYING ..IT REALLY COVERS LITTLE THIN PLACES WITH A FILL IN OF EXTREMELY LIGHT BROWN FIBERS</li>
            <li> This is just as described and works really well.</li>
            <li> To sum up this product; it does exactly what it says it can do! I absolutely love it. Will buy the bigger bottle next time!</li>
            <li> As stated above, works great for thinning crowns. Not so much for from hairlines. U already knew this though so I&#x27;m happy with it</li>
            <li> I have only a mild case of thinning hair. Still, when I sprinkle Toppik on, it just looks like I have potting soil on my scalp. I&#x27;ve tried applying it a few different ways (shaking, swirling, etc.). It looks nothing like any of the \\&quot;after\\&quot; photos I&#x27;ve ever seen. This does work if you&#x27;re going to be on camera, and possibly onstage (not sure how it will look under those bright lights, though). You might look in the mirror at home and think you look fine, but when you go outside in natural light, forget it! I found this out by accident after running some errands and was pretty embarrassed. FYI, \\&quot;Medium Brown\\&quot; is actually dark brown, and \\&quot;Light Brown\\&quot; looks auburn.</li>
            <li> Love this powder.  My hair is fine and wavy with lots of cowlicks in the back of my hair, which leaves a few areas where my scalp shows.  I was hesitant to use it, thinking it may look unnatural.  But it works great, looks natural, is easy to use, stays all day.  I only wish they made a reddish brown.  But I combine the red and med brown and it works fine.</li>
            <li> Toppik is a very good product that basically hides the scalp which is what shows that hair is thinning or absent.  It disguises baldness very effectively.  The only thing I would try to improve is the time it lasts.  Sometimes if I wear it in the morning, I notice that in the afternoon most of the product is gone and I can see my scalp again at least partially .  However, this may be due to brushing my hair after using Toppik.  Anyway, I recommend this product to every person with thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Toppik fills in those sparse areas and looks totally natural.  I love it.  A real confidence booster. I have very dark brown hair and a friend suggested I get the medium brown Toppik. Glad I did.  The medium brown is pretty dark and is perfect with my hair color.  I purchased the small size to make sure I&#x27;d like the product, but I&#x27;m  sure I will be ordering more in the future. I shopped around and the price here on Amazon is the lowest I&#x27;ve found.  Ladies, if you suffer from thinning hair as I do, you owe it to yourself to try this amazing product.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty impressed with the product. It is easy to apply and covers up the thin/balding areas well. I think it works better on men though. I sprinkled it on a male friend&#x27;s bald spot and it was amazing how it covered it right up! I haven&#x27;t had as much luck with it on over all thinning female hair, but it does what it says as far as covering bald spots.</li>
            <li> My hair is no longer thin due to Toppix, I love the product, its the only I have found that really does what you see in the advertisement, thanks Toppix. I have to order some more.</li>
            <li> I gave this a 5 star because it seems to be the best hair filler I&#x27;ve tried.  Some are sticky, this one is not.</li>
            <li> too expensive, switch to X-fusion, even better quality for 1/3 of the price</li>
            <li> Amazing product, i have good hair but this helps alot just to make it ABIT better looking more full, i don&#x27;t think its for anyone who is balding completely it won&#x27;t work its for those who are thinning (ive had thin hair since i was 18) It never changesb ut this stuff makes it look thicker and cooler when i spike it up.</li>
            <li> The product is very helpful for us women! Thank you for the product. It is very good and easy to use!</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT WORKS GREAT. THE BROWN FIBERS FILL IN MY THINNING HAIR. I WEAR MY HAIR SHORT AND SHOW THE ROOT BASE SKIN COLOR. THESE BUILDING FIBERS DO THE JOB OF FILLIN IN.</li>
            <li> it works - you need a mirror to see what your doing - but trust me - i have a litttle patch on the back of my head and thiss stuff after a few shakes takes care of biz.  honest to goodness - and itt don&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li> I highty recommend this product. I have been using it for years and love the results it gives my hair.</li>
            <li> Looks are what I want to achieve, this product makes my hair look fuller.  Gained about 10 years in appearance. Mission complete, more than satisfied.</li>
            <li> It is always nice when a product delivers on what it claims it can do!  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t really what I expected. I thought it was a spray instead of loose powder. I got it all over instead of just in my hair.</li>
            <li> I tried Toppik for first time. I was totally thrilled by the results. It totally hides the thin hair I have. I washed my hair with water for next two days and I noticed that few of the product fell off my hair but never the less, it majority remained in there (for almost 3-4 days). If you use other hair sprays with it, it will make the product stay longer even.&lt;br /&gt;If you keep washing hair after 5 days, you will notice the Toppik fibers forming a circle around hair follicles, this looks more obvious and by that time, you will need to add more Toppik to your hair!.&lt;br /&gt;I only wish it is cheaper. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This works great! I have thinning all over the front and crown and this not only covers any visible scalp, but also thickens the appearance of my hair. Amazing! It looks very natural, doesn&#x27;t rub off, and lasts until my next shampoo (3-4 days). I hadn&#x27;t tried it before now because I was discouraged by some of the negative reviews. Really wish I had tried it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> if i spray it light enough it is perfect coverage - just have a problem with getting it on thin enough.  Would not be able to use it without the toppik spray applicator</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;bond&amp;#34; to my hair at all. If I moved my head at all, any pieces that didn&#x27;t tumble off my head at the get go would fall off as well.</li>
            <li> I do like this product.  It truly does help one to feel more confident about a few  thinning &amp;#34;spots&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I am using it daily.&lt;br /&gt;The color was not quite what I expected.  Ordered med. brown and it is more of a dark brown.</li>
            <li> I needed some confidence.  My hair is so thin and this product allows me to smile again.  I am a customer for life.</li>
            <li> I definitely prefer Nanogen hair fibers, but this does the job and is far less expensive. The main difference&lt;br /&gt;between the two is that this one doesn&#x27;t seem to blend into the hair quite as &amp;#34;cleanly&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, I m glad I discovered it. Toppik is doing a great job for me. My hair is thinning on the top. For now I can cover it up and not worry about having a shinney scalp.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about five years now, and cannot live without it.  I would highly recommend purchasing the atomizer that you can screw on to the container.  It really does help with the application process and eliminates mess.  My hair is Auburn/brown and I use the Medium Brown.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> tends to fall out as the day gos on dose give the appearance of thicker hair and I would reorder</li>
            <li> My husband has been using Toppik for awhile now. It is an incredible waste of money because this product would work only for people with very small bald spots. My husband uses it to cover the whole top of his head, which looks like brown fungus growing out of his hair. And in the sun, it actually turns a pinkish red (he uses dark brown)! The claim that it can withstand rain or shine is a complete lie. Even with a bit of wind or humidity, the hair fibers leak down the sides of his face, making it look like tar. It leaves a mess in the bathroom and on pillows and sheets. I would not recommend this product just for the sake of sanity because my husband truly believes that I still don&#x27;t know that he uses the product! Toppik has really exacerbated his vanity about losing his hair. Using Toppik has had a huge pyschological impact on him because he is always ducking his head in front of any strong wind, constantly wearing hats when he is not using the product, and is constantly checking to make sure the fibres are in place. Instead of just accepting the fact that hair loss is natural and inevitable and that it doesn&#x27;t even bother me, my husband constantly obsesses over his hair. Instead of enhancing his look, Toppik makes his hair look incredibly fake and the fibers fall all over the place. Instead of boosting his confidence, Toppik has made him even more insecure about losing his hair.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  It really makes your hair fuller and fluffier.  Prolongs time between colorings, too.  Highly recommend it. Def</li>
            <li> This in the medium brown color has helped with the sparse areas of my thinning hair and also where I have a permanent part. I color my hair so it helps with the between times of coloring. Lots cheaper than Viviscal. I peel back just a small part of the sticker on top of the bottle and get just the right amount I need. A little goes a long way for me.</li>
            <li> Based on other friend&#x27;s recommendation I bought this as a gift for a cousin, she loves it and says it is really easy to use and covers the gray roots well.  She is very happy with the product.  I would recommend this to other people who might benefit from its&#x27; use.</li>
            <li> Fir thinning hair this is the best Item they are selling. It is covers what you need and no one can tell your hair is falling out or you have a bold spot..</li>
            <li> I have thinning hair.  It&#x27;s not bad, but no matter how I comb it, you can tell it&#x27;s thinned out.  It&#x27;s pretty discouraging when your going out.  I&#x27;m 25 and I feel old when I look in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a product that will help you should grab Toppik.  It&#x27;s wonderful.  Fast, easy application and it really works. It covers up and you don&#x27;t even see it.  It looks and feels like my own hair.  It doesn&#x27;t come off on my hands when I rub through it and it will last you the night.  It won&#x27;t run when you sweat. I wore it with gel just fine and my hair looked thick.  It&#x27;s amazing what a bit of thick hair will make you look and feel.  In my opinion it&#x27;s like any other hair product you might use before a night out and it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of hiding my thining hair spots.  Stays in place and does not flake.  Has save me lots of time and really like this product.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used this product. It seem to be working very well covering up the thinning spot. I use regular hair spray instead of buying there product.I will continue to use this. Great service from seller.</li>
            <li> I have really thin hair on top and this works perfect covering the bald spots. It&#x27;s really easy to brush it out or wash it off.</li>
            <li> Getting older is not for sissy my Mother always said and she is right.  That spot on your head where the hair begins to thin out and you can see your scalp. You know the spot - well this covers it up.  Makes me feel younger just looking in the mirror and not see the &amp;#34;spot&amp;#34;.  Easy to use and know one knows.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews of products, but felt compelled to share my thoughts on Toppik for those of you who are on fence about making a purchase.  I purchased the medium brown a few weeks ago.  I am a 45 year old female with moderate thinning, with the most obvious thinning in my part area.  I have never used a product like this before and quite frankly, did not have very high expectations that this product would really work.  I have to admit, I am really pleased and completely shocked at how well it works.  People who know the way my hair usually looks cannot believe the difference that a few shakes of Toppik makes.  I do not find the shaking to be messy at all, but again, I just use it on my part area at the top and along either side of my part. It stays on really well and I just use an Aveda brand aerosol hair spray on it.  I feel like the medium brown matches my hair color perfect and looks very natural. Toppik has really improved my confidence....I just wish I would have discovered it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> i use this product on a daily basis for a thinning spot in the back of my head and it covers and conseals it.  it is not noticable that i have anything concealing it.  My only recommendation is if you have greying hair mixed in with brown on the sides you need to dye it to make the blending more effective.</li>
            <li> Toppik not only hides the scalp where hair is thin, but gives my hair better texture and volume.  I love the product and hope you never stop making it!  Since I color my hair, I use a darker shade at first and then a medium shade as the weeks go by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> Yes, I was looking for a similar product but it was out of stock so I bought Toppik and I can&#x27;t tell the difference.</li>
            <li> I have female pattern baldness and have tried several hair styles to try and cover my baldness. After several years I was thinking about wigs and I saw this product on Dr. Oz and it changed my life. I am an every other day shampooer and always have been.  This stays in your hair till you wash it out! You do need to buy the applicator to get an even amount on your bald spots. I love it and would recommend it to anyone who has thinning hair. My husband even noticed the difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cover up guys not a a hair grower. That being said it works great!! Sprinkle some on your balding area and Wala no more bald. Doesn&#x27;t come out until your next wash. Great for special occasions or for everyday.</li>
            <li> I begin this review with a bit of a personal story. For the past few years I&#x27;ve had thinning hair along with receding hairline. Granted I still have hair and thankfully not full male pattern baldness, but as guy, most men in their mid-20s begin to thin out over time. It comes with age and genes, it&#x27;s fairly common.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But of course the reality is, patches of baldness or thinning hair looks embarrassing and can make guys lose self-confidence in their appearance. Be it either in the face of friends, the work place, or trying to meet girls, hair loss can play a major factor in how someone is perceived towards others. It&#x27;s a real issue that guys deal with, believe me I&#x27;ve been there. Bottom line, even if guys don&#x27;t always say it, guys do want to look good. We just don&#x27;t say it, we show it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So rather than expensive hair restoration or expensive transplants, Toppik is an all natural fiber-based concealer that fills in existing hairs and provides a look of fullness and can bring the scalp back together where thinning or patches of baldness have parted the hairline. The fibers themselves are very small and when applied to the scalp and hair, it fills in the color and the fibers cling to the hair without looking too thick or too thin, it&#x27;s perfectly balanced in such a small bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t like the old fashioned hair concealers of the 80s and 90s which was the equivalent of just spraying paint on your head. It&#x27;s an actual, natural way to use existing hairs to get great results. Less is more in this case, and the best way to apply Toppik is by starting where your hair is currently growing and working within the hairline, not outside it. And when applying, put the applicator against the scalp and rub it into the hairs and scalp to get desired coverage. You&#x27;ll get much more experience and accuracy if you do it that way, don&#x27;t just shake it on, it wont be accurate and it can look clumped if you just shake it on. Putting it against the scalp and going into the areas you need it will get you the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall and most importantly, I&#x27;ve had no irritation, burning, itching or any discomfort using Toppik. It&#x27;s 100% natural plant fibers, and it washes out very easily with shampoo. Also very important, it really does look natural, no one, and I guarantee no one will know your using it. It looks that good. If you style and comb your hair and really combine your hair with the Toppik, it will look like your natural hair. In my experience, not a lot of people know about these kinds of concealers since they are fairly new, so no ones the wiser. But also very important, you will regain confidence. Trust me, if you do it correctly and do some styling, not only will you look like a million bucks, but you&#x27;ll feel like a new man and want to look that good all the time. So if you&#x27;re reading this and have hair loss, don&#x27;t worry, you can regain confidence and look great. This is a product is a must own for guys with hair loss, I really can&#x27;t praise enough of how good this product is. It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Such a great product for anyone with fine hair.  It works just as well as advertised, in fact even better.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t have thinning hair (yet), I do have rather fine hair so I wanted to see if this product would just give me the appearance of fuller hair.  Much to my surprise, it does just that.  I mainly use it on the front part of my hairline just above the forehead to cover my scalp just above my bangs.  Once I have my hair styled and sprayed in place, I tilt my head back a little and lightly tap the container so that the fine particles land precisely where I want.  Then I spray with a little more hairspray and that&#x27;s it.  It never moves out of place or flakes off onto my forehead/face.  I will definitely order this product again!!!  (I did purchase this product directly from the manufacturer but wanted to post a review on Amazon so others who also shop Amazon.com would know about my good experience).</li>
            <li> I am a woman who had surgery on her Thyroid and my medicine is thinning my hair terribly.  This is truly a life saving product. Thank you...Never looks fake or painted on.</li>
            <li> Good coverage for thinning hair. Fibers make hair appear fuller. Color matched perfectly. Hair looks healthier,and I ahve more confidence about my appearance.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but this works very well to hide the slight thinning on my crown, I felt self conscious and this solved it perfectly.</li>
            <li> This item arrived in a timely manner.  It met my expectations and I would purchase it again.  My only regret is that it comes in such a small container.  For the price, I would have liked this product in a larger sized container.  Other than that, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Looks great, easy to use. Make me look like my hair 10 years ago. It&#x27;s a daily user.</li>
            <li> And this does.  It covers the areas where my hair is thinning and really makes it look fuller and thicker.</li>
            <li> I have bought other hair filler products, but this is the best. Just a few sprinkles on your bald or thinning spot, and it covers it with what looks like, real hair!&lt;br /&gt;The tony fibers bond to other nearby hair until they eventually fill in the entire spot, making it look like naturally grown hair. You wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Works great, takes practice, best done in shower (leaves dust residue).  Great quality, better price than other brands.  You will like it</li>
            <li> I recently got local hairloss RIGHT ON TOP OF MY HEAD the size of a quarter.  So embarrassing!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no matter how much i style my hair.  i alwasy find my strands to be moving around during the day and i panic and have to run to the bathroom.  but with this guy,  it will NOT be noticeable for people to raise questions!!!  confidence booster definitely.</li>
            <li> Great product. Color is more like black. Great for thinning hair. Covers the scalp where hair is thin.  Wish I found this sooner!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, but unfortunately I&#x27;ve hardly used it.  I have dark (thinning) hair and pale skin, and as soon as I apply this, it starts to settle out of my hair on to my scalp.  As other reviews have mentioned, it kind of looks like dirt on your scalp.  Ugh.  If you have darker skin, you probably would not have this issue.</li>
            <li> This product really works! I feel much more confident, my hair now looks uniform. I recommend Toppik Hair Buildind Fibers!</li>
            <li> I call this my hair &amp;#34;pepper&amp;#34;.  When my hair starts to show gray roots, I use Toppiks to cover the white hair in my part line and sprinkle it on a few other gray areas that would be seen.  I like it.  Its a quick fix between hair dying.</li>
            <li> My complaint is with the seller, not the product. The product itself is very effective, but I ordered from amazon.co.uk when I was living in London over the summer; the order was fulfilled by Toppik and the bottle I received felt significantly lighter than normal. I didn&#x27;t think much of it but when it finished within 3 months of moderate use, I KNEW I&#x27;d been sent a half empty, if not more, bottle. The two times before that and one time since that I&#x27;ve purchased the bottle from a beauty store, it was heavier and lasted at least a full year. Be watchful of this; I don&#x27;t know if this is a common practice or not. Do a comparison with a store bought bottle and an amazon ordered bottle, if you have the option to do so. If I were rating the product itself, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This is really excellent. I love it. When I decided to order it I was really not sure, but I used it and found it is working magically. It is very useful to hide  grey roots  as well while you don,t have enough time to color.</li>
            <li> Product seems to work as mentioned.  Important to spray with hairspray or it disappears which makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it and will use it on the part that has been thinning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do doubt it would work on hair that is thinning all over but would be worth a try.  I plan to get the spray applicator as they seems to help get it exactly where you want it to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was great!</li>
            <li> It gives the scalp a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; color to mask the white scalp due to thinning hair.  It doesn&#x27;t spread well.  So, where it gets blown (I bought the applicator)  it stays and washes away with water and/or rubbing.  But, in general it serves a good purpose.  Buy the applicator or I have no idea how you could dispense it neatly where you want it...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using hair fibers for years.  They&#x27;ve saved my self-esteem b/c I look like I have thick hair on my crown.  The fibers stay put through rainstorms, even light swimming.  Choose a slightly darker shade than your hair to look natural.</li>
            <li> poorly sealed so it got damp &amp;#34;before I even opened it....thus beingin effective</li>
            <li> It works perfectly for what I need it for.  As I&#x27;ve aged my hair has gotten much thinner and areas are becoming bare.  I sprinkle this on over the thinnest areas and it covers the &amp;#34;emptiness&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This product makes my fine thin hair look and feel fuller. It definitely covers my scalp that shows through my thin hair. The only drawback is that the product doesn&#x27;t last long. There&#x27;s got to be something better for the $$</li>
            <li> Im 50 and my hair is thinning where I part my hair. I sprinkle a little in certain spots and it makes a world of difference in my appearance and my confidence.</li>
            <li> Thickened hair and helped cover bald spots.  Exactly what I needed.  Good product at a reasonable price.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome!!!! covers really good and  looks natural, match with my natural hair color.I recommended to people with thin hair.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 30&#x27;s and my moderate thinning in my crown area makes me very insecure and self concious....I would contantly take pictures of the back of my head with my phone camera, and looking in the mirror all the time while at home....I tell you, the first time I applied this product, combed it in and sprayed it, it was like magic before my very eyes....it is INCREDIBLE how well this stuff works....it truly has given me such a huge boost in confidence....I give it 5 stars!!!</li>
            <li> This provides coverage but viviscal hair fibers is MUCH better. Not only is coverage better, you use less and you get more per bottle and it&#x27;s cheaper. Once I figured this out after trying several different options I&#x27;ve stuck with viviscal ever since. I can actually buy this local but still prefer to buy viviscal online.&lt;br /&gt;Toppik does do the job it&#x27;s intended for but I think viviscal does it better and cheaper personally.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful.  Helps fill in spare areas and the color matches well.  Thinning hair especially for women is often an embarrassment and this product will help you feel more confident.  Great price.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product for those of us who have a problem with thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I recently found about Toppix, it does work and was thrilled to find it on Amazon for a great price!!</li>
            <li> Fantastic results with this product, have been using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> To dull when you put it on</li>
            <li> Fibers really make thinning male hair look full again. A little sprinkle directly to my scalp goes a long way. Bottle lasted about 4 months with 5 applications a week. Can be worn all day as they do not rub off easily even when your sweating. Overall a great product to conceal thinning hair I am a repeat customer of Toppik.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  If used properly, it does exactly what it says and makes my thin hair look not so thin because my scalp isn&#x27;t quite so distinguished.  Be careful not to sprinkle too much because then it&#x27;s obvious you&#x27;re using something to cover the thinnest part.  I&#x27;ve also accidentally moved my head while trying to apply it closer to my face and some of it landed on my forehead.  There is a tool for that, but I choose to just be a bit more careful in applying it!</li>
            <li> I have tried a few versions of this type of product and like this best. The concept is fabulous, as it fills in thinning spots at my temple. Also works like a dry shampoo as it thickens. I do suggest you use the dispenser top that is available.</li>
            <li> Quick, easy, economical way to &#x27;fill in&#x27; those thinning spots.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not good。I don&#x27;t like it.feel too bad ,I don&#x27;t think so well，No sense，If I can, want to return it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff it is awesome! I could not believe how well it works and I will defiantly continue using it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for a relative so I&#x27;ll just give it a fair rating.  This is a decent product providing you stay in good weather conditions or indoors.</li>
            <li> Great product! This is the 3rd time I have ordered this product and I love it. It works like it says it will.</li>
            <li> My hair had been thinning in different areas due to stress. The front portion of my head where I usually part my hair was mildly thinner than I liked. I use this to help cover the part in my hair with different styles that I do. It helps cover the scalp lightly, but it also seems to dust off by the end of the day. No problems with color match (I am a dark brunette). I am also using Nioxin and taking biotin. My hair is growing back ,thinner, but coming back so I don&#x27;t really use it all that often anyway. I would buy it again if I should need it and I will keep using it as needed to fill in the weak spots in my hair.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, LOVE this product.  For those of us with thinning hair, especially women, this stuff is really great.  It comes in lots of colors and is forgiving in terms of the shade not being EXACT to what you have.  It is so easy - just sprinkle it on, comb it through and style.  Spritz just a bit of any cheap hairspray for staying power.  I use mine mostly on the top part of my head - from the hairline (bangs) back a few inches. :o)</li>
            <li> does not give me the coverage i hoped.     I ordered black, but the color looks blue-ish</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! I am a 34 year old female with moderate thinning on my scalp and crown. This has caused me quite a bit of distress and embarrassment, and I spend a lot of time worrying about my scalp showing. My very first application of Toppik was wonderful: it shook on easily, blended seamlessly into my roots, and covered up every bit of scalp. It stayed in place and did the job all day. I wish I had discovered this sooner. I&#x27;ve only used this product twice, and I already am feeling much less anxious about my thin scalp. This truly does give you more peace of mind and confidence. It is nice to go out in public and not worry about direct sunlight highlighting all my thin areas.</li>
            <li> I love this, it really works, It makes my hair look fuller.......no one can tell I am using it.  I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> At a loss of words....10 stars! I really regret not knowing about this a long time ago! I use it everyday and cannot wait to walk out the door!</li>
            <li> Makes such a difference on my thin hair! Really fills it in and covers my scalp. No one even knows.</li>
            <li> Wow.  Toppik works great.  My hair has started to thin at my part and it doesn&#x27;t help that  i am going gray as well.  I used the product and I am amazed at how well it works.  I can&#x27;t figure out how it does it.  Looks really natural! So happy I tried it!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this works.  I have thinning hair at the top, and this product makes my hair look full and thick.</li>
            <li> I am surprised at how well this product works to fill in the bald spots and make my hair look thicker.</li>
            <li> Great product and just what I needed to cover some thinning areas in my hair. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, just like I needed.</li>
            <li> Good product over all this was the first one I ordered but I found out my hair was more of a dark brown but this one did the job and looked great . I ordered the dark brown Toppix and that was the best match .</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this product and it does&lt;br /&gt;work good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You shake it on the bald area, then you pat it down.</li>
            <li> This product works well if you have hair that can go over the balding. It looks better than some of the other products I have tried which are like \\&quot;painting\\&quot; makeup on your scalp. The applicator will really help you use less product too, increasing the time between purchases. I have long straight brown hair and I am really thin on my crown, it helps to cover the problem spots. and the medium brown blends well with my hair. I would reccomend this to you if you are contemplating buying it!</li>
            <li> This product absolutely makes your really look thicker and fuller. I love it!!</li>
            <li> My hairstylist used this product and I was amazed at the difference it made.  I ordered for myself and was not disappointed.  This size lasts a long time.  Will reorder when my supply gets low.  I would recommend this product to anyone with thinning or fine hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item and was SO happy with the results!! I have thinning hair on most of the top of my head and noticed in pictures how thin it was getting. My dad and brothers are bald and my aunts had to wear wigs :( I only use it when I&#x27;m in public and I&#x27;m really happy it covers the appearance of thinning. I also try to suit as sparingly as possible. I&#x27;ve noticed when I apply too much it&#x27;s hard to remove (fibers). Which is why I believe it&#x27;s causing the increase in hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;DOWNSIDE: over the past 3 months I&#x27;ve noticed an increase in hair loss where I use this powder. I color my hair (and have for 20 yrs so that&#x27;s nothing different) and wash it every other day to help retain the color longer.&lt;br /&gt;The only difference I&#x27;ve made in styling is using the Toppik. I&#x27;ve looked it up on the Internet and found other testimonies of people experiencing the same thing. Basically, it is a powder/fiber and could be clogging the pores.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to stop using this product, but will definitely be washing it out at night (which I wasn&#x27;t doing).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update if I notice a difference.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect product for anyone with fine and thin hair.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years and it is great!</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product.  Never could get top off to put spray applicator on to use. Color was fine but it looked dirty on scalp.</li>
            <li> I tried using this on my gray hair and thinning spots it&#x27;s very messy I tried the good hair day by Joan Rivers and it works great</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews but this product deserves one.  I have been using Toppik hair building fibers for almost a year now. I hardly leave the house without putting it in my hair! I am only 33 with thin hair. My scalp shows along my part and toward the back and I NEVER wore my hair completely down. I would always use hair clips to conceal the top and back crown part of my scalp. Well not anymore.  Now I have a choice of styling my hair any way I want.  It was a little tough to get used to the application in the first few uses but now I&#x27;m a pro at it! Definitely at least try this product. You most likely will fall in love! My self confidence sky rocketed after using Toppik!</li>
            <li> Love it.  Medium brown blends wonderfully with my hair.  Seems to make my hair look thicker.</li>
            <li> Well no one wants to have the issue of thinning hair but if you do, THIS REALLY HELPS!!! I am a 39 yr old female with fine shedding hair and have tried chasing down the cause through many yrs old blood work and even a year of laser hair therapy with no success. I use Toppik when I&#x27;m having a really thin hair day with too much scalp showing &amp; it gets me out the door quickly with confidence and undectable coverage. Just lean over the sink when using, spray hair with hairspray, wipe up sink &amp; GO:)</li>
            <li> I have small areas where I need coverage and this is so easy and does not feel like &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; in my hair, love it</li>
            <li> I hate that I&#x27;m a female with thinning hair.  Before finding this product I had to style my hair and almost &amp;#34;comb-over&amp;#34; in places to cover up thinning areas.  Now I just sprinkle it on in the thin areas after I&#x27;ve styled it, pat it in, and hairspray it in place.  The only thing I dislike about it is after a few days of use there is a dusting or film of it all over my bathroom.  Not sure how to prevent that and frankly it&#x27;s worth having to clean my bathroom more often to have more confidence about my hair.  It blends nicely with my hair color. When I order again I&#x27;ll just bite the bullet and get the larger size.</li>
            <li> If you have thinning hair and would like your hair to look thicker, then this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair, this product works.  It fills the balding spots in, allowing you to feel comfortable with your thinning hair,.</li>
            <li> I have lost a significant amount of weight and have suddenly started experiencing severe thinning, to the point that my scalp is visible all over.  Think it&#x27;s just stress or weight-loss related but while I wait for my doctor&#x27;s appointment and sit here freaking out over being a bald woman, some googling brought me to this stuff.  IT. IS. AMAZING.  That&#x27;s all.  It came today, i sprinkled it on, and suddenly my hair looks incredible.  You can&#x27;t use it too close to the edges (temples/forehead) but it totally fills in the rest of my head and I want to cry over what a tremendous difference it&#x27;s made.  I have no idea how it will hold up to severe sweating, or what happens if you get caught in the rain, but this is just such a lifesaver and I had to come review it in case there were other hopeless people out there wondering.</li>
            <li> I like using the Toppix, it beats getting a hair transplant.  It covers well and looks good.  It washes out with each shampoo but is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I have little to moderate thinning and this covers it perfectly!  My own sister asked if I had done Bosely!&lt;br /&gt;Now, this isn&#x27;t like the ads make it seem.  I can&#x27;t just dump out the powder and hide my bald spots, I do have to take time to &#x27;style&#x27; my hair now.  Also, if I add too much it can cake on my scalp-to fix this, I use a little makeup brush.&lt;br /&gt;This being said, I won&#x27;t go to the grocery store without putting this on.  I&#x27;ve heard some people have had bad reactions when using this, which may be possible, however, after a couple of months of using this, I haven&#x27;t had any problems.  I remember looking at this product nearly a year ago and didn&#x27;t buy this because of the price, I really wish I had bought this then.</li>
            <li> I had thinning hair on my part really bad due to thyroid issues and it was driving me nuts..very noticible as for I have med dark brown hair. a couple shakes of Toppik on my part and you cant even tell or notice .I cant believe the magic of this product .I would never be able to live without!!!! they sell the mascara wands for root touch ups that leave hair looking wet and totally noticable that it looks like a magic marker went over your roots, Toppik doesnt look wet  or make your hair feel differant. I completely style my hair and add a few shakes and WOW.. I went to hairdressing school and know about all products having 3 hairdressers in the family and we are all IMPRESSED!! love,love,love this product!!!! ps: its very true to color of hair, I also have golden highlights on med brn hair and went with base color of hair of med brn and perfect match!!!</li>
            <li> This is a really great product for thinning hair. Sprinkle it on after styling in the areas that scalp shows, and no more shine.  I like to use it when my color has grown out a quarter of an inch or so, because that outgrowth will make the hair look even thinner.  I hold it up above the part, tip my head back slightly so the sprinkles fall where I want them, and tap slightly. Just let it float on.  This was recommended to me by the Bosley center after a hair transplant because you tend to lose some of your original hair in shock trauma.  I am a hairstylist and am very familiar with thinning problems. I highly recommend these little fibers.  They remind me of flocking on a Christmas tree!</li>
            <li> Two stars because it doesn&#x27;t do what it says it does. Long review short: I&#x27;ve tried everything, every suggestion, idea, etc. and no matter what, it goes straight to the scalp. Then, don&#x27;t even think about touching your head for the rest of the day or it&#x27;s going to migrate. I think a finely ground coffee would do the same thing. No joke.  I&#x27;ll use it, sparingly, when I have the time to perfect the coverage, which is hardly ever. Holding onto hope that my new thyroid meds will help my thinning, but if you&#x27;re very thin or balding, forget this one.</li>
            <li> Very poor customer service on trying to return this product. I was accused of lieing about opening this product when I never opened it at all. I sent it back - they said it was opened and sent it back to me. The product may be fine - I do not know as I tried to return it and now have something I do not want.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of  making my husband&#x27;s hair look fuller.  He has graying brown hair and found that medium brown sprinkled from the container and then combed looks good and makes hair darker without the dyed blond- brown look you get with touch of gray Also it washes out very easily.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. I having thinning hair at my crown and this fills in nicely.If your a women with thin hair I would buy this product.</li>
            <li> Just as my title says this product does amazing things my confidence is restored and my hair looks amazing.  Thank you TOPPIK</li>
            <li> Love, love, this product! I used to hate having my photo taken because of thinning hair.  Now I am confident that my hair looks good and no scalp is showing.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for thin hair, looks very natural</li>
            <li> Great product for concealing areas of thin hair density, changing haircolor, or masking dermal scars after surgery. Take a while to get used to applying properly.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it really works.  I would highly reccomend this to anyone who has thinning hair. Comes in colors</li>
            <li> I  bought the pump to spay  the toppik and it broke.  The product is ok  but it falls  on the floor get on the neck etc.I still use it.</li>
            <li> My wife has a very small area of thinning at the front of her hair line. She is a very attractive and outgoing woman, so when this came about, it was worrisome to her, to say the least. A friend of ours, who does hair, talked to her and on a visit to her shop, showed my wife this little bottle of magic. I&#x60;ll tell you, when she came home that afternoon, she was all smiles. No more worrying about that little thin place, or having to part her hair on a certain side. We were buying this from the beauty supply house in town, but it seemed they couldn&#x60;t, or wouldn&#x60;t keep it in stock. I searched and found it on Amazon. Man, it was worth the bit of time it took to find it. My wife is happy, and confident, and now she doesn&#x60;t have to worry about running out of this any more.&lt;br /&gt;  Great product. We&#x60;l  be back for more. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful cosmetic product.  I have salt and pepper, thin fine hair cut in short layers.  I have become an expert in arranging my hair to cover the thin spots but lately it has become too challenging so thought I would try Toppik.  Wasn&#x27;t sure what color to try so I went with medium brown.&lt;br /&gt;I first tried applying the product to the roots of my hair like the pictures and instructions but it stuck to my scalp and looked rather odd.  So I washed, dried and arranged my hair like normal.  Then I sprinkled Toppik over the thin spots and: holy moly!  The Toppik blended right in and diffused the thin spot so my scalp didn&#x27;t show through.  Totally natural looking and undetectable.  In my case, less is more.  Now I don&#x27;t worry about how my hair looks.  Completely satisfied. Sent my daughter a bottle to try.  Waiting for her response.</li>
            <li> I originally ordered the travel size and when I saw how well it worked, I ordered the larger size.  I recommend it very highly.</li>
            <li> This is a little heavy, and I find that I prefer Viviscal which is lighter and easier to fluff and distribute in the hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning, and I use this product daily. I&#x27;m not comfortable doing my hair and going out without it.</li>
            <li> As a woman with very thin hair this is pretty nice.&lt;br /&gt;Much more natural than a wig. Keep in mind it takes&lt;br /&gt;Some time to get good at applying. Don&#x27;t try it the first time with only a few minutes before you have to rush out the door. Also although a little light rain/mist/snow flurries do not displace. Sweating on your scalp can make it clump and come off on your hands. Do not wear to workout! I always wash my hair before bed as it makes my scalp itchy after 12 hrs. I have noticed that the wool/faux fur hood on my coat will pull the &amp;#34;fibers&amp;#34; from my hair. Will these issues stop me from using? No. I feel more confident and don&#x27;t feel like people are pitying me. Thank you topic!</li>
            <li> Heck yeah Toppik! My bald spot is covered up now! This stuff looks like real hair. The only downside I have experienced is after having it on all day i notice it starts to look less real and rub off. I have just been using regular hair spray to hold in in place. I just ordered the hair spray by Toppik but after reading the reviews, most say it is the same as regular hair spray so we will see. I really dont think this stuff will hold on after sweating or getting wet. I wore it to a party a few weeks ago and got home and noticed a  portion was rubbing off and wasn&#x27;t sure if it happened after the party or while I was still there and that kind of worried me.</li>
            <li> As a woman hair loss is devastating! I don&#x27;t know what I would do without this product.&lt;br /&gt;It works great but takes a few times to get to know the right amount but, one you get it the result is life changing!&lt;br /&gt;I style my hair (mostly) any way I want to.&lt;br /&gt;One downside is the fine black powder all over the bathroom and if you have white pillow cases.....small price to pay.</li>
            <li> As a semi-young female, it has been hard to accept thinning hair on my scalp but this product, combined with hairspray, really gives the illusion of hair in those thin spots. I am grateful to have found this product. Just make sure you get the right shade! The medium brown was more of a dark brown on my medium brown hair.</li>
            <li> Product works great !!  It helps thin hair look a little fuller naturaly.  I hated my scalp to&lt;br /&gt;in the front.  I am so glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered Medium Brown, but it is really dark.  When I reorder I will order a shade lighter..  I suggest ordering the smallest amount to see if you like the color first.  But, as far as it working, it is great!!!!!</li>
            <li> works well and easy to use</li>
            <li> I love this I use it on my roots were I part my hair, when it grows out so I don&#x27;t have to dye it as often. My son-in-law uses it on the back of his head where he is getting thin and he looks like he grew a full head of hair.  I really didn&#x27;t believe it would work, but I  needed some really bad so I tried it and was very surprised, it really is a great product</li>
            <li> I feel it clog the pores of your scalp creating more bald spots.</li>
            <li> I like the product Toppik. But the medium brown is a little too light for me. The product in itself is great -- a little dry, but it sure makes a difference to the volume of my hair.</li>
            <li> I like it but does not blend in . Sometimes it looks blothced on scalp. Could be color os too dark.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I&#x27;m not entitled to use the word \\&quot;miraculous\\&quot; here―I&#x27;m only 24 and my hair loss is quite minor. I&#x27;ve always had a high hair line, and as far as I can tell it has not receded, but I have much less density than I did about six years ago. If I keep my hair trimmed properly and brush and blow dry it carefully, I can get away the appearance of full coverage, but it&#x27;s gradually getting more and more difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this product, however, makes my hair appear as full as it did when I was 18. It&#x27;s not at all messy: should you get a little on your hand, it&#x27;ll rinse right off. It clings to hair astonishingly well and will stay there for days if you don&#x27;t rinse it out. It blends in perfectly with the color of my hair, and it complements my hair&#x27;s natural luster as well. Short of a future cure for baldness and perhaps some of the more advanced hair transplant therapies available, this is as good as it&#x27;s going to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, to those suffering from hair loss: switch to no &#x27;poo, and only rinse your scalp with lukewarm/cold water. You&#x27;ll be a greaseball for a week or two, but once you reach an equilibrium, your hair will naturally be fuller, your scalp will be much healthier, and your hair loss will at the very least slow down considerably.</li>
            <li> Have used many times and will continue to order. Great coverage for thinning hair and bald spots. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Works well but is MESSY and will migrate to your forehead if you start sweating!  Over-sprinkle fibers can migrate to the sides of your face also....but since NOTHING else covers bald spots like Toppik I will keep using it.  Expensive and a shaker only lasts me about 6 weeks...but at least few people know the amount of thinning hair I truly have since I use this product.  Is strictly a cover-up and does nothing to stop hair loss, just so&lt;br /&gt;you are aware.</li>
            <li> I do not know another product which surprised me more than Toppik Hair Fibers.  It works exactly as advertised and it is a big relief  for those who have thin or not much hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as reviewers told. It&#x27;s not at all for the front hair line - it looks like a dirt on the forehead.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely wonderful!  I suffer from alopecia and have two spots on my head that are getting hard to cover. This does the trick so nicely!</li>
            <li> Have been using for several years now and am always pleased with the results.  My hair is very fine and thinning in spots.  I do not color my hair and this blends in well with my natural color.</li>
            <li> This is more like BLack Black Black... Such a dark color, i have medium brown hair and this is like black. Maybe I should of ordered blonde to get the right color. Also it had a heck of a time coming out have to try a bunch of times to get any out.</li>
            <li> I like the color and how it covers. It was very easy to use and blends in with your own hair.</li>
            <li> If you have some thinning places on your scalp, just sprinkle Toppik on over the top of them and they are covered up!!!!</li>
            <li> It helps with thinning of the hair.  It came darker than the medium brown I ordered.  It will last a long time.  Be careful putting it on as it may spill onto the counter.</li>
            <li> Great product. Would recommend. Great for those thinning areas.</li>
            <li> I started losing my hair when I was 19 (24 now), and it has been a very gradual process. Like most guys with MPB, you learn to find ways to accept it, fight it as best you can, and ultimately deal with it. My hairline has receded quit a bit, and now the area behind above my temples is fading out, and gradually receding more. That&#x27;s where toppik comes in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just tap a bit of the hair building fibers directly on to the thinning areas (just a couple shakes is all you need), and it thickens those trouble spots. I spray a bit of hairspray on after the application of the hair building fibers to ensure everything stays. It looks incredibly natural. Believe me, I wouldn&#x27;t risk it if I thought it looked obvious. I did it without telling my girlfriend, and she never even noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any issue with it coming off from sweating or the everyday elements. Granted, you wouldn&#x27;t want to swim with it, but even if you did... it would just be a small amount of dust that would come off. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d be anything too obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product uses your remaining thinned out hair as a sort of scafolding, which is what makes it so brilliant. Unlike so many other products for MPB, this one actually lives up to its hype. It&#x27;s not a miracle product and wont bring your hair back altogether, but it will help you address those trouble areas and keep your hair looking fuller, longer. I cannot recommend it enough, and for the price, you might as well give it a shot.</li>
            <li> Got this for my bf who has been a long term user of a similar product called Caboki. I got him this as a less expensive alternative,  and he loves it! He was surprised how Toppik is just as good of quality as the more expensive one. Next time, he wants to get the bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> Best invention since sliced bread!!! simple, clean, effective and not obvious that it is there. Definite  recommendation to all i know who could use it.</li>
            <li> I am always concious of my thinning hair in the front. This product is easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li> She is so glad she tried this product. Her head is held high again, Thanks Toppik!  If you have thin/thinning hair it is especially hard for women of all ages to cope with this product helps to mask the scalp without coating the scalp with a dye. It takes some getting use to, it is easy to be heavy handed at first. and if you sweat or have a itchy head it will clump and get under your nails so keep this in mind. over all it is better than wearing a wig.</li>
            <li> My hair is quite thin on the top and this nicely disguises it.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it now. Terrific!</li>
            <li> I use this product for thinness in the very middle of my head between just above the forehead hairline and the crown of the head.  The thinness is apparent if I was to part my hair down the middle, if I comb over from the side it is sometimes still thin looking.  I would call my thinness on the mild side and not necessary moderate at this point.  I tip my head back and use about three shakes and then see how that looks and sometimes I might use another two or three shakes.  I don&#x27;t have to use a lot and can only attest to my usage of it based on my head of hair and I do like it at this point and it works for me.  I lightly tap the area a couple of times and then spray hairspray on the area and it stays put for the rest of the day.  If you don&#x27;t spray it, it will fall like snow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 3 different similar products &amp; this one by far stands out as the best. The fibers are so fine it gives you great coverage &amp; is well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I do not write many reviews, but felt compelled to write this one based on the level of satisfaction I had with this product. It does everything as promised. I have tried other products that promised hair regrowth or body enhancement, but I never felt that those products truly lived up to their claims. Toppik is one of the very few products that I have tried that really made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always felt terribly ashamed about my thinning hair , resorting to shorter haircuts with as much layers as possible in an attempt to lessen the appearance of my thinning hair. (I am a female, and my hair had started to thin out to the point that it was already noticeable in my mid-20s). While it doesn&#x27;t solve the problem of hair loss (I&#x27;ve found the Therapy G line to be helpful in that respect), it absolutely lessens the appearance. I honestly cried when I saw the results. The thinning areas disappeared and it created the illusion of thicker hair in seconds. I would recommend applying this to your hair after blow-drying and partially styling your hair. Shake on liberally to the areas of your scalp that are noticeably thin, using your fingers to disperse the product throughout your hair. Finish styling and set your hair with a mild hairspray. I believe Toppik has their own product, but I&#x27;ve been happy just using the Frizz-Ease that was already in my cabinet. I could not be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I can add is that it would be safe to get a color one shade lighter than what you normally think to purchase. I have dark brown hair, but the medium-brown blends very nicely (I&#x27;ve heard that &amp;#34;dark brown&amp;#34; is a lot closer to black and might not blend as well).  I cannot recommend this product highly enough. Anyone who has suffered the embarrassment of premature hair loss should give this product a try. It&#x27;s not very expensive and it raised my self confidence in ways I didn&#x27;t think possible. I hope this product stays on the market for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is a decent product, and fills in the bald spots for sure, but the dust comes off easy, and gets all over your pillow, and clothing. I think its a better product for a guy who is loosing his hair on the top of his head. For someone like myself ..a woman who has thinning hair all over ..it just doesnt work for me. I put it on the very front where its really thin,and it would rub off quickly there. My husband can get away with it alot better. It completely colors in his bald spot on top.</li>
            <li> Grayce is a product that really works miracles for the purpose of temporally covering root growth. This product does not work well at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 72 years old. I look younger by at least 10 years because I&#x27;ve continued coloring my hair medium brown; however, it&#x27;s getting thinner as I age and I now need to update my coloring on at least a 2 week basis. I&#x27;m fortunate to have a hair dresser friend that helped me formulate a good color mixture of a quality product, which I purchase from her salon but I do the actual hair coloring of my short hair style myself. I couldn&#x27;t afford to continue coloring if I had to pay to have it done. Because of the thin hair, even just after coloring, my scalp shows in the crown. Using the medium brown &amp;#34;sprinkles&amp;#34; in the crown of my head and then brushing makes a significant difference in my looks. When I see others with thinning hair and scalp showing, I feel sorry for them and wish I could share the &amp;#34;sprinkles&amp;#34; secret, as my friend hair dresser and I call this product. It also gets used a bit more as my grey roots start to show. Part of my monthly budget always goes to having a backup of &amp;#34;sprinkles,&amp;#34; as I never want to &amp;#34;run out.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Now why did I not hear of this product before? I am totally impressed by Toppik and the ease of using it. I tried it on my mother recently and was so pleased to see how it changed her whole appearance, and gave her much needed confidence. She didn&#x27;t have to be embarrassed by the obvious bald spots on her head, or the thinning sparse hairs on her head, which were covered in a matter of seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon - thank you for promoting this product on your site! And Toppik - hats off to you for this innovation!</li>
            <li> Really fills in the scalp area.  I Love this product..</li>
            <li> Wonderful thank you very much</li>
            <li> great product, quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this product works fast and easily to hide the thinning spots in my hair. It goes on easily and the medium brown color blends perfectly with my hair. Great product, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> i have thinning hair on top of my head. but while using toppik. you cant even tell it. i am so glad i found this product. makes me feel better about my self. and people not looking at my bald head anymore</li>
            <li> I like this product. It works great. The small container lasts a really long time too.</li>
            <li> I had some doubts when I first heard about this product, but it really is amazing! I can&#x27;t believe how well it works.</li>
            <li> I hate the fact that my hair is thinning but this stuff makes life bearable.  I sprinkle, pat, and spray my hair and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> The product does not stay in your hair until washed out as they promise It  can Hide you thinning hair if it&#x27;s not too much but it&#x27;s not as prefect as they said</li>
            <li> just the soon i used , was increible , cover the empy hair spaces , a look like i have full hair !! amazing product</li>
            <li> Because of reviews I read from others, I have not used this product too much.  I don&#x27;t want a situation where I get itchy scalp - which has been reported by some.  Also, some have reported that their hair has gotten thinner over time with prolonged use of this product.  I definitely don&#x27;t want that, so I&#x27;ve chosen to use this on special occasions only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the time, I wear my hear in a style that covers my thinning areas.  But on the rare times, I wear my hair down, I will sprinkle a little of this over my thin spots.  The color blends really well with my color - which is chestnut.  I don&#x27;t get the coverage that is advertised, but it&#x27;s enough to help my confidence.  So far, I have not experienced the itchy scalp reported by others, but again, I don&#x27;t use this every day - maybe once every other week  - and i only use in small amounts.</li>
            <li> Good product, works well for the intended purpose. Good shipping service.</li>
            <li> Great product to cover thinning hair between colors. Didn&#x27;t like the spray attachment I bought extra.&lt;br /&gt;Sprinkling it on works fine</li>
            <li> Good but hard to apply. Wish there was an easier way to apply without getting it on face etc...</li>
            <li> I have bought this product for my girlfriend. It works wonderful. I recommend this product to people who has very thin hair.</li>
            <li> Finally a product that does what it says it will do.  I have a very small area that I needed to cover.  It literally takes me about a minute and I&#x27;m finished.  It looks great and doesn&#x27;t come off until you wash your hair.  I tried another similar product that was  powder-like and was very inferior to Toppik.  I am so pleased with the performance of Toppik and it blends into your hair so well that no one can tell you are using it.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the good reviews, I wonder who wrote them. Either I am using the product wrong, or it does not do a thing, it does not really cover the bald spots, or you need so much, it starts pouring down your face. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love Toppik!  This product really helps to camouflage the scalp when hair becomes thin.  My only complaint is the container!  I can&#x27;t tell when I need more of it.  The product is so light of weight and the container is dark and offers no hint of when you&#x27;re getting low!  Other than that, this product has definitely made me more self confident about my appearance.  I use it daily.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be able to work with the public without this product.  I would be in a wig by now.</li>
            <li> Hard to get used to at first, but like it!</li>
            <li> This is great for if you want to thicken the look of your hair in certain areas. Definitely recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> MY HAIRDRESSER RECOMMENDED THIS PRODUCT AND NOW I DON&#x27;T FEEL THAT&lt;br /&gt; PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT MY THINNING HAIR WHILE TALKING TO ME.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts about this stuff. I am balding on the top, but I had an audition in which I had to appear 18. A bald spot does not convey 18. After using this product, I got carded when trying to make a purchase. Works great, nice appearance.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with this powder. Love it. Does the trick.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re literally &amp;#34;covered&amp;#34; with this product.  Easy and pretty fast to use. Unsure about being able to swim with it though...</li>
            <li> I am happy that I found Toppik Hair. This is my second purchase.&lt;br /&gt;And will be next for sure.&lt;br /&gt;My head looks much better with using Toppik.&lt;br /&gt;Really super produkt.</li>
