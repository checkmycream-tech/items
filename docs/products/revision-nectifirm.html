    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Had a rash on my neck after a week of use, Product not for me.</li>
            <li> The jury is still out but I have seen some results.</li>
            <li> First time ordering from this seller.  Will order from again - great price, fast shipping, excellent product :)</li>
            <li> Best neck cream ever !!! trust me I have been searching for the good neck cream for a while, this one so far works for me.  my neck&#x27;s appearance has improved nicely.  Great product !!!</li>
            <li> This is a really good product and I do believe it works but I don&#x27;t think that it will work miracles.  If you have realistic expectations you will love this product.  I like the texture, smell, ingredients and I do plan on continuing use.  This isn&#x27;t the first time I have purchased this product and it won&#x27;t be the last.  I also use their make up and other moisturizing products.  The Intellishade makeup is amazing!!</li>
            <li> My go to neck cream! The BEST!</li>
            <li> Like the fragrance of the lotion and it seems to be smoothing out my neck.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> Great cream for neck. Give it a couple of weeks to see results</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve used it for about 18 months now and can say it works. I&#x27;ve recommended it to many people.</li>
            <li> Still trying this product but not seeing any drastic results</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for 5 years or more.  My neck looks younger than I do!!  It really works for me.  I do not have any little lines or droopy skin on my neck and I am old enough I should!  You have to keep using it tho.  But it is worth it.  One jar lasts about 8 months even using it twice a day.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.  But I just see a very small improvement in my neck.  I mistakenly hit the wrong star.  I think it&#x27;s worth 3 stars!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice moisturizer for the neck.  Much better than any other I have tried.  It keeps my neck moisturized the entire day (I have very dry skin) and the appearance of wrinkles has diminished.  I have not, however, seen and firming.  I really didn&#x27;t expect to.  But I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Great price for an awesome product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for close to 5 months and it really works.</li>
            <li> A wonderful product! Will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> good product, this is my second bottle.</li>
            <li> Top of the line immediate results</li>
            <li> Excellent product  I have used it for many years and it really works well. Highly recommend this for you sagging neck problems.</li>
            <li> I have used this for over a year. This product actually works the way it claims!</li>
            <li> I have ordered so much, they sent me a free gift, loved it!</li>
            <li> Have been using this for about 6 months now, and unlike many other products I CAN SEE a difference in my neck. And at 66 years old that difference is pretty noticeable. If I had started using a product like this younger, I would have a better looking neck today. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> good product, i can notice some firmness in my neck</li>
            <li> must have for skin care regime</li>
            <li> We received this product on time, wrapped securely. I don&#x27;t ever want to be without this as it really works well to fix the excess skin on my neck. It makes a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> The cream seems to be working</li>
            <li> Fabulous stuff!  Great price!</li>
            <li> The product seems to work better for my wife then it does for me. Also, the price is very expensive in my estimation.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for at least a month and have seen no changes.  It may be that my neck although starting to droop some has no lines.  I photos I have seen have improvements on necks with deep wrinkles.  I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and always come back to it.  It wont make your 66 year old neck look like its 30 but it does improve the appearance in such a way that makes it look more nourished and less crepey.  I havent found another product that works as well.</li>
            <li> It does seem to firm up the neck area but the jars often seem to be only 3/4&lt;br /&gt;full.</li>
            <li> Yes it had never been opened</li>
            <li> Wow! This works! Love, love, LOVE it!</li>
            <li> First facial product that I was amazed at the results ..  After about 4 weeks I was impressed and got my girlfriends to try it too.</li>
            <li> I started to use this product when living in Singapore.  It really firms and the crappy skin dropping was gone from my neck after a month of use.  Wonderful product.  I would highly recommend</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a great difference.  There are less expensive items that will give you as good, if not better results.  I don&#x27;t think I will purchase it again.  Not all its cracked up to be.  They sell this in the Medi Spa&#x27;s, I guess I expected more.</li>
            <li> Great product! Reduced all fine lines and wrinkles on neck area.</li>
            <li> This is just ridiculously awesome.  Have been using for over a week now and can&#x27;t believe the difference in texture, visibility and...I&#x27;m afraid I might jinx it, but I swear the few skin tags I had at the base of my neck (so small, not even worth doing anything about) are disappearing!</li>
            <li> It works really fast I could see a difference in a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use much of this , what I have used is very nice and moisturizing</li>
            <li> Love it.  Have used other products and always come back to this.  Helps keep you skin on the neck looking healthy and nourished.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery of my favorite product!</li>
            <li> Works wonders in smoothing your neck! Been using this for a year now and love it!</li>
            <li> I really like this cream. This is my 3rd one and I will continue to buy it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Nectifirm smooths the skin on the neck and chest  It helps to reduce the horizontal lines and bumpy skin which comes with sun damage and aging.  It&#x27;s a much more effective than the more expensive creams from the department stores.</li>
            <li> As effective as any are, short of surgery. It comes highly recommended by the plastic surgeon I have used. Excellent delivery.</li>
