            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled there are no floral tones to this vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ummm this utterly delicious fragrance makes me feel so good all day long.</li>
            <li>One of my good friends always smelled so amazing, her nickname quickly became Vanilla Cupcake.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the most beautiful vanilla perfume I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>However I think it smells more like cotton candy than vanilla.</li>
            <li>I get many complements on it...mostly from men.</li>
            <li>Most Vanilla fragrances don&#x27;t even smell like Vanilla.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a wonderfully comforting aroma.</li>
            <li>Objectively the best perfume I&#x27;ve ever smelled.</li>
            <li>I received an Amazon gift card and am very happy that I could order a life essential.</li>
            <li>MAKE SURE to spray it a couple times before on yourself.</li>
            <li>Not too french vanilla -  just perfect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as &#x27;perfumey&#x27; as most perfume.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received so many compliments on this perfume.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this perfume.</li>
            <li>Watch out ladies it makes the men notice your fragrance more.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on this perfume.</li>
            <li>you like vanilla based perfumes you will love this.</li>
            <li>The lovely lady at beauty habit put me on hold, and went and found a bottle off the shelf.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve worn this time for YEARS - more than 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I receive many compliments while wearing it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Vanille orders for this have been through Smallflowers and they don&#x27;t offer Prime, but I&#x27;ve been very pleased with quick delivery of my orders.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t exactly just-plain-vanilla, and maybe just a tad sweeter than my dream vanilla scent, but I do love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely sweet and sugary!</li>
            <li>In fairness to the seller - my order was packaged well &amp; I received the product very quickly.  </li>
            <li>The seller replaced the bottle very quickly, without argument.  </li>
            <li>I first found this AMAZING fragrance at Anthropologie, and since then, this is my every-day, go-to perfume.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, it has a sweet, light smell like baking cookies.</li>
            <li>This \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; smells like a cheap, dollar store , vanilla scented candle.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy enough that my search is over.</li>
            <li>I work at an Elementary School and the kids say it smells like cotton candy!</li>
            <li>I wish it was more consistent</li>
            <li>but it is not the wonderful sent that it has been in the past.</li>
            <li>It has a really sweet</li>
            <li>The perfume has done me well, but the last bottle i received did not smell as good.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff, can&#x27;t get enough of it, I first found it at Anthropolgie for around 19.00.</li>
            <li>The first bottle was bought at antropology store ( and i did not feel that strong alchool in the beggining).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Exactly what a vanilla perfume should smell like !</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>She agreed, the scent wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really just pure vanilla, without being too sweet.</li>
            <li>It smells EXACTLY like the vanilla extract you use to cook.</li>
            <li>The first couple sprays dissapointed me because it did smell like alcohol at first.</li>
            <li>The first day I wore it to school</li>
            <li>Many years ago I wore Comptoir Sud Pacifique Vanille Abricot, and this smells very similar to me.</li>
            <li>I received three compliments within the first two days of wearing it.</li>
            <li>I received this perfume as a gift years ago, and when it finally ran out, I had to buy some more.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell fake like many vanilla scents out there, this smells like warm vanilla sugar cookies!</li>
            <li>some reason, in the beggining i felt a strong smell of alchool, but after a few uses, the perfume became very sweet vanila (like i remembered it to be!)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got compliments from pretty much everyone I was around.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be honest, I was a bit hesitant to order it after reading some of the negitive reveiws that It was watered down and \\&quot;alcoholy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>and then i started to notice that after a few uses the smell became more sweet</li>
            <li>I want to give this item a FULL GOOD review, but really don&#x27;t want anyone to know my secret for smelling absolutely delicious!&lt;br</li>
            <li>My $18.00 perfume went straight into the trash.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It was a beautiful scent, but the button to release the perfume was a little jammed</li>
            <li>I used to wear the vanille oil, but the last 2 times I ordered it, it did not smell right at all, very resinous.</li>
            <li>if you are a person who loves the smell of vanilla I highly recommend this perfume.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>BUT i decided i was going to use it until i bought a new perfume....</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance and usually buy from the Smallflower website.</li>
            <li>So, buyer beware, sometimes the scent is so delicious, but other times it falls into a weird alcohol smelling-not as vanilla- perfume.</li>
            <li>It starts out very, very sweet, like cotton candy, and then dries down to a softer and more subtle vanilla-caramel.</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>It mostly reminds me of Bath &amp; Body Works &#x27;Vanilla Bean Noel&#x27; and perhaps a little bit of Aquolina&#x27;s &#x27;Pink Sugar&#x27;.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s irresistible--a sweet smelling vanilla scent that is neither subtle nor overpowering.</li>

            <li> It has a subtle vanilla scent, so that it is not overwhelming like many vanilla perfumes.</li>
            <li> When It came in the mail (which it came just on time, even a little early)</li>
            <li> I will say the fact that it&#x27;s only around 19.00 doesn&#x27;t mean it lasts a very long time, but I buy so much of it</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan L&#x27;Aromarine Vanille - sadly this product does not stack up.  </li>
            <li> Plus it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched for a non-flowery, just-plain-vanilla for a long time.</li>
            <li> Overly sweet, strangly fake vanilla scent that FYI DOES NOT WASH OFF.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing L&#x27;aromarine Vanille for a few years, and I really noticed that since the fragrance is made in small batches, that sometimes..it is off.</li>
            <li> I thought that they had changed the formula or the product was not real...</li>
            <li> Majorly dissappointed to say the least.  </li>
            <li> After reading some of the other reviews, I was concerned....</li>
            <li> have resorted to layer this fragrance with my other vanilla or coconut ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very weak, and not truly a pure vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> Even the color is not as dark.  </li>
            <li> As others have said it seems \\&quot;watered\\&quot; down with alcohol.</li>
            <li> I died a little bit inside.  </li>
            <li> and it smelled just like my previous bottle!  </li>
            <li> Its a little bottle if heaven!</li>
            <li> The spray mechanism is made of metal, and it&#x27;s very hard to push down...</li>
            <li> so it was hard to push.</li>
            <li> It seriously smells like heaven.</li>
            <li> I would have given it away, but I didn&#x27;t want to stumble upon the one person who would actually wear this nasty smelling stuff and be forced to smell this \\&quot;scent\\&quot; day after day.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I stumbled upon this product &amp; foolishly thought maybe, just maybe it would smell something like what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> I get compliments on it weekly when I merely walk into a room.</li>
            <li> I was so sad to discover the shop where I used to get it had stopped carrying it, and then Amazon came through for me.</li>
            <li> My product was shipped during the ultra cold snap in winter of 2013-14.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed .</li>
            <li> I decided to try it based on the reviews, also the fact it was a product offered at Anthropologie, I&#x27;ve never been disappointed with their fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried on this perfume once, in Anthropologie, and I stupidly didn&#x27;t buy it.  </li>

            <li> My daughter adores this product and every time she wears it I comment on how wonder she smells. However I think it smells more like cotton candy than vanilla.</li>
            <li> I work at an Elementary School and the kids say it smells like cotton candy! I get many complements on it...mostly from men.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product. Ever since L&#x27;occitane discontinued it&#x27;s vanille line I have been search for something to replace it. Sadly, I stumbled upon this product &amp; foolishly thought maybe, just maybe it would smell something like what I was looking for. Boy was I wrong. This \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; smells like a cheap, dollar store , vanilla scented candle. You know the type I&#x27;m talking about, right? Overly sweet, strangly fake vanilla scent that FYI DOES NOT WASH OFF. So basically, I reeked all day from this stuff. Majorly dissappointed to say the least.  In fairness to the seller - my order was packaged well &amp; I received the product very quickly.  That&#x27;s all the good I can say. My $18.00 perfume went straight into the trash. I would have given it away, but I didn&#x27;t want to stumble upon the one person who would actually wear this nasty smelling stuff and be forced to smell this \\&quot;scent\\&quot; day after day.</li>
            <li> I tried on this perfume once, in Anthropologie, and I stupidly didn&#x27;t buy it.  The beautiful smell literally haunted me all day.  I went back to buy it, and it was sold out.  I died a little bit inside.  Until I found it on Amazon!  It&#x27;s just as wonderful as I remembered: warm, vanilla-caramelly, delicious.  Amazing.</li>
            <li> Ummm this utterly delicious fragrance makes me feel so good all day long. I constantly get compliments and people stop me and want to know what I am wearing. This is truly the best Vanilla fragrance I have found. Most Vanilla fragrances don&#x27;t even smell like Vanilla. And, this fragrance lasts and lasts. All your clothes will smell yummy. It&#x27;s such a wonderfully comforting aroma. Do yourself a favor and order this fragrance you&#x27;ll be so happy you did!! :-)</li>
            <li> I first found this AMAZING fragrance at Anthropologie, and since then, this is my every-day, go-to perfume. It smells EXACTLY like the vanilla extract you use to cook. I get compliments on it weekly when I merely walk into a room. Everyone loves it! It seriously smells like heaven. I will never wear another scent!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s irresistible--a sweet smelling vanilla scent that is neither subtle nor overpowering. Objectively the best perfume I&#x27;ve ever smelled.</li>
            <li> if you are a person who loves the smell of vanilla I highly recommend this perfume. U smell like a delicious cookie. I have compliments everywhere I go</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and usually buy from the Smallflower website. I received an Amazon gift card and am very happy that I could order a life essential.</li>
            <li> One of my good friends always smelled so amazing, her nickname quickly became Vanilla Cupcake. The moment I found out it was this perfume that she uses, I just HAD to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, I was a bit hesitant to order it after reading some of the negitive reveiws that It was watered down and \\&quot;alcoholy\\&quot;. When It came in the mail (which it came just on time, even a little early) I was nervous to smell it. The first couple sprays dissapointed me because it did smell like alcohol at first. MAKE SURE to spray it a couple times before on yourself. But I PROMISE, after that, it smells WONDEROUS. The first day I wore it to school I got compliments from pretty much everyone I was around. Even the guys love this smell to and wanted it sprayed all over class! I hear people behing me saying that it smells like a Walk through Disneyland by all the churros and candy (; so. BUY THIS PRODUCT. You wont be dissapointed. Its a little bottle if heaven!</li>
            <li> This is a great product &amp; I had a GREAT customer service experience.  My product was shipped during the ultra cold snap in winter of 2013-14.  The product froze in the bottle &amp; leaked out.  The seller replaced the bottle very quickly, without argument.  I believe they even overnighted it to me as it arrived 2 days after my claim.</li>
            <li> It was a beautiful scent, but the button to release the perfume was a little jammed so it was hard to push.</li>
            <li> lovely and great price. I get a ton of compliments with this one and always have. Very good, milky creamy vanilla. Not too french vanilla -  just perfect.</li>
            <li> Many years ago I wore Comptoir Sud Pacifique Vanille Abricot, and this smells very similar to me. Great scent, great price. My husband loves it.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells amazing! I received three compliments within the first two days of wearing it. It has a subtle vanilla scent, so that it is not overwhelming like many vanilla perfumes.</li>
            <li> I have read some reviews saying that it was not the same perfume and i must say that when i received this and tested it i felt the same way!! I thought that they had changed the formula or the product was not real...BUT i decided i was going to use it until i bought a new perfume....and then i started to notice that after a few uses the smell became more sweet vanila!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, in the beggining i felt a strong smell of alchool, but after a few uses, the perfume became very sweet vanila (like i remembered it to be!)&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite perfume! The first bottle was bought at antropology store ( and i did not feel that strong alchool in the beggining).&lt;br /&gt;I hope the product has not changed because it is amazing!!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, it has a sweet, light smell like baking cookies. It&#x27;s not as &#x27;perfumey&#x27; as most perfume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received so many compliments on this perfume. I&#x27;ve worn vanilla perfumes before but this one takes the cake, literally, it smells like a cupcake. I&#x27;ll catch my husband getting close to me and taking a deep inhale to capture that fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume. It&#x27;s really just pure vanilla, without being too sweet. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I received this perfume as a gift years ago, and when it finally ran out, I had to buy some more. It has a really sweet smell-- whenever I wear it, people say it smells like cotton candy, or cookies in the oven. Plus it lasts for a long time. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery....and it smelled just like my previous bottle!  I get so many compliments! After reading some of the other reviews, I was concerned....no need!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t walk around without someone saying I smell chocolate cake, where is it? Watch out ladies it makes the men notice your fragrance more.</li>
            <li> Every time I wear this I here coments from people like &amp;#34; I smell cupcakes &amp;#34; ,  &amp;#34; What a yummy desert &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> People want to lick me when I wear this. It smells that good. I can&#x27;t live without it. I was so sad to discover the shop where I used to get it had stopped carrying it, and then Amazon came through for me. Oh happy day!</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on this perfume. It has a deep vanilla scent. Exactly what a vanilla perfume should smell like ! I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched for a non-flowery, just-plain-vanilla for a long time. It isn&#x27;t exactly just-plain-vanilla, and maybe just a tad sweeter than my dream vanilla scent, but I do love it! It reminds me of snow ice cream my grandma made years ago; snow, vanilla extract, sugar, with a splash of milk. Yum!!!  And I&#x27;ve had numerous people around me sniff the air and say &#x27;something smells wonderful&#x27; or &#x27;I smell cookies!&#x27;.  Even though it is sweet, it&#x27;s still the best I&#x27;ve found and I&#x27;m happy enough that my search is over. I&#x27;m thrilled there are no floral tones to this vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Vanille orders for this have been through Smallflowers and they don&#x27;t offer Prime, but I&#x27;ve been very pleased with quick delivery of my orders.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always get compliments on how great it smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like vanilla based perfumes you will love this.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the most beautiful vanilla perfume I&#x27;ve ever tried. Lasts all day and I get compliments from men and women alike when I wear it. My go to perfume for daily use!!! Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this Vanilla perfume  ! It&#x27;s the best vanilla perfume I have ever smelled . You can wear it by itself or layer it . You won&#x27;t be disappointed .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing L&#x27;aromarine Vanille for a few years, and I really noticed that since the fragrance is made in small batches, that sometimes..it is off. I used to wear the vanille oil, but the last 2 times I ordered it, it did not smell right at all, very resinous. The lovely lady at beauty habit put me on hold, and went and found a bottle off the shelf. She agreed, the scent wasn&#x27;t right. Now you cannot find the vanille oil anywhere. The perfume has done me well, but the last bottle i received did not smell as good. So, buyer beware, sometimes the scent is so delicious, but other times it falls into a weird alcohol smelling-not as vanilla- perfume. I wish it was more consistent</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan L&#x27;Aromarine Vanille - sadly this product does not stack up.  As others have said it seems \\&quot;watered\\&quot; down with alcohol. Even the color is not as dark.  When you spray it all you smell is alcohol. Maybe I got a bad batch but it is not the wonderful sent that it has been in the past. I would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely sweet and sugary! It mostly reminds me of Bath &amp; Body Works &#x27;Vanilla Bean Noel&#x27; and perhaps a little bit of Aquolina&#x27;s &#x27;Pink Sugar&#x27;. It starts out very, very sweet, like cotton candy, and then dries down to a softer and more subtle vanilla-caramel.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff, can&#x27;t get enough of it, I first found it at Anthropolgie for around 19.00. But a lot of times they ran out, so I finally found it online yay! I will say the fact that it&#x27;s only around 19.00 doesn&#x27;t mean it lasts a very long time, but I buy so much of it I never have to worry about that. It has the most delicious smell and men LOVE it!</li>
            <li> The L&#x27;Armomarine was so great!! Has a really good smell. I will soon be getting it again. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I want to give this item a FULL GOOD review, but really don&#x27;t want anyone to know my secret for smelling absolutely delicious!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve worn this time for YEARS - more than 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell fake like many vanilla scents out there, this smells like warm vanilla sugar cookies!</li>
            <li> The best smelling vanilla I have ever used. I receive many compliments while wearing it. Some say it smells like sugar cookies. I love it.</li>
            <li> I am a vanilla &amp;#34;addict&amp;#34; LOL!!! This fragrance was not in my collection yet. I decided to try it based on the reviews, also the fact it was a product offered at Anthropologie, I&#x27;ve never been disappointed with their fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I am experiencing all the issues of the &amp;#34;not so good&amp;#34; reviews. The fragrance is very weak, and not truly a pure vanilla scent. The spray mechanism is made of metal, and it&#x27;s very hard to push down...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have resorted to layer this fragrance with my other vanilla or coconut ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doubt I will buy again...</li>
