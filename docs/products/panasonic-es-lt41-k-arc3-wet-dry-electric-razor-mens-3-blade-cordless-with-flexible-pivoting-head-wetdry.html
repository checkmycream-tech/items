            <li>The Panasonic ES-LT41-K is an excellent choice among electric shavers.er when it reaches 10% - use it for more</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ES-LT41-K has some notable features - excellent blades that provide for a close shave, a side trimmer, and an easy-to-read battery status LED display.  </li>
            <li>Works way better than I thought it would, very happy.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly to me it does a great job of shaving my face.  </li>
            <li>This Panasonic got great reviews and the price was good.  </li>

            <li>Perfect form fitting function.  </li>
            <li>excellent shaver, Love Panasonic</li>
            <li>It did not meet my expectations as not that successful at neck and jawbone area.</li>
            <li>One gets better results by going over the skin at a snail&#x27;s pace, allowing the skin to compress, unroll, and conform to the shape of the razor head, thus presenting the whiskers at maximum advantage to the blades for best &amp;#34;off with her head&amp;#34; performance.  </li>
            <li>I also have many Panasonic products in my home and have had excellent service from them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it, best razor &amp; closest shave</li>
            <li>Works great - a good shave</li>
            <li>Excellent contour - easy to hold in your hand</li>
            <li>Easy to use and gives great shaves!!!!!  </li>
            <li>This is easily the best electric razor I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the Best of The Best.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a huge fan of the wet/dry capabilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best pieces of advice I can offer</li>
            <li>As good as a blade on the face.  </li>
            <li>My perfectly good Panasonic is now in the trash.</li>
            <li>This worked fairly well for my husband.  </li>
            <li>and there that weren&#x27;t getting cut, but now things seem to be going fairly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really good razor, close shave</li>
            <li>This is a good shaver for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as good.</li>
            <li>The battery is good for couple of shaves, plus it recharges quickly&lt;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good quality electric razor for quite some time.</li>
            <li>Again, this is good.</li>
            <li>Good pop-out sideburn trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Good handle.  </li>
            <li>price was good to me</li>
            <li>Germans are good at making machines.</li>
            <li>you should be good.</li>
            <li>the works really good.</li>
            <li>she loved it so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives a good shave</li>
            <li>all amounts to a good value.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Good quality shaver and good performance.....</li>
            <li>Good price also.</li>
            <li>It gives a wonderful smooth shave when using with shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>) Has good vibration protection--doesn&#x27;t wear out your hand.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good, because you can&#x27;t shave with it</li>
            <li>does a good job shaving.</li>
            <li>A good close shave.</li>
            <li>It gives a good shave for a shaver of this price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Performance: The 30 degree Nanotech blades gives a fairly close shave, depending on how your hair grows.</li>
            <li>It seems well-built, and it has good battery life.  </li>
            <li>Works as advertised, battery life is good, about 10 days per charge and it shaves close.</li>
            <li>The three blade Panasonic ES-LT41-K is a good Panasonic razor.  </li>
            <li>Quality seems good</li>
            <li>This shaver is a good value.</li>
            <li>This is a great value for the price and has nice features.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my partner and he loved it.</li>
            <li>he loved it</li>
            <li>but I get a good shave.</li>
            <li>Just as good as advertised.</li>
            <li>For the price it is a good razor.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly close shave for an electric</li>
            <li>Good value for money.</li>
            <li>So while searching for a replacement,  I knew I did not want to invest in one with a cleaning station and the ES-LT41-K appeared to be priced well and offered some improvements in design that looked like a good choice for me.  </li>
            <li>I shave my head in the shower and this one does not do as good of a job at all.</li>
            <li>so I thought this might be a good investment.  </li>
            <li>If you think about it over time, this would save you a good amount of money if you are shaving once a day.  </li>
            <li>I had another Panasonic shaver for 12 years which was no longer holding charge so decided to buy this product after reading good reviews about it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get a good shave in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get a good shave in the neck area</li>
            <li>shave was fairly close</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li>had good reviews and bought one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No complaints at all and good value for money</li>
            <li>My opinion is that this razor does not give as good of a shave as a Braun.</li>
            <li>I never achieved a good neck shave with an electric before - always had to get out the Gillette for that.</li>
            <li>This one is a good shaver but the stubborn neck hairs (under the side of your jaw)</li>
            <li>Nice razor, great for traveling</li>
            <li>Good power.  </li>
            <li>Ability to clean under running water is great!</li>
            <li>very good feel in the hand, and easy to wash/rinse.  </li>
            <li>It charges quickly and battery life is excellent.</li>
            <li>clean-up is quick with soap &amp; water!!!....</li>
            <li>Picked it up on sale for $59.99 Best Buy but easily worth it for the $79.99 Amazon sale price.</li>
            <li>My cousin likes this shaver better because this one has a lock button -- it&#x27;s great for travel.  </li>
            <li>- It&#x27;s also very safe</li>
            <li>I have had it for over a year now and am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this</li>
            <li>This panasonic is everything that is promised and i am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great machine and gives a better shave than my rotary shaver.</li>
            <li>The flip-up razor does a great job trimming sideburns and my mustache, much better than the Norelco.</li>
            <li>I have had this for just over a month now and very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>and I am very satisfied with the result.</li>
            <li>I am very glad I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this Panasonic Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver.  </li>
            <li>: After a month of use, I am still very satisfied.</li>
            <li>A good buy, with nice features.</li>
            <li>It also gets my neck right under my chin line perfectly on one or two passes.</li>
            <li>the motor vibrates the head perfectly and the pivoting head is just the right tension for moving along angles.  </li>
            <li>with any good electric razor make sure that you get a good cleaner/lubricant.</li>
            <li>This shaver is very fast at shaving and I have discovered that a circular motion is best (the single-head shavers don&#x27;t work as well with the circular motion).</li>
            <li>My first es8066 (no longer offered) is the very best.  </li>
            <li>not anything fancy but better than my finances $250 braun!</li>
            <li>Good use of an electric razor!It is suitable as a gift。&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>He loves the closeness of the shave with this razor, and I love it as well!</li>
            <li>I am enjoying it !</li>
            <li>Not as perfect as using a blade - but pretty darn close.  </li>
            <li>There are so many options out there!</li>
            <li>and smooth!!...</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS SHAVER!  </li>
            <li>Love it.!</li>
            <li>so glad it did!  </li>
            <li>It works great and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>After shaving for most all of my life with blades, this is a pleasant change.</li>
            <li>Excellent shave, well designed, easy to hold and comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>Amazing experience.</li>
            <li>Great to actually enjoy shaving a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>Amazingly easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also feels great in hand and is light.</li>
            <li>but the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing...</li>
            <li>I cuts fairly close but could do a better job.</li>
            <li>Oh yeah, its like shaving honestly.</li>
            <li>Not a close or effective shave at all.  </li>
            <li>Excellent quality - shaves very well.  </li>
            <li>Nice feel.  </li>
            <li>- The travel lock is handy.  </li>
            <li>razors materials are also really nice.  </li>
            <li>nice holding pouch</li>
            <li>As I write this, I&#x27;ve been thinking about any &amp;#34;cons&amp;#34; to report to you, but I honestly can&#x27;t think of any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked the reviews on this one and tried it.  </li>
            <li>On the contrary, it&#x27;s produced a nice close shave without pain.  </li>
            <li>Men&#x27;s 4-Blade (Arc 4) Multi-Flex Dual-Motor Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Silver]] which is absolutely the best shaving system that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>A stand or cradle might have been nice, but this configuration hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>which is nice.</li>
            <li>previously liked the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>guess I have a nice paperweight now..</li>
            <li>I purchased a foil type portable shaver (Braun) for travel and liked it.</li>
            <li>It does have a nice feature in the cut off switch in front of the shaver</li>
            <li>The fast charging is impressive, and the battery holds a charge well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good shaver for sensitive skin , i bought this shaver for my husband&#x27;s gife , and he is very happy this shaver .</li>
            <li>Travel lock-out feature is nice to have.</li>
            <li>The pop-up trimmer is surprisingly effective.</li>
            <li>Still, an excellent option if you don&#x27;t want a real razor.</li>
            <li>Battery life hasn&#x27;t impressed me much yet</li>
            <li>have the nice curly cord that my Braun did.</li>
            <li>the LT41 has an added travel lock, which is a nice feature, although I had never had problems with my 8103 turning on during travel.</li>
            <li>Perfect and works very good.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>one is a nice upgrade.</li>
            <li>I have had it over a year holding up nice.</li>
            <li>absolutely the greatest razor I ever had.</li>
            <li>Nice looking shaver as well.</li>
            <li>if you like foil shavers, there are a lot of nice things to say about this one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pop-up trimmer is a nice feature</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice design though</li>
            <li>features I liked about the ES-LT41-K</li>
            <li>I actually liked this thing when it worked.</li>
            <li>so the dual 100-240v option is nice, and it comes with a travel case and a lock for the power switch for it to prevent it from accidentally turning on in your luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lock is a nice feature because I will take it when I travel</li>
            <li>Nice rubbery grips.</li>
            <li>Had a Braun 7000 series that I liked but after 10 yrs</li>
            <li>I liked mine</li>
            <li>and and people were telling me that electric razors always irritate the skin, but this was really milder than the best razor I ever used.</li>
            <li>Husband liked shaver.  </li>
            <li>Really nice razor for the price.</li>
            <li>Lots of nice features</li>
            <li>I am absolutely thrilled to own this razor.  </li>
            <li>However, this particular shaver is probably the best electric shaver I have had.  </li>
            <li>LCD panel on the front of the unit displays in a bright amber, which is nice (easy to read, even without my glasses).</li>
            <li>It even tells you when to clean it!!</li>
            <li>They added a wonderful new feature.</li>
            <li>This is my NEW FAVORITE razor!!!!</li>
            <li>I am new to electric shavers, but this appears to be best rated for a reason.</li>
            <li>Definitely a great upgrade from cheap electric shavers without spending hundreds on the top models.</li>
            <li>I have read some reviews where people talk about great battery life; I can&#x27;t imagine how they shave as I am lucky if I get 5 days without a re-charge needed.</li>
            <li>The unit was delivered quickly and the price was great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a great razor for people like myself (mild beard).</li>
            <li>It trims the side burns and beard very quickly and surprisingly close.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, holds a charge well, and gives a good shave.  </li>
            <li>This razor feels good in the hand and the motor is really strong sounding</li>
            <li>It is very easy to handle</li>
            <li>Cleaning is also very easy.</li>
            <li>Very, very easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>I found it to give me a close shave and very easy to use and clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The arc&#x27;d blades make trimming shorter hair very easy.</li>
            <li>Love, love!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall though I am happy with the shaver and feel it works well and is a good replacement for my older model, whether it will beat the record of 7 years is another question?</li>
            <li>tried a Braun 5090CC, and it wasn&#x27;t nearly as comfortable, or as good shaving for me.  </li>
            <li>The best shave I&#x27;d got so far with</li>
            <li>About 8 months ago the old one wore out and rather than just ordering another one I decided to do so research and buy the best razor out there.  </li>
            <li>but I like this one best so far.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned a lot of Panasonic Wet/Dry shavers, but this is by far the best one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was favorably surprised when I used the shaver that gave me the best shave from an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need powder sticks or Lectric Shave to get a good, comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>It gave the best shave at the time but it was so loud it was like shaving with a chainsaw.</li>
            <li>I have had the razor for 2 weeks now and so far I have not been impressed.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Its nice to be able to rinse it under the tap.</li>
            <li>By far, the best.</li>
            <li>I have been using Panasonic shavers for many years, and liked them.</li>
            <li>As well the textured handle is nice providing a much better grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This by far is the best bang for the buck!  </li>
            <li>My old trimmer was at a 90 degree angle which was perfect.</li>
            <li>this is far from perfect.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best shaver I have ever had</li>
            <li>This will give you an exceptional shave and that this price, I can easily overlook the lack of a stand.</li>
            <li>Excellent shaving for people with sensitive skin, as you can apply foam and soften your skin to reduce irritation.</li>
            <li>Pros: Very easy to use, very easy to clean, and holds a charge for a good while.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic shavers are among the best, from my experience, and the ES-LT41-K is right at the sweet spot.  </li>
            <li>Very useful razor which is good for my face.</li>
            <li>Had many razors over many decades, this one really is the best one yet and delivers a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend is very pleased with this razor as it is easy to hold and gets a close shave without nicking his face.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, and the Linear razors just seem to cut closer to the skin than the rotaries do.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned many electric razors in my 60 years, but I&#x27;d have to say this one is clearly the best shave.</li>
            <li>It does everything an electric razor should do well: close shave, great battery life, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It gives a good, clean, close shave.</li>
            <li>I love this razor, It does a good good and is gentle on the skin on my face.</li>
            <li>Combined that with it supporting 100-240V charging, it makes it a great razor for travelling.</li>
            <li>It sounded too good to be true, but I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>this shaver fits your budget, it&#x27;s an exceptional device that&#x27;ll give you a close and comfortable shave for many years.  </li>
            <li>have a couple of areas that the hair grows rather fast, so I shave with a razor once a week as electrics aren&#x27;t the best for longer hair and do the clean up with this the rest of the week.</li>
            <li>The reviews I read about this model were very accurate.</li>
            <li>Very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Very light weight&lt;</li>
            <li>worked well for me from the day one with a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable when you use it.</li>
            <li>It does have a pop out trimmer for thicker hairs, but it is very cheap and it irritates the skin when using.</li>
            <li>You will get unimpressive shaves the first couple of weeks, but it does get better; 2) Williams Lectric Shave really is great stuff, our fathers and grandfathers were on to something.</li>
            <li>The case it comes with is a nice fabric pouch, that keeps in easily protected (though I still pack it in a shoe when traveling).</li>
            <li>The razor does not feel good on the skin and seems to pull hairs if you move the head too quickly.</li>
            <li>It does a pretty good job and by far is the best electric shaver I have ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great ;product, easy to use and easy to clean</li>
            <li>so far it&#x27;s a very good buy.  </li>
            <li>The price is also very good for such a nice device.</li>
            <li>I have used many models of shavers and this one does the job.</li>
            <li>Its battery is giving up, and its still a better performer.  </li>
            <li>irritates the heck out of my face because I have to make many passes to get it done.</li>
            <li>Some better than others, I&#x27;ve found that the foil type work better than the rotating ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Getting this product the second day with this prime thing is AWESOME.</li>
            <li>This is an outstanding razor.</li>
            <li>That makes it more compact for traveling light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>There are none any more.</li>
            <li>It never got any better.</li>
            <li>Its an okay razor</li>
            <li>The electric razor was ok, I just didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put the shaver on the charger when it reaches 10% - use it for more</li>
            <li>Closer and better in the neck and jaw area than the Braun 300 series and certainly better than any of the Remingtons I have owned.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care what the blades are made of, but if &#x27;nanotech&#x27; is the reason that this shaver makes me happy then</li>
            <li>The trimmer seems OK as well.</li>
            <li>- I find that the closeness of the shave is quite good, and while not as close as a razor, still close enough to make me happy.  </li>
            <li>This one is much better size, lighter, easier to handle, and seems more sturdy &amp; reliable.</li>
            <li>but glad I tried this one.</li>
            <li>Does not leave stubs like most shavers.</li>
            <li>give it 5 stars if the trimmer was designed/built a bit better</li>
            <li>Compared to my CC, this charges in 1 hour (vs. 12), holds a charge longer, and has more features.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;comfortable to hold,  Love shaving with lather</li>
            <li>Glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sure is close</li>
            <li>/&gt;Gentlemen, this really is a better mousetrap.</li>
            <li>Still, quite pleased with this.  </li>
            <li>Not using this on a face, I haven&#x27;t encountered a sensitivity issue that many men experience.  </li>
            <li>Check out my video review for more.</li>
            <li>I will return to Norelco, even though I think the Panasonic gives me a slightly better shave.</li>
            <li>nice smooth shave, does what its supposed to.</li>
            <li>I have been using this shaver for 3 months and fairly satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>That was when the magic happened :).</li>
            <li>Another feature I love is the travel lock on the power button.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is top of the line for a razor trimmer.</li>
            <li>but they didn&#x27;t work well on my face, even after many weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>It shuts itself off after 20 seconds, then youremove the foil section, activate the sonic mode once more while holding the blades under running water to rinse.</li>
            <li>even more so, actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it feels more maneuverable on my face.  </li>
            <li>Both Panasonics before this one performed flawlessly and lasted several years</li>
            <li>However, this one feels noticeably lighter and has a more secure/textured surface to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the cheaper ES-LT41 provides a better shave over all.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the latest Norelco technology</li>
            <li>And for the price it is a much better deal than the Braun foil shavers.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>My husband has used Philips Norelco shaver for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li>I shopped the many shaving offerings from Panasonic and others.  </li>
            <li>but it is smooth and a  nice change to a razor.</li>
            <li>To be able to shave while plugged into the charger.</li>
            <li>For many, that may take some getting used to.  </li>
            <li>For many, that may take some getting used to.  </li>
            <li>I have owned several Panasonic razors over the years and this is the best.</li>
            <li>But no, it&#x27;s excellent, should&#x27;ve bought it earlier.  </li>
            <li>While the shaver did OK (replaced once under warranty)</li>
            <li>I switched from Norelco rotaries, because the Linear razors gave me a better cut than the rotaries.  </li>
            <li>much more</li>
            <li>I had been using a rotary shaver for many years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had Panasonic Wet/Dry razors for many years.  </li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve always been satisfied using a blade.</li>
            <li>My husband had never been able to find a razor that didn&#x27;t give him razor burn.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think you can do any better than this.</li>
            <li>so he can keep it in his car, but he love the shaver.</li>
            <li>Battery is good for about a week&#x27;s worth of shaves.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this razor.  </li>
            <li>The trimming tool is better than the rotaries.</li>
            <li>I am glad i did.  </li>
            <li>almost bought the 4-head model for $50 more, but I&#x27;m glad I chose this one.</li>
            <li>I have been shaving with electric shavers for many years.  </li>
            <li>Most electric shavers are not designed to handle beard growth more than 3-4 days.  </li>
            <li>OK I decided I might want more</li>
            <li>thing I think could be better would be the way it&#x27;s connects to the charging cable.</li>
            <li>thing I think could be better would be the way it&#x27;s connects to the charging cable.</li>
            <li>Excellent razor, especially for the money.  </li>
            <li>It is so nice and even cheap.</li>
            <li>Love, love this thing.  </li>
            <li>Love the fact that it is water proof.</li>
            <li>Feels better going over my face</li>
            <li>/&gt;Panasonic Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Feels better in my hand</li>
            <li>The head design allows better access to nooks and crannies around my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Husband really likes this razor, does a great job.</li>
            <li>Takes getting used to, but worth it for a good shave.</li>
            <li>I have noticed the more I shave with this</li>
            <li>I do make many passes to get a close shave, but this is the case for all electric shavers.</li>
            <li>No reason to spend more for a shaver.  </li>
            <li>Shaves OK and is better on neck than a rotary  shaver.</li>
            <li>Therefore, turning the shaver in a way to get a better look on where you want to trim should help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using razor blades for shaving my head and got some spots bleeding, This did the trick, I love it</li>
            <li>Even 12 hours after shaving, his face is still smooth!</li>
            <li>He declares it his favorite razor ever.</li>
            <li>also own the Panasonic ES-LV61 shaver, so this will primarily be a comparison between the two.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter how many times I go over that area in varying angles and speeds, can never truly get it cut.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this razor.</li>
            <li>Better shave than my Braun or Norelco.</li>
            <li>It was much more aggressive</li>
            <li>I decided to give this shaver a try because an electric is way faster and easier and cheaper to use, so I knew I&#x27;d use it more.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve had it for about 3 weeks) but there are many factors in that</li>
            <li>There is zero chance that it&#x27;s $400+ better than this one.  </li>
            <li>It does take more passes to shave with the 3 blade than with the 4 blades, and a bit more effort.  </li>
            <li>you may save a bit more by buying this over the 4 blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>4 or 5 blade ones may be better.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>more like a</li>
            <li>For the most part, I&#x27;ve used Remington models.</li>
            <li>When the trimmer on my latest Remington quit working, I decided to see what else was out there.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m liking it more and more each day.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say I love it</li>
            <li>For a while I used 2-blade disposable razors, which would work OK if I hadn&#x27;t shaved in a couple days, but towards the end of the work week</li>
            <li>the bumps/irritation/nicks would increase, which as many of you</li>
            <li>The shave is close but a razer blade is still better.</li>
            <li>I dont know how a 4 and 5 blade electric razer shaves but it cant be that much better than my 3 blade</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned most models, from Ronson and Remington to Braun, Norelco and Panasonic, wired and rechargeable, with rotary, foil and bar cutters.  </li>
            <li>Sure, it gives a close shave</li>
            <li>I love everything except the cord, which is a wall wart</li>
            <li>And I understand I have to write 1 more word for this review.</li>
            <li>So glad I made the switch</li>
            <li>Glad I did.  </li>
            <li>It seems to do a better job for me.  </li>
            <li>I also just love the style of this one aesthetically -</li>
            <li>I get even better results on shaving the mustache than I do with my razor.</li>
            <li>However, there are some notable differences that I believe are improvements with the LT41 line.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I expect many more years of trusty service.</li>
            <li>So I shave like King Henry, ok.  </li>
            <li>The Braun shavers feel the best made and have lasted forever; I still have a Braun Synchro I keep around, just in case (it still keeps a charge, more than 10 years later!).</li>
            <li>The Panasonic is much better on the neck area.</li>
            <li>It pays for itself in 6 months compared to buying replacement cartridges, while giving a shave that is faster, more convenient, and just as close.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue using the Norelco for a month to see if it does better after my face adjusts to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had 2 Panasonic shavers and both have not lasted more than 4 years.</li>
            <li>If Braun and Norelco can make a shaver that lasts more than 10 years, then so should Panasonic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue using the Norelco for a month to see if it does better after my face adjusts to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had 2 Panasonic shavers and both have not lasted more than 4 years.</li>
            <li>If Braun and Norelco can make a shaver that lasts more than 10 years, then so should Panasonic.</li>
            <li>Ok for sideburns, but tricky for a beard or mustache.</li>
            <li>He was glad to get it and has said that he likes it a lot.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, the comfort and ease of shaving that it provides is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>This shaver gives a nice and smooth shave.</li>
            <li>GIVES A CLOSE CUT AND LOOKING FOR MORE TO CUT</li>
            <li>I have been using Panasonic Wet/Dry shavers for last 14 years and this is the 4th and the best</li>
            <li>I have been a blade and shaving cream shaver for most of my life.</li>
            <li>I found myself using it in the shower more than I would have thought .if</li>
            <li>However after giving the Panasonic wet/dry a really fair shake, I still experienced the same problems I&#x27;ve always had with foil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>some reason, the 3 rotary head shavers have always worked better for me.</li>
            <li>so maybe ok for those who do like electrics better.  </li>
            <li>I heard the foil is better if you don&#x27;t shave often.</li>
            <li>I read an independent review that said this was the best shaver under $100.</li>
            <li>I love this model.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I would love to give this a 5th star, but it just has one flaw, which i&#x27;ll get to shortly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Bought 2 more of them for Christmas -- one for each of my sons.  </li>
            <li>They LOVE them too.</li>
            <li>I also love the button lock feature, so when I travel it doesn&#x27;t accidentally turn itself on in my luggage.</li>
            <li>it gave me the best overall performance and shave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic shavers for many years</li>
            <li>Hope the rest of you have better luck.</li>
            <li>have a Braun shaver as well and find the Panasonic to be better and gives me a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>So I ordered it and am quite pleased.</li>
            <li>and I am as pleased with it as the day I bought it.  </li>
            <li>The MS was better in that respect.</li>
            <li>Has all the most desirable features but doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li>Never have been able to, even with a safety razor.</li>
            <li>Works better that way on my beard/face.</li>
            <li>on top it would cause ingrown hair and irritation all over.</li>
            <li>and I would rate it among the top tier of electric shavers in terms of closeness.  </li>
            <li>They always get better.</li>
            <li>and I think all electrics, will never be able to do that.</li>
            <li>A couple more notes: 1)</li>
            <li>and I think it works better.</li>
            <li>Works well for already more than 2 years</li>
            <li>It is simply the best.</li>
            <li>Much better than the Remington that it replaced.</li>
            <li>Love it - even with 3 day growth.</li>
            <li>Thought I&#x27;d take a chance on a Panasonic and am delightfully pleased.</li>
            <li>it was better than both of them.....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been able to quit using Lectric Shave.  </li>
            <li>I like&lt;br /&gt;living cut free!</li>
            <li>Does it shave better than this ES-LT41-K?  </li>
            <li>I will say this without equivocation, my Schick disposable razors shave better than this razor AND the $120 Panasonic ES</li>
            <li>The shave is OK, but takes longer than I am used to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks now, mostly once a day.</li>
            <li>will be trying it for 1 more week before attempting to return it.</li>
            <li>I like the compact feel of the ES-LT41-K, and love being able to rinse it out.</li>
            <li>Much, much better shave.</li>
            <li>That one I thought was a better shaver.  </li>
            <li>I am 55 and have used a blade most of my life.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t find it all that worthwhile</li>
            <li>more Remington for me, thanks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Remingtons I used had better trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;Supposedly, you can go a year without changing the foil and blade on this razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing more like 8-10 months.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>I know that this shaver is not on the top tier</li>
            <li>This razor does a much better job on my neck than any of my Brauns ever did.</li>
            <li>Though the more you go over your face, the closer the shave will be.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>I am sure there are better razors on the market</li>
            <li>but it takes many passes (more than 10) to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>My Braun 3 works much better and doesn&#x27;t nick me.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is a nice shaver with good features for your buck!</li>
            <li>Shaves really nice and clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Summary: Great shaver, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Summary: Great shaver, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The price was good to me too.&lt;br /&gt;Engine was strong and calm.  </li>
            <li>Gives a very clean shave.</li>
            <li>I bought this razor for myself, and liked it so much, I purchased 2 more for my sons!...</li>
            <li>Gosh, I&#x27;ve been using a Norelco (a cheaper one), which was pretty good.</li>
            <li>The first time i use this shaver, i was amazed by how close it can shave; it is nearly as good as razor blades.</li>
            <li>My first Panasonic lasted 15 years ,, this one feels just as good,  holds a charge for about 14 shaves.</li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>PRETTY GOOD TOO.</li>
            <li>Better than my last Panasonic, which was very good at the time.</li>
            <li>The new Panasonic Wet/Dry shaver works great in and out of the shower.</li>
            <li>Even dry with a bit of beard the shaver was GREAT!  </li>
            <li>This one works much better providing a closer and more comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean &amp;</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to clean using the procedure outlined in the manual.  </li>
            <li>I consider this charger absolutely perfect as I cannot fine a single fault in it and gladly give 5 stars to it.</li>
            <li>If possible, it&#x27;s best to let the battery run all the way down and then recharge it fully to get the best charge capacity.  </li>
            <li>The new swivel head is very nice and the charge lasts for weeks.</li>
            <li>I have tried different products, trimmer etc and by far this is the greatest investment I have ever done; I&#x27;m like super happy, completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>The female razors didn&#x27;t have very good reviews</li>
            <li>I have found that foamed soap, or electric razor pre-shave product (like Williams &amp;#34;Lectric Shave&amp;#34;), used before a shower, to be the most effective shaving method with this shaver.</li>
            <li>I have the Panasonic 8243 also and find it shaves more comfortably and closer than this one.  </li>
            <li>i bought this shaver to replace my old panasonic ,which did a great job, but the battery was to the point</li>
            <li>is my first Electric shaver and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>, it also works smoothly and efficiently, but there&#x27;s no question that the Panasonic gives a closer shave, and includes much better features.  </li>
            <li>Great shaver replacing my old one.</li>
            <li>also use it wet and have been very happy with it</li>
            <li>can be back at full charge  Very happy with it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lighter in weight, and more comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic shaver, keeps a charge for many shaves.  </li>
            <li>The flexible pivoting head allows for a more precise shave around the contours of your face.</li>
            <li>I found that none of them performed any better than the others, so I ended up keeping a cheap model.</li>
            <li>It is also great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>13 years only one blade, incredible.</li>
            <li>There are two primary reasons that I simply love this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, this is a great razor for high-school/college age guys with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it wet or with shaving cream, so I cannot comment on performance in that scenario; but I suspect it would be superb.</li>
            <li>Electric shavers aren&#x27;t going to replace manual ones any time soon, but if you are looking for one, my experience over 6 weeks as far as the durability, battery life and shaving experience of this one are great.  </li>
            <li>This used to work great on my old shaver</li>
            <li>This shaver is gentle and gives a good, close shave.</li>
            <li>this is also quite reasonable given the costs of good disposable razors in Australia).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- battery lasts a good ~8 shaves; charges extremely fast</li>
            <li>Brauns used to be good with this, not so much lately.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This looked like a good choice thanks to all the reviews.</li>
            <li>very impressed with panasonic in general, and this one gets it right.  </li>
            <li>For me, it was an eye-opener, because I was actually able to shave more quickly, and without any irritation.</li>
            <li>Right off the bat, I liked the look of the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It cleans easily and charges very quickly.</li>
            <li>For many years I used a couple of different Remington Microscreen razors and was happy with them.</li>

            <li>It charges very quickly, perhaps an hour</li>
            <li>I had an opportunity to test this Panasonic ES-LT41-K, and while it doesn&#x27;t compare to the Panasonic ES-LA63-S, it easily beats both the Philips Norelco and Panasonic ES8043SC in performance.  </li>
            <li>Easy to take apart to clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>easy to use and clean, affordable, but more noisy than philips</li>
            <li>Recharges very quickly.  </li>
            <li>The comb cutter with the slots gets those pesky throat hairs, or makes a shaveless weekend easy shaving Monday morning.  </li>
            <li>Not so easy getting at the cross-growing hairs with an electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, it&#x27;s not as easy as it could be.to connect and charge.  </li>
            <li>My 5 O&#x27;clock shadow phase is now officially over.t or dry.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to rinse off and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, it&#x27;s not as easy as it could be.to connect and charge.  </li>
            <li>This has been a great replacement for my old Braun and a huge improvement over the Norelco I tried.  </li>
            <li>The foil dents easily</li>
            <li>It comes apart easily, and also has a cleaning setting which does help.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely the best shaver I have had by far.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, plastic quality.</li>
            <li>Well made and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning under the water is easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning is easy.</li>
            <li>If I used it with soap or shaving cream I&#x27;d probably want to clean more often to avoid scummy build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cleaning is easy.</li>
            <li>Cleans easily, charges in about an hour and battery lasts for about a 8 to 10 shaves.</li>
            <li>is easy and battery life seems generous.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Cleans easily and has pivoting head.</li>

            <li>Easy to carry.</li>
            <li>Love that you can clean it with water.</li>
            <li>My husband is finally able to get a clean shave with an electric razor.</li>
            <li>I get cuts easily and shaving used to be a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the feature where it reminds you when to clean.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning is easy -</li>
            <li>It cleans as easily as promised.  </li>
            <li>I did not think the shave was as good as my previous Panasonic electric, not horrible, but not as good.</li>
            <li>The razor worked fairly well, gave a decent shave.</li>
            <li>the owners manual, the creators have a strong clam that the user won&#x27;t have the desire to shave with anything else, if used for a minimum of 30 days.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s just as good as what I was doing with a blade, but far more convenient.  </li>
            <li>After my old Braun gave up I decided to try this unit because of so many good things I read about it.</li>
            <li>I used an older version of this shaver for 5 or 6 years and loved it.</li>
            <li>Mainly electric razor good.</li>
            <li>High quality shaver, but is maybe too good for my skin.</li>
            <li>Light and let me have a clean shaving !</li>
            <li>If they improved this it would be a pretty amazing device.  </li>
            <li>shaver has a very \\&quot;cool\\&quot; look, but more importantly, it has some nice features.</li>
            <li>Rinse the foil separately under cool water, shake to remove most of the moisture and</li>
            <li>Nice touch is I&#x27;m in the comfort of a hot shower.</li>
            <li>Cool running and performed much better than Norelco rotary shaver.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for an electric shaver to be as good (or better) than a triple (or more) blade shaver, it&#x27;s just not possible.  </li>
            <li>The shaving head has the option for you to lock it in place or let it follow the contours of your face and the ability to do both really provides a good, clean shave.  </li>
            <li>great, thanks very much.</li>
            <li>New to electric razors, works good.</li>
            <li>The LCD is simply fabulous and easy to read.  </li>
            <li>in all it works fine.  </li>
            <li>This is a fine product for the money.</li>
            <li>It does a fine job on my teensy chin hairs and post menopausal mustache, and in a pinch it can do your legs or arms.  </li>
            <li>I like the easy cleaning and the smooth skin</li>
            <li>This one shaves very quickly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li>This thing deals with the three-day stubble just fine, including my neck.  </li>
            <li>(Doesn&#x27;t make it any less of an awesome shaver though!).</li>
            <li>This razor charges quick!  </li>
            <li>Super!  </li>
            <li>He was happy to get it as he is handicapped and needs a good electric razor for his very heavy beard.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to operate without reading the manual, cleans up beautifully with a little liquid soap and water, and retains it&#x27;s charge just fine.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product that performs flawlessly with precision gently shaving with unbelievable closeness unlike the many like assorted products I&#x27;ve used over the years.</li>
            <li>Works great in the shower and great the old fashion dry way.</li>
            <li>It is also very easy to clean after every shave and the battery is good for 10 to 12 sessions before it actually tells you to insert the charger.  </li>
            <li>They take more than one pass because they easily bend away -- but my old Norelco rotary took many more to get them.  </li>
            <li>It will take a little time to figure out how to best use a given electric</li>
            <li>The trimmer is excellent it helps in spots that you want a little closer.  </li>
            <li>It is a little noisy, but it is one of the best razors I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li>Yes, it takes some time to get used to; and yes it is very good if wet shaving.  </li>
            <li>He likes it because it works really fast and his skin is nice and smooth when done</li>
            <li>Near perfect so far.</li>
            <li>tried wet cut, but i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charges</li>
            <li>This by far has been the best shaver i have owned thus far.</li>
            <li>Being able to use it wet or with soap or shaving cream is great.  </li>
            <li>Light weight, battery lasts well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Well designed, light and fits the hand, extremely easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It seems that within one day you would have to shave again to keep it smooth.</li>
            <li>but it does a great job with my coarse hair and her almost invisible peach fuzz on her arms</li>
            <li>Avery smooth close to the skin shave.</li>
            <li>Easy clean up, no costly add on alcohol bath required.</li>

            <li>The shave is smooth, with no burn.</li>
            <li>Sound level was measured at 2 inches from shaver head.</li>
            <li>More economical as well</li>
            <li>It really does offer a lot of nice features.  </li>
            <li>I really want nice things in my life.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- extremely easy to clean (no need to buy those auto-cleaners)</li>
            <li>Although I do use my bladed razor to finish up against the grain, it gets so close even the bladed razor is smooth.</li>
            <li>Gives me a smooth and close shave</li>
            <li>Otherwise, fantastic model from Panasonic and I would recommend it with all my heart.</li>

            <li>Cheap replacement blades ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It comes out of the dispenser as a light foam, but virtually disappears when applied to the face.</li>
            <li>I have had three different Panasonics for review now and each has turned out to be a joy,</li>
            <li>Power tools are top notch, pricey but worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The feaures in the ES-LT41-K fit my intended usage.  </li>
            <li>Close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>It primarily shows the battery and cleaning status.  </li>
            <li>for experience while shaving, keep in mind that personal preferences vary greatly.  </li>

            <li>This is also easy to clean as the manual says to run it under water after applying liquid soap.  </li>
            <li>my face doesn&#x27;t stay smooth all day after using a blade.</li>
            <li>and I like how easy it is to clean.</li>
            <li>This is a well made and easy to clean razor.</li>
            <li>but this razer was great for a year until it simply wouldnt turn on.</li>
            <li>The lockable power button and secure shaver head cap make travel</li>
            <li>The free carrying case is the cheapest thing I have seen.  </li>
            <li>The one thing I have to say is that it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Cheap replacement parts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>The razor shaves close and is easy to clean up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d probably be thrilled spitless if the head was straight.  </li>
            <li>he says how fantastic a product this is.</li>
            <li>I rated a 4 because: It takes me about 4+ minutes per shave because I like a really smooth finish.  </li>
            <li>After using a razor for months, my skin was smooth, but it had somewhat of an irritated look on my neck area.</li>
            <li>Some people have commented about the sound of the razor.  </li>
            <li>The sound, however, is not annoying and within a week, you won&#x27;t even notice it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It cuts close, doesn&#x27;t pull the hair, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the 2nd one I&#x27;ve owned and works great in the shower.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, clean and charge.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>I would say 99% as smooth as razor</li>

            <li>They had 4 or even 5 blade models available too, but the cost difference didn&#x27;t make sense to me.</li>
            <li>It feels substantial yet comfortable in your hand.</li>
            <li>The charge lasts for 8-10 days (3-4 minutes/shave); this is fabulous.</li>

            <li>One plus over the cheap Remington, the cutoff beard pieces stay inside the Panasonic head, as opposed to flying all over the bathroom sink and vanity as they did with the Remingtons.</li>
            <li>and it worked fantastic.</li>
            <li>Also easy to clean.</li>

            <li>Plus, the Panasonics are easy to clean with&lt;br /&gt;plain</li>

            <li>hope its lifespan is many, many years, because I really do like this razor.  </li>
            <li>Far superior to the remington it replaced.</li>
            <li>This tells me that the shaver is good for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This tells me that the shaver is good for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Good upgrade from my 7 year old norelco.</li>
            <li>It boggles my mind that anyone would spend any more money than this on a shaver when this one does such a good job.  </li>
            <li>so far so good.  </li>
            <li>But, so far, so good</li>
            <li>It takes some patience to get used to going over same areas again and again for perfect smoothness, and doing the chin is really demanding.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve given it 2 months and so far so good.  </li>
            <li>I am very glad I opted for the new razor instead.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband who has been through a lot of electric shavers, so far he&#x27;s had this one about a yr and still loves it, charges fast and gives good shave!</li>
            <li>My dad absolutely loves it!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve owned several Braun razors for about 10 years now, and LOVE this panasonic compared to them!!...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaver!!!!</li>
            <li>Quiet performance and holds the charge very nicely.</li>
            <li>but this was a very useful feature when you want to take it traveling</li>
            <li>Extremely quiet, but very effective.  </li>
            <li>It is also easy to clean and keep clean without the use of oils or a brush.</li>
            <li>The only problem he has had is cleaning the blades, but once he understood it could be washed clean, he was happy.</li>
            <li>The price is right, works perfectly for my legs and unwanted hairs on some other areas of your body.</li>
            <li>Second, for the closeness of the shave, it does a very good job; again, better than my Remington was with new blades.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fit my face and clean any part of my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found this shaver to be very easy to use and it cuts very well.  </li>
            <li>It gives a nice, smooth, comfortable shave and is the most quiet electric shaver I have used.  </li>
            <li>After going through many electric razors in the $30 to $100 range, I have now found a new favorite, and it&#x27;s not even a rotary!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is also easy to clean and quick to charge.  </li>
            <li>What I like it charges fast and is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean, does a great job, charges quickly, and the blades and foil are supposed to go a fairly long time before needing replacement.    </li>
            <li>Just took my first shave with it and find it gives a MUCH better shave than the Phillips had.</li>
            <li>I purchased this razor to replace a 10 year old panasonic shaver and I am very glad I did.  </li>
            <li>After 2 months its working great and battery life is surprisingly long.</li>
            <li>This razor while nice for keeping my beard under control with daily shavings isn&#x27;t meant for much more then light stubble.  </li>
            <li>Love how all tech related products are getting better and cheaper!</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve settled on Panasonic as my favored brand over Braun and Norelco long ago).</li>
            <li>As for the cleaning stand, I use mine mostly for charging and rarely for cleaning because simply cleaning the razor with soap and water is faster, cheaper, quieter, and just as good (</li>
            <li>My first shaver from HITACHI was phenomenal.</li>
            <li>This will condition the battery and extend its like significantly.</li>
            <li>To me, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>; First the feel of the shaver has been improved through the addition of a more textured plastic material.</li>
            <li>At first, the readout started going wacky (just like my Panasonic es8109).</li>
            <li>dropped a star from the original review.</li>
            <li>dropped a star from the original review.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not really disappointed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as smooth a shave as the Braun, but it&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li>So far, very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Great Battery life, close shave, waterproof, easy to clean, and minimal irritation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very good for those \\&quot;unmentionable\\&quot; areas, both on myself and my fiance, who agrees that it causes less irritation than a razor.    </li>
            <li>This would be fine if used only for sideburns, but not so good to make a clean continuous line defining the neck beard.</li>
            <li>(when you use it for 3 minutes at a time).v&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**It indicates power reserve in 10% increments as well as when to clean and charge it.</li>
            <li>I had forgotten how much simpler and quicker and more comfortable shaving can be.</li>
            <li>TO CLEAN:  </li>
            <li>It has an indicator for when it needs cleaning, though I don&#x27;t rely on that as I clean it after each use.  </li>
            <li>Good hand-held fit design.</li>
            <li>Once per week or per recharge, add liquid/gel anti-bacterial soap to the foil while it is installed over the blades and turn on the shaver to help lather up the soap and clean the metal surfaces.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get the top done faster and easier than with my old electrics or a blade.  </li>
            <li>The most important is really close shave.</li>
            <li>It is a clean cut.</li>
            <li>&gt; Clean up</li>
            <li>My 15-year old Norelco (similar to [[ASIN:B001AJ6YS2 this model - Norelco 7310]] does a superb job in 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Shave it clean.</li>
            <li>This is perfect especially since it&#x27;s a wet - dry which I think is the best of both worlds.</li>
            <li>Soap and water will clean this razor, no need for chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Cuts clean.</li>
            <li>Even as a dry shaver it does a great job.</li>
            <li>For the clean cut look this is a must.</li>
            <li>A quick and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I figured I would try some kind of electric razor, so I could get a good shave, everyday.</li>
            <li>Was hoping for more from all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I went with the Panasonic based on so many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the Panasonic ES-LT41-K shaver after reading many positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It went smooth from the very first use.</li>
            <li>But since then, it hasn&#x27;t done that great a job, leaving neck hairs and actually chafing the skin right under my chin.</li>
            <li>and this is the first time I&#x27;ve noticed a less than perfect shave.</li>
            <li>It gives a very fine shave with one day and two day old beards, and is easy to keep clean without the bells and whistles of</li>
            <li>I really like how well it does shave and is very comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>After owning this shaver for a whole year, it is still gives me a very comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>After owning this shaver for a whole year, it is still gives me a very comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>To do that, you apply some liquid hand soap and water to the outer foil (while it&#x27;s on the shaver), and press the power switch for more than 2 seconds, which activates the sonic cleaning mode (you hear a high-pitch sound as the blades vibrate super fast).</li>
            <li>The pivoting head and special cleaning mode don&#x27;t do anything for me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This shaver works so much better than my older one!</li>
            <li>Upgraded from a Philips Norelco Powertouch with Aquatec that I had been happy with, but the charging port on the razor gave out on me in roughly 14 months of us.</li>
            <li>This razor offers an amazingly close shave without chafing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He said it cut beautifully, whether he had a light beard or a heavy mustache.</li>
            <li>A great advantage is the presence of wet shaving.</li>
            <li>I like the cleaning options with soap as well.shave is good enough for me</li>
            <li>My father said, he never used such a good shaver.</li>
            <li>is simple, which has helped to keep the blades in good shape.</li>
            <li>It works well and has a good, solid build.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought the basic drugstore $25-$40 type electric razors, none of which were good.</li>
            <li>You will never get the same close shave with an electric as you so with a blade, but you also won&#x27;t get razor burn, which is a fair trade for</li>
            <li>If this is true for you, you might consider trying the Alba Botanica Moisturizing Foam Shave.</li>
            <li>The shave head has a good size to it that allows for a quicker shave and comes with your standard head lock feature.  </li>
            <li>Overall I think it was a good buy.</li>
            <li>This makes it much quieter, more of a hum than growl.</li>
            <li>Shave is very close and price is better than I would have thought.</li>
            <li>It holds a charge for a full two weeks.  </li>
            <li>The razor does a good job of cleaning up all hair above the chin line, but once you get below that, its like trying to shave a gorilla with a disposable razor.</li>
            <li>Full 14 shaves on a charge.</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise the Panasonic works much better for me.</li>
            <li>Then pass the blade portion of the shaver under cool tap water until the shavings are rinsed off.  </li>
            <li>Remove the foil and rinse the foil and blades separately under cool tap water.  </li>
            <li>Wet/Dry function is a nice option for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I think it is good enough for you.</li>
            <li>And we just charge it for 1 hr that already full battery .</li>
            <li>This one got such good reviews</li>
            <li>The reviews we read were true.  </li>
            <li>This thing is just really a work of art more than a razor.</li>
            <li>For a more intense cleaning, you can use the Sonic Vibration Mode.</li>
            <li>Holds a full week charge, and recharges in about an hour.</li>
            <li>I really dislike shaving, a lot, but I look better when I&#x27;ve shaved</li>
            <li>it holds up as good as my Brauns, I&#x27;ll be back!!!!....</li>
            <li>so good enough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll write a full review of the Norelco at that</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll write a full review of the Norelco at that</li>
            <li>If it were to break today, I would not hesitate to buy another one immediately -- even if I had to pay full price.  </li>
            <li>I can do a quick clean up before going out or before bed</li>
            <li>My criticisms are just that it&#x27;s not the closest shave in the world, and I&#x27;d really rather that it just plugged in rather than running off a battery, the battery is just something that will have to be replaced eventually, and I always use it where there&#x27;s a mirror (and places to plug it in), Most models do seem to be battery based</li>
            <li>I was getting tied of my old 10+year old Norelcos and wanted to give this a shot, since it had so many good reviews.  </li>
            <li>Good shaves, and I know when the charge is running low.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve dropped it multiple times from a good 4 feet</li>
            <li>Love the battery recharge meter and fast recharge.</li>
            <li>It provides a smooth shave and is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>but Amazon had such a good price that I thought I would try it.  </li>
            <li>the plus side, battery life is good enough and it recharges quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad at all though.</li>
            <li>it doess the job and is easy to charge and holds a charge longer than most shaver do and my man is has no trouble using it</li>
            <li>Luckily, the main shaver head actually does a good job there!</li>
            <li>, is very easy to use, has a meter to show how much charge is left and has a nice head to contour around your face.  </li>
            <li>* Shaving in wet mode is a very nice feature (plus, you can rinse it in water, making cleaning</li>
            <li>It shaves very clean and fast.</li>
            <li>Panasonic gives me the closest shave I&#x27;ve experienced, around ALL areas of the face and neck, and with no burn, snags, or other problems.</li>
            <li>Well, I pulled the trigger on this Panasonic and figured I&#x27;d use it for one full month to be able to really see if it was worth it or</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much after the Braun which has a pretty good reputation.</li>
            <li>He was so happy when his other shaver died so he could purchase this one.</li>
            <li>It will get a good amount, but because of the flat hairs, I still have to give a quick swipe with a blade razor, depending on length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing product to own if you find yourself trimming everyday.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the tradeoff, though I do usually clean up with a razor to catch hairs and stubble</li>
            <li>charge indicator is a HUGE plus, it&#x27;s nice knowing when you&#x27;ve got 10% left!</li>
            <li>I get about 5 or 6 shaves between charges, and found that it recharges fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>I ordered another different model, same company and that one is excellent.</li>
            <li>Quick charging (0% to 100% in 30 minutes)&lt;br</li>
            <li>&quot; me from shower shaving; now I can just grab it and get a quick shave anytime</li>
            <li>quick charge</li>
            <li>Again, quick and easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>have the same basic shape and ergonomics - excellent in my opinion.</li>
            <li>The razor has some nice features and ergonomics, but for the price I expected a better shave.  </li>
            <li>i like this razor cause it is does its job quickly</li>
            <li>I have a heavy beard and have sported a goatee for more than 20 years which requires a good trimmer to maintain.  </li>
            <li>The battery life performs as advertised requiring the razor to be charged once a week, I have not had to depend on the quick charge feature yet</li>
            <li>Smooth, comfortable, and fast shave.</li>
            <li>It cuts very well, is flexible and easy to clean with water.  </li>
            <li>Quick close shave.</li>
            <li>Better than his older one.</li>
            <li>The charger recharges the battery quickly in 1 hour</li>
            <li>Recharging goes quickly.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean, and gets really close.  </li>
            <li>However, there were some mild skin irritation after the shave.</li>
            <li>This shaver has been very well designed to shave well, clean easily, and maintain.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through more than one Braun, more than one Norelco, and I&#x27;m on my second Panasonic.</li>
            <li>Battery charges quickly and lasts about a week between charges.</li>
            <li>Works well, no bells and whistles but does adequate job for the money.</li>
            <li>It charges quickly.</li>
            <li>This razor isn&#x27;t for someone looking for a quick shave.</li>
            <li>Gave me a nice smooth feeling without the irritation and rawness of a regular razor.</li>
            <li>This replaced an earlier model of the same shaver that I was very happy with.</li>
            <li>So if your looking to make the switch from blades, which are increasingly more expensive over time, this razor is among the best.</li>
            <li>Holds a charge as well as recharging quickly.</li>
            <li>Cleaning is quick and effortless.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always stuck with the Norelco rotary razors, because I could never find a foil razor that would adequately cut the hair on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like how it works and how easy it is to clean and handle.</li>
            <li>I can quick shave in 5 minutes at 5pm before going out.  </li>
            <li>Well designed and constructed and recharges quickly.</li>
            <li>Charges quickly.  </li>
            <li>The very first shave convinced me.  </li>
            <li>Particularly good price/quality value in comparison to other available shavers.</li>
            <li>First off, I&#x27;m a woman, so this may be a fantastic product for men.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The light weight worried me at first</li>
            <li>People have also noticed the difference in how smooth my skin is, since I have been consistently using this shaver.</li>
            <li>People have also noticed the difference in how smooth my skin is, since I have been consistently using this shaver.</li>
            <li>We have tried other electric razors, but this one is by far the best!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other Panasonic razors but this is the best so far.  </li>
            <li>While it does not give me the same results as a razor does, I am very pleased with the job that it does.</li>
            <li>have used the shaver several times since I purchased it and have been very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>It also charges very fast and shows the percentage of remaining charge, which is very useful and convenient.</li>
            <li>and I find it seems sharper after doing a cleaning - the higher pitched clicking sound of hairs being cut seems restored after cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now I wish that I had not struggled so long trying to get a good shave with my Phillips Norelco rotary blade shaver.  </li>
            <li>Shaving is good as long as your skin gets accustomed to it</li>
            <li>shaver has  such a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li>He said it really works well.&lt;br /&gt;Shave quick, easy and evenly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind shaving as much anymore, quick and easy.</li>
            <li>The only thing I liked better on my former Braun was the pop up trimmer is much better on the Braun.  </li>
            <li>My husband is enjoying &amp;#34;getting to know&amp;#34; his new razor.  </li>
            <li>It has a good looking no nonsense led readout that lets you know how much battery charge is left and also reminds you to clean it when it&#x27;s time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy, much quieter</li>
            <li>The price is very affordable, easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is my sons first razor, so I wanted something simple and with a good review.</li>
            <li>last pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this new purchase and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This is not only cheaper, but it does a better job of shaving for me!  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take longer than the first shave for me to be sold on it!  </li>
            <li>This is my fourth or fifth Panasonic razor - there just isn&#x27;t anything better!</li>
            <li>I tried different combinations (after a shower, in the shower etc) but it seemed to work best when your face is dry</li>
            <li>The shaver-head lock, power-button lock, and LCD display features are nice upgrades that you typically pay more for with Braun shavers and it includes a protective plastic foil-cover and a storage bag for travel.</li>
            <li>: does not shave as rapidly as two older models I have; cannot operate when plugged in - my Norelco, and older Panasonic models will do so &amp; it&#x27;s handy if battery is discharged.</li>
            <li>He gets several shaves from one charging and it&#x27;s very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Any way, I am really happy so far and can see it&#x27;s going to make my shaving live so much easier.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Any way, I am really happy so far and can see it&#x27;s going to make my shaving live so much easier.</li>
            <li>The shave is great, i only use it dry, but love that i can run it under water for cleaning afterwards.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts at least a week of good use and charges rapidly (less than an hour).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a lock on the power button which is perfect since I travel a lot.</li>
            <li>to clean - run it under hot water &amp; in about 15 seconds</li>
            <li>My favorite way of shaving is to use William&#x27;s &#x27;Lectric Shave before shaving, which provides nice lubrication without the mess of shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Pro&#x27;s:  easy to clean; not excessively noisy; recharges rapidly&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li>I eventually just used hot soap and water to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Panasonic is a nice sized product, but the battery life and the quality of the shave are not as good as I&#x27;ve had in the past with much older Braun and Norelco products.  </li>
            <li>Besides , this shaver outlooks is very modern , pretty and light .</li>
            <li>It just does a great job on a wet face!!!</li>
            <li>So much quieter and smooth.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic has performed very well in this situation, in fact it is as comfortable as the Braun and gets the job done in</li>
            <li>I got a fast, smooth, close shave.</li>
            <li>Tone of the shaver is not tuned as well as the Braun (no joke they tune the sound of the motor to be pleasing) who cares really</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard and have had a great experience using this with Williams Lectric Shave as well as shaving cream in the shower.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve been using mine almost everyday for 8 months now and the razor still feels great.  </li>
            <li>Of all the Panasonic lasted the longest, in 2005 I got a ES8077 for Christmas and after a few foil and head replacements, it still worked great, eventually though it started showing it&#x27;s wear and battery life diminished, the flip out trimmer broke</li>
            <li>close smooth shaves....and fast</li>
            <li>It was painless and reasonably fast, and almost perfectly smooth.</li>
            <li>He has used it a few times now and is extremely happy.</li>
            <li>The power meter is well worth it</li>
            <li>but I rarely use it.  </li>
            <li>I think that this is because my face is oval, not round, so the narrower head works better for me.</li>
            <li>I love it so far.  </li>
            <li>Update: just tried a wet shave with Body Shop shaving cream, and it gives an even closer shave, close enough to blades, without the cuts; very impressive.</li>
            <li>But then again, a shaver can be a lot more comfortable to use, especially on your lip and chin (where it can feel like your beard is being pulled out, rather than cut, with a razor).  </li>
            <li>Some may find it useful, but to me the cleaning station seems like a holdover from the days of harder-to-clean models.  </li>

            <li>Another point with foil versus rotary head razors is irritation, which I infrequently experience but some friends experience at a far greater rate.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;Oh, and as far as body hair----it does ok on the chest.....I still prefer to use a blade for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>hope this review helps, especially since I do not write too many, but I was asked to rate this by Amazon.due to the razor since I know my face doesn&#x27;t stay smooth all day after using a blade.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Oh, and as far as body hair----it does ok on the chest.....I still prefer to use a blade for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This model is noticably lighter and more efficient than our old model.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer at the back can be extended and used as an effective hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>However, this Panasonic gives a far better shave than the Braun ever did.</li>
            <li>I dont think this product is worth the money.</li>
            <li>The last three razors I have purchased were Remington foil style and have always liked the shave.  </li>
            <li>Braun was much better but it still burned in sensitive areas of my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised and pleased with the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>Overall, fast motor, keeps a great charge and able to place under water for rinsing which I only do once in awhile.</li>
            <li>My 96 year old father has used many razors over his 75+ years of shaving.  </li>
            <li>The feel in your hand allows you to mention a really good grip even if hands are wet.</li>
            <li>Hope this helps some one if you are on the fence about which model to get this might really be worth a try for you.</li>
            <li>This was a far better value and shaver than I ever imagined.  </li>
            <li>Either way, a smooth and comfortable shave will be the aftermath of complete use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most important of all, it produces similar shaving results as razor blade.</li>
            <li>Better shave than my old Norelco rotary.</li>
            <li>It is a bit noisy, but it&#x27;s just a different kind of pitch for a shaver.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t have as many passes to clear your face and</li>
            <li>Whether or not this is worth a price point</li>
            <li>Even at 100% charge I find I&#x27;m going over the same places too many times to get a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>so much better than my old remington 5300</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Shaves closely, no irritation, powerful, and fast.&lt;br /&gt;Convenient charge level indicator....</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Works as described and is worth</li>
            <li>I liked it enough that I almost bought another Braun but thought I would take a chance on the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>think that the Panasonic was worth the price paid.</li>
            <li>it would be cheaper than a year&#x27;s worth of Gilette razor cartridges ($3 per week</li>
            <li>I think this is pretty true.  </li>
            <li>I said not only is this so much quieter, but I get as good a shave as a razor, but without the razor burn.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that this shaver does not come with is a case which would be nice to use if you travel.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping to reduce the shave time, but I really feel it&#x27;s as good as it can get even with using a regular razor and dealing with the cuts and razor bumps.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping to reduce the shave time, but I really feel it&#x27;s as good as it can get even with using a regular razor and dealing with the cuts and razor bumps.  </li>
            <li>It has a real sturdy, well built feel,and I really like being able to use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I liked - travel lock on off/on switch and digital readout on charge.</li>
            <li>Charges in about 45 minutes which is better than the old shaver.</li>
            <li>The feel and closeness is much better than my old razor.</li>
            <li>and I like it even more than my old one.</li>
            <li>I am very well pleased and the price was quite reasonable also.</li>
            <li>The clean up is so easy - hold under water flow - no messy mini brush.</li>
            <li>and I have had lot of shavers during my life, but I have never had such a nice one.</li>
            <li>I had the 8096 model for 8 years which I liked (it was 3 times the price even back then).  </li>
            <li>I stayed with panasonic as he really liked his last one</li>
            <li>Besides the closer shave (the sine non quo of shaving), the Panasonic is much easier to clean, and is moreforgiving of user error (I accidently broke the head of the Philips when trying to clean it for the first time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shaving is excellent - close with very minimal irritation and it does even better if you have a little soap on your face.</li>
            <li>my old razor is shot...came at the right time for sure...</li>
            <li>The price was right and the shave is much better than my old Braun.</li>
            <li>This is a nice shaver, I should point out that the razor only goes into a horezontal position, not the up right that I am used too.</li>
            <li>The unit has a special high speed mode thatis supposed to make it easier to clean under the faucet.</li>
            <li>Great close shave, Super features Wet or Dry, Easy to clean, +</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; shave is an added bonus for that extra clean shave, but shaving dry gets the job done almost as good!</li>
            <li>Norelco was fine until years later when my skin started becoming more sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I bought this one with the thought that I was just going to use the trimmer as well, but was pleasantly surprised to find it very effective overall.</li>
            <li>I switched to a Braun 3 Series, highly recommended by a large consumer test organization, hoping the system would hold together better.</li>
            <li>For the price this is a great shaver, the trimmer works great, a little odd on the angle but cuts really well.  </li>
            <li>I have to go over the same area many times to get a clean shave&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can take the head off quickly and wash off the blades, it&#x27;s a fast cutter and shaves you quickly.</li>
            <li>I follow instructions precisely and clean it each time with soft soap under water.</li>
            <li>It is perfect the main reason I bought it was because its hypoallergenic one complaint</li>
            <li>If you are mainly looking for the shaver and not the part in the back that comes up, then this should be good.</li>
            <li>The first and only product that has ever been able to provide me with a close and comfortable share has been the Panasonic foil shavers.</li>
            <li>There are times when Amazon offers those at prices that beat the current, as of this writing new price, and then they are no-brainers, but I wouldn&#x27;t spend more than this on a razor knowing how good this one is.</li>
            <li>before finding Panasonic, a razor brand I&#x27;d seen but passed over because, well, they&#x27;re the company that makes radios, not razors, right?  </li>
            <li>I had a three day growth and this thing right out of the box after charged.</li>
            <li>I had no problems with the shape around my ears right below the jaw line.</li>
            <li>this right</li>
            <li>If I shave in the shower or right after than I don&#x27;t even need any pre-shave product.  </li>
            <li>just right it can nick you.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic is superior to any other electric razor I&#x27;ve used over the years, which includes most major brands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a number of electric shavers in the past years but this has to be the best so far.</li>
            <li>It is SO MUCH easier to clean than my rotary shaver.  </li>
            <li>When I just want something fast and clean I will use this.  </li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t experience any pulling sensation on his beard and got a very close, clean shave.</li>
            <li>I have very strong facial hair</li>
            <li>But with a little bit of patience, you can get a remarkably close shave with this</li>
            <li>I would be cool with some shadow after I was done, but everything above my neck line is smooth, while my neck still has hairs significantly</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t shave against the grain because my skin gets highly irritated when I do that, so I&#x27;ve never had ultra-turbo-close shaves, but plenty smooth.  </li>
            <li>I should note that he isn&#x27;t super hairy, and I don&#x27;t know how it would compare to someone that grew thick facial hair, but for trimming and keeping the face clean it is top-notch.</li>
            <li>I recently upgraded to the newer ES-LT41K to try something new - I was debating whether to buy another 8103, which I have very much loved.</li>
            <li>This is one of the better ones; he especially likes that it shaves quickly.</li>
            <li>yes i can shave dry and fast and its a good shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is the best electric I have used for cutting hair on the back of my neck, and it  does a good job on those stray hairs forward of my bald spot that now seem out of place.</li>
            <li>The Norelco design just fits my face much better overall and provides a more natural hand grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great that it can be made rigid for those who might prefer it that way (though I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li>One cannot just fly over the whiskers like an ordinary razor.  </li>
            <li>The included travel switch seemed useful at first</li>
            <li>Nice cut, charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Stays charged for a long time and has a handy trimmer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d used previously, much less skin irritation, quick recharge time, very easy to clean, helpful % of charge remaining indicator, selectable floating or locked shave head, wet/dry shave option and lockable power button</li>
            <li>I find that the shave feels immediately the same - incredibly close, basically like using one of the better (multi-blade) disposable razors but doesn&#x27;t last as long.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The one hour charge feature, which is faster by far than most of its competitors (including other Panasonic electric shavers), is another nice plus.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I tried it at a right angle as per instructions.</li>
            <li>The fast, linear motor ensures a quick cut, eliminating pulling, tugging and irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>sum up, battery life isn&#x27;t good, and it doesn&#x27;t shave as close or as well as my previous Panasonic shavers.</li>
            <li>The motor is strong, not too loud, and dependable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast, free shipping from Amazon plus the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s marked which side is up, but not so easy to see with my eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s marked which side is up, but not so easy to see with my eyes.</li>
            <li>It is far superior to the last Braun that I had.</li>
            <li>Digital display and easy to clean with soap and water.</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace my beloved 13 year old Braun 6000 series (which was still working, but battery was finally dying).  </li>
            <li>and I can get more than several days worth of shaves.</li>
            <li>Reasonably quiet &amp; easy to clean.</li>
            <li>razor seems vastly superior to all foils I&#x27;ve used previously.</li>
            <li>I have to go every which way about 20 times to get 80% of the hairs, 20 % do not come out no matter what I do unless I resort to my old razor and that simply isn&#x27;t good enough.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and wanted to replace my ageing Norelco Smooth Skin razor.</li>
            <li>My first shave with this razor was great, felt smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind.</li>
            <li>He is thrilled with this gift and his handsome face has no more cuts!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s seriously *almost* as good as a blade shave at this point, which is amazing to me, since previously I have never been able to get a truly close shave from an electric.&lt;br</li>
            <li>- Price if purchased from Amazon is *very* reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning the razor is amazingly easy too; as you can simply remove the foil, add soap directly to the blades, and clean the shaver in seconds, using the built in &#x27;sonic vibration cleaning mode&#x27;, which ups the CPM (cycles per minute) from 13,000 to 17,000, and will literally vibrate any debris free from the blades.</li>
            <li>products are very much alike.</li>
            <li>I like it very much</li>
            <li>Charges very fast.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say anything good about this shaver other than it will eventually do the job.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is a good fast shaver.  </li>
            <li>It still worked well before changing those items (very inexpensive and easy to change), but now that I&#x27;ve changed them, it&#x27;s like a brand spankin&#x27; new razor.  </li>
            <li>I finish off with a good splash of Witch Hazel, a little Nivea aftershave balm</li>
            <li>/&gt;**As far as closeness of the shave goes (one of the main points I look for more than anything in an electric shaver),</li>
            <li>- Cleaning is quick and easy, especially as it can be opened and run under the tap / faucet.  </li>
            <li>sweep the dry whiskers out of the blades and top foil, then give it a quick rinse under water.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this razor for a close, comfortable shave at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s has been seven months since first using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This works VERY well!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it does and the results...</li>
            <li>This is my first Panasonic (Japan/China).  </li>
            <li>The Arc 3 blade system flex and pivots to better conform to your facial contours.  </li>
            <li>I have red bumps mostly on my neck</li>
            <li>Second best is actually the Braun Total Control.</li>
            <li>The first thing that stood out about the Panasonic was the noise.</li>
            <li>I chose this shaver for the linear motor and higher rpm, and it gives me a smoother shave than mach whatever razors.</li>
            <li>First and foremost you can use it in the shower which means while I&#x27;m washing I can also be shaving.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I had to order an european plug adaptor with the shaver, because I will use it in Turkey:)</li>
            <li>razor does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and I believe it does it</li>
            <li>I had used a rotary shaver for close to 30 years and it did take me a while to adjust to this as it made my neck break out badly at first...</li>
            <li>I think that I have written more than enough!</li>
            <li>I cannot recommend this higher.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t necessarily an \\&quot;apples to apples\\&quot; comparison because the ES-LA63-S is 50% more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more thrifty price while maintaining the same shave</li>
            <li>it seems as if the head is consistently producing irritation on my skin.</li>
            <li>Decided to do some research, check reviews and such to see if I could get better results with an electric.  </li>
            <li>First time, I thought another Norelco.</li>
            <li>and I repeated the shaving so many times that I literally bled.&lt;br /&gt;After returning this shaver I bought BRAUN of same price category 70 dollars.</li>
            <li>Finally, if you are someone who lets your beard grow out at length before shaving, this razor, and most electric razors are not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Finally, if you are someone who lets your beard grow out at length before shaving, this razor, and most electric razors are not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The Braun that I used is nice but does not offer a wet-shave mode and is not easy to keep clean when traveling unless you pack (and check) the cleaning dock &amp; cleaning solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this to replace a panasonic pulsonic shaver, which is a higher end device.  </li>
            <li>/cleaning stand held together pretty well</li>
            <li>Again, purchasing the cleaning cartridges, which need to be changed about once a month, also became pretty expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, I am really glad that I made this purchase.  </li>
            <li>only because of having to go over an area more than once sometimes.  </li>
            <li>hope this review helps, especially since I do not write too many, but I was asked to rate this by Amazon.</li>
            <li>I missed the instructions to find out any more about this, but as of now I don&#x27;t get a regular razor close shave.  </li>
            <li>The first thing that caught my eye was the price.  </li>
            <li>, i didn&#x27;t give it 5 star since nothing is perfect although i cant find anything wrong with this machine yet.</li>
            <li>This one is more basic with no cleaning unit</li>
            <li>This is my first foil razor.</li>
            <li>As most folks know faces and whiskers come in various types and not all electric razors work well for all faces.</li>
            <li>for the trimmer attachement, Both the Panasonic and Braun trimmer attachments could have been made better and performed about the same.  </li>
            <li>Remove the foil then press and hold the power button for 2 seconds to activatethe  cleaning mode (higher frequency).</li>
            <li>I still use it, mostly as a wet shaver now, but still have to tidy up with a blade.</li>
            <li>This is the first time to use electric shaver.</li>
            <li>The shaver makes a relatively high-pitched noise which doesn&#x27;t seem to bother most people here but does bother me.  </li>
            <li>My first Mon</li>
            <li>and WOW, it did a fantastic job.  </li>
            <li>A blade shaves closer, but this is pretty darn close.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you will do the same.</li>
            <li>It actually trims better than my Remington trimmers.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>I was weary spending the 80 or so bucks on this, but I can see that it is a great value and will last a long time.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>Because of the 13,000 cycles-per-minute speed, the razor definitely has more of a high-pitched buzz rather than a hum.  </li>
            <li>While I love the idea of no charging/cleaning station, Panasonic needs to rethink the needs of American men.</li>
            <li>This one holds a charge better than the last 2 but still needs a recharge at 60% and below.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned other Panasonic electric razors and they work the best compared to other brands.</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s lighter in weight compared to the ES-8068.  </li>
            <li>Bought this razor for my son and he absolutely LOVES it!</li>
            <li>A few nice but modest upgrades from the ES-8103S line.feel of the shaver has been improved through the addition of a more textured plastic material.</li>
            <li>I believe it is because the razor helps with exfoliation much better than my standard loofah and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several Panasonic shavers in the past (wore them out) and this one appears to be the best I&#x27;ve used yet...</li>
            <li>A year later, and I&#x27;m still in love with this shaver, and I still haven&#x27;t needed to use a blade to \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; hairs that it&#x27;s missed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for several months, and have been pleased.</li>
            <li>I went and purchased a Panasonic for the first time as I have been a Norelco owner for over 30 years.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I have tried the Norelco type electric shavers twice in the past , and this back and forth foil type shaver has worked best for my shaving purposes.</li>
            <li>I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited 20 years to use an electric, but I&#x27;m glad I finally did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally satisfied and would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>This is the first electric razor I have ever used or owned.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Really I think the only thing I could have better for me is that I share my medicine cabinet with 3 roommates</li>
            <li>His skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I have not used an electric shaver in a number of years prior to owning this one, I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
            <li>Glad to have a Panasonic shaver back again.  </li>
            <li>The shaves aren&#x27;t as close as a blade, but it&#x27;s close enough for most purposes.</li>
            <li>Much better than the Braun that has you buying cleaning fluid.  </li>
            <li>Over the years I have used many different types and brands of electric razors.  </li>
            <li>In 7 years of marriage this is the FIRST gift I&#x27;ve given him that he uses, loves and is truly grateful for.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is MUCH better than the Norelco I had...cuts closer everywhere on my face, especially up under my nostrils, which&lt;br /&gt;has</li>
            <li>I get a close shave with no skin irritation even after the first use.</li>
            <li>It just completely fails at getting any hair that isn&#x27;t perfectly set up for it to grab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had only used Braun shavers for many years.  </li>
            <li>I finally pulled the trigger on the Arc 3 and glad I did.  </li>
            <li>also love the pop up trimmer on the back side.</li>
            <li>This is mostly just in areas with hair growing in different directions like the jaw line, neck, and Adam&#x27;s apple.</li>
            <li>first had (2) Braun electric shavers ochancever a span of approx.</li>
            <li>liquid soap and hot water.  </li>
            <li>After 5 years the time had come to replace my first Panasonic and did</li>
            <li>If this last model lasts 10 years, i am sure i will purchase another Panasonic razor to replace this one.</li>
            <li>But after a while I figured it out that this predictable unreliability is a good thing</li>
            <li>Battery charges very quickly and holds it charge well - about a week or a little more for me.  </li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s light, durable, holds a charge a long time, has a form fitting carrying case, has a \\&quot;lock\\&quot;  button to prevent the razor from turning on while in your luggage, and provides a great shave - wet or dry.</li>
            <li>Much better than my old Braun was even when the Braun was new.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning is simple and effective, you just add a couple of drops of mild handsoap to the foils and turn on under a stream of water, the razor is so fast that it immediately starts to foam up and rense clean, ready for your next shave.</li>
            <li>I noticed that with a 3-day old beard the shaver worked best with a light touch to simply trim the beard down to a more manageable length, then go over the entire area once more with a slight pressure to get the closest shave.  </li>
            <li>I previously owned 3 Panasonic electric shavers and I was very satisfied with them.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job for a quick dry shave, and it does an even closer shave as the wet option.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a very slight foam that provides good lubrication.</li>
            <li>It charges quickly, is easy to clean, and has a very convenient display to tell you how much power is left and whether it needs to be cleaned.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is not bad, only not as clean and balanced as the Norelcos.</li>
            <li>You have to repeat certain areas more than twice, especially the neck and area&lt;</li>
            <li>With this shaver, even after the first shave, I haven&#x27;t experienced any sensitivity (keep in mind that I only &#x27;wet&#x27; shave) at all.</li>
            <li>It takes a little time for your skin to adjust but it&#x27;s convenient, relatively fast and gives a good shave.</li>
            <li>As I do have to use it in more than just &#x60;detail&#x27; areas, it is useful that it is wide.  </li>
            <li>I find that you have to go over areas a few times to get the desired close shave but easy to clean and quick charging time...</li>
            <li>By far the best wet and dry shaver out there.  </li>
            <li>Only downside is like most foil shavers, if you miss a whisker 2 days straight the foil won&#x27;t pick it up.</li>
            <li>The head on the ES8228S is more complex with more moving parts but</li>
            <li>Fast to charge,  holds a charge for many shaves, cuts with fewer passes, waterproof, quiet.  </li>
            <li>I was very close to pulling the trigger on another Braun in the same price range (Series 3-530cc), but many of the reviews claim that the Braun shavers have been inconsistent with shaving &amp;#34;closeness/smoothness&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer does not have a good locking mechanism so it constantly keeps folding back onto the device when trimming.</li>
            <li>Overall I think it is a good shaver for the price, which was key for</li>
            <li>The only problem I have with it &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; is that it does not feel good on my upper lip.  </li>
            <li>Louder than any of my Norelcos, battery life could be just a bit more for my needs (barely a week, but remember I shave both face and head which takes considerably longer and so uses more battery charge), requires multiple passes for the closest shave.</li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, it works fine so far, quiet and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I&#x27;m very satisfied and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Saw all the positive reviews on this Panasonic and gave it a shot.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After reading the positive reviews for the Panasonic ES-LT41-K</li>
            <li>This is by far the best electric shaver that I have used after switching from an old-fashioned double edge safety razor a few years ago.&lt;br /&gt;None</li>
            <li>oscillations in the blade are higher than a Braun (13K vs 10K)  at a much lower price</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is easy to clean and gets a closer shave than other brands as well.</li>
            <li>It operates at a much higher vibration rate and even has a supersonic cleaning speed that works very well under running water.</li>
            <li>real question is how this compares to the higher price point 4 and 5 blade Panasonics.  </li>
            <li>I first order the Norelco PT720 electric razor from Walmart and that thing really caused my neck to rash.</li>
            <li>I do NOT wet the razor as that dilutes the gel and causes the shave to not be as smooth.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the feel too much for the first week</li>
            <li>How wonderful to be back to a shaver that is QUIET, shaves close, and does what I expected from it.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad product, however I did not see any improvement in my shaving results when compared to my old Norelco.</li>
            <li>When I purchased the new one I was right back to a quick clean shave immediately.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall though I am happy with the shaver and feel it works well and is a good replacement for my older model, whether it will beat the record of 7 years is another question?ls in my ES8077, total shave time is not much better, of course I shave every morning and find myself passing over the same areas several times to get a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>However the price of the cartridges are getting more and more ridiculous.</li>
            <li>I had also has used a 3 blade rotary Norelco previously and it did ok, but the battery died too quickly</li>
            <li>This is the best one so far, much better shaving the neck area and cutting a two day old growth.</li>
            <li>This one has 3 blades, spins at high RPMs and shows the charge level in decrements of 10,shavers with the same spec 10 years ago would cost 2-3 times more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has been about two years now and it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as it did when new, or a close as my old Norelco (but better than the new cheaper Norelco</li>
            <li>close shave, simple  to clean, priced right</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not as easy for me to flip it open as the Braun&#x27;s trimmer which is mounted on the \\&quot;thumb\\&quot; side of the razor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s loaded with USEFUL featuresm including a percent power remaining indicator, a pop-up trimmer that actually works, a lock,&lt;br /&gt;a razor head that detaches for EASY cleaning and re-attaches firmly and easily, and extremely quick recharging</li>
            <li>Watch out using the trimmer anywhere super sensitive, ie downstairs.</li>
            <li>To help dry the shaver, re-activate the cleaning mode to shake off most of the moisture.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this shaver for near 3 months, and i still get some mild skin irritation after shaving.</li>
            <li>multiple times&lt;br /&gt;- Easy cleaning without a cleaning stand</li>
            <li>Panasonic charges easily and holds the charge for several shaves.  </li>
            <li>Dry shaving performance is just ok.  </li>
            <li>Good shave, low noise, long kept charging.</li>
            <li>In general, I&#x27;d suggest spending a little more for the ES-LA63-S, which provides more closeness, and faster</li>
            <li>This replaced my Panasonic ES-SA40 single-head shaver bought 5 years ago (the single head is still better at shaving under the nose).</li>
            <li>I noticed that I have to go over a spot a couple of times, and it seems to help if I tighten my skin a bit by blowing out my cheeks while shaving certain spots.  </li>
            <li>that being said, I would certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li>Okay, I am new to electric razors, and female.</li>
            <li>There are times when Amazon offers those at prices that beat the current, as of this writing new price, and then they are no-brainers, but I wouldn&#x27;t spend more than this on a razor knowing how good this one is.able to get into the odd nooks of my neck/jawline that caused problems before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to remove the head/guard and rinse with water and in 20 seconds or less its completely clean.</li>
            <li>Charge lasts a long time and this thing has not disappointed at all!</li>
            <li>While similar in price to the old unit, this new model has one nice feature-</li>
            <li>Overall, the shave is fine.</li>
            <li>His skin is pretty sensitive and he is prone to getting red spots from other razors, but this worked great.  </li>
            <li>My hair is a little coarse and this thing just does a great job.  </li>
            <li>First I do a dry run, then after a splash of water and a pea sized amount of shaving gel I mow the lawn again, quick rinse, and swipe a moistened alcohol swab across my freshly shaved face.</li>
            <li>We both have sensitive skin and this little guy works good with out the rash.</li>
            <li>Noise wise it may be a little loud, but not irritating.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, due to the positive reviews I bought one of the Panasonic wet/dry shavers and it&#x27;s actually rather good... for an electric.  </li>
            <li>Charging is also amazing, as the shaver can be recharged in under an hour, and that charge will last through the entire week.</li>
            <li>Shaves very close and much easier than the Norelco which cost twice as much and in 6 months thrown away.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the ES-LT41-K for my current deployment and it is a huge upgrade.</li>
            <li>It is quite, runs with alot of smooth power that really does an effficient job in short order.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s only accurate to tenths - 100%, 90%, 80%, etc.).  </li>
            <li>This product runs at an amazing speed and does give you a close shave, but it is not a smooth shave and if it catches your skin</li>
            <li>but it does have a better cut when your beard is wet.  </li>
            <li>Fast, Linear Motor Drive</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a handful of electric shavers over the years, none work really well.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Hahahaha</li>
            <li>I have been using these Panasonic razors for quite some time, and they perform well, and are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s put together very well, recharges in practically no time and hold the charge well.  </li>
            <li>This shaver cuts closer and is quieter and with more features likes cleaning, shaving wet, etc.</li>
            <li>- The charging time and number of shaves seems reasonable.  </li>
            <li>- The build quality seems reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Trimmer works very well for sideburns, and around the ears.</li>
            <li>This item is not what I expected, its better off using a razor then this shaver.</li>
            <li>The Whal does really close</li>
            <li>I did&#x27;t expected that a machine can be better and closer than a three-bladed razor.</li>
            <li>It’s great on my legs, and to my surprise, isn’t irritating on my underarms—which the Close Curves was, so I couldn&#x27;t even use it there.  </li>
            <li>Both Panasonics give a close, comfortable shave however overall</li>
            <li>I really like the battery strength meter.</li>
            <li>electric gets very close to my face.</li>
            <li>I love that you can use shaving cream with it to keep it from getting too rough.</li>
            <li>No electric seems as close as a blade to me, although this one is VERY close to a blade.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a Norelco that I bought at Costco and this shaves much closer than that one.</li>
            <li>The pop out trimmer works very well</li>
            <li>I have gotten between 3 and 4 shaves per charge, and that seems reasonable.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin, and figured all that hot water would help soften my beard and make the whole process easier, although I was still getting some redness and irritation afterwards.</li>
            <li>husband thanks to me for this choice.</li>
            <li>I had to use the beard trimmer (haha), which pulled.  </li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I really like the LED battery display</li>
            <li>It missed hair so much</li>
            <li>It gives me such a close and smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Charged up fast...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been much of an electric razor fan because I&#x27;ve always felt that they didn&#x27;t provide the level of shave that I need/want.  </li>
            <li>I really like this shaver.</li>
            <li>So, if you are really looking for a close shave, I suggest trying something along the lines of [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>So, if you are really looking for a close shave, I suggest trying something along the lines of [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Recharging is very fast...impressed</li>
            <li>The Phillips has a pop-up trimmer, but it&#x27;s not part of the shaver, you have to store it until ready for use.  </li>
            <li>Very close shave.  </li>
            <li>and it still cuts smooth as silk and doesn&#x27;t require the back-and-forth effort my former shavers have required.</li>
            <li>I have found it much easier to just take a shaver brush (which really should be included)</li>
            <li>My husband thanks me every time he shaves.  </li>
            <li>No cuts, no pulled hairs (which is what I had always heard about electrics), and a really close shave.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Charges FAST.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning is much easier than the rotaries.</li>
            <li>I have been cut on my face by the middle part of the shaver head and have to go over my neck, cheek and chin area over and over again to get a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>So when that battery died and I saw that a replacement was almost as much as the razor, I switched to Panasonic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This gives a fantastic shave and it&#x27;s quiet.</li>
            <li>And this one has really micro-close shaving heads.</li>
            <li>And the battery meter is very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>see a lot of people saying they still need to use a straight edge razor once they are done with this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;About ready to return this for not providing the close shave it promises.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Norelcos really burned my face - all three models I used for years.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s reasonable sized for travel use.</li>
            <li>an electric really works well for me up</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very dinky.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t let you charge it while you&#x27;re using it, which I don&#x27;t really like.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I get a real close shave, but to get it, go vertical and then at the end go horizontal.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m used to a straight razor in my hand.  </li>
            <li>Very close shave.  </li>
            <li>I really like this razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Features: This electric shaver is very versatile.</li>
            <li>If you buy this shaver and have any reservations after using it a couple of times, give it at the very minimum, 30 day chance.</li>
            <li>If you buy this shaver and have any reservations after using it a couple of times, give it at the very minimum, 30 day chance.</li>
            <li>Works very well and gives as close a shave as any electric razor I have used.  </li>
            <li>and my fiance really appreciates me not having sandpaper-face.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t fault the shaver too much.  </li>
            <li>is really up to the buyer.  </li>
            <li>It performs its intended task very well.  </li>
            <li>I bought this Panasonic for $76 and really like it.</li>
            <li>I have 65\\&quot; plasman TV, a surround sound system, two digital cameras (one underwater), a cordless phone.</li>
            <li>As a modern day Sasquatch, this razor is a god send.</li>
            <li>so you cannot shave as fast as you could with a Remmington shaver.  </li>
            <li>ABSOLUTE GARBAGE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>He says it shaves very close and does not pull his skin at all.  </li>
            <li>I expected better than this.  </li>
            <li>fast</li>
            <li>Thanks Parasonic</li>
            <li>The Norelco is much quieter than the Panasonic (and Braun).</li>
            <li>The Norelco is much quieter than the Panasonic (and Braun).</li>
            <li>/&gt;To put it simply, this shaver is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it wet with my face soapy, and it does even better.</li>
            <li>and I really like the charge display indicator and the travel lock button.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it much</li>
            <li>Mostly I use it for a wet shave</li>
            <li>This one charges fast and cuts well.</li>
            <li>and it gets very close.</li>
            <li>This one shaves as well, but is much quieter.</li>
            <li>Product arrived very promptly and as described.</li>
            <li>nothing really to complain about.&lt;br</li>
            <li>High quality!</li>
            <li>I really wonder if the coarseness or thickness of your beard affects how well foil shavers work for you.</li>
            <li>It charges *fast</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have much room.  </li>
            <li>: Shaves much closer than any of the Norelcos</li>
            <li>I do like the LED panel that doesn&#x27;t try to give me too much information.</li>
            <li>Have to go over face multiple times but razor does a fantastic job giving a close shave.</li>
            <li>All that being said, this thing works really well.  </li>
            <li>I really like the feel and ease of use.</li>
            <li>It holds a charge very well</li>
            <li>I have found you don&#x27;t really need shaving cream though because it is so gentle.  </li>
            <li>It really work for me.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li>I had been purchasing cheap Remington foil razors, and after the last one started loosing the cutters every time I cleaned it</li>
            <li>that really is the only way to get a really superlative, BBS (baby bottom smooth) shave.</li>
            <li>It tells you how much charge you have left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this shaver.</li>
            <li>You will have to use a straight razor.  </li>
            <li>If straight razors did not irritate my neck, I would never bother with these electric shavers.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to be as fast.</li>
            <li>Having used Norelco shavers for 40 years, I felt ready to try something else.</li>
            <li>In fact, I really can&#x27;t tell the difference.  </li>
            <li>it really didn&#x27;t shave well</li>
            <li>The cleaning notification does not come on very often though.</li>
            <li>The real problem area was my neck.</li>
            <li>- Really just the opposites of the advantages.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I shave in the shower and this really does the job.</li>
            <li>Works very well - the fast motor makes shaving a 5 minute task.</li>
            <li>Product shipped fast and works very well.</li>
            <li>Liked it enough to buy a second one for father in law when his died.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s nice to know when the battery is getting low - especially with the nifty e-meter!</li>
            <li>In my opinion, the charging stand is not necessary and the cleaning system is a throwback to a bygone error because newer products are easily cleaned compared to the older systems.  </li>
            <li>With my OLD electrics they&#x27;d get most of it, above and some below.</li>
            <li>I really liked it until I bought a Wahl which I now use everyday.</li>
            <li>I tried rotary and they pulled too much, then foils seemed better, but not much.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The number of shaves per charge decreases drastically if you have any kind of heavy growth.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I REALLY like it!!!</li>
            <li>He got a close, comfortable shave the first time, just using it dry.</li>
            <li>The razor charges quickly and is pretty quiet.</li>
            <li>I was looking quick and easy maintenance, do the job without fuss, close enough to do facial hair, ez charge and fast.</li>
            <li>maybe i found the new hot set up?  </li>
            <li>far everything is great - water proof (or at least splash proof), easy to clean, and 1 full charge gets approximately 10 shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;**It doesn&#x27;t pull your whiskers or leave your skin irritated and red like other shavers plus the trimmer is as good as my beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First, for others who think it is very loud, my Remington sounded like a chainsaw compared to this thing.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic is fabulous and far superior to any of the electrics I had used briefly in the past.  </li>
            <li>This shaver really hums along, much faster than my older model.</li>
            <li>The trimmer option does not do a good job unless you&#x27;re ready to spend a serious amount of time using it.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the only problem I have, but it&#x27;s definitely a significant one.</li>
            <li>After originally being told that they would send me an advance replacement so that I would not be without a shaver, they called back to say that was an error</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will update the review if I have any issues with the durability of it, but my initial impression is that this is a biggest improvement I&#x27;ve had in shaving since I originally switched from rotaries to foil razors.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Since then, I have asked other electric razor users about their experiences with electric razors and most like them</li>
            <li>First, I thought more than 3 blades would be too bulky (plus more expensive to replace blades).</li>
            <li>Some of my facial hairs do not grow out in a consistent direction or grain, so I have some spots that are particularly prone to in-grown hairs, and mildly acne-prone skin.  </li>
            <li>He has used twin edge plastic blades for decades, and is excited at this different approach.  </li>
            <li>Over the years I&#x27;ve used all the major brands and some were better than others, but this Panasonic stands head and  shoulders above all the others.</li>
            <li>If you shave every other day, you may have to make more passes just to get the close shave.</li>
            <li>This particular razor can be used wet or dry, which is an important point because wet shaves, in my opinion, yield better results (and makes it even more usable for women).  </li>
            <li>The pop up trimmer works great and is an added feature I like, as are the clear LCD display, wet or dry capability and the lock.  </li>
            <li>I have been a Panasonic user for many years now and the last wet shaver I had gave me a good 6 years before the battery started acting up (had to only replace the blades once in the 6 years).</li>
            <li>When done, you simply push the button and put the shaver under the shower faucet to clean.  </li>
            <li>It was a different style and brand than he usually used, but he has been extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li>, the % of charge left LCD as well as notifying you to clean</li>
            <li>Number of times to go over the same area has reduced may be 1 or 2 to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li>My expectations were so low before using this shaver because I have several other more expensive electric shavers across many brands and thought surely this fairly cheap, no-frills model wasn&#x27;t going to be anything to get excited about.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy on the skin with everyday use.</li>
            <li>I really liked the version of electric razors with rotating circular blades, but I read the reviews on this one and was convinced to try it after my old electric razor broke down.</li>
            <li>Its long-hair trimmer is okay if it&#x27;s just trimming very fine or sparse hairs, but on my face, where my hairs are dense, it is close to useless.</li>
            <li>The only problem has been price - unless Amazon dropped the price on these razors, they were usually way, way out of the range of the possible for most people, but luckily this razor is more sensibly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s high quality and very durable.</li>
            <li>The head is smaller but it shaved close and held its charge for a couple of weeks, because of the smaller size and long battery life it made a perfect travel shaver for long trips.  </li>
            <li>Very, very convenient if you&#x27;re a busy person who needs to save some time in the morning.</li>
            <li>Once it gets the rough stubble down to a shorter length, though, the ES-LT41 does a very good job of getting all the hairs removed down to the smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>For the past few years I&#x27;ve been using a double-edged safety razor (the old-school kind) because my first two electric shavers, one a Panasonic and the other a rotary Norelco, weren&#x27;t all that great.  </li>
            <li>It seems much easier to be able to get into the odd nooks of my neck/jawline that caused problems before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to try it on a wet shave - if it was that good dry....</li>
            <li>It charges quickly and is easier to clean than my previous Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have a super coarse or fast growing beard.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used the shaver dry, and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>6 dB difference seems consistent with what I hear; the Panasonic measures to be four times as loud as the Norelco, and it seems that way when shaving.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re definitely not as good as a blade shave, but they&#x27;ve been \\&quot;good enough\\&quot; to allow me to dodge having to blade shave</li>
            <li>Then, hold the blades under water and any access hair caught up in the shaver will be rinsed and shaken away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging: A full charge only takes and hour.</li>
            <li>I have worn a short cropped full beard and mustache for 40 years.</li>
            <li>When I browsed Amazon, I was surprised to see them -- and the price was much lower than that in Japan!</li>
            <li>But, speaking for myself, I can say that it gives me a smooth, easy, close shave that is at least 3 times better than my old Panasonic electric shaver ...and virtually ties in comparison to a wet blade shave.</li>
            <li>It offers a high level of performance and useful features - good blades, 13,000 cycle per minute cutter - without unnecessary frills.  </li>
            <li>On the regular whiskers, it shaves close with one pass, and entirely smooth with a second pass at right angles.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Panasonic razors typically come out on top when considering price point and quality.  </li>
            <li>Options of Wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to rinse off and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is probably the top rated shaver which cost less than $100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the travel lock, but it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as my previous Panasonic model.  </li>
            <li>:-)&lt;br /&gt; - Less to take with you</li>
            <li>My husband is an older man who has &amp;#34;gone&amp;#34; through lots of shavers in forty-plus years of our marriage.  </li>
            <li>This is my main gripe with the unit and why I still need to intermittently use a disposable razor.</li>
            <li>The CC is much cheaper, but this was well worth the extra cost.  </li>
            <li>But when I examine it more closely, they are the same products with different skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The inner blades are so sharp, you do not have to put any pressure on the skin of your face, which makes the shaving experience all the more satisfactory!  </li>
            <li>Does not shave as closely as the older models.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s performed far better than I expected.</li>
            <li>The shaver can also be used, without the heads pivoting because there is a \\&quot;lock\\&quot; switch, which keeps the heads steady, during shaving.</li>
            <li>Anyways, in about five minutes with this shaver, you can get a decent shave.  </li>
            <li>I found my most recent purchase, a Series 3 razor, to be a big step backward in terms of closeness and speed of shaving.  </li>
            <li>This has lasted all of 2 years and has done a fairly decent job.  </li>
            <li>A few nice but modest upgrades from the ES-8103S line.</li>
            <li>I had an older model Panasonic for 4-5 years and it still got the job done.</li>
            <li>Everyone is different, we have different hair types and coarseness, my neck hair has always been a problem, I never found a electric razor that does a better job over another.  </li>
            <li>The only time I use it is when I don&#x27;t \\&quot;have\\&quot; to have a super close shave.  </li>
            <li>This is much zippier and seem to cut much faster, but then I hand never replaced the foil or blade on my old razor.</li>
            <li>Replaced the blades once for $30, although they were still going decent.</li>
            <li>It does not tear up his neck or miss any whiskers, exceptionally quiet and holds the charge better than the last ones he has had.  </li>
            <li>Quiet running and quick charge battery.  </li>
            <li>Going strong for five months - just as expected &amp; no complaints.</li>
            <li>It cost about $50, has lasted this long with original parts.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this razor - it is the CLOSEST electric shave I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for both men &amp; women.</li>
            <li>If I did 1/2 with a blade and 1/2 with this you could feel the blade did a closer job, but I highly doubt anyone couldn&#x27;t see a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Then, I discovered the high ratings of the Panasonic Arc three on Amazon and decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using this in the shower.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommemded.</li>
            <li>This razor hits all my requirements to a high degree.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I highly highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>However, over time I&#x27;d become dissatisfied with the quality of the shave and high price of replacement heads.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a high end</li>
            <li>Overal, I would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>/&gt;Charging the Panasonic shaver is super quick, about an hour or a little longer.  </li>
            <li>It is great for side burns, neck line, and other sensitive areas that need to be trimmed down slightly so that the foil shaver can be more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The wet or dry construction also makes it easy to clean</li>
            <li>As suggested, I&#x27;ve used this for 30 days and found it to be as smooth a shave as I got from my Gilette blade razor when I use it with wet lather and almost as smooth when I use it dry.  </li>
            <li>The wet/dry feature is nice though I haven&#x27;t compared to other brands with the same feature.    </li>
            <li>He really liked how much smaller, and sleeker it was than other electric razors.  </li>
            <li>anyone is really looking for a criticism, the only thing I can say is it is easy to hit the off button inadvertently and turn the shaver off in the middle of the shave</li>
            <li>Guess they should make the trimmer a little more stable for repeated use.</li>
            <li>But if you can spend a little more, try the ES-LA63-S</li>
            <li>The cleaning method is a little more echonomical, since you can use either water or water and liquid/gel anti-bacterial soap vs buying a cleaning cartridge for the Braun cleaning system.  </li>
            <li>I thought the blade would be a little better when I&#x27;m done shaving</li>
            <li>Sure it takes a little longer than a blade</li>
            <li>It requires a little more patience</li>
            <li>On/off lock also essential, as I heard it turn on first time I squeezed my suitcase shut!</li>
            <li>The ES-LT41-K moves more smoothly over my face, thus creating less razor burn than previous Linear razors (rotaries didn&#x27;t create as much razor burn for me, but they didn&#x27;t shave me as well,</li>
            <li>This new Panasonic is a generation ahead of the older one.</li>
            <li>fell in my new price range and had a decent rating, so</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried the trimmer yet, and it might be premature to give a Five Star review, but thus far I&#x27;m really blown away by the performance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a different shave wet, and it&#x27;s great that this shaver is built to let you shave wet or</li>
            <li>After less than an hour, it was fully charged and ready to go, and has been going fine for about a month now.  </li>
            <li>Wow, I really like this shaver.  </li>
            <li>Shaves closer than my old Braun 5770 and is much quieter too.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it all the time, but it provides a close comfortable shave when I do use it wet.</li>
            <li>Fantastic wet shave with gel.  </li>
            <li>After using this shaver for over 3 months I notice that I am spending more time shaving than normal and I am forced to go over areas on my face numerous times before it is smooth, something that rarely happened with my last Panasonic shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Panasonic ES-LT41 measured 84 dB; my old Norelco 8140XL measured 78 dB, using an old but consistent and reliable dB</li>
            <li>Just be sure to have a backup razor if you decide to let things grow for a few days.</li>
            <li>You do have to do a few more revolutions to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t like electric shavers because they nick up my legs...</li>
            <li>it was nice to know how long I&#x27;d spent</li>
            <li>Worth the extra twenty or so bucks over the cheaper model/competition.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Below the Jawbone - Same issue pretty much.</li>
            <li>That being said, the trimmer on the back is really useful.</li>
            <li>B0048ZIFA0 Soft Sheen Carson Magic Fragrant Shaving Powder]], which can only be used 36 hours after an initial shave</li>
            <li>It is worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>Have been using a normal razor for 25 years.</li>
            <li>It does take a few passes to accomplish that, but that&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>Many times while traveling, I&#x27;ve had shavers turn on in my bag, then its dead when i needed it</li>
            <li>Some have been more gimmicky than others and a few have been top performers.  </li>
            <li>It does seem to take a few more passes to get all the hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also quite powerful, which is a bonus, because I&#x27;ve got thicker facial hair.  </li>
            <li>Second, I didn&#x27;t want to pay $20 extra for the cleaner; based on my experience with other shavers, just removing the cap and tapping it clean has always been more than sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, i read that this shaver is the new version of the highly rated ES8103S.</li>
            <li>but it typically took over 5 minutes to get a clean shave!</li>
            <li>The alternative was to replace the foil, battery etc in my old razor, which would have cost as much as this new one did.  </li>
            <li>charges quickly enough, cleans easily in the shower or under a faucet, holds a charge for several days, and keeps you informed as to the status of the battery.</li>
            <li>decided to give the LT41-K a try using it as a wet shaver 100% of the time, and after a couple weeks, in addition to some other essential components, I&#x27;ve been having great results.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job overall, but it&#x27;s definitely not a viable option for someone with sharp angles in their face/neck.</li>
            <li>Personal preference will vary - neither one is right for everybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Personal preference will vary - neither one is right for everybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The package arrived, I opened it, turned it on, shut it off and put it back in the box right away.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it dry, but it&#x27;s really good even dry.</li>
            <li>Holds a charge for a long time and recharges quickly.  </li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t mind, shave nearly everyday, and have even starting shaving on my days off because this things is so quick and easy</li>
            <li>shaver charges quickly and the battery lasts a reasonably long time.</li>
            <li>Charges quick and holds a long time.</li>
            <li>I decided that the 4 blade or larger shavers would probably be too big and this one has turned out fine.</li>
            <li>Sure, I wish I could the $200-$300 shavers, but&#x27;s that a pretty ridiculous price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Power stays strong all the way down to 10%.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Third, it is very comfortable due to the high speed.</li>
            <li>though I have no other electric razor to compare this to for you, I can say for certain that I do not regret my purchase, and since I use this every day, I would recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>though I have no other electric razor to compare this to for you, I can say for certain that I do not regret my purchase, and since I use this every day, I would recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable and leaves very little rash.  </li>
            <li>Shaves as close as any other shaver I&#x27;ve owned, comfortable to hold, can use wet/dry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m able to use the carrying case from my old shaver and don&#x27;t bother using the little bag that is supplied with this</li>
            <li>Hopefully getting a new razor that won&#x27;t cause these problems for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>for years and wanted to have a new shaver.  </li>
            <li>Because they want to sell me new accessories.  </li>
            <li>and then they would send me a new one.</li>
            <li>It may be that I need a new head and razor for it</li>
            <li>but my razor is a fairly new model.  </li>
            <li>i also tried something new.</li>
            <li>B003H9HPAO New - PANASONIC MENS SHAVER - ES8109S]])</li>
            <li>Just purchased this new one for the holiday.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps a new head is in order...</li>
            <li>He had an electric razor before with 3 rotating heads and needed a new one.  </li>
            <li>The batteries died and I decided it was time to see what&#x27;s new, rather than replace the batteries again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Cuts as well as the new Panasonic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco</li>
            <li>, just don&#x27;t expect it to neccesarily live up to the reviews.</li>
            <li>I read some reviews saying that it takes ~1 month for your skin to get use to a new shaver?</li>
            <li>but so did my ES-8068 when it was brand new.  </li>
            <li>As a test, I shaved with the Braun with essentially new foil and cutters.</li>
            <li>The new one seems to be underpowered and tugs a bit even with brand new blades.  </li>
            <li>And even if I bought new blades once a year</li>
            <li>My \\&quot;old\\&quot; one had served me well for five years or so and was in need of a new screen and blade.</li>
            <li>it basically costs me 20$ to get a new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It never got a close shave, and would scratch up my legs even with a new foil.</li>
            <li>When that day came, I started shopping for a new shaver and stumbled upon a Panasonic on</li>
            <li>It charges up lightning fast and is able to get corners and hard to reach places.</li>
            <li>Given that it&#x27;s a lot less expensive than many other electric shavers available, I consider it a good buy.</li>
            <li>It holds a charge for a very long time, and charges fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>Prior to that minimum of 30 days, I was not totally satisfied because of impatience, but the more I shaved, I realized that they were right.</li>
            <li>so I have to work harder to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had Panasonic shavers for years because of the wet part of it; you clean them with soap and water, you can shave in the shower, etc.</li>
            <li>have the same 13,000 cpms and similar sound</li>
            <li>If what I described above applies to you, set yourself up with the following &amp;#34;cocktail&amp;#34; (all available at Amazon):&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, feeling the whiskers remaining as you go helps align the stroke with the best direction for cutting performance, as you seek the lay of the whiskers to approach from the opposite direction.  </li>
            <li>I love the convenience that an electric razor has to offer so much that I purchased a couple to keep one in the car so I can spruce up when I have a late appointment with a client.</li>
            <li>Spent more to get this razor and having second thoughts.</li>
            <li>My old Norelco packed in more shaves per charge, but I misplaced it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as the shave goes its good but not great.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s VERY quiet and very fast.</li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>After shaving he feels very soft feeling on his chin and</li>
            <li>It provides a closer shave than rotaries by far, but I have to admit I have not been using high dollar rotaries.</li>
            <li>but I do have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised as in the past&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and cannot use a razor blade or the circular style electric razors.</li>
            <li>I expected it to be an amazing difference compared to all my other razors, but that wasn&#x27;t the case.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Also, while the charge indicator is useful, it seems it can stay at 10% for a long time.  </li>
            <li>My second problem, The first couple weeks I used this shaver</li>
            <li>We have bought many shavers in the past..</li>
            <li>I was told I would have to send it back first</li>
            <li>It is more manageable due to its smaller size.</li>
            <li>It shaves close, is quiet and I love the digital readout of the  amount of charge left.    </li>
            <li>This shaver is LOUD!</li>
            <li>especially when used with shaving cream and hot water.  </li>
            <li>It is smaller than some other brands and that makes it even more desireable.</li>
            <li>I have been using Norelco for the past 40 years and this shaves closer, but it makes more noise.  </li>
            <li>As with any shaver, there are a few stray neck hairs, but overall the shave is much closer than most others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In general, I have really become a fan of Panasonic products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, the shave I get is equal to or better than the one I get from the hand held razor, and I&#x27;ve never come close to that experience with any other electric shaver (including Panasonic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty quiet and it holds a charge well.</li>
            <li>The display is exactly what you need (% charge left; charging; when shaver needs to be cleaned).</li>
            <li>The Braun worked fine (and half the cost of the Panasonic).</li>
            <li>but if your first, you need to get used to it, and expect to make multiple passes over areas.  </li>
            <li>So the first impression is five stars, but I will come back after a month of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life, I am actually shaving every day.</li>
            <li>I used a top of the line Braun shaver for a couple of years and then tried a high-end Norelco for the past year.  </li>
            <li>Boy was I surprised!  </li>
            <li>Wet mode is really cool, no pulling, no irritation, and works a lot faster (10 minutes).</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t bother me to have stubble and look a little scraggly, the electric is easy just to keep it under control.  </li>
            <li>You need to pay attention to the display when you turn it off because the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; indicator turns off and does not come back the next day to re-remind you to clean it.</li>
            <li>The reason I think this might work better, is because, despite the name, it&#x27;s not actually a \\&quot;foam\\&quot; like the conventional ones in cans.</li>
            <li>If you can live with the fairly loud 13,000 cycle hum you will probably like this Panasonic.</li>
            <li>, the ES-LT41-K is actually a huge improvement over the previous Linear series razors that I&#x27;ve used:&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Shaves baby&#x27;s-bottom smooth in about half or 2/3 the time of the Braun.  </li>
            <li>first shave with the Panasonic ES-LT41-K was on 3-day old facial hair.  </li>
            <li>It is also very easy to maintain, cleaning does not require $6 solutions or a cleaning station, I simply remove and rinse the head and cutting blades under the faucet making the Panasonic much more convenient to travel with.  </li>
            <li>With that being said, I would recommend using this shaver, when the hair is not very thick.</li>
            <li>It works fine, so 4 stars is a little severe..</li>
            <li>biggest positive that I see with this razor compared to the ES-LV61, is that the battery seems to last noticeably longer.  </li>
            <li>The battery percentage readout is handy, not sure how accurate it is, but at least it puts me in the ballpark of when it will die.</li>
            <li>thought I would give this Panasonic a try, hoping the Wet/Dry feature might make it easier to manually clean than a conventional model.</li>
            <li>Of course, this would only be necessary if you were in a hurry to get a quick shave.</li>
            <li>The previous review repeats a significant part of my review below as the products are very similar, but also describes my positive experience with Panasonic customer</li>
            <li>but I do replace them and don&#x27;t recall that razor ever having such an easy time with the most difficult neck</li>
            <li>That is, it gives a closer shave than pretty much any comparable razors of other brands at this price point, specifically Braun and Norelco.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a solid unit that has become my go to shaver when I need to leave the house quick while looking professional.</li>
            <li>Will certainly buy another next time around.</li>
            <li>Possibly its better with wet shaving, but dry shaving is an absolute chore.  </li>
            <li>I first tried it in the shower and honestly, I spent over 10 minutes just trying to get a decent shave that was even.  </li>
            <li>Normally, as I have sensitive skin, after blade shaving, I would experience a slightly &#x27;raw&#x27; feeling, and applying aftershave was an &#x27;experience&#x27; to put it lightly.</li>
            <li>At least it&#x27;s not a broken-shaver sound with rattling and the sound of loose parts, just a loud BUZZ.</li>
            <li>You may find you need to shave a little longer than you&#x27;d like to, or go over the same spot more than you think you ought to.  </li>
            <li>It takes me a little longer to shave than my prior shaver, but the result is a much better shave.  </li>
            <li>I have the bigger more expensive model and it works fine</li>
            <li>I quickly homed-in on the Panasonic models and chose this one over the other Panasonic models for a couple reasons.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s nice to not be regularly throwing things away and using dull razors.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I had the tools to retrieve it, but now I am very careful to handle that removeable head with no chance of dropping it.  </li>
            <li>Many electric razors are not as comfortable shaving longer whiskers, they tend to pull them out rather than cutting them off.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if Braun sells any newer models that offer this feature (it has proven useful many times in the past, when the battery was dead/low), but nowadays it seems that most wet/dry shavers, including the Braun shavers, have disabled the &amp;#34;use</li>
            <li>I typically use the Gillette manual razors for a close clean shave and use an electric for maintenance on day 2.</li>
            <li>Clear % of battery readout.  </li>
            <li>shut clearly, like it</li>
            <li>I have a full beard so don&#x27;t have to shave much except my throat and small patches on my cheeks</li>
            <li>Compared to my old Remington MS2, this thing is a joke.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how ineffective my old one had become until I used this one.  </li>
            <li>PANASONIC is by FAR the closest electric shave I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>My old Remington would go weeks before needing a charge.</li>
            <li>As far as razors go, this items does what it advertises, just like its predecessor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, you really can&#x27;t get the same shave with a shaver that you can with a razor.  </li>
            <li>Very accomodative of various curves and angles of the face.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Like, the hum of an airplane loud.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband to replace his old Remington</li>
            <li>Anytime we&#x27;re at our lake home, he uses and prefers his old Remington.</li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t shave any closer than my old Remington 407 shaver.</li>
            <li>I purchased the ES-LT41 to replace an old Braun that broke and a Remington that I used once before returning.</li>
            <li>The panasonic, while not quiet, is much lower volume.</li>
            <li>It is not as loud.</li>
            <li>but with this foil razor, the blades are covered so my skin isn&#x27;t directly exposed to the blades.  </li>
            <li>give it a \\&quot;B\\&quot; because it is really loud.</li>
            <li>For the frequent traveler there is a way to lock the on/off switch so that while it is stored it won&#x27;t accidentally turn on.</li>
            <li>Like the indicator showing how much battery life is left.  </li>
            <li>But recently I bought a Panasonic hair clipper and it was really good.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>I guess that could have something to do with my Braun being 10+ years old</li>
            <li>( just to clarify, i am a woman and got this to shave parts of my body that are too sensitive for razor).</li>
            <li>This is one LOUD shaver.  </li>
            <li>Not motorcyle or electric mower loud, but</li>
            <li>Maybe I have sensitive hearing</li>
            <li>My son has 4 young ones running around as he shaves in the morning.  </li>
            <li>So far, the Li ion battery lasted two weeks plus.</li>
            <li>B0009DT342 Panasonic ES8043SC Pro-Curve Pivot Action Linear Wet/Dry Shaver, Silver]] that I have been using since 2008.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Panasonic Linear series foil razors since the mid-90s.  </li>
            <li>It is a vast improvement in blade speed and is much quieter.</li>
            <li>I got a wild hair (no pun intended)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s near blade quality I must say.  </li>
            <li>I miss the old, pre-P&amp;G Brauns and the old Victor Kiam Remingtons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>No cleaning brush, but you could use your old one.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>So far I have owned this Panasonic for almost 6 months.</li>
            <li>It cuts closer than my old Remington and nearly as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li>I have heard it takes 2-3 weeks to adjust to each electric razor, but so far I am not a fan.</li>
            <li>It does an okay job, but I can&#x27;t say it shaves any better than the older, less expensive model I used for 5</li>
            <li>/&gt;Below the jawbone - It&#x27;s a simple straight up swipe with a blade razor</li>
            <li>expectations on this razor were based on my OLD electric razors.</li>
            <li>Some things are the same, and some are much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My old one had the a non-polarized connection and  the rectifier in the shaver.</li>
            <li>My old one had the a non-polarized connection and  the rectifier in the shaver.</li>
            <li>so you know how much charge is left.</li>
            <li>I still use the old Braun for side burn trim or to shave off neck fuzz, just easier.  </li>
            <li>It would definitely be too much to take as part of the wake up routine.  </li>
            <li>I got this as a gift for my husband who has really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I picked this one because of the reviews mentioning it works for sensitive skin and also because it has a travel switch, and my husband travels a lot.</li>
            <li>One pass is only for safety razors and barbers straight razors.</li>
            <li>; the old one did not have one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This will without a doubt be replacing my old razors.</li>
            <li>, I have sensitive skin and quite a number of acne on my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit loud, if that&#x27;s a concern.  </li>
            <li>The facial hair trimmer works very well.</li>
            <li>Fast, you don&#x27;t need to go over the same area</li>
            <li>I do think that the batteries now being used in the current electric shavers have improved much.</li>
            <li>I have some soft, wispy hairs on my neck.  </li>
            <li>This razor is very quiet, very fast,(blades rotating @</li>
            <li>I owe my wife a kiss for ruining the old one.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve formed some early opinions.  </li>
            <li>The ES-LT41 is cheaper than my old ES-8068, by a long-shot, which may account for my perception that I&#x27;ve &amp;#34;stepped down&amp;#34; in class.  </li>
            <li>But my expectations are lower, given that this is what the market now offers.</li>
            <li>It gives a closer shave than the old Norelco one ever did.  </li>
            <li>product comparison chart shows the two shavers to be nearly identical - and they are.</li>
            <li>I buy this for replace my old one.</li>
            <li>My old one buy from 2000.</li>
            <li>The newer series from Panasonic (ES-LT41-K) is lighter than my old shaver</li>
            <li>My skin is Really Really sensitive</li>
            <li>Replaced an old Panasonic razor with this one.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying this shaver because I lost my old one, not because it stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All of these are pretty minor and don&#x27;t detract from my 5-star</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say on the order of 30% the volume of my old Norelco titanium 3 and 4s.  </li>
            <li>My old Norelcos are 10+ years old, and their batteries are shot, but they still work if plugged in and you don&#x27;t have to throw  them away.  </li>
            <li>like the readout to know how much charge is left, so I don&#x27;t have to guess (even though it displays in hundredths</li>
            <li>time soon came where I was thinking of getting a replacement, looked at them all, thought about Norelco, but I still felt pulled by the quality of my old Panasonic and felt out of all I used</li>
            <li>The overall feel and quality of the shaver is much improved over my ES8077,</li>
            <li>Takes about 30 days for beard to get used to electric shave but after that wow.  </li>
            <li>I find it uncomfortably loud.</li>
            <li>Shaving near the ear makes me think I&#x27;ll damage my hearing.</li>
            <li>After my old Panasonic wet/dry shaver died I switched to a Sanyo.  </li>
            <li>so I was frequently turning it off during shaving by mistake, causing the razor at that point to PULL out the whiskers, not cut them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found each shave so far uses 10% of the power, i.e., I started at 100%, was at 90% after shave one, 80% after shave two, etc.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m 70 years old.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft on the face and does on heck of a job.</li>
            <li>My old one took about 12 hours.</li>
            <li>This seems positioned near the point of diminishing returns in the Panasonic line.</li>
            <li>I am comparing this to my old shaver.</li>
            <li>Replace a decade old Panasonic Electric Razor.  </li>
            <li>so it takes me about 10 minutes for a complete shave</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve probably increased by shave time by about a minute), but the final result is very smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you do not have sensitive skin this may be the shaver for you.</li>
            <li>so much I bought the same one for my son.  </li>
            <li>My sensitive neck area is never irritated.</li>
            <li>This thing shaves darn near as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li>Only real gripe, as others have said, it should have a stand.  </li>
            <li>I have had it for 6 months so far and see no reduction in the battery life or shave quality.</li>
            <li>This was quite a change from my old, worn-out, rotary shaver.  </li>
            <li>and you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Overall, this shaver is worth owning, especially for the price it has dropped to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well worth the minimal price.</li>
            <li>Being able to use this wet/dry shaver in the shower is something I was never able to do with other electric shavers I&#x27;ve owned, so its a new experience for me and a positive</li>
            <li>Unlike other reviewers I have only cleaned the shaver after every three or four shaves, and this seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The trimmer is very effective and makes trimming the edges of my goatee a neat and simple task, my only complaint is that the trimmer is on the back side of the razor</li>
            <li>I simply cannot justify spending more money just to have the accessories included or to improve the actual shaving quality when other brands can provide these improvements and accessories for a lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and she says it is MUCH better than any of her other more expensive razors</li>
            <li>My beard has always been difficult and used a regular blade and shaving cream, this is better!!</li>
            <li>I just did my first dry shave</li>
            <li>You can get a pretty close shave with this product, but besides stretching your skin, not pressing too hard, and shaving in multiple directions--I still find I have to spend the time to go over the same areas more times than I should have to to get a satisfactory shave.</li>
            <li>(I went from 0 to full power in less than one</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not excited about its prompt to clean it with soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No mess, no cords, no standing and shaves close like a razor.</li>
            <li>I never liked wet razor shaving and found the best was dry, and even though this shaver says it can do wet, I haven&#x27;t tried it, nor I plan on trying it.  </li>
            <li>Even when using the wet model with the special gel it would burn and not cut close enough for</li>
            <li>Cons: I really don&#x27;t have a true complaint about this razor.  </li>
            <li>Clean shave from the start, and I have a heavy beard.</li>
            <li>Some of the ones I&#x27;ve bought in the past have cost more than double and triple</li>
            <li>The price is the same or higher than what I paid over 5 years ago for virtually the same model.  </li>
            <li>but I try not to do business with companies that don&#x27;t put the customer&#x27;s needs first so this will likely be my last Panasonic purchase.</li>
            <li>It gives a decent shave, is smaller and faster.  </li>
            <li>When I got this wet/dry shaver, I used it in the shower the first few times, and it worked very well,</li>
            <li>This particular razor was actually confiscated by my daughter for her use (legs and arm pits)</li>
            <li>I bought the ES-LT41-K when an older Panasonic model finally began to wear out.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic replaced it and the second one did the exact same thing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned a couple electric shavers in the past, but they left my face irritated most of the time.  </li>
            <li>the charge last a long time, and the blades are adequately sharp after many uses.</li>
            <li>1st night face feels little flushed but not bad</li>
            <li>I had no idea that shavers had evolved to such a high degree of excellence.  </li>
            <li>Second, the ES-LT41 is more difficult to push through my stubble, whereas the ES-8068 moved smoothly across my face and objected only when presented with a 2-day growth of beard.  </li>
            <li>close comfortable shave wet or dry</li>
            <li>Yes, you can clean it with plain tap water.  </li>
            <li>It is small and light but seems well made.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a super-thick beard, but have sensitive skin in general.</li>
            <li>I usually shave once a week, so it does take awhile to get a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re like me and tend to Amazon research products before you buy, this is a great, quality product, and I would put this up against the very expensive ones from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.</li>
            <li>I do still use my regular razor, but only when I need a very close shave for professional purposes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a much more expensive Arc4, ES8249 for several years, long enough to replace the blades more than twice, and I found that I wanted a replacement, that would be cheaper to replace blades on.  </li>
            <li>I have tried different electrics before, most recently a 7 series Braun, which was still too harsh.  </li>
            <li>I normally use a disposable razor but this Panasonic 3-blade has made a big difference for me.</li>
            <li>it is very nice as is the travel lock, as I do travel often and nothing more annoying then finding my shaver dead because the button got bumped by TSA or in transit.  </li>
            <li>My prior experience confirmed that corded ones last due to not having a battery.  </li>
            <li>I decided to present new one to him.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had my new shaver a couple of weeks</li>
            <li>The Braun and the Panasonic were in my opinion equal at giving a close/smooth shave when the foil/blades are new.</li>
            <li>It totally outperforms my new Braun shaver.</li>
            <li>Hope this is my last one because i did not like the new Brauns.</li>
            <li>I like the easy to clean, cutting head, and the fact that they can be used &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;... I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It cant get a clean shave wet or dry...</li>
            <li>I wanted a close, comfortable shave, a precise cutting line, cordless ability, and some cleaning convenience.</li>
            <li>I use it dry and it gets very close.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shaves really well for a dry cut...</li>
            <li>Panasonic does not pull my hair, is much less noisy, cuts with fewer strokes, and is just more enjoyable to use than my previous razors.&lt;br /&gt;The pop-out trimmer on this razor is average (doesn&#x27;t seem very powerful/sharp) and seems small to me.</li>
            <li>drawback is that this isn&#x27;t saving me as much time as I&#x27;d hoped when I decided to switch from a regular razor to an electric one; I have to go over some areas several times to get all the hairs.</li>
            <li>that I&#x27;ve been using for several years now, but that razor was also three times the price of this one when it came out and is only now a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I was very hesitant on changing to a different brand or shaver type, but I researched for a while on the current rotory &amp; foil shavers and have settled on the Panasonic ES-LT41-K.  </li>
            <li>Over the years I have use several Norelco and an expensive Braun in an attempt to get a good close shave without razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I gets my my beard right down to the skin with no burning or irritation.</li>
            <li>After reading the high ratings and glowing reviews on this Panasonic I decided it was worth the few extra bucks and ordered one.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very satisfied with the performance of both shavers, with the Panasonic slightly out edging the Braun because of less irritation with longer facial</li>
            <li>In this case, the 13k cycle per minute cutting rate combined with the blade system, ergonomics, and price point will likely place this in the sweet spot for most users.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get used to the three circular heads on a Norelco and prefer one broad screen to work</li>
            <li>My first such razor, a modern one, broke when it fell, so I was using my great-grandfather&#x27;s 100+ year old razor for the past year or so.  </li>
            <li>My second es8243 is not bad, smooth on my face, but noisy, and the lcd failed after barely a year.  </li>
            <li>Also, this shaver has 3 blades compared to other razors and those with significant bear growth typically prefer 4 blade systems that I personally find too large.  </li>

            <li>The shave on my tough chin whiskers is fast and clean.</li>
            <li>There are certain items on Amazon which seem to have wide price fluctuations, and Panasonic shavers are among them.  </li>

            <li>Stop missing the slightly longer hairs but overall pretty smooth shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using the Panasonic ES-LT41-K, I immediately noticed a few key differences, it has a slightly louder &amp; higher pitched sound than the Braun shavers.  </li>
            <li>So it may be worth tracking the price a little, or searching the web, to catch it on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So it may be worth tracking the price a little, or searching the web, to catch it on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a little bit noisebut powerful</li>
            <li>Now I can shave in half the time or less and with a better result.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure know tends to be a viscous cycle that can be tough to break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And parts were getting more difficult to obtain, particularly the pop-up trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Long battery life (4-5 weeks for me)&lt;br /&gt;- High quality LED display</li>
            <li>Fortunately it is the \\&quot;ones\\&quot; digit so that I at least know what percent of a charge remains.</li>
            <li>but this is in my near future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve apparently become a fan of Panasonic razors.  </li>
            <li>For me I&#x27;m going back to old reliable (the ES8086)</li>
            <li>I tend to have a rough, fast growing beard.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have never had a problem shaving with this razor and the proper cream.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Original:  I purchased this Panasonic shaver to replace a 5 year old Norelco triple head whose battery run time had gotten too short.  </li>
            <li>Wow it cuts, quiet compared to any</li>
            <li>only downside to this shaver is the loud buzz noise it makes.  </li>
            <li>I can get 4-5 shaves per charge-about the same as my old Braun (3-4).</li>
            <li>Even using a magnifying mirror I could barely see stubble.</li>
            <li>As far as noise levels go for an electric shaver, I would say it is very quiet.</li>
            <li>But at 12 years old, it was starting to show its age.  </li>
            <li>I replaced a similar Panasonic model with this unit after using the old for 5 years.</li>
            <li>I could simply drop my old shaver into a charging cradle</li>
            <li>so far charges well, can hold for about a week, without recharging, for daily shavings.</li>
            <li>Not as close as a razor blade, not even when used in shower with shaving gel, but still at top of game for expectations or an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>It is okay but not great.</li>
            <li>that, I was even more confused.  </li>
            <li>Not cheap, but definitely worth re-buying.</li>
            <li>I limited my budget to $100 and saw the Panasonic had decent reviews</li>
            <li>I charged it up fully for the first time, tried to run it all the way down (part of the battery memory</li>
            <li>The first one lasted 6 plus years and still works but has slowed down some</li>
            <li>I simply cannot get over the fact that my neck will not adjust to the new razor and the irritation has persisted for several weeks.  </li>
            <li>The unit seems to run at a much higher speed than my previous shavers.</li>
            <li>However, I purchased this electronic shaver for the days where I do not have adequate time to wash my face, lather, and manually shave ....and for those lazy days when I just don&#x27;t feel like shaving manually.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sometimes I do have to go over my neck area a few extra times to get it perfectly smooth, and even then, I might notice later that it still missed a whisker here and there, especially if I haven&#x27;t shaved in a couple of days.</li>
            <li>- Takes a while to get a close, clean shave compared to a razor (but this is a general complaint against all electric shavers).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fine razor, but I found it difficult to get a really close shave.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to other reviewers, I decided to get this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shaves very closed but not irritating at all.  </li>
            <li>It is only about three quarters of an inch wide and the Remington was twice that and really made it easier to trim around my ears between haircuts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Two days ago I finally gave up and went back to my old es8066.  </li>
            <li>and this has almost eliminated razor bumps and ingrown hairs, only have problems when I get in a hurry and shave too fast or rough.</li>
            <li>But for daily use I am swapping it out with my \\&quot;secondary\\&quot; shaver, an old Norelco triple header I keep in my suitcase for occasional travel use.  </li>
            <li>but it was far more expensive.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is the best I ever found - at least within my meager price range.  </li>
            <li>I thought about rating it lower since it was a total fail for me, but everything else about it seems nicely made and well thought out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s 1/2 the mess and pretty close to the same shave!</li>
            <li>There was a close, even shave with no long hairs &#x27;leftover&#x27; at the bottom of the neck.</li>
            <li>I currently also have a more expensive Panasonic ES8228S which I&#x27;ve had for 2-3years and will make direct comparisons to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It evidently went by the way of our waste basket which was sitting under the table it was on.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time in 40 years of shaving that I have not had skin irritation from an electric razor - and I have tried quite a few.</li>
            <li>total shave time is not much better, of course I shave every morning and find myself passing over the same areas several times to get a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>This thing really gets down to the skin</li>
            <li>Finally, after lots of research on all current electric options I decided on the Panasonic ES-LT41-K due to its reviews, price and features.&lt;br /&gt;Now, after a month of use I&#x27;ve come to really like this razor for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used my blade other than to do a little clean up on the neck at times.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind this, too much, as it is just a slight inconvenience.</li>
            <li>I dry shave early in the morning before heading out and this shaver performs the job</li>
            <li>Blades are much sharper than previous razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>can not shave with the power cord plugged in, not much trouble because the battery can last a long time.</li>
            <li>I recently wanted to try another electric shaver, mainly because I&#x27;ve been feeling guilty about all the landfill I&#x27;m creating with cheap disposable razors (I break off the head and throw the shaft in the recycling,</li>
            <li>My first Linear finally needed replacement after quite a few years of use.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m not so old that I can&#x27;t learn a few new tricks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>What I dislike about the new shaver is that it doesn&#x27;t cut as well as the old one (even with the old one&#x27;s dull blade).  </li>
            <li>I think I get the closest shave using shaving gel, but, dry or wet shaving is very serviceable as well.  </li>
            <li>Wet and Dry shaving a real plus, and so is the trimmer.</li>
            <li>If I have a few days growth then I will use a regular razor and switch to this for the rest of the week, but as long as you don&#x27;t let your beard go for more than a few days (or even a day for some of you lumberjacks)</li>
            <li>At first, the shave was a little rough (shaving dry), but then I tried another readers suggestion of just using normal liquid hand soap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey (for me) but it works absolutely as advertised and maintenance of it</li>
            <li>This razor absolutely shaves as close as a blade; and there is little to no irritation.  </li>
            <li>I know this is a really minor complaint and certainly will not prevent me from giving this razor high marks (5-stars).</li>
            <li>I wanted a new electric because my other one died.  </li>
            <li>Shaves the closest of any I&#x27;ve ever used, is light, sturdy, cuts through my tough beard, etc.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using a Gilette Fusion power razor and liked it fine except for the outrageous cost of replacement blades!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Shave performance, well to me, I have not seen a real improvement, even with my old dull foils in my ES8077,</li>
            <li>had  a VERY old Braun and one other type.</li>
            <li>I would have to hit my beard from EVERY angle, up, down, left, right, diagonal one way, diagonal the other way, back and forth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard good and bad about electrics, pros and cons, etc.  </li>
            <li>without getting technical (since i cant) i recommend this machine for the closeness of the shave, the ease it catches even long hair, the contour of the grip, the charge status (0%-100%) display, the quietness, the wet/dry ability and the general workmanship.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric razor.</li>

            <li> My husband says it&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> but this is very impressive quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!</li>
            <li> It works best with shaving cream, but I have very good results with just a pre-shave lotion as well.</li>
            <li> Very good choice.  </li>
            <li> Very good shaver that operates as advertised.</li>

            <li> I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> Works great on my head as well.</li>
            <li> I had to switch and bought a Braun which was Great until it died.  </li>

            <li> This is a great shaver.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic works great though not noticibly faster than my Braun.  </li>
            <li> Buy this and you will be happy.</li>
            <li> I have to say i am very impressed with this shaver, i have used foil shavers before but the quality of the shaver is amazing.</li>
            <li> However, having tried it in both scenarios, I can say that it performs great in either setting.  </li>
            <li> Product works great.  </li>

            <li> This is a great shave.</li>
            <li> Works great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did!!</li>
            <li> I love this shaver!!</li>
            <li> Very nice product.</li>
            <li> Very nice shave, not load at all.</li>
            <li> it is very nice.  </li>
            <li> Very nice.</li>
            <li> The charge state indicator is also very handy.</li>
            <li> OMG AMAZING!</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES-LT41-K is an excellent choice among electric shavers.er when it reaches 10% - use it for more</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES-LT41-K has some notable features - excellent blades that provide for a close shave, a side trimmer, and an easy-to-read battery status LED display.  </li>
            <li> Works way better than I thought it would, very happy.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly to me it does a great job of shaving my face.  </li>
            <li> This Panasonic got great reviews and the price was good.  </li>
            <li> It is especially nice being able to use it in the shower with or without shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Perfect form fitting function.  </li>
            <li> excellent shaver, Love Panasonic</li>
            <li> It did not meet my expectations as not that successful at neck and jawbone area.</li>
            <li> One gets better results by going over the skin at a snail&#x27;s pace, allowing the skin to compress, unroll, and conform to the shape of the razor head, thus presenting the whiskers at maximum advantage to the blades for best &amp;#34;off with her head&amp;#34; performance.  </li>
            <li> I also have many Panasonic products in my home and have had excellent service from them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it, best razor &amp; closest shave</li>
            <li> Works great - a good shave</li>
            <li> Excellent contour - easy to hold in your hand</li>
            <li> Easy to use and gives great shaves!!!!!  </li>
            <li> This is easily the best electric razor I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the Best of The Best.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a huge fan of the wet/dry capabilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best pieces of advice I can offer</li>
            <li> As good as a blade on the face.  </li>
            <li> My perfectly good Panasonic is now in the trash.</li>
            <li> This worked fairly well for my husband.  </li>
            <li> and there that weren&#x27;t getting cut, but now things seem to be going fairly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really good razor, close shave</li>
            <li> This is a good shaver for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as good.</li>
            <li> The battery is good for couple of shaves, plus it recharges quickly&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good quality electric razor for quite some time.</li>
            <li> Again, this is good.</li>
            <li> Good pop-out sideburn trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Good handle.  </li>
            <li> price was good to me</li>
            <li> Germans are good at making machines.</li>
            <li> you should be good.</li>
            <li> the works really good.</li>
            <li> she loved it so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives a good shave</li>
            <li> all amounts to a good value.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Good quality shaver and good performance.....</li>
            <li> Good price also.</li>
            <li> It gives a wonderful smooth shave when using with shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> ) Has good vibration protection--doesn&#x27;t wear out your hand.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s good, because you can&#x27;t shave with it</li>
            <li> does a good job shaving.</li>
            <li> A good close shave.</li>
            <li> It gives a good shave for a shaver of this price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Performance: The 30 degree Nanotech blades gives a fairly close shave, depending on how your hair grows.</li>
            <li> It seems well-built, and it has good battery life.  </li>
            <li> Works as advertised, battery life is good, about 10 days per charge and it shaves close.</li>
            <li> The three blade Panasonic ES-LT41-K is a good Panasonic razor.  </li>
            <li> Quality seems good</li>
            <li> This shaver is a good value.</li>
            <li> This is a great value for the price and has nice features.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my partner and he loved it.</li>
            <li> he loved it</li>
            <li> but I get a good shave.</li>
            <li> Just as good as advertised.</li>
            <li> For the price it is a good razor.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly close shave for an electric</li>
            <li> Good value for money.</li>
            <li> So while searching for a replacement,  I knew I did not want to invest in one with a cleaning station and the ES-LT41-K appeared to be priced well and offered some improvements in design that looked like a good choice for me.  </li>
            <li> I shave my head in the shower and this one does not do as good of a job at all.</li>
            <li> so I thought this might be a good investment.  </li>
            <li> If you think about it over time, this would save you a good amount of money if you are shaving once a day.  </li>
            <li> I had another Panasonic shaver for 12 years which was no longer holding charge so decided to buy this product after reading good reviews about it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get a good shave in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get a good shave in the neck area</li>
            <li> shave was fairly close</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> had good reviews and bought one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No complaints at all and good value for money</li>
            <li> My opinion is that this razor does not give as good of a shave as a Braun.</li>
            <li> I never achieved a good neck shave with an electric before - always had to get out the Gillette for that.</li>
            <li> This one is a good shaver but the stubborn neck hairs (under the side of your jaw)</li>
            <li> Nice razor, great for traveling</li>
            <li> Good power.  </li>
            <li> Ability to clean under running water is great!</li>
            <li> very good feel in the hand, and easy to wash/rinse.  </li>
            <li> It charges quickly and battery life is excellent.</li>
            <li> clean-up is quick with soap &amp; water!!!....</li>
            <li> Picked it up on sale for $59.99 Best Buy but easily worth it for the $79.99 Amazon sale price.</li>
            <li> My cousin likes this shaver better because this one has a lock button -- it&#x27;s great for travel.  </li>
            <li> - It&#x27;s also very safe</li>
            <li> I have had it for over a year now and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this</li>
            <li> This panasonic is everything that is promised and i am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great machine and gives a better shave than my rotary shaver.</li>
            <li> The flip-up razor does a great job trimming sideburns and my mustache, much better than the Norelco.</li>
            <li> I have had this for just over a month now and very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> and I am very satisfied with the result.</li>
            <li> I am very glad I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this Panasonic Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver.  </li>
            <li> : After a month of use, I am still very satisfied.</li>
            <li> A good buy, with nice features.</li>
            <li> It also gets my neck right under my chin line perfectly on one or two passes.</li>
            <li> the motor vibrates the head perfectly and the pivoting head is just the right tension for moving along angles.  </li>
            <li> with any good electric razor make sure that you get a good cleaner/lubricant.</li>
            <li> This shaver is very fast at shaving and I have discovered that a circular motion is best (the single-head shavers don&#x27;t work as well with the circular motion).</li>
            <li> My first es8066 (no longer offered) is the very best.  </li>
            <li> not anything fancy but better than my finances $250 braun!</li>
            <li> Good use of an electric razor!It is suitable as a gift。&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> He loves the closeness of the shave with this razor, and I love it as well!</li>
            <li> I am enjoying it !</li>
            <li> Not as perfect as using a blade - but pretty darn close.  </li>
            <li> There are so many options out there!</li>
            <li> and smooth!!...</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SHAVER!  </li>
            <li> Love it.!</li>
            <li> so glad it did!  </li>
            <li> It works great and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> After shaving for most all of my life with blades, this is a pleasant change.</li>
            <li> Excellent shave, well designed, easy to hold and comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> Amazing experience.</li>
            <li> Great to actually enjoy shaving a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> Amazingly easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also feels great in hand and is light.</li>
            <li> but the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing...</li>
            <li> I cuts fairly close but could do a better job.</li>
            <li> Oh yeah, its like shaving honestly.</li>
            <li> Not a close or effective shave at all.  </li>
            <li> Excellent quality - shaves very well.  </li>
            <li> Nice feel.  </li>
            <li> - The travel lock is handy.  </li>
            <li> razors materials are also really nice.  </li>
            <li> nice holding pouch</li>
            <li> As I write this, I&#x27;ve been thinking about any &amp;#34;cons&amp;#34; to report to you, but I honestly can&#x27;t think of any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked the reviews on this one and tried it.  </li>
            <li> On the contrary, it&#x27;s produced a nice close shave without pain.  </li>
            <li> Men&#x27;s 4-Blade (Arc 4) Multi-Flex Dual-Motor Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Silver]] which is absolutely the best shaving system that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> A stand or cradle might have been nice, but this configuration hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> which is nice.</li>
            <li> previously liked the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> guess I have a nice paperweight now..</li>
            <li> I purchased a foil type portable shaver (Braun) for travel and liked it.</li>
            <li> It does have a nice feature in the cut off switch in front of the shaver</li>
            <li> The fast charging is impressive, and the battery holds a charge well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good shaver for sensitive skin , i bought this shaver for my husband&#x27;s gife , and he is very happy this shaver .</li>
            <li> Travel lock-out feature is nice to have.</li>
            <li> The pop-up trimmer is surprisingly effective.</li>
            <li> Still, an excellent option if you don&#x27;t want a real razor.</li>
            <li> Battery life hasn&#x27;t impressed me much yet</li>
            <li> have the nice curly cord that my Braun did.</li>
            <li> the LT41 has an added travel lock, which is a nice feature, although I had never had problems with my 8103 turning on during travel.</li>
            <li> Perfect and works very good.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> one is a nice upgrade.</li>
            <li> I have had it over a year holding up nice.</li>
            <li> absolutely the greatest razor I ever had.</li>
            <li> Nice looking shaver as well.</li>
            <li> if you like foil shavers, there are a lot of nice things to say about this one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pop-up trimmer is a nice feature</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice design though</li>
            <li> features I liked about the ES-LT41-K</li>
            <li> I actually liked this thing when it worked.</li>
            <li> so the dual 100-240v option is nice, and it comes with a travel case and a lock for the power switch for it to prevent it from accidentally turning on in your luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lock is a nice feature because I will take it when I travel</li>
            <li> Nice rubbery grips.</li>
            <li> Had a Braun 7000 series that I liked but after 10 yrs</li>
            <li> I liked mine</li>
            <li> and and people were telling me that electric razors always irritate the skin, but this was really milder than the best razor I ever used.</li>
            <li> Husband liked shaver.  </li>
            <li> Really nice razor for the price.</li>
            <li> Lots of nice features</li>
            <li> I am absolutely thrilled to own this razor.  </li>
            <li> However, this particular shaver is probably the best electric shaver I have had.  </li>
            <li> LCD panel on the front of the unit displays in a bright amber, which is nice (easy to read, even without my glasses).</li>
            <li> It even tells you when to clean it!!</li>
            <li> They added a wonderful new feature.</li>
            <li> This is my NEW FAVORITE razor!!!!</li>
            <li> I am new to electric shavers, but this appears to be best rated for a reason.</li>
            <li> Definitely a great upgrade from cheap electric shavers without spending hundreds on the top models.</li>
            <li> I have read some reviews where people talk about great battery life; I can&#x27;t imagine how they shave as I am lucky if I get 5 days without a re-charge needed.</li>
            <li> The unit was delivered quickly and the price was great.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is a great razor for people like myself (mild beard).</li>
            <li> It trims the side burns and beard very quickly and surprisingly close.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, holds a charge well, and gives a good shave.  </li>
            <li> This razor feels good in the hand and the motor is really strong sounding</li>
            <li> It is very easy to handle</li>
            <li> Cleaning is also very easy.</li>
            <li> Very, very easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> I found it to give me a close shave and very easy to use and clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The arc&#x27;d blades make trimming shorter hair very easy.</li>
            <li> Love, love!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall though I am happy with the shaver and feel it works well and is a good replacement for my older model, whether it will beat the record of 7 years is another question?</li>
            <li> tried a Braun 5090CC, and it wasn&#x27;t nearly as comfortable, or as good shaving for me.  </li>
            <li> The best shave I&#x27;d got so far with</li>
            <li> About 8 months ago the old one wore out and rather than just ordering another one I decided to do so research and buy the best razor out there.  </li>
            <li> but I like this one best so far.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a lot of Panasonic Wet/Dry shavers, but this is by far the best one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was favorably surprised when I used the shaver that gave me the best shave from an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need powder sticks or Lectric Shave to get a good, comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> It gave the best shave at the time but it was so loud it was like shaving with a chainsaw.</li>
            <li> I have had the razor for 2 weeks now and so far I have not been impressed.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Its nice to be able to rinse it under the tap.</li>
            <li> By far, the best.</li>
            <li> I have been using Panasonic shavers for many years, and liked them.</li>
            <li> As well the textured handle is nice providing a much better grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This by far is the best bang for the buck!  </li>
            <li> My old trimmer was at a 90 degree angle which was perfect.</li>
            <li> this is far from perfect.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shaver I have ever had</li>
            <li> This will give you an exceptional shave and that this price, I can easily overlook the lack of a stand.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaving for people with sensitive skin, as you can apply foam and soften your skin to reduce irritation.</li>
            <li> Pros: Very easy to use, very easy to clean, and holds a charge for a good while.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic shavers are among the best, from my experience, and the ES-LT41-K is right at the sweet spot.  </li>
            <li> Very useful razor which is good for my face.</li>
            <li> Had many razors over many decades, this one really is the best one yet and delivers a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is very pleased with this razor as it is easy to hold and gets a close shave without nicking his face.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and the Linear razors just seem to cut closer to the skin than the rotaries do.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned many electric razors in my 60 years, but I&#x27;d have to say this one is clearly the best shave.</li>
            <li> It does everything an electric razor should do well: close shave, great battery life, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It gives a good, clean, close shave.</li>
            <li> I love this razor, It does a good good and is gentle on the skin on my face.</li>
            <li> Combined that with it supporting 100-240V charging, it makes it a great razor for travelling.</li>
            <li> It sounded too good to be true, but I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> this shaver fits your budget, it&#x27;s an exceptional device that&#x27;ll give you a close and comfortable shave for many years.  </li>
            <li> have a couple of areas that the hair grows rather fast, so I shave with a razor once a week as electrics aren&#x27;t the best for longer hair and do the clean up with this the rest of the week.</li>
            <li> The reviews I read about this model were very accurate.</li>
            <li> Very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Very light weight&lt;</li>
            <li> worked well for me from the day one with a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable when you use it.</li>
            <li> It does have a pop out trimmer for thicker hairs, but it is very cheap and it irritates the skin when using.</li>
            <li> You will get unimpressive shaves the first couple of weeks, but it does get better; 2) Williams Lectric Shave really is great stuff, our fathers and grandfathers were on to something.</li>
            <li> The case it comes with is a nice fabric pouch, that keeps in easily protected (though I still pack it in a shoe when traveling).</li>
            <li> The razor does not feel good on the skin and seems to pull hairs if you move the head too quickly.</li>
            <li> It does a pretty good job and by far is the best electric shaver I have ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great ;product, easy to use and easy to clean</li>
            <li> so far it&#x27;s a very good buy.  </li>
            <li> The price is also very good for such a nice device.</li>
            <li> I have used many models of shavers and this one does the job.</li>
            <li> Its battery is giving up, and its still a better performer.  </li>
            <li> irritates the heck out of my face because I have to make many passes to get it done.</li>
            <li> Some better than others, I&#x27;ve found that the foil type work better than the rotating ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Getting this product the second day with this prime thing is AWESOME.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding razor.</li>
            <li> That makes it more compact for traveling light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There are none any more.</li>
            <li> It never got any better.</li>
            <li> Its an okay razor</li>
            <li> The electric razor was ok, I just didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put the shaver on the charger when it reaches 10% - use it for more</li>
            <li> Closer and better in the neck and jaw area than the Braun 300 series and certainly better than any of the Remingtons I have owned.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care what the blades are made of, but if &#x27;nanotech&#x27; is the reason that this shaver makes me happy then</li>
            <li> The trimmer seems OK as well.</li>
            <li> - I find that the closeness of the shave is quite good, and while not as close as a razor, still close enough to make me happy.  </li>
            <li> This one is much better size, lighter, easier to handle, and seems more sturdy &amp; reliable.</li>
            <li> but glad I tried this one.</li>
            <li> Does not leave stubs like most shavers.</li>
            <li> give it 5 stars if the trimmer was designed/built a bit better</li>
            <li> Compared to my CC, this charges in 1 hour (vs. 12), holds a charge longer, and has more features.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;comfortable to hold,  Love shaving with lather</li>
            <li> Glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sure is close</li>
            <li> /&gt;Gentlemen, this really is a better mousetrap.</li>
            <li> Still, quite pleased with this.  </li>
            <li> Not using this on a face, I haven&#x27;t encountered a sensitivity issue that many men experience.  </li>
            <li> Check out my video review for more.</li>
            <li> I will return to Norelco, even though I think the Panasonic gives me a slightly better shave.</li>
            <li> nice smooth shave, does what its supposed to.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver for 3 months and fairly satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> That was when the magic happened :).</li>
            <li> Another feature I love is the travel lock on the power button.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is top of the line for a razor trimmer.</li>
            <li> but they didn&#x27;t work well on my face, even after many weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> It shuts itself off after 20 seconds, then youremove the foil section, activate the sonic mode once more while holding the blades under running water to rinse.</li>
            <li> even more so, actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it feels more maneuverable on my face.  </li>
            <li> Both Panasonics before this one performed flawlessly and lasted several years</li>
            <li> However, this one feels noticeably lighter and has a more secure/textured surface to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the cheaper ES-LT41 provides a better shave over all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the latest Norelco technology</li>
            <li> And for the price it is a much better deal than the Braun foil shavers.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver.  </li>
            <li> My husband has used Philips Norelco shaver for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li> I shopped the many shaving offerings from Panasonic and others.  </li>
            <li> but it is smooth and a  nice change to a razor.</li>
            <li> To be able to shave while plugged into the charger.</li>
            <li> For many, that may take some getting used to.  </li>
            <li> For many, that may take some getting used to.  </li>
            <li> I have owned several Panasonic razors over the years and this is the best.</li>
            <li> But no, it&#x27;s excellent, should&#x27;ve bought it earlier.  </li>
            <li> While the shaver did OK (replaced once under warranty)</li>
            <li> I switched from Norelco rotaries, because the Linear razors gave me a better cut than the rotaries.  </li>
            <li> much more</li>
            <li> I had been using a rotary shaver for many years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Panasonic Wet/Dry razors for many years.  </li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve always been satisfied using a blade.</li>
            <li> My husband had never been able to find a razor that didn&#x27;t give him razor burn.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you can do any better than this.</li>
            <li> so he can keep it in his car, but he love the shaver.</li>
            <li> Battery is good for about a week&#x27;s worth of shaves.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this razor.  </li>
            <li> The trimming tool is better than the rotaries.</li>
            <li> I am glad i did.  </li>
            <li> almost bought the 4-head model for $50 more, but I&#x27;m glad I chose this one.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with electric shavers for many years.  </li>
            <li> Most electric shavers are not designed to handle beard growth more than 3-4 days.  </li>
            <li> OK I decided I might want more</li>
            <li> thing I think could be better would be the way it&#x27;s connects to the charging cable.</li>
            <li> thing I think could be better would be the way it&#x27;s connects to the charging cable.</li>
            <li> Excellent razor, especially for the money.  </li>
            <li> It is so nice and even cheap.</li>
            <li> Love, love this thing.  </li>
            <li> Love the fact that it is water proof.</li>
            <li> Feels better going over my face</li>
            <li> /&gt;Panasonic Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Feels better in my hand</li>
            <li> The head design allows better access to nooks and crannies around my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Husband really likes this razor, does a great job.</li>
            <li> Takes getting used to, but worth it for a good shave.</li>
            <li> I have noticed the more I shave with this</li>
            <li> I do make many passes to get a close shave, but this is the case for all electric shavers.</li>
            <li> No reason to spend more for a shaver.  </li>
            <li> Shaves OK and is better on neck than a rotary  shaver.</li>
            <li> Therefore, turning the shaver in a way to get a better look on where you want to trim should help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using razor blades for shaving my head and got some spots bleeding, This did the trick, I love it</li>
            <li> Even 12 hours after shaving, his face is still smooth!</li>
            <li> He declares it his favorite razor ever.</li>
            <li> also own the Panasonic ES-LV61 shaver, so this will primarily be a comparison between the two.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter how many times I go over that area in varying angles and speeds, can never truly get it cut.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this razor.</li>
            <li> Better shave than my Braun or Norelco.</li>
            <li> It was much more aggressive</li>
            <li> I decided to give this shaver a try because an electric is way faster and easier and cheaper to use, so I knew I&#x27;d use it more.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve had it for about 3 weeks) but there are many factors in that</li>
            <li> There is zero chance that it&#x27;s $400+ better than this one.  </li>
            <li> It does take more passes to shave with the 3 blade than with the 4 blades, and a bit more effort.  </li>
            <li> you may save a bit more by buying this over the 4 blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 4 or 5 blade ones may be better.</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> more like a</li>
            <li> For the most part, I&#x27;ve used Remington models.</li>
            <li> When the trimmer on my latest Remington quit working, I decided to see what else was out there.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m liking it more and more each day.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say I love it</li>
            <li> For a while I used 2-blade disposable razors, which would work OK if I hadn&#x27;t shaved in a couple days, but towards the end of the work week</li>
            <li> the bumps/irritation/nicks would increase, which as many of you</li>
            <li> The shave is close but a razer blade is still better.</li>
            <li> I dont know how a 4 and 5 blade electric razer shaves but it cant be that much better than my 3 blade</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned most models, from Ronson and Remington to Braun, Norelco and Panasonic, wired and rechargeable, with rotary, foil and bar cutters.  </li>
            <li> Sure, it gives a close shave</li>
            <li> I love everything except the cord, which is a wall wart</li>
            <li> And I understand I have to write 1 more word for this review.</li>
            <li> So glad I made the switch</li>
            <li> Glad I did.  </li>
            <li> It seems to do a better job for me.  </li>
            <li> I also just love the style of this one aesthetically -</li>
            <li> I get even better results on shaving the mustache than I do with my razor.</li>
            <li> However, there are some notable differences that I believe are improvements with the LT41 line.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I expect many more years of trusty service.</li>
            <li> So I shave like King Henry, ok.  </li>
            <li> The Braun shavers feel the best made and have lasted forever; I still have a Braun Synchro I keep around, just in case (it still keeps a charge, more than 10 years later!).</li>
            <li> The Panasonic is much better on the neck area.</li>
            <li> It pays for itself in 6 months compared to buying replacement cartridges, while giving a shave that is faster, more convenient, and just as close.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue using the Norelco for a month to see if it does better after my face adjusts to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 2 Panasonic shavers and both have not lasted more than 4 years.</li>
            <li> If Braun and Norelco can make a shaver that lasts more than 10 years, then so should Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue using the Norelco for a month to see if it does better after my face adjusts to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 2 Panasonic shavers and both have not lasted more than 4 years.</li>
            <li> If Braun and Norelco can make a shaver that lasts more than 10 years, then so should Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Ok for sideburns, but tricky for a beard or mustache.</li>
            <li> He was glad to get it and has said that he likes it a lot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, the comfort and ease of shaving that it provides is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> This shaver gives a nice and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> GIVES A CLOSE CUT AND LOOKING FOR MORE TO CUT</li>
            <li> I have been using Panasonic Wet/Dry shavers for last 14 years and this is the 4th and the best</li>
            <li> I have been a blade and shaving cream shaver for most of my life.</li>
            <li> I found myself using it in the shower more than I would have thought .if</li>
            <li> However after giving the Panasonic wet/dry a really fair shake, I still experienced the same problems I&#x27;ve always had with foil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> some reason, the 3 rotary head shavers have always worked better for me.</li>
            <li> so maybe ok for those who do like electrics better.  </li>
            <li> I heard the foil is better if you don&#x27;t shave often.</li>
            <li> I read an independent review that said this was the best shaver under $100.</li>
            <li> I love this model.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I would love to give this a 5th star, but it just has one flaw, which i&#x27;ll get to shortly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Bought 2 more of them for Christmas -- one for each of my sons.  </li>
            <li> They LOVE them too.</li>
            <li> I also love the button lock feature, so when I travel it doesn&#x27;t accidentally turn itself on in my luggage.</li>
            <li> it gave me the best overall performance and shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic shavers for many years</li>
            <li> Hope the rest of you have better luck.</li>
            <li> have a Braun shaver as well and find the Panasonic to be better and gives me a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> So I ordered it and am quite pleased.</li>
            <li> and I am as pleased with it as the day I bought it.  </li>
            <li> The MS was better in that respect.</li>
            <li> Has all the most desirable features but doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> Never have been able to, even with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> Works better that way on my beard/face.</li>
            <li> on top it would cause ingrown hair and irritation all over.</li>
            <li> and I would rate it among the top tier of electric shavers in terms of closeness.  </li>
            <li> They always get better.</li>
            <li> and I think all electrics, will never be able to do that.</li>
            <li> A couple more notes: 1)</li>
            <li> and I think it works better.</li>
            <li> Works well for already more than 2 years</li>
            <li> It is simply the best.</li>
            <li> Much better than the Remington that it replaced.</li>
            <li> Love it - even with 3 day growth.</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d take a chance on a Panasonic and am delightfully pleased.</li>
            <li> it was better than both of them.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been able to quit using Lectric Shave.  </li>
            <li> I like&lt;br /&gt;living cut free!</li>
            <li> Does it shave better than this ES-LT41-K?  </li>
            <li> I will say this without equivocation, my Schick disposable razors shave better than this razor AND the $120 Panasonic ES</li>
            <li> The shave is OK, but takes longer than I am used to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks now, mostly once a day.</li>
            <li> will be trying it for 1 more week before attempting to return it.</li>
            <li> I like the compact feel of the ES-LT41-K, and love being able to rinse it out.</li>
            <li> Much, much better shave.</li>
            <li> That one I thought was a better shaver.  </li>
            <li> I am 55 and have used a blade most of my life.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t find it all that worthwhile</li>
            <li> more Remington for me, thanks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Remingtons I used had better trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;Supposedly, you can go a year without changing the foil and blade on this razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing more like 8-10 months.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> I know that this shaver is not on the top tier</li>
            <li> This razor does a much better job on my neck than any of my Brauns ever did.</li>
            <li> Though the more you go over your face, the closer the shave will be.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I am sure there are better razors on the market</li>
            <li> but it takes many passes (more than 10) to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> My Braun 3 works much better and doesn&#x27;t nick me.  </li>
            <li> Overall this is a nice shaver with good features for your buck!</li>
            <li> Shaves really nice and clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Summary: Great shaver, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Summary: Great shaver, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The price was good to me too.&lt;br /&gt;Engine was strong and calm.  </li>
            <li> Gives a very clean shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for myself, and liked it so much, I purchased 2 more for my sons!...</li>
            <li> Gosh, I&#x27;ve been using a Norelco (a cheaper one), which was pretty good.</li>
            <li> The first time i use this shaver, i was amazed by how close it can shave; it is nearly as good as razor blades.</li>
            <li> My first Panasonic lasted 15 years ,, this one feels just as good,  holds a charge for about 14 shaves.</li>
            <li> Pretty good.</li>
            <li> PRETTY GOOD TOO.</li>
            <li> Better than my last Panasonic, which was very good at the time.</li>
            <li> The new Panasonic Wet/Dry shaver works great in and out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Even dry with a bit of beard the shaver was GREAT!  </li>
            <li> This one works much better providing a closer and more comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean &amp;</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to clean using the procedure outlined in the manual.  </li>
            <li> I consider this charger absolutely perfect as I cannot fine a single fault in it and gladly give 5 stars to it.</li>
            <li> If possible, it&#x27;s best to let the battery run all the way down and then recharge it fully to get the best charge capacity.  </li>
            <li> The new swivel head is very nice and the charge lasts for weeks.</li>
            <li> I have tried different products, trimmer etc and by far this is the greatest investment I have ever done; I&#x27;m like super happy, completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> The female razors didn&#x27;t have very good reviews</li>
            <li> I have found that foamed soap, or electric razor pre-shave product (like Williams &amp;#34;Lectric Shave&amp;#34;), used before a shower, to be the most effective shaving method with this shaver.</li>
            <li> I have the Panasonic 8243 also and find it shaves more comfortably and closer than this one.  </li>
            <li> i bought this shaver to replace my old panasonic ,which did a great job, but the battery was to the point</li>
            <li> is my first Electric shaver and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> , it also works smoothly and efficiently, but there&#x27;s no question that the Panasonic gives a closer shave, and includes much better features.  </li>
            <li> Great shaver replacing my old one.</li>
            <li> also use it wet and have been very happy with it</li>
            <li> can be back at full charge  Very happy with it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lighter in weight, and more comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic shaver, keeps a charge for many shaves.  </li>
            <li> The flexible pivoting head allows for a more precise shave around the contours of your face.</li>
            <li> I found that none of them performed any better than the others, so I ended up keeping a cheap model.</li>
            <li> It is also great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> 13 years only one blade, incredible.</li>
            <li> There are two primary reasons that I simply love this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, this is a great razor for high-school/college age guys with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it wet or with shaving cream, so I cannot comment on performance in that scenario; but I suspect it would be superb.</li>
            <li> Electric shavers aren&#x27;t going to replace manual ones any time soon, but if you are looking for one, my experience over 6 weeks as far as the durability, battery life and shaving experience of this one are great.  </li>
            <li> This used to work great on my old shaver</li>
            <li> This shaver is gentle and gives a good, close shave.</li>
            <li> this is also quite reasonable given the costs of good disposable razors in Australia).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- battery lasts a good ~8 shaves; charges extremely fast</li>
            <li> Brauns used to be good with this, not so much lately.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This looked like a good choice thanks to all the reviews.</li>
            <li> very impressed with panasonic in general, and this one gets it right.  </li>
            <li> For me, it was an eye-opener, because I was actually able to shave more quickly, and without any irritation.</li>
            <li> Right off the bat, I liked the look of the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It cleans easily and charges very quickly.</li>
            <li> For many years I used a couple of different Remington Microscreen razors and was happy with them.</li>
            <li> is so easy.</li>
            <li> Overall, this shaver is impressive and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> It charges very quickly, perhaps an hour</li>
            <li> I had an opportunity to test this Panasonic ES-LT41-K, and while it doesn&#x27;t compare to the Panasonic ES-LA63-S, it easily beats both the Philips Norelco and Panasonic ES8043SC in performance.  </li>
            <li> Easy to take apart to clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> easy to use and clean, affordable, but more noisy than philips</li>
            <li> Recharges very quickly.  </li>
            <li> The comb cutter with the slots gets those pesky throat hairs, or makes a shaveless weekend easy shaving Monday morning.  </li>
            <li> Not so easy getting at the cross-growing hairs with an electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s not as easy as it could be.to connect and charge.  </li>
            <li> My 5 O&#x27;clock shadow phase is now officially over.t or dry.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to rinse off and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s not as easy as it could be.to connect and charge.  </li>
            <li> This has been a great replacement for my old Braun and a huge improvement over the Norelco I tried.  </li>
            <li> The foil dents easily</li>
            <li> It comes apart easily, and also has a cleaning setting which does help.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely the best shaver I have had by far.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, plastic quality.</li>
            <li> Well made and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning under the water is easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning is easy.</li>
            <li> If I used it with soap or shaving cream I&#x27;d probably want to clean more often to avoid scummy build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cleaning is easy.</li>
            <li> Cleans easily, charges in about an hour and battery lasts for about a 8 to 10 shaves.</li>
            <li> is easy and battery life seems generous.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Cleans easily and has pivoting head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just so easy.  </li>
            <li> Easy to carry.</li>
            <li> Love that you can clean it with water.</li>
            <li> My husband is finally able to get a clean shave with an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I get cuts easily and shaving used to be a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the feature where it reminds you when to clean.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning is easy -</li>
            <li> It cleans as easily as promised.  </li>
            <li> I did not think the shave was as good as my previous Panasonic electric, not horrible, but not as good.</li>
            <li> The razor worked fairly well, gave a decent shave.</li>
            <li> the owners manual, the creators have a strong clam that the user won&#x27;t have the desire to shave with anything else, if used for a minimum of 30 days.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just as good as what I was doing with a blade, but far more convenient.  </li>
            <li> After my old Braun gave up I decided to try this unit because of so many good things I read about it.</li>
            <li> I used an older version of this shaver for 5 or 6 years and loved it.</li>
            <li> Mainly electric razor good.</li>
            <li> High quality shaver, but is maybe too good for my skin.</li>
            <li> Light and let me have a clean shaving !</li>
            <li> If they improved this it would be a pretty amazing device.  </li>
            <li> shaver has a very \\&quot;cool\\&quot; look, but more importantly, it has some nice features.</li>
            <li> Rinse the foil separately under cool water, shake to remove most of the moisture and</li>
            <li> Nice touch is I&#x27;m in the comfort of a hot shower.</li>
            <li> Cool running and performed much better than Norelco rotary shaver.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for an electric shaver to be as good (or better) than a triple (or more) blade shaver, it&#x27;s just not possible.  </li>
            <li> The shaving head has the option for you to lock it in place or let it follow the contours of your face and the ability to do both really provides a good, clean shave.  </li>
            <li> great, thanks very much.</li>
            <li> New to electric razors, works good.</li>
            <li> The LCD is simply fabulous and easy to read.  </li>
            <li> in all it works fine.  </li>
            <li> This is a fine product for the money.</li>
            <li> It does a fine job on my teensy chin hairs and post menopausal mustache, and in a pinch it can do your legs or arms.  </li>
            <li> I like the easy cleaning and the smooth skin</li>
            <li> This one shaves very quickly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li> This thing deals with the three-day stubble just fine, including my neck.  </li>
            <li> (Doesn&#x27;t make it any less of an awesome shaver though!).</li>
            <li> This razor charges quick!  </li>
            <li> Super!  </li>
            <li> He was happy to get it as he is handicapped and needs a good electric razor for his very heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to operate without reading the manual, cleans up beautifully with a little liquid soap and water, and retains it&#x27;s charge just fine.  </li>
            <li> Amazing product that performs flawlessly with precision gently shaving with unbelievable closeness unlike the many like assorted products I&#x27;ve used over the years.</li>
            <li> Works great in the shower and great the old fashion dry way.</li>
            <li> It is also very easy to clean after every shave and the battery is good for 10 to 12 sessions before it actually tells you to insert the charger.  </li>
            <li> They take more than one pass because they easily bend away -- but my old Norelco rotary took many more to get them.  </li>
            <li> It will take a little time to figure out how to best use a given electric</li>
            <li> The trimmer is excellent it helps in spots that you want a little closer.  </li>
            <li> It is a little noisy, but it is one of the best razors I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li> Yes, it takes some time to get used to; and yes it is very good if wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> He likes it because it works really fast and his skin is nice and smooth when done</li>
            <li> Near perfect so far.</li>
            <li> tried wet cut, but i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charges</li>
            <li> This by far has been the best shaver i have owned thus far.</li>
            <li> Being able to use it wet or with soap or shaving cream is great.  </li>
            <li> Light weight, battery lasts well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Well designed, light and fits the hand, extremely easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It seems that within one day you would have to shave again to keep it smooth.</li>
            <li> but it does a great job with my coarse hair and her almost invisible peach fuzz on her arms</li>
            <li> Avery smooth close to the skin shave.</li>
            <li> Easy clean up, no costly add on alcohol bath required.</li>

            <li> Gives a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> The shave is smooth, with no burn.</li>
            <li> Sound level was measured at 2 inches from shaver head.</li>
            <li> More economical as well</li>
            <li> It really does offer a lot of nice features.  </li>
            <li> I really want nice things in my life.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- extremely easy to clean (no need to buy those auto-cleaners)</li>
            <li> Although I do use my bladed razor to finish up against the grain, it gets so close even the bladed razor is smooth.</li>
            <li> Gives me a smooth and close shave</li>
            <li> Otherwise, fantastic model from Panasonic and I would recommend it with all my heart.</li>

            <li> I really like this electric shaver, it fits nice in the hand and has plenty of speed and power.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works very well and it has a nice looking on/off button that also has a locking feature to prevent the shaver from accidentally turning on when not in use.</li>
            <li> It does a fantastic job of protecting the skin while shaving.</li>

            <li> It comes out of the dispenser as a light foam, but virtually disappears when applied to the face.</li>
            <li> I have had three different Panasonics for review now and each has turned out to be a joy,</li>
            <li> Power tools are top notch, pricey but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The feaures in the ES-LT41-K fit my intended usage.  </li>
            <li> Close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> It primarily shows the battery and cleaning status.  </li>

            <li> and I like how easy it is to clean.</li>
            <li> This is a well made and easy to clean razor.</li>
            <li> but this razer was great for a year until it simply wouldnt turn on.</li>
            <li> The lockable power button and secure shaver head cap make travel</li>
            <li> The free carrying case is the cheapest thing I have seen.  </li>
            <li> The one thing I have to say is that it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Cheap replacement parts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really enjoy this and hope it lasts forever.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean</li>
            <li> /&gt;Gives me a close, smooth shave without irritation.</li>
            <li> The razor shaves close and is easy to clean up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d probably be thrilled spitless if the head was straight.  </li>
            <li> he says how fantastic a product this is.</li>
            <li> I rated a 4 because: It takes me about 4+ minutes per shave because I like a really smooth finish.  </li>
            <li> After using a razor for months, my skin was smooth, but it had somewhat of an irritated look on my neck area.</li>
            <li> Some people have commented about the sound of the razor.  </li>
            <li> The sound, however, is not annoying and within a week, you won&#x27;t even notice it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It cuts close, doesn&#x27;t pull the hair, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s the 2nd one I&#x27;ve owned and works great in the shower.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, clean and charge.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> I would say 99% as smooth as razor</li>
            <li> Three hours after shaving this morning and my face is still smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> Shave is close and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I should note that I have a light beard.</li>
            <li> It fit all the bills.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth to the touch after shaving and zero irritation.</li>
            <li> So if this is my last razor, i&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li> They had 4 or even 5 blade models available too, but the cost difference didn&#x27;t make sense to me.</li>
            <li> It feels substantial yet comfortable in your hand.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts for 8-10 days (3-4 minutes/shave); this is fabulous.</li>
            <li> , THIS HAS A SMOOTH SHAVING EXPERIENCE FOR HIM.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean under tap.</li>
            <li> It easy to use, clean, and maintain.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and recharges in about an hour.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of work and moving against the grain, stretching the skin, but I can get a smooth and close shave with no razor-burn in 3-5 min.  </li>
            <li> Overall this is a great product.  </li>
            <li> Well balanced and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> It shaves amazingly smoothly and close.</li>
            <li> An extremely comfortable shave -</li>
            <li> is the best electric razor I have ever used and as a senior I have a few</li>
            <li> One plus over the cheap Remington, the cutoff beard pieces stay inside the Panasonic head, as opposed to flying all over the bathroom sink and vanity as they did with the Remingtons.</li>
            <li> and it worked fantastic.</li>
            <li> Also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Does not chafe giving a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m quite happy.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Light weight.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, and battery</li>
            <li> It is light and sleek.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> The Arc 3 is smooth and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;a clearance rack for CHEAP.  </li>
            <li> Plus, the Panasonics are easy to clean with&lt;br /&gt;plain</li>
            <li> This may work for a light beard, but not mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I use it with shaving cream, it is great overall.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and to clean.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable in my hands</li>
            <li> and I like how easy to clean it.</li>
            <li> Good deal if you are an early riser like me.</li>
            <li> hope its lifespan is many, many years, because I really do like this razor.  </li>
            <li> hope its lifespan is many, many years, because I really do like this razor.  </li>
            <li> Far superior to the remington it replaced.</li>
            <li> This tells me that the shaver is good for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This tells me that the shaver is good for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Good upgrade from my 7 year old norelco.</li>
            <li> It boggles my mind that anyone would spend any more money than this on a shaver when this one does such a good job.  </li>
            <li> so far so good.  </li>
            <li> But, so far, so good</li>
            <li> It takes some patience to get used to going over same areas again and again for perfect smoothness, and doing the chin is really demanding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given it 2 months and so far so good.  </li>
            <li> I am very glad I opted for the new razor instead.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband who has been through a lot of electric shavers, so far he&#x27;s had this one about a yr and still loves it, charges fast and gives good shave!</li>
            <li> My dad absolutely loves it!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned several Braun razors for about 10 years now, and LOVE this panasonic compared to them!!...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver!!!!</li>
            <li> Quiet performance and holds the charge very nicely.</li>
            <li> but this was a very useful feature when you want to take it traveling</li>
            <li> Extremely quiet, but very effective.  </li>
            <li> It is also easy to clean and keep clean without the use of oils or a brush.</li>
            <li> The only problem he has had is cleaning the blades, but once he understood it could be washed clean, he was happy.</li>
            <li> The price is right, works perfectly for my legs and unwanted hairs on some other areas of your body.</li>
            <li> Second, for the closeness of the shave, it does a very good job; again, better than my Remington was with new blades.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fit my face and clean any part of my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this shaver to be very easy to use and it cuts very well.  </li>
            <li> It gives a nice, smooth, comfortable shave and is the most quiet electric shaver I have used.  </li>
            <li> After going through many electric razors in the $30 to $100 range, I have now found a new favorite, and it&#x27;s not even a rotary!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is also easy to clean and quick to charge.  </li>
            <li> What I like it charges fast and is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean, does a great job, charges quickly, and the blades and foil are supposed to go a fairly long time before needing replacement.    </li>
            <li> Just took my first shave with it and find it gives a MUCH better shave than the Phillips had.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor to replace a 10 year old panasonic shaver and I am very glad I did.  </li>
            <li> After 2 months its working great and battery life is surprisingly long.</li>
            <li> This razor while nice for keeping my beard under control with daily shavings isn&#x27;t meant for much more then light stubble.  </li>
            <li> Love how all tech related products are getting better and cheaper!</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve settled on Panasonic as my favored brand over Braun and Norelco long ago).</li>
            <li> As for the cleaning stand, I use mine mostly for charging and rarely for cleaning because simply cleaning the razor with soap and water is faster, cheaper, quieter, and just as good (</li>
            <li> My first shaver from HITACHI was phenomenal.</li>
            <li> This will condition the battery and extend its like significantly.</li>
            <li> To me, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> ; First the feel of the shaver has been improved through the addition of a more textured plastic material.</li>
            <li> At first, the readout started going wacky (just like my Panasonic es8109).</li>
            <li> dropped a star from the original review.</li>
            <li> dropped a star from the original review.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not really disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as smooth a shave as the Braun, but it&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li> So far, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great Battery life, close shave, waterproof, easy to clean, and minimal irritation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very good for those \\&quot;unmentionable\\&quot; areas, both on myself and my fiance, who agrees that it causes less irritation than a razor.    </li>
            <li> This would be fine if used only for sideburns, but not so good to make a clean continuous line defining the neck beard.</li>
            <li> (when you use it for 3 minutes at a time).v&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**It indicates power reserve in 10% increments as well as when to clean and charge it.</li>
            <li> I had forgotten how much simpler and quicker and more comfortable shaving can be.</li>
            <li> TO CLEAN:  </li>
            <li> It has an indicator for when it needs cleaning, though I don&#x27;t rely on that as I clean it after each use.  </li>
            <li> Good hand-held fit design.</li>
            <li> Once per week or per recharge, add liquid/gel anti-bacterial soap to the foil while it is installed over the blades and turn on the shaver to help lather up the soap and clean the metal surfaces.  </li>
            <li> I was able to get the top done faster and easier than with my old electrics or a blade.  </li>
            <li> The most important is really close shave.</li>
            <li> It is a clean cut.</li>
            <li> &gt; Clean up</li>
            <li> My 15-year old Norelco (similar to [[ASIN:B001AJ6YS2 this model - Norelco 7310]] does a superb job in 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li> Shave it clean.</li>
            <li> This is perfect especially since it&#x27;s a wet - dry which I think is the best of both worlds.</li>
            <li> Soap and water will clean this razor, no need for chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Cuts clean.</li>
            <li> Even as a dry shaver it does a great job.</li>
            <li> For the clean cut look this is a must.</li>
            <li> A quick and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I figured I would try some kind of electric razor, so I could get a good shave, everyday.</li>
            <li> Was hoping for more from all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I went with the Panasonic based on so many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the Panasonic ES-LT41-K shaver after reading many positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It went smooth from the very first use.</li>
            <li> But since then, it hasn&#x27;t done that great a job, leaving neck hairs and actually chafing the skin right under my chin.</li>
            <li> and this is the first time I&#x27;ve noticed a less than perfect shave.</li>
            <li> It gives a very fine shave with one day and two day old beards, and is easy to keep clean without the bells and whistles of</li>
            <li> I really like how well it does shave and is very comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> After owning this shaver for a whole year, it is still gives me a very comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> After owning this shaver for a whole year, it is still gives me a very comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> To do that, you apply some liquid hand soap and water to the outer foil (while it&#x27;s on the shaver), and press the power switch for more than 2 seconds, which activates the sonic cleaning mode (you hear a high-pitch sound as the blades vibrate super fast).</li>
            <li> The pivoting head and special cleaning mode don&#x27;t do anything for me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This shaver works so much better than my older one!</li>
            <li> Upgraded from a Philips Norelco Powertouch with Aquatec that I had been happy with, but the charging port on the razor gave out on me in roughly 14 months of us.</li>
            <li> This razor offers an amazingly close shave without chafing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He said it cut beautifully, whether he had a light beard or a heavy mustache.</li>
            <li> A great advantage is the presence of wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I like the cleaning options with soap as well.shave is good enough for me</li>
            <li> My father said, he never used such a good shaver.</li>
            <li> is simple, which has helped to keep the blades in good shape.</li>
            <li> It works well and has a good, solid build.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought the basic drugstore $25-$40 type electric razors, none of which were good.</li>
            <li> You will never get the same close shave with an electric as you so with a blade, but you also won&#x27;t get razor burn, which is a fair trade for</li>
            <li> If this is true for you, you might consider trying the Alba Botanica Moisturizing Foam Shave.</li>
            <li> The shave head has a good size to it that allows for a quicker shave and comes with your standard head lock feature.  </li>
            <li> Overall I think it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> This makes it much quieter, more of a hum than growl.</li>
            <li> Shave is very close and price is better than I would have thought.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a full two weeks.  </li>
            <li> The razor does a good job of cleaning up all hair above the chin line, but once you get below that, its like trying to shave a gorilla with a disposable razor.</li>
            <li> Full 14 shaves on a charge.</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise the Panasonic works much better for me.</li>
            <li> Then pass the blade portion of the shaver under cool tap water until the shavings are rinsed off.  </li>
            <li> Remove the foil and rinse the foil and blades separately under cool tap water.  </li>
            <li> Wet/Dry function is a nice option for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I think it is good enough for you.</li>
            <li> And we just charge it for 1 hr that already full battery .</li>
            <li> This one got such good reviews</li>
            <li> The reviews we read were true.  </li>
            <li> This thing is just really a work of art more than a razor.</li>
            <li> For a more intense cleaning, you can use the Sonic Vibration Mode.</li>
            <li> Holds a full week charge, and recharges in about an hour.</li>
            <li> I really dislike shaving, a lot, but I look better when I&#x27;ve shaved</li>
            <li> it holds up as good as my Brauns, I&#x27;ll be back!!!!....</li>
            <li> so good enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll write a full review of the Norelco at that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll write a full review of the Norelco at that</li>
            <li> If it were to break today, I would not hesitate to buy another one immediately -- even if I had to pay full price.  </li>
            <li> I can do a quick clean up before going out or before bed</li>
            <li> My criticisms are just that it&#x27;s not the closest shave in the world, and I&#x27;d really rather that it just plugged in rather than running off a battery, the battery is just something that will have to be replaced eventually, and I always use it where there&#x27;s a mirror (and places to plug it in), Most models do seem to be battery based</li>
            <li> I was getting tied of my old 10+year old Norelcos and wanted to give this a shot, since it had so many good reviews.  </li>
            <li> Good shaves, and I know when the charge is running low.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dropped it multiple times from a good 4 feet</li>
            <li> Love the battery recharge meter and fast recharge.</li>
            <li> It provides a smooth shave and is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> but Amazon had such a good price that I thought I would try it.  </li>
            <li> the plus side, battery life is good enough and it recharges quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad at all though.</li>
            <li> it doess the job and is easy to charge and holds a charge longer than most shaver do and my man is has no trouble using it</li>
            <li> Luckily, the main shaver head actually does a good job there!</li>
            <li> , is very easy to use, has a meter to show how much charge is left and has a nice head to contour around your face.  </li>
            <li> * Shaving in wet mode is a very nice feature (plus, you can rinse it in water, making cleaning</li>
            <li> It shaves very clean and fast.</li>
            <li> Panasonic gives me the closest shave I&#x27;ve experienced, around ALL areas of the face and neck, and with no burn, snags, or other problems.</li>
            <li> Well, I pulled the trigger on this Panasonic and figured I&#x27;d use it for one full month to be able to really see if it was worth it or</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much after the Braun which has a pretty good reputation.</li>
            <li> He was so happy when his other shaver died so he could purchase this one.</li>
            <li> It will get a good amount, but because of the flat hairs, I still have to give a quick swipe with a blade razor, depending on length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product to own if you find yourself trimming everyday.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the tradeoff, though I do usually clean up with a razor to catch hairs and stubble</li>
            <li> charge indicator is a HUGE plus, it&#x27;s nice knowing when you&#x27;ve got 10% left!</li>
            <li> I get about 5 or 6 shaves between charges, and found that it recharges fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> I ordered another different model, same company and that one is excellent.</li>
            <li> Quick charging (0% to 100% in 30 minutes)&lt;br</li>
            <li> &quot; me from shower shaving; now I can just grab it and get a quick shave anytime</li>
            <li> quick charge</li>
            <li> Again, quick and easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have the same basic shape and ergonomics - excellent in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The razor has some nice features and ergonomics, but for the price I expected a better shave.  </li>
            <li> i like this razor cause it is does its job quickly</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard and have sported a goatee for more than 20 years which requires a good trimmer to maintain.  </li>
            <li> The battery life performs as advertised requiring the razor to be charged once a week, I have not had to depend on the quick charge feature yet</li>
            <li> Smooth, comfortable, and fast shave.</li>
            <li> It cuts very well, is flexible and easy to clean with water.  </li>
            <li> Quick close shave.</li>
            <li> Better than his older one.</li>
            <li> The charger recharges the battery quickly in 1 hour</li>
            <li> Recharging goes quickly.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean, and gets really close.  </li>
            <li> However, there were some mild skin irritation after the shave.</li>
            <li> This shaver has been very well designed to shave well, clean easily, and maintain.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through more than one Braun, more than one Norelco, and I&#x27;m on my second Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Battery charges quickly and lasts about a week between charges.</li>
            <li> Works well, no bells and whistles but does adequate job for the money.</li>
            <li> It charges quickly.</li>
            <li> This razor isn&#x27;t for someone looking for a quick shave.</li>
            <li> Gave me a nice smooth feeling without the irritation and rawness of a regular razor.</li>
            <li> This replaced an earlier model of the same shaver that I was very happy with.</li>
            <li> So if your looking to make the switch from blades, which are increasingly more expensive over time, this razor is among the best.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge as well as recharging quickly.</li>
            <li> Cleaning is quick and effortless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always stuck with the Norelco rotary razors, because I could never find a foil razor that would adequately cut the hair on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like how it works and how easy it is to clean and handle.</li>
            <li> I can quick shave in 5 minutes at 5pm before going out.  </li>
            <li> Well designed and constructed and recharges quickly.</li>
            <li> Charges quickly.  </li>
            <li> The very first shave convinced me.  </li>
            <li> Particularly good price/quality value in comparison to other available shavers.</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;m a woman, so this may be a fantastic product for men.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The light weight worried me at first</li>
            <li> People have also noticed the difference in how smooth my skin is, since I have been consistently using this shaver.</li>
            <li> People have also noticed the difference in how smooth my skin is, since I have been consistently using this shaver.</li>
            <li> We have tried other electric razors, but this one is by far the best!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other Panasonic razors but this is the best so far.  </li>
            <li> While it does not give me the same results as a razor does, I am very pleased with the job that it does.</li>
            <li> have used the shaver several times since I purchased it and have been very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> It also charges very fast and shows the percentage of remaining charge, which is very useful and convenient.</li>
            <li> and I find it seems sharper after doing a cleaning - the higher pitched clicking sound of hairs being cut seems restored after cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now I wish that I had not struggled so long trying to get a good shave with my Phillips Norelco rotary blade shaver.  </li>
            <li> Shaving is good as long as your skin gets accustomed to it</li>
            <li> shaver has  such a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li> He said it really works well.&lt;br /&gt;Shave quick, easy and evenly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind shaving as much anymore, quick and easy.</li>
            <li> The only thing I liked better on my former Braun was the pop up trimmer is much better on the Braun.  </li>
            <li> My husband is enjoying &amp;#34;getting to know&amp;#34; his new razor.  </li>
            <li> It has a good looking no nonsense led readout that lets you know how much battery charge is left and also reminds you to clean it when it&#x27;s time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy, much quieter</li>
            <li> The price is very affordable, easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is my sons first razor, so I wanted something simple and with a good review.</li>
            <li> last pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this new purchase and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is not only cheaper, but it does a better job of shaving for me!  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take longer than the first shave for me to be sold on it!  </li>
            <li> This is my fourth or fifth Panasonic razor - there just isn&#x27;t anything better!</li>
            <li> I tried different combinations (after a shower, in the shower etc) but it seemed to work best when your face is dry</li>
            <li> The shaver-head lock, power-button lock, and LCD display features are nice upgrades that you typically pay more for with Braun shavers and it includes a protective plastic foil-cover and a storage bag for travel.</li>
            <li> : does not shave as rapidly as two older models I have; cannot operate when plugged in - my Norelco, and older Panasonic models will do so &amp; it&#x27;s handy if battery is discharged.</li>
            <li> He gets several shaves from one charging and it&#x27;s very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Any way, I am really happy so far and can see it&#x27;s going to make my shaving live so much easier.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Any way, I am really happy so far and can see it&#x27;s going to make my shaving live so much easier.</li>
            <li> The shave is great, i only use it dry, but love that i can run it under water for cleaning afterwards.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts at least a week of good use and charges rapidly (less than an hour).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a lock on the power button which is perfect since I travel a lot.</li>
            <li> to clean - run it under hot water &amp; in about 15 seconds</li>
            <li> My favorite way of shaving is to use William&#x27;s &#x27;Lectric Shave before shaving, which provides nice lubrication without the mess of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Pro&#x27;s:  easy to clean; not excessively noisy; recharges rapidly&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li> I eventually just used hot soap and water to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Panasonic is a nice sized product, but the battery life and the quality of the shave are not as good as I&#x27;ve had in the past with much older Braun and Norelco products.  </li>
            <li> Besides , this shaver outlooks is very modern , pretty and light .</li>
            <li> It just does a great job on a wet face!!!</li>
            <li> So much quieter and smooth.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic has performed very well in this situation, in fact it is as comfortable as the Braun and gets the job done in</li>
            <li> I got a fast, smooth, close shave.</li>
            <li> Tone of the shaver is not tuned as well as the Braun (no joke they tune the sound of the motor to be pleasing) who cares really</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard and have had a great experience using this with Williams Lectric Shave as well as shaving cream in the shower.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve been using mine almost everyday for 8 months now and the razor still feels great.  </li>
            <li> Of all the Panasonic lasted the longest, in 2005 I got a ES8077 for Christmas and after a few foil and head replacements, it still worked great, eventually though it started showing it&#x27;s wear and battery life diminished, the flip out trimmer broke</li>
            <li> close smooth shaves....and fast</li>
            <li> It was painless and reasonably fast, and almost perfectly smooth.</li>
            <li> He has used it a few times now and is extremely happy.</li>
            <li> The power meter is well worth it</li>
            <li> but I rarely use it.  </li>
            <li> I think that this is because my face is oval, not round, so the narrower head works better for me.</li>
            <li> I love it so far.  </li>
            <li> Update: just tried a wet shave with Body Shop shaving cream, and it gives an even closer shave, close enough to blades, without the cuts; very impressive.</li>
            <li> But then again, a shaver can be a lot more comfortable to use, especially on your lip and chin (where it can feel like your beard is being pulled out, rather than cut, with a razor).  </li>
            <li> Some may find it useful, but to me the cleaning station seems like a holdover from the days of harder-to-clean models.  </li>
            <li> Some may find it useful, but to me the cleaning station seems like a holdover from the days of harder-to-clean models.  </li>
            <li> Another point with foil versus rotary head razors is irritation, which I infrequently experience but some friends experience at a far greater rate.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;Oh, and as far as body hair----it does ok on the chest.....I still prefer to use a blade for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> hope this review helps, especially since I do not write too many, but I was asked to rate this by Amazon.due to the razor since I know my face doesn&#x27;t stay smooth all day after using a blade.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh, and as far as body hair----it does ok on the chest.....I still prefer to use a blade for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This model is noticably lighter and more efficient than our old model.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer at the back can be extended and used as an effective hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> However, this Panasonic gives a far better shave than the Braun ever did.</li>
            <li> I dont think this product is worth the money.</li>
            <li> The last three razors I have purchased were Remington foil style and have always liked the shave.  </li>
            <li> Braun was much better but it still burned in sensitive areas of my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised and pleased with the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Overall, fast motor, keeps a great charge and able to place under water for rinsing which I only do once in awhile.</li>
            <li> My 96 year old father has used many razors over his 75+ years of shaving.  </li>
            <li> The feel in your hand allows you to mention a really good grip even if hands are wet.</li>
            <li> Hope this helps some one if you are on the fence about which model to get this might really be worth a try for you.</li>
            <li> This was a far better value and shaver than I ever imagined.  </li>
            <li> Either way, a smooth and comfortable shave will be the aftermath of complete use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most important of all, it produces similar shaving results as razor blade.</li>
            <li> Better shave than my old Norelco rotary.</li>
            <li> It is a bit noisy, but it&#x27;s just a different kind of pitch for a shaver.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t have as many passes to clear your face and</li>
            <li> Whether or not this is worth a price point</li>
            <li> Even at 100% charge I find I&#x27;m going over the same places too many times to get a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> so much better than my old remington 5300</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Shaves closely, no irritation, powerful, and fast.&lt;br /&gt;Convenient charge level indicator....</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Works as described and is worth</li>
            <li> I liked it enough that I almost bought another Braun but thought I would take a chance on the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> think that the Panasonic was worth the price paid.</li>
            <li> it would be cheaper than a year&#x27;s worth of Gilette razor cartridges ($3 per week</li>
            <li> I think this is pretty true.  </li>
            <li> I said not only is this so much quieter, but I get as good a shave as a razor, but without the razor burn.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that this shaver does not come with is a case which would be nice to use if you travel.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping to reduce the shave time, but I really feel it&#x27;s as good as it can get even with using a regular razor and dealing with the cuts and razor bumps.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping to reduce the shave time, but I really feel it&#x27;s as good as it can get even with using a regular razor and dealing with the cuts and razor bumps.  </li>
            <li> It has a real sturdy, well built feel,and I really like being able to use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I liked - travel lock on off/on switch and digital readout on charge.</li>
            <li> Charges in about 45 minutes which is better than the old shaver.</li>
            <li> The feel and closeness is much better than my old razor.</li>
            <li> and I like it even more than my old one.</li>
            <li> I am very well pleased and the price was quite reasonable also.</li>
            <li> The clean up is so easy - hold under water flow - no messy mini brush.</li>
            <li> and I have had lot of shavers during my life, but I have never had such a nice one.</li>
            <li> I had the 8096 model for 8 years which I liked (it was 3 times the price even back then).  </li>
            <li> I stayed with panasonic as he really liked his last one</li>
            <li> Besides the closer shave (the sine non quo of shaving), the Panasonic is much easier to clean, and is moreforgiving of user error (I accidently broke the head of the Philips when trying to clean it for the first time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shaving is excellent - close with very minimal irritation and it does even better if you have a little soap on your face.</li>
            <li> my old razor is shot...came at the right time for sure...</li>
            <li> The price was right and the shave is much better than my old Braun.</li>
            <li> This is a nice shaver, I should point out that the razor only goes into a horezontal position, not the up right that I am used too.</li>
            <li> The unit has a special high speed mode thatis supposed to make it easier to clean under the faucet.</li>
            <li> Great close shave, Super features Wet or Dry, Easy to clean, +</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; shave is an added bonus for that extra clean shave, but shaving dry gets the job done almost as good!</li>
            <li> Norelco was fine until years later when my skin started becoming more sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I bought this one with the thought that I was just going to use the trimmer as well, but was pleasantly surprised to find it very effective overall.</li>
            <li> I switched to a Braun 3 Series, highly recommended by a large consumer test organization, hoping the system would hold together better.</li>
            <li> For the price this is a great shaver, the trimmer works great, a little odd on the angle but cuts really well.  </li>
            <li> I have to go over the same area many times to get a clean shave&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can take the head off quickly and wash off the blades, it&#x27;s a fast cutter and shaves you quickly.</li>
            <li> I follow instructions precisely and clean it each time with soft soap under water.</li>
            <li> It is perfect the main reason I bought it was because its hypoallergenic one complaint</li>
            <li> If you are mainly looking for the shaver and not the part in the back that comes up, then this should be good.</li>
            <li> The first and only product that has ever been able to provide me with a close and comfortable share has been the Panasonic foil shavers.</li>
            <li> There are times when Amazon offers those at prices that beat the current, as of this writing new price, and then they are no-brainers, but I wouldn&#x27;t spend more than this on a razor knowing how good this one is.</li>
            <li> before finding Panasonic, a razor brand I&#x27;d seen but passed over because, well, they&#x27;re the company that makes radios, not razors, right?  </li>
            <li> I had a three day growth and this thing right out of the box after charged.</li>
            <li> I had no problems with the shape around my ears right below the jaw line.</li>
            <li> this right</li>
            <li> If I shave in the shower or right after than I don&#x27;t even need any pre-shave product.  </li>
            <li> just right it can nick you.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic is superior to any other electric razor I&#x27;ve used over the years, which includes most major brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of electric shavers in the past years but this has to be the best so far.</li>
            <li> It is SO MUCH easier to clean than my rotary shaver.  </li>
            <li> When I just want something fast and clean I will use this.  </li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t experience any pulling sensation on his beard and got a very close, clean shave.</li>
            <li> I have very strong facial hair</li>
            <li> But with a little bit of patience, you can get a remarkably close shave with this</li>
            <li> I would be cool with some shadow after I was done, but everything above my neck line is smooth, while my neck still has hairs significantly</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t shave against the grain because my skin gets highly irritated when I do that, so I&#x27;ve never had ultra-turbo-close shaves, but plenty smooth.  </li>
            <li> I should note that he isn&#x27;t super hairy, and I don&#x27;t know how it would compare to someone that grew thick facial hair, but for trimming and keeping the face clean it is top-notch.</li>
            <li> I recently upgraded to the newer ES-LT41K to try something new - I was debating whether to buy another 8103, which I have very much loved.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better ones; he especially likes that it shaves quickly.</li>
            <li> yes i can shave dry and fast and its a good shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is the best electric I have used for cutting hair on the back of my neck, and it  does a good job on those stray hairs forward of my bald spot that now seem out of place.</li>
            <li> The Norelco design just fits my face much better overall and provides a more natural hand grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great that it can be made rigid for those who might prefer it that way (though I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> One cannot just fly over the whiskers like an ordinary razor.  </li>
            <li> The included travel switch seemed useful at first</li>
            <li> Nice cut, charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Stays charged for a long time and has a handy trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d used previously, much less skin irritation, quick recharge time, very easy to clean, helpful % of charge remaining indicator, selectable floating or locked shave head, wet/dry shave option and lockable power button</li>
            <li> I find that the shave feels immediately the same - incredibly close, basically like using one of the better (multi-blade) disposable razors but doesn&#x27;t last as long.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The one hour charge feature, which is faster by far than most of its competitors (including other Panasonic electric shavers), is another nice plus.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I tried it at a right angle as per instructions.</li>
            <li> The fast, linear motor ensures a quick cut, eliminating pulling, tugging and irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> sum up, battery life isn&#x27;t good, and it doesn&#x27;t shave as close or as well as my previous Panasonic shavers.</li>
            <li> The motor is strong, not too loud, and dependable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast, free shipping from Amazon plus the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s marked which side is up, but not so easy to see with my eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s marked which side is up, but not so easy to see with my eyes.</li>
            <li> It is far superior to the last Braun that I had.</li>
            <li> Digital display and easy to clean with soap and water.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my beloved 13 year old Braun 6000 series (which was still working, but battery was finally dying).  </li>
            <li> and I can get more than several days worth of shaves.</li>
            <li> Reasonably quiet &amp; easy to clean.</li>
            <li> razor seems vastly superior to all foils I&#x27;ve used previously.</li>
            <li> I have to go every which way about 20 times to get 80% of the hairs, 20 % do not come out no matter what I do unless I resort to my old razor and that simply isn&#x27;t good enough.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and wanted to replace my ageing Norelco Smooth Skin razor.</li>
            <li> My first shave with this razor was great, felt smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind.</li>
            <li> He is thrilled with this gift and his handsome face has no more cuts!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seriously *almost* as good as a blade shave at this point, which is amazing to me, since previously I have never been able to get a truly close shave from an electric.&lt;br</li>
            <li> - Price if purchased from Amazon is *very* reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning the razor is amazingly easy too; as you can simply remove the foil, add soap directly to the blades, and clean the shaver in seconds, using the built in &#x27;sonic vibration cleaning mode&#x27;, which ups the CPM (cycles per minute) from 13,000 to 17,000, and will literally vibrate any debris free from the blades.</li>
            <li> products are very much alike.</li>
            <li> I like it very much</li>
            <li> Charges very fast.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say anything good about this shaver other than it will eventually do the job.</li>
            <li> Other than that it is a good fast shaver.  </li>
            <li> It still worked well before changing those items (very inexpensive and easy to change), but now that I&#x27;ve changed them, it&#x27;s like a brand spankin&#x27; new razor.  </li>
            <li> I finish off with a good splash of Witch Hazel, a little Nivea aftershave balm</li>
            <li> /&gt;**As far as closeness of the shave goes (one of the main points I look for more than anything in an electric shaver),</li>
            <li> - Cleaning is quick and easy, especially as it can be opened and run under the tap / faucet.  </li>
            <li> sweep the dry whiskers out of the blades and top foil, then give it a quick rinse under water.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this razor for a close, comfortable shave at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s has been seven months since first using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This works VERY well!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it does and the results...</li>
            <li> This is my first Panasonic (Japan/China).  </li>
            <li> The Arc 3 blade system flex and pivots to better conform to your facial contours.  </li>
            <li> I have red bumps mostly on my neck</li>
            <li> Second best is actually the Braun Total Control.</li>
            <li> The first thing that stood out about the Panasonic was the noise.</li>
            <li> I chose this shaver for the linear motor and higher rpm, and it gives me a smoother shave than mach whatever razors.</li>
            <li> First and foremost you can use it in the shower which means while I&#x27;m washing I can also be shaving.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I had to order an european plug adaptor with the shaver, because I will use it in Turkey:)</li>
            <li> razor does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and I believe it does it</li>
            <li> I had used a rotary shaver for close to 30 years and it did take me a while to adjust to this as it made my neck break out badly at first...</li>
            <li> I think that I have written more than enough!</li>
            <li> I cannot recommend this higher.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t necessarily an \\&quot;apples to apples\\&quot; comparison because the ES-LA63-S is 50% more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more thrifty price while maintaining the same shave</li>
            <li> it seems as if the head is consistently producing irritation on my skin.</li>
            <li> Decided to do some research, check reviews and such to see if I could get better results with an electric.  </li>
            <li> First time, I thought another Norelco.</li>
            <li> and I repeated the shaving so many times that I literally bled.&lt;br /&gt;After returning this shaver I bought BRAUN of same price category 70 dollars.</li>
            <li> Finally, if you are someone who lets your beard grow out at length before shaving, this razor, and most electric razors are not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Finally, if you are someone who lets your beard grow out at length before shaving, this razor, and most electric razors are not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The Braun that I used is nice but does not offer a wet-shave mode and is not easy to keep clean when traveling unless you pack (and check) the cleaning dock &amp; cleaning solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this to replace a panasonic pulsonic shaver, which is a higher end device.  </li>
            <li> /cleaning stand held together pretty well</li>
            <li> Again, purchasing the cleaning cartridges, which need to be changed about once a month, also became pretty expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, I am really glad that I made this purchase.  </li>
            <li> only because of having to go over an area more than once sometimes.  </li>
            <li> hope this review helps, especially since I do not write too many, but I was asked to rate this by Amazon.</li>
            <li> I missed the instructions to find out any more about this, but as of now I don&#x27;t get a regular razor close shave.  </li>
            <li> The first thing that caught my eye was the price.  </li>
            <li> , i didn&#x27;t give it 5 star since nothing is perfect although i cant find anything wrong with this machine yet.</li>
            <li> This one is more basic with no cleaning unit</li>
            <li> This is my first foil razor.</li>
            <li> As most folks know faces and whiskers come in various types and not all electric razors work well for all faces.</li>
            <li> for the trimmer attachement, Both the Panasonic and Braun trimmer attachments could have been made better and performed about the same.  </li>
            <li> Remove the foil then press and hold the power button for 2 seconds to activatethe  cleaning mode (higher frequency).</li>
            <li> I still use it, mostly as a wet shaver now, but still have to tidy up with a blade.</li>
            <li> This is the first time to use electric shaver.</li>
            <li> The shaver makes a relatively high-pitched noise which doesn&#x27;t seem to bother most people here but does bother me.  </li>
            <li> My first Mon</li>
            <li> and WOW, it did a fantastic job.  </li>
            <li> A blade shaves closer, but this is pretty darn close.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you will do the same.</li>
            <li> It actually trims better than my Remington trimmers.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I was weary spending the 80 or so bucks on this, but I can see that it is a great value and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> Because of the 13,000 cycles-per-minute speed, the razor definitely has more of a high-pitched buzz rather than a hum.  </li>
            <li> While I love the idea of no charging/cleaning station, Panasonic needs to rethink the needs of American men.</li>
            <li> This one holds a charge better than the last 2 but still needs a recharge at 60% and below.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned other Panasonic electric razors and they work the best compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s lighter in weight compared to the ES-8068.  </li>
            <li> Bought this razor for my son and he absolutely LOVES it!</li>
            <li> A few nice but modest upgrades from the ES-8103S line.feel of the shaver has been improved through the addition of a more textured plastic material.</li>
            <li> I believe it is because the razor helps with exfoliation much better than my standard loofah and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several Panasonic shavers in the past (wore them out) and this one appears to be the best I&#x27;ve used yet...</li>
            <li> A year later, and I&#x27;m still in love with this shaver, and I still haven&#x27;t needed to use a blade to \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; hairs that it&#x27;s missed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several months, and have been pleased.</li>
            <li> I went and purchased a Panasonic for the first time as I have been a Norelco owner for over 30 years.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I have tried the Norelco type electric shavers twice in the past , and this back and forth foil type shaver has worked best for my shaving purposes.</li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited 20 years to use an electric, but I&#x27;m glad I finally did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally satisfied and would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric razor I have ever used or owned.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Really I think the only thing I could have better for me is that I share my medicine cabinet with 3 roommates</li>
            <li> His skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I have not used an electric shaver in a number of years prior to owning this one, I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
            <li> Glad to have a Panasonic shaver back again.  </li>
            <li> The shaves aren&#x27;t as close as a blade, but it&#x27;s close enough for most purposes.</li>
            <li> Much better than the Braun that has you buying cleaning fluid.  </li>
            <li> Over the years I have used many different types and brands of electric razors.  </li>
            <li> In 7 years of marriage this is the FIRST gift I&#x27;ve given him that he uses, loves and is truly grateful for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is MUCH better than the Norelco I had...cuts closer everywhere on my face, especially up under my nostrils, which&lt;br /&gt;has</li>
            <li> I get a close shave with no skin irritation even after the first use.</li>
            <li> It just completely fails at getting any hair that isn&#x27;t perfectly set up for it to grab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had only used Braun shavers for many years.  </li>
            <li> I finally pulled the trigger on the Arc 3 and glad I did.  </li>
            <li> also love the pop up trimmer on the back side.</li>
            <li> This is mostly just in areas with hair growing in different directions like the jaw line, neck, and Adam&#x27;s apple.</li>
            <li> first had (2) Braun electric shavers ochancever a span of approx.</li>
            <li> liquid soap and hot water.  </li>
            <li> After 5 years the time had come to replace my first Panasonic and did</li>
            <li> If this last model lasts 10 years, i am sure i will purchase another Panasonic razor to replace this one.</li>
            <li> But after a while I figured it out that this predictable unreliability is a good thing</li>
            <li> Battery charges very quickly and holds it charge well - about a week or a little more for me.  </li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s light, durable, holds a charge a long time, has a form fitting carrying case, has a \\&quot;lock\\&quot;  button to prevent the razor from turning on while in your luggage, and provides a great shave - wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Much better than my old Braun was even when the Braun was new.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning is simple and effective, you just add a couple of drops of mild handsoap to the foils and turn on under a stream of water, the razor is so fast that it immediately starts to foam up and rense clean, ready for your next shave.</li>
            <li> I noticed that with a 3-day old beard the shaver worked best with a light touch to simply trim the beard down to a more manageable length, then go over the entire area once more with a slight pressure to get the closest shave.  </li>
            <li> I previously owned 3 Panasonic electric shavers and I was very satisfied with them.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job for a quick dry shave, and it does an even closer shave as the wet option.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a very slight foam that provides good lubrication.</li>
            <li> It charges quickly, is easy to clean, and has a very convenient display to tell you how much power is left and whether it needs to be cleaned.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is not bad, only not as clean and balanced as the Norelcos.</li>
            <li> You have to repeat certain areas more than twice, especially the neck and area&lt;</li>
            <li> With this shaver, even after the first shave, I haven&#x27;t experienced any sensitivity (keep in mind that I only &#x27;wet&#x27; shave) at all.</li>
            <li> It takes a little time for your skin to adjust but it&#x27;s convenient, relatively fast and gives a good shave.</li>
            <li> As I do have to use it in more than just &#x60;detail&#x27; areas, it is useful that it is wide.  </li>
            <li> I find that you have to go over areas a few times to get the desired close shave but easy to clean and quick charging time...</li>
            <li> By far the best wet and dry shaver out there.  </li>
            <li> Only downside is like most foil shavers, if you miss a whisker 2 days straight the foil won&#x27;t pick it up.</li>
            <li> The head on the ES8228S is more complex with more moving parts but</li>
            <li> Fast to charge,  holds a charge for many shaves, cuts with fewer passes, waterproof, quiet.  </li>
            <li> I was very close to pulling the trigger on another Braun in the same price range (Series 3-530cc), but many of the reviews claim that the Braun shavers have been inconsistent with shaving &amp;#34;closeness/smoothness&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer does not have a good locking mechanism so it constantly keeps folding back onto the device when trimming.</li>
            <li> Overall I think it is a good shaver for the price, which was key for</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with it &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; is that it does not feel good on my upper lip.  </li>
            <li> Louder than any of my Norelcos, battery life could be just a bit more for my needs (barely a week, but remember I shave both face and head which takes considerably longer and so uses more battery charge), requires multiple passes for the closest shave.</li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, it works fine so far, quiet and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I&#x27;m very satisfied and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Saw all the positive reviews on this Panasonic and gave it a shot.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading the positive reviews for the Panasonic ES-LT41-K</li>
            <li> This is by far the best electric shaver that I have used after switching from an old-fashioned double edge safety razor a few years ago.&lt;br /&gt;None</li>
            <li> oscillations in the blade are higher than a Braun (13K vs 10K)  at a much lower price</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is easy to clean and gets a closer shave than other brands as well.</li>
            <li> It operates at a much higher vibration rate and even has a supersonic cleaning speed that works very well under running water.</li>
            <li> real question is how this compares to the higher price point 4 and 5 blade Panasonics.  </li>
            <li> I first order the Norelco PT720 electric razor from Walmart and that thing really caused my neck to rash.</li>
            <li> I do NOT wet the razor as that dilutes the gel and causes the shave to not be as smooth.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the feel too much for the first week</li>
            <li> How wonderful to be back to a shaver that is QUIET, shaves close, and does what I expected from it.  </li>
            <li> Not a bad product, however I did not see any improvement in my shaving results when compared to my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> When I purchased the new one I was right back to a quick clean shave immediately.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall though I am happy with the shaver and feel it works well and is a good replacement for my older model, whether it will beat the record of 7 years is another question?ls in my ES8077, total shave time is not much better, of course I shave every morning and find myself passing over the same areas several times to get a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> However the price of the cartridges are getting more and more ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I had also has used a 3 blade rotary Norelco previously and it did ok, but the battery died too quickly</li>
            <li> This is the best one so far, much better shaving the neck area and cutting a two day old growth.</li>
            <li> This one has 3 blades, spins at high RPMs and shows the charge level in decrements of 10,shavers with the same spec 10 years ago would cost 2-3 times more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has been about two years now and it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as it did when new, or a close as my old Norelco (but better than the new cheaper Norelco</li>
            <li> close shave, simple  to clean, priced right</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not as easy for me to flip it open as the Braun&#x27;s trimmer which is mounted on the \\&quot;thumb\\&quot; side of the razor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s loaded with USEFUL featuresm including a percent power remaining indicator, a pop-up trimmer that actually works, a lock,&lt;br /&gt;a razor head that detaches for EASY cleaning and re-attaches firmly and easily, and extremely quick recharging</li>
            <li> Watch out using the trimmer anywhere super sensitive, ie downstairs.</li>
            <li> To help dry the shaver, re-activate the cleaning mode to shake off most of the moisture.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver for near 3 months, and i still get some mild skin irritation after shaving.</li>
            <li> multiple times&lt;br /&gt;- Easy cleaning without a cleaning stand</li>
            <li> Panasonic charges easily and holds the charge for several shaves.  </li>
            <li> Dry shaving performance is just ok.  </li>
            <li> Good shave, low noise, long kept charging.</li>
            <li> In general, I&#x27;d suggest spending a little more for the ES-LA63-S, which provides more closeness, and faster</li>
            <li> This replaced my Panasonic ES-SA40 single-head shaver bought 5 years ago (the single head is still better at shaving under the nose).</li>
            <li> I noticed that I have to go over a spot a couple of times, and it seems to help if I tighten my skin a bit by blowing out my cheeks while shaving certain spots.  </li>
            <li> that being said, I would certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li> Okay, I am new to electric razors, and female.</li>
            <li> There are times when Amazon offers those at prices that beat the current, as of this writing new price, and then they are no-brainers, but I wouldn&#x27;t spend more than this on a razor knowing how good this one is.able to get into the odd nooks of my neck/jawline that caused problems before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to remove the head/guard and rinse with water and in 20 seconds or less its completely clean.</li>
            <li> Charge lasts a long time and this thing has not disappointed at all!</li>
            <li> While similar in price to the old unit, this new model has one nice feature-</li>
            <li> Overall, the shave is fine.</li>
            <li> His skin is pretty sensitive and he is prone to getting red spots from other razors, but this worked great.  </li>
            <li> My hair is a little coarse and this thing just does a great job.  </li>
            <li> First I do a dry run, then after a splash of water and a pea sized amount of shaving gel I mow the lawn again, quick rinse, and swipe a moistened alcohol swab across my freshly shaved face.</li>
            <li> We both have sensitive skin and this little guy works good with out the rash.</li>
            <li> Noise wise it may be a little loud, but not irritating.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, due to the positive reviews I bought one of the Panasonic wet/dry shavers and it&#x27;s actually rather good... for an electric.  </li>
            <li> Charging is also amazing, as the shaver can be recharged in under an hour, and that charge will last through the entire week.</li>
            <li> Shaves very close and much easier than the Norelco which cost twice as much and in 6 months thrown away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the ES-LT41-K for my current deployment and it is a huge upgrade.</li>
            <li> It is quite, runs with alot of smooth power that really does an effficient job in short order.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s only accurate to tenths - 100%, 90%, 80%, etc.).  </li>
            <li> This product runs at an amazing speed and does give you a close shave, but it is not a smooth shave and if it catches your skin</li>
            <li> but it does have a better cut when your beard is wet.  </li>
            <li> Fast, Linear Motor Drive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a handful of electric shavers over the years, none work really well.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Hahahaha</li>
            <li> I have been using these Panasonic razors for quite some time, and they perform well, and are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s put together very well, recharges in practically no time and hold the charge well.  </li>
            <li> This shaver cuts closer and is quieter and with more features likes cleaning, shaving wet, etc.</li>
            <li> - The charging time and number of shaves seems reasonable.  </li>
            <li> - The build quality seems reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Trimmer works very well for sideburns, and around the ears.</li>
            <li> This item is not what I expected, its better off using a razor then this shaver.</li>
            <li> The Whal does really close</li>
            <li> I did&#x27;t expected that a machine can be better and closer than a three-bladed razor.</li>
            <li> It’s great on my legs, and to my surprise, isn’t irritating on my underarms—which the Close Curves was, so I couldn&#x27;t even use it there.  </li>
            <li> Both Panasonics give a close, comfortable shave however overall</li>
            <li> I really like the battery strength meter.</li>
            <li> electric gets very close to my face.</li>
            <li> I love that you can use shaving cream with it to keep it from getting too rough.</li>
            <li> No electric seems as close as a blade to me, although this one is VERY close to a blade.</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a Norelco that I bought at Costco and this shaves much closer than that one.</li>
            <li> The pop out trimmer works very well</li>
            <li> I have gotten between 3 and 4 shaves per charge, and that seems reasonable.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin, and figured all that hot water would help soften my beard and make the whole process easier, although I was still getting some redness and irritation afterwards.</li>
            <li> husband thanks to me for this choice.</li>
            <li> I had to use the beard trimmer (haha), which pulled.  </li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> I really like the LED battery display</li>
            <li> It missed hair so much</li>
            <li> It gives me such a close and smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Charged up fast...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been much of an electric razor fan because I&#x27;ve always felt that they didn&#x27;t provide the level of shave that I need/want.  </li>
            <li> I really like this shaver.</li>
            <li> So, if you are really looking for a close shave, I suggest trying something along the lines of [[ASIN:</li>

            <li> Recharging is very fast...impressed</li>
            <li> The Phillips has a pop-up trimmer, but it&#x27;s not part of the shaver, you have to store it until ready for use.  </li>
            <li> Very close shave.  </li>
            <li> and it still cuts smooth as silk and doesn&#x27;t require the back-and-forth effort my former shavers have required.</li>
            <li> I have found it much easier to just take a shaver brush (which really should be included)</li>
            <li> My husband thanks me every time he shaves.  </li>
            <li> No cuts, no pulled hairs (which is what I had always heard about electrics), and a really close shave.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Charges FAST.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning is much easier than the rotaries.</li>
            <li> I have been cut on my face by the middle part of the shaver head and have to go over my neck, cheek and chin area over and over again to get a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> So when that battery died and I saw that a replacement was almost as much as the razor, I switched to Panasonic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This gives a fantastic shave and it&#x27;s quiet.</li>
            <li> And this one has really micro-close shaving heads.</li>
            <li> And the battery meter is very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> see a lot of people saying they still need to use a straight edge razor once they are done with this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;About ready to return this for not providing the close shave it promises.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Norelcos really burned my face - all three models I used for years.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s reasonable sized for travel use.</li>
            <li> an electric really works well for me up</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very dinky.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t let you charge it while you&#x27;re using it, which I don&#x27;t really like.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I get a real close shave, but to get it, go vertical and then at the end go horizontal.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m used to a straight razor in my hand.  </li>
            <li> Very close shave.  </li>
            <li> I really like this razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Features: This electric shaver is very versatile.</li>
            <li> If you buy this shaver and have any reservations after using it a couple of times, give it at the very minimum, 30 day chance.</li>
            <li> If you buy this shaver and have any reservations after using it a couple of times, give it at the very minimum, 30 day chance.</li>
            <li> Works very well and gives as close a shave as any electric razor I have used.  </li>
            <li> and my fiance really appreciates me not having sandpaper-face.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t fault the shaver too much.  </li>
            <li> is really up to the buyer.  </li>
            <li> It performs its intended task very well.  </li>
            <li> I bought this Panasonic for $76 and really like it.</li>
            <li> I have 65\\&quot; plasman TV, a surround sound system, two digital cameras (one underwater), a cordless phone.</li>
            <li> As a modern day Sasquatch, this razor is a god send.</li>
            <li> so you cannot shave as fast as you could with a Remmington shaver.  </li>
            <li> ABSOLUTE GARBAGE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> He says it shaves very close and does not pull his skin at all.  </li>
            <li> I expected better than this.  </li>
            <li> fast</li>
            <li> Thanks Parasonic</li>
            <li> The Norelco is much quieter than the Panasonic (and Braun).</li>
            <li> The Norelco is much quieter than the Panasonic (and Braun).</li>
            <li> /&gt;To put it simply, this shaver is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it wet with my face soapy, and it does even better.</li>
            <li> and I really like the charge display indicator and the travel lock button.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it much</li>
            <li> Mostly I use it for a wet shave</li>
            <li> This one charges fast and cuts well.</li>
            <li> and it gets very close.</li>
            <li> This one shaves as well, but is much quieter.</li>
            <li> Product arrived very promptly and as described.</li>
            <li> nothing really to complain about.&lt;br</li>
            <li> High quality!</li>
            <li> I really wonder if the coarseness or thickness of your beard affects how well foil shavers work for you.</li>
            <li> It charges *fast</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have much room.  </li>
            <li> : Shaves much closer than any of the Norelcos</li>
            <li> I do like the LED panel that doesn&#x27;t try to give me too much information.</li>
            <li> Have to go over face multiple times but razor does a fantastic job giving a close shave.</li>
            <li> All that being said, this thing works really well.  </li>
            <li> I really like the feel and ease of use.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge very well</li>
            <li> I have found you don&#x27;t really need shaving cream though because it is so gentle.  </li>
            <li> It really work for me.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li> I had been purchasing cheap Remington foil razors, and after the last one started loosing the cutters every time I cleaned it</li>
            <li> that really is the only way to get a really superlative, BBS (baby bottom smooth) shave.</li>
            <li> It tells you how much charge you have left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver.</li>
            <li> You will have to use a straight razor.  </li>
            <li> If straight razors did not irritate my neck, I would never bother with these electric shavers.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to be as fast.</li>
            <li> Having used Norelco shavers for 40 years, I felt ready to try something else.</li>
            <li> In fact, I really can&#x27;t tell the difference.  </li>
            <li> it really didn&#x27;t shave well</li>
            <li> The cleaning notification does not come on very often though.</li>
            <li> The real problem area was my neck.</li>
            <li> - Really just the opposites of the advantages.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I shave in the shower and this really does the job.</li>
            <li> Works very well - the fast motor makes shaving a 5 minute task.</li>
            <li> Product shipped fast and works very well.</li>
            <li> Liked it enough to buy a second one for father in law when his died.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s nice to know when the battery is getting low - especially with the nifty e-meter!</li>
            <li> In my opinion, the charging stand is not necessary and the cleaning system is a throwback to a bygone error because newer products are easily cleaned compared to the older systems.  </li>
            <li> With my OLD electrics they&#x27;d get most of it, above and some below.</li>
            <li> I really liked it until I bought a Wahl which I now use everyday.</li>
            <li> I tried rotary and they pulled too much, then foils seemed better, but not much.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The number of shaves per charge decreases drastically if you have any kind of heavy growth.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I REALLY like it!!!</li>
            <li> He got a close, comfortable shave the first time, just using it dry.</li>
            <li> The razor charges quickly and is pretty quiet.</li>
            <li> I was looking quick and easy maintenance, do the job without fuss, close enough to do facial hair, ez charge and fast.</li>
            <li> maybe i found the new hot set up?  </li>
            <li> far everything is great - water proof (or at least splash proof), easy to clean, and 1 full charge gets approximately 10 shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;**It doesn&#x27;t pull your whiskers or leave your skin irritated and red like other shavers plus the trimmer is as good as my beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First, for others who think it is very loud, my Remington sounded like a chainsaw compared to this thing.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic is fabulous and far superior to any of the electrics I had used briefly in the past.  </li>
            <li> This shaver really hums along, much faster than my older model.</li>
            <li> The trimmer option does not do a good job unless you&#x27;re ready to spend a serious amount of time using it.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only problem I have, but it&#x27;s definitely a significant one.</li>
            <li> After originally being told that they would send me an advance replacement so that I would not be without a shaver, they called back to say that was an error</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will update the review if I have any issues with the durability of it, but my initial impression is that this is a biggest improvement I&#x27;ve had in shaving since I originally switched from rotaries to foil razors.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Since then, I have asked other electric razor users about their experiences with electric razors and most like them</li>
            <li> First, I thought more than 3 blades would be too bulky (plus more expensive to replace blades).</li>
            <li> Some of my facial hairs do not grow out in a consistent direction or grain, so I have some spots that are particularly prone to in-grown hairs, and mildly acne-prone skin.  </li>
            <li> He has used twin edge plastic blades for decades, and is excited at this different approach.  </li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve used all the major brands and some were better than others, but this Panasonic stands head and  shoulders above all the others.</li>
            <li> If you shave every other day, you may have to make more passes just to get the close shave.</li>
            <li> This particular razor can be used wet or dry, which is an important point because wet shaves, in my opinion, yield better results (and makes it even more usable for women).  </li>
            <li> The pop up trimmer works great and is an added feature I like, as are the clear LCD display, wet or dry capability and the lock.  </li>
            <li> I have been a Panasonic user for many years now and the last wet shaver I had gave me a good 6 years before the battery started acting up (had to only replace the blades once in the 6 years).</li>
            <li> When done, you simply push the button and put the shaver under the shower faucet to clean.  </li>
            <li> It was a different style and brand than he usually used, but he has been extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li> , the % of charge left LCD as well as notifying you to clean</li>
            <li> Number of times to go over the same area has reduced may be 1 or 2 to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> My expectations were so low before using this shaver because I have several other more expensive electric shavers across many brands and thought surely this fairly cheap, no-frills model wasn&#x27;t going to be anything to get excited about.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy on the skin with everyday use.</li>
            <li> I really liked the version of electric razors with rotating circular blades, but I read the reviews on this one and was convinced to try it after my old electric razor broke down.</li>
            <li> Its long-hair trimmer is okay if it&#x27;s just trimming very fine or sparse hairs, but on my face, where my hairs are dense, it is close to useless.</li>
            <li> The only problem has been price - unless Amazon dropped the price on these razors, they were usually way, way out of the range of the possible for most people, but luckily this razor is more sensibly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s high quality and very durable.</li>
            <li> The head is smaller but it shaved close and held its charge for a couple of weeks, because of the smaller size and long battery life it made a perfect travel shaver for long trips.  </li>
            <li> Very, very convenient if you&#x27;re a busy person who needs to save some time in the morning.</li>
            <li> Once it gets the rough stubble down to a shorter length, though, the ES-LT41 does a very good job of getting all the hairs removed down to the smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> For the past few years I&#x27;ve been using a double-edged safety razor (the old-school kind) because my first two electric shavers, one a Panasonic and the other a rotary Norelco, weren&#x27;t all that great.  </li>
            <li> It seems much easier to be able to get into the odd nooks of my neck/jawline that caused problems before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try it on a wet shave - if it was that good dry....</li>
            <li> It charges quickly and is easier to clean than my previous Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have a super coarse or fast growing beard.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the shaver dry, and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> 6 dB difference seems consistent with what I hear; the Panasonic measures to be four times as loud as the Norelco, and it seems that way when shaving.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re definitely not as good as a blade shave, but they&#x27;ve been \\&quot;good enough\\&quot; to allow me to dodge having to blade shave</li>
            <li> Then, hold the blades under water and any access hair caught up in the shaver will be rinsed and shaken away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging: A full charge only takes and hour.</li>
            <li> I have worn a short cropped full beard and mustache for 40 years.</li>
            <li> When I browsed Amazon, I was surprised to see them -- and the price was much lower than that in Japan!</li>
            <li> But, speaking for myself, I can say that it gives me a smooth, easy, close shave that is at least 3 times better than my old Panasonic electric shaver ...and virtually ties in comparison to a wet blade shave.</li>
            <li> It offers a high level of performance and useful features - good blades, 13,000 cycle per minute cutter - without unnecessary frills.  </li>
            <li> On the regular whiskers, it shaves close with one pass, and entirely smooth with a second pass at right angles.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Panasonic razors typically come out on top when considering price point and quality.  </li>
            <li> Options of Wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to rinse off and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is probably the top rated shaver which cost less than $100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the travel lock, but it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as my previous Panasonic model.  </li>
            <li> :-)&lt;br /&gt; - Less to take with you</li>
            <li> My husband is an older man who has &amp;#34;gone&amp;#34; through lots of shavers in forty-plus years of our marriage.  </li>
            <li> This is my main gripe with the unit and why I still need to intermittently use a disposable razor.</li>
            <li> The CC is much cheaper, but this was well worth the extra cost.  </li>
            <li> But when I examine it more closely, they are the same products with different skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The inner blades are so sharp, you do not have to put any pressure on the skin of your face, which makes the shaving experience all the more satisfactory!  </li>
            <li> Does not shave as closely as the older models.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s performed far better than I expected.</li>
            <li> The shaver can also be used, without the heads pivoting because there is a \\&quot;lock\\&quot; switch, which keeps the heads steady, during shaving.</li>
            <li> Anyways, in about five minutes with this shaver, you can get a decent shave.  </li>
            <li> I found my most recent purchase, a Series 3 razor, to be a big step backward in terms of closeness and speed of shaving.  </li>
            <li> This has lasted all of 2 years and has done a fairly decent job.  </li>
            <li> A few nice but modest upgrades from the ES-8103S line.</li>
            <li> I had an older model Panasonic for 4-5 years and it still got the job done.</li>
            <li> Everyone is different, we have different hair types and coarseness, my neck hair has always been a problem, I never found a electric razor that does a better job over another.  </li>
            <li> The only time I use it is when I don&#x27;t \\&quot;have\\&quot; to have a super close shave.  </li>
            <li> This is much zippier and seem to cut much faster, but then I hand never replaced the foil or blade on my old razor.</li>
            <li> Replaced the blades once for $30, although they were still going decent.</li>
            <li> It does not tear up his neck or miss any whiskers, exceptionally quiet and holds the charge better than the last ones he has had.  </li>
            <li> Quiet running and quick charge battery.  </li>
            <li> Going strong for five months - just as expected &amp; no complaints.</li>
            <li> It cost about $50, has lasted this long with original parts.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this razor - it is the CLOSEST electric shave I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for both men &amp; women.</li>
            <li> If I did 1/2 with a blade and 1/2 with this you could feel the blade did a closer job, but I highly doubt anyone couldn&#x27;t see a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Then, I discovered the high ratings of the Panasonic Arc three on Amazon and decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using this in the shower.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommemded.</li>
            <li> This razor hits all my requirements to a high degree.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I highly highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> However, over time I&#x27;d become dissatisfied with the quality of the shave and high price of replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a high end</li>
            <li> Overal, I would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> /&gt;Charging the Panasonic shaver is super quick, about an hour or a little longer.  </li>
            <li> It is great for side burns, neck line, and other sensitive areas that need to be trimmed down slightly so that the foil shaver can be more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wet or dry construction also makes it easy to clean</li>
            <li> As suggested, I&#x27;ve used this for 30 days and found it to be as smooth a shave as I got from my Gilette blade razor when I use it with wet lather and almost as smooth when I use it dry.  </li>
            <li> The wet/dry feature is nice though I haven&#x27;t compared to other brands with the same feature.    </li>
            <li> He really liked how much smaller, and sleeker it was than other electric razors.  </li>
            <li> anyone is really looking for a criticism, the only thing I can say is it is easy to hit the off button inadvertently and turn the shaver off in the middle of the shave</li>
            <li> Guess they should make the trimmer a little more stable for repeated use.</li>
            <li> But if you can spend a little more, try the ES-LA63-S</li>
            <li> The cleaning method is a little more echonomical, since you can use either water or water and liquid/gel anti-bacterial soap vs buying a cleaning cartridge for the Braun cleaning system.  </li>
            <li> I thought the blade would be a little better when I&#x27;m done shaving</li>
            <li> Sure it takes a little longer than a blade</li>
            <li> It requires a little more patience</li>
            <li> On/off lock also essential, as I heard it turn on first time I squeezed my suitcase shut!</li>
            <li> The ES-LT41-K moves more smoothly over my face, thus creating less razor burn than previous Linear razors (rotaries didn&#x27;t create as much razor burn for me, but they didn&#x27;t shave me as well,</li>
            <li> This new Panasonic is a generation ahead of the older one.</li>
            <li> fell in my new price range and had a decent rating, so</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried the trimmer yet, and it might be premature to give a Five Star review, but thus far I&#x27;m really blown away by the performance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a different shave wet, and it&#x27;s great that this shaver is built to let you shave wet or</li>
            <li> After less than an hour, it was fully charged and ready to go, and has been going fine for about a month now.  </li>
            <li> Wow, I really like this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Shaves closer than my old Braun 5770 and is much quieter too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it all the time, but it provides a close comfortable shave when I do use it wet.</li>
            <li> Fantastic wet shave with gel.  </li>
            <li> After using this shaver for over 3 months I notice that I am spending more time shaving than normal and I am forced to go over areas on my face numerous times before it is smooth, something that rarely happened with my last Panasonic shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Panasonic ES-LT41 measured 84 dB; my old Norelco 8140XL measured 78 dB, using an old but consistent and reliable dB</li>
            <li> Just be sure to have a backup razor if you decide to let things grow for a few days.</li>
            <li> You do have to do a few more revolutions to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t like electric shavers because they nick up my legs...</li>
            <li> it was nice to know how long I&#x27;d spent</li>
            <li> Worth the extra twenty or so bucks over the cheaper model/competition.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Below the Jawbone - Same issue pretty much.</li>
            <li> That being said, the trimmer on the back is really useful.</li>
            <li> B0048ZIFA0 Soft Sheen Carson Magic Fragrant Shaving Powder]], which can only be used 36 hours after an initial shave</li>
            <li> It is worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> Have been using a normal razor for 25 years.</li>
            <li> It does take a few passes to accomplish that, but that&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> Many times while traveling, I&#x27;ve had shavers turn on in my bag, then its dead when i needed it</li>
            <li> Some have been more gimmicky than others and a few have been top performers.  </li>
            <li> It does seem to take a few more passes to get all the hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also quite powerful, which is a bonus, because I&#x27;ve got thicker facial hair.  </li>
            <li> Second, I didn&#x27;t want to pay $20 extra for the cleaner; based on my experience with other shavers, just removing the cap and tapping it clean has always been more than sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , i read that this shaver is the new version of the highly rated ES8103S.</li>
            <li> but it typically took over 5 minutes to get a clean shave!</li>
            <li> The alternative was to replace the foil, battery etc in my old razor, which would have cost as much as this new one did.  </li>
            <li> charges quickly enough, cleans easily in the shower or under a faucet, holds a charge for several days, and keeps you informed as to the status of the battery.</li>
            <li> decided to give the LT41-K a try using it as a wet shaver 100% of the time, and after a couple weeks, in addition to some other essential components, I&#x27;ve been having great results.  </li>
            <li> It does a good job overall, but it&#x27;s definitely not a viable option for someone with sharp angles in their face/neck.</li>
            <li> Personal preference will vary - neither one is right for everybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Personal preference will vary - neither one is right for everybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The package arrived, I opened it, turned it on, shut it off and put it back in the box right away.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it dry, but it&#x27;s really good even dry.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a long time and recharges quickly.  </li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t mind, shave nearly everyday, and have even starting shaving on my days off because this things is so quick and easy</li>
            <li> shaver charges quickly and the battery lasts a reasonably long time.</li>
            <li> Charges quick and holds a long time.</li>
            <li> I decided that the 4 blade or larger shavers would probably be too big and this one has turned out fine.</li>
            <li> Sure, I wish I could the $200-$300 shavers, but&#x27;s that a pretty ridiculous price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Power stays strong all the way down to 10%.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Third, it is very comfortable due to the high speed.</li>
            <li> though I have no other electric razor to compare this to for you, I can say for certain that I do not regret my purchase, and since I use this every day, I would recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> though I have no other electric razor to compare this to for you, I can say for certain that I do not regret my purchase, and since I use this every day, I would recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable and leaves very little rash.  </li>
            <li> Shaves as close as any other shaver I&#x27;ve owned, comfortable to hold, can use wet/dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m able to use the carrying case from my old shaver and don&#x27;t bother using the little bag that is supplied with this</li>
            <li> Hopefully getting a new razor that won&#x27;t cause these problems for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> for years and wanted to have a new shaver.  </li>
            <li> Because they want to sell me new accessories.  </li>
            <li> and then they would send me a new one.</li>
            <li> It may be that I need a new head and razor for it</li>
            <li> but my razor is a fairly new model.  </li>
            <li> i also tried something new.</li>
            <li> B003H9HPAO New - PANASONIC MENS SHAVER - ES8109S]])</li>
            <li> Just purchased this new one for the holiday.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps a new head is in order...</li>
            <li> He had an electric razor before with 3 rotating heads and needed a new one.  </li>
            <li> The batteries died and I decided it was time to see what&#x27;s new, rather than replace the batteries again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Cuts as well as the new Panasonic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco</li>
            <li> , just don&#x27;t expect it to neccesarily live up to the reviews.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews saying that it takes ~1 month for your skin to get use to a new shaver?</li>
            <li> but so did my ES-8068 when it was brand new.  </li>
            <li> As a test, I shaved with the Braun with essentially new foil and cutters.</li>
            <li> The new one seems to be underpowered and tugs a bit even with brand new blades.  </li>
            <li> And even if I bought new blades once a year</li>
            <li> My \\&quot;old\\&quot; one had served me well for five years or so and was in need of a new screen and blade.</li>
            <li> it basically costs me 20$ to get a new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It never got a close shave, and would scratch up my legs even with a new foil.</li>
            <li> When that day came, I started shopping for a new shaver and stumbled upon a Panasonic on</li>
            <li> It charges up lightning fast and is able to get corners and hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> Given that it&#x27;s a lot less expensive than many other electric shavers available, I consider it a good buy.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a very long time, and charges fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Prior to that minimum of 30 days, I was not totally satisfied because of impatience, but the more I shaved, I realized that they were right.</li>
            <li> so I have to work harder to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Panasonic shavers for years because of the wet part of it; you clean them with soap and water, you can shave in the shower, etc.</li>
            <li> have the same 13,000 cpms and similar sound</li>
            <li> If what I described above applies to you, set yourself up with the following &amp;#34;cocktail&amp;#34; (all available at Amazon):&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, feeling the whiskers remaining as you go helps align the stroke with the best direction for cutting performance, as you seek the lay of the whiskers to approach from the opposite direction.  </li>
            <li> I love the convenience that an electric razor has to offer so much that I purchased a couple to keep one in the car so I can spruce up when I have a late appointment with a client.</li>
            <li> Spent more to get this razor and having second thoughts.</li>
            <li> My old Norelco packed in more shaves per charge, but I misplaced it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as the shave goes its good but not great.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY quiet and very fast.</li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> After shaving he feels very soft feeling on his chin and</li>
            <li> It provides a closer shave than rotaries by far, but I have to admit I have not been using high dollar rotaries.</li>
            <li> but I do have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised as in the past&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and cannot use a razor blade or the circular style electric razors.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be an amazing difference compared to all my other razors, but that wasn&#x27;t the case.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Also, while the charge indicator is useful, it seems it can stay at 10% for a long time.  </li>
            <li> My second problem, The first couple weeks I used this shaver</li>
            <li> We have bought many shavers in the past..</li>
            <li> I was told I would have to send it back first</li>
            <li> It is more manageable due to its smaller size.</li>
            <li> It shaves close, is quiet and I love the digital readout of the  amount of charge left.    </li>
            <li> This shaver is LOUD!</li>
            <li> especially when used with shaving cream and hot water.  </li>
            <li> It is smaller than some other brands and that makes it even more desireable.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco for the past 40 years and this shaves closer, but it makes more noise.  </li>
            <li> As with any shaver, there are a few stray neck hairs, but overall the shave is much closer than most others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In general, I have really become a fan of Panasonic products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the shave I get is equal to or better than the one I get from the hand held razor, and I&#x27;ve never come close to that experience with any other electric shaver (including Panasonic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty quiet and it holds a charge well.</li>
            <li> The display is exactly what you need (% charge left; charging; when shaver needs to be cleaned).</li>
            <li> The Braun worked fine (and half the cost of the Panasonic).</li>
            <li> but if your first, you need to get used to it, and expect to make multiple passes over areas.  </li>
            <li> So the first impression is five stars, but I will come back after a month of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life, I am actually shaving every day.</li>
            <li> I used a top of the line Braun shaver for a couple of years and then tried a high-end Norelco for the past year.  </li>
            <li> Boy was I surprised!  </li>
            <li> Wet mode is really cool, no pulling, no irritation, and works a lot faster (10 minutes).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bother me to have stubble and look a little scraggly, the electric is easy just to keep it under control.  </li>
            <li> You need to pay attention to the display when you turn it off because the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; indicator turns off and does not come back the next day to re-remind you to clean it.</li>
            <li> The reason I think this might work better, is because, despite the name, it&#x27;s not actually a \\&quot;foam\\&quot; like the conventional ones in cans.</li>
            <li> If you can live with the fairly loud 13,000 cycle hum you will probably like this Panasonic.</li>
            <li> , the ES-LT41-K is actually a huge improvement over the previous Linear series razors that I&#x27;ve used:&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Shaves baby&#x27;s-bottom smooth in about half or 2/3 the time of the Braun.  </li>
            <li> first shave with the Panasonic ES-LT41-K was on 3-day old facial hair.  </li>
            <li> It is also very easy to maintain, cleaning does not require $6 solutions or a cleaning station, I simply remove and rinse the head and cutting blades under the faucet making the Panasonic much more convenient to travel with.  </li>
            <li> With that being said, I would recommend using this shaver, when the hair is not very thick.</li>
            <li> It works fine, so 4 stars is a little severe..</li>
            <li> biggest positive that I see with this razor compared to the ES-LV61, is that the battery seems to last noticeably longer.  </li>
            <li> The battery percentage readout is handy, not sure how accurate it is, but at least it puts me in the ballpark of when it will die.</li>
            <li> thought I would give this Panasonic a try, hoping the Wet/Dry feature might make it easier to manually clean than a conventional model.</li>
            <li> Of course, this would only be necessary if you were in a hurry to get a quick shave.</li>
            <li> The previous review repeats a significant part of my review below as the products are very similar, but also describes my positive experience with Panasonic customer</li>
            <li> but I do replace them and don&#x27;t recall that razor ever having such an easy time with the most difficult neck</li>
            <li> That is, it gives a closer shave than pretty much any comparable razors of other brands at this price point, specifically Braun and Norelco.  </li>
            <li> Overall, a solid unit that has become my go to shaver when I need to leave the house quick while looking professional.</li>
            <li> Will certainly buy another next time around.</li>
            <li> Possibly its better with wet shaving, but dry shaving is an absolute chore.  </li>
            <li> I first tried it in the shower and honestly, I spent over 10 minutes just trying to get a decent shave that was even.  </li>
            <li> Normally, as I have sensitive skin, after blade shaving, I would experience a slightly &#x27;raw&#x27; feeling, and applying aftershave was an &#x27;experience&#x27; to put it lightly.</li>
            <li> At least it&#x27;s not a broken-shaver sound with rattling and the sound of loose parts, just a loud BUZZ.</li>
            <li> You may find you need to shave a little longer than you&#x27;d like to, or go over the same spot more than you think you ought to.  </li>
            <li> It takes me a little longer to shave than my prior shaver, but the result is a much better shave.  </li>
            <li> I have the bigger more expensive model and it works fine</li>
            <li> I quickly homed-in on the Panasonic models and chose this one over the other Panasonic models for a couple reasons.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s nice to not be regularly throwing things away and using dull razors.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I had the tools to retrieve it, but now I am very careful to handle that removeable head with no chance of dropping it.  </li>
            <li> Many electric razors are not as comfortable shaving longer whiskers, they tend to pull them out rather than cutting them off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if Braun sells any newer models that offer this feature (it has proven useful many times in the past, when the battery was dead/low), but nowadays it seems that most wet/dry shavers, including the Braun shavers, have disabled the &amp;#34;use</li>
            <li> I typically use the Gillette manual razors for a close clean shave and use an electric for maintenance on day 2.</li>
            <li> Clear % of battery readout.  </li>
            <li> shut clearly, like it</li>
            <li> I have a full beard so don&#x27;t have to shave much except my throat and small patches on my cheeks</li>
            <li> Compared to my old Remington MS2, this thing is a joke.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how ineffective my old one had become until I used this one.  </li>
            <li> PANASONIC is by FAR the closest electric shave I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> My old Remington would go weeks before needing a charge.</li>
            <li> As far as razors go, this items does what it advertises, just like its predecessor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, you really can&#x27;t get the same shave with a shaver that you can with a razor.  </li>
            <li> Very accomodative of various curves and angles of the face.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Like, the hum of an airplane loud.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband to replace his old Remington</li>
            <li> Anytime we&#x27;re at our lake home, he uses and prefers his old Remington.</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t shave any closer than my old Remington 407 shaver.</li>
            <li> I purchased the ES-LT41 to replace an old Braun that broke and a Remington that I used once before returning.</li>
            <li> The panasonic, while not quiet, is much lower volume.</li>
            <li> It is not as loud.</li>
            <li> but with this foil razor, the blades are covered so my skin isn&#x27;t directly exposed to the blades.  </li>
            <li> give it a \\&quot;B\\&quot; because it is really loud.</li>
            <li> For the frequent traveler there is a way to lock the on/off switch so that while it is stored it won&#x27;t accidentally turn on.</li>
            <li> Like the indicator showing how much battery life is left.  </li>
            <li> But recently I bought a Panasonic hair clipper and it was really good.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> I guess that could have something to do with my Braun being 10+ years old</li>
            <li> ( just to clarify, i am a woman and got this to shave parts of my body that are too sensitive for razor).</li>
            <li> This is one LOUD shaver.  </li>
            <li> Not motorcyle or electric mower loud, but</li>
            <li> Maybe I have sensitive hearing</li>
            <li> My son has 4 young ones running around as he shaves in the morning.  </li>
            <li> So far, the Li ion battery lasted two weeks plus.</li>
            <li> B0009DT342 Panasonic ES8043SC Pro-Curve Pivot Action Linear Wet/Dry Shaver, Silver]] that I have been using since 2008.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Panasonic Linear series foil razors since the mid-90s.  </li>
            <li> It is a vast improvement in blade speed and is much quieter.</li>
            <li> I got a wild hair (no pun intended)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s near blade quality I must say.  </li>
            <li> I miss the old, pre-P&amp;G Brauns and the old Victor Kiam Remingtons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> No cleaning brush, but you could use your old one.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> So far I have owned this Panasonic for almost 6 months.</li>
            <li> It cuts closer than my old Remington and nearly as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li> I have heard it takes 2-3 weeks to adjust to each electric razor, but so far I am not a fan.</li>
            <li> It does an okay job, but I can&#x27;t say it shaves any better than the older, less expensive model I used for 5</li>
            <li> /&gt;Below the jawbone - It&#x27;s a simple straight up swipe with a blade razor</li>
            <li> expectations on this razor were based on my OLD electric razors.</li>
            <li> Some things are the same, and some are much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My old one had the a non-polarized connection and  the rectifier in the shaver.</li>
            <li> My old one had the a non-polarized connection and  the rectifier in the shaver.</li>
            <li> so you know how much charge is left.</li>
            <li> I still use the old Braun for side burn trim or to shave off neck fuzz, just easier.  </li>
            <li> It would definitely be too much to take as part of the wake up routine.  </li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my husband who has really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I picked this one because of the reviews mentioning it works for sensitive skin and also because it has a travel switch, and my husband travels a lot.</li>
            <li> One pass is only for safety razors and barbers straight razors.</li>
            <li> ; the old one did not have one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This will without a doubt be replacing my old razors.</li>
            <li> , I have sensitive skin and quite a number of acne on my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit loud, if that&#x27;s a concern.  </li>
            <li> The facial hair trimmer works very well.</li>
            <li> Fast, you don&#x27;t need to go over the same area</li>
            <li> I do think that the batteries now being used in the current electric shavers have improved much.</li>
            <li> I have some soft, wispy hairs on my neck.  </li>
            <li> This razor is very quiet, very fast,(blades rotating @</li>
            <li> I owe my wife a kiss for ruining the old one.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve formed some early opinions.  </li>
            <li> The ES-LT41 is cheaper than my old ES-8068, by a long-shot, which may account for my perception that I&#x27;ve &amp;#34;stepped down&amp;#34; in class.  </li>
            <li> But my expectations are lower, given that this is what the market now offers.</li>
            <li> It gives a closer shave than the old Norelco one ever did.  </li>
            <li> product comparison chart shows the two shavers to be nearly identical - and they are.</li>
            <li> I buy this for replace my old one.</li>
            <li> My old one buy from 2000.</li>
            <li> The newer series from Panasonic (ES-LT41-K) is lighter than my old shaver</li>
            <li> My skin is Really Really sensitive</li>
            <li> Replaced an old Panasonic razor with this one.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying this shaver because I lost my old one, not because it stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All of these are pretty minor and don&#x27;t detract from my 5-star</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say on the order of 30% the volume of my old Norelco titanium 3 and 4s.  </li>
            <li> My old Norelcos are 10+ years old, and their batteries are shot, but they still work if plugged in and you don&#x27;t have to throw  them away.  </li>
            <li> like the readout to know how much charge is left, so I don&#x27;t have to guess (even though it displays in hundredths</li>
            <li> time soon came where I was thinking of getting a replacement, looked at them all, thought about Norelco, but I still felt pulled by the quality of my old Panasonic and felt out of all I used</li>
            <li> The overall feel and quality of the shaver is much improved over my ES8077,</li>
            <li> Takes about 30 days for beard to get used to electric shave but after that wow.  </li>
            <li> I find it uncomfortably loud.</li>
            <li> Shaving near the ear makes me think I&#x27;ll damage my hearing.</li>
            <li> After my old Panasonic wet/dry shaver died I switched to a Sanyo.  </li>
            <li> so I was frequently turning it off during shaving by mistake, causing the razor at that point to PULL out the whiskers, not cut them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found each shave so far uses 10% of the power, i.e., I started at 100%, was at 90% after shave one, 80% after shave two, etc.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m 70 years old.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft on the face and does on heck of a job.</li>
            <li> My old one took about 12 hours.</li>
            <li> This seems positioned near the point of diminishing returns in the Panasonic line.</li>
            <li> I am comparing this to my old shaver.</li>
            <li> Replace a decade old Panasonic Electric Razor.  </li>
            <li> so it takes me about 10 minutes for a complete shave</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve probably increased by shave time by about a minute), but the final result is very smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you do not have sensitive skin this may be the shaver for you.</li>
            <li> so much I bought the same one for my son.  </li>
            <li> My sensitive neck area is never irritated.</li>
            <li> This thing shaves darn near as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li> Only real gripe, as others have said, it should have a stand.  </li>
            <li> I have had it for 6 months so far and see no reduction in the battery life or shave quality.</li>
            <li> This was quite a change from my old, worn-out, rotary shaver.  </li>
            <li> and you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Overall, this shaver is worth owning, especially for the price it has dropped to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well worth the minimal price.</li>
            <li> Being able to use this wet/dry shaver in the shower is something I was never able to do with other electric shavers I&#x27;ve owned, so its a new experience for me and a positive</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers I have only cleaned the shaver after every three or four shaves, and this seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The trimmer is very effective and makes trimming the edges of my goatee a neat and simple task, my only complaint is that the trimmer is on the back side of the razor</li>
            <li> I simply cannot justify spending more money just to have the accessories included or to improve the actual shaving quality when other brands can provide these improvements and accessories for a lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and she says it is MUCH better than any of her other more expensive razors</li>
            <li> My beard has always been difficult and used a regular blade and shaving cream, this is better!!</li>
            <li> I just did my first dry shave</li>
            <li> You can get a pretty close shave with this product, but besides stretching your skin, not pressing too hard, and shaving in multiple directions--I still find I have to spend the time to go over the same areas more times than I should have to to get a satisfactory shave.</li>
            <li> (I went from 0 to full power in less than one</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not excited about its prompt to clean it with soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No mess, no cords, no standing and shaves close like a razor.</li>
            <li> I never liked wet razor shaving and found the best was dry, and even though this shaver says it can do wet, I haven&#x27;t tried it, nor I plan on trying it.  </li>
            <li> Even when using the wet model with the special gel it would burn and not cut close enough for</li>
            <li> Cons: I really don&#x27;t have a true complaint about this razor.  </li>
            <li> Clean shave from the start, and I have a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> Some of the ones I&#x27;ve bought in the past have cost more than double and triple</li>
            <li> The price is the same or higher than what I paid over 5 years ago for virtually the same model.  </li>
            <li> but I try not to do business with companies that don&#x27;t put the customer&#x27;s needs first so this will likely be my last Panasonic purchase.</li>
            <li> It gives a decent shave, is smaller and faster.  </li>
            <li> When I got this wet/dry shaver, I used it in the shower the first few times, and it worked very well,</li>
            <li> This particular razor was actually confiscated by my daughter for her use (legs and arm pits)</li>
            <li> I bought the ES-LT41-K when an older Panasonic model finally began to wear out.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic replaced it and the second one did the exact same thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a couple electric shavers in the past, but they left my face irritated most of the time.  </li>
            <li> the charge last a long time, and the blades are adequately sharp after many uses.</li>
            <li> 1st night face feels little flushed but not bad</li>
            <li> I had no idea that shavers had evolved to such a high degree of excellence.  </li>
            <li> Second, the ES-LT41 is more difficult to push through my stubble, whereas the ES-8068 moved smoothly across my face and objected only when presented with a 2-day growth of beard.  </li>
            <li> close comfortable shave wet or dry</li>
            <li> Yes, you can clean it with plain tap water.  </li>
            <li> It is small and light but seems well made.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a super-thick beard, but have sensitive skin in general.</li>
            <li> I usually shave once a week, so it does take awhile to get a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re like me and tend to Amazon research products before you buy, this is a great, quality product, and I would put this up against the very expensive ones from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.</li>
            <li> I do still use my regular razor, but only when I need a very close shave for professional purposes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a much more expensive Arc4, ES8249 for several years, long enough to replace the blades more than twice, and I found that I wanted a replacement, that would be cheaper to replace blades on.  </li>
            <li> I have tried different electrics before, most recently a 7 series Braun, which was still too harsh.  </li>
            <li> I normally use a disposable razor but this Panasonic 3-blade has made a big difference for me.</li>
            <li> it is very nice as is the travel lock, as I do travel often and nothing more annoying then finding my shaver dead because the button got bumped by TSA or in transit.  </li>
            <li> My prior experience confirmed that corded ones last due to not having a battery.  </li>
            <li> I decided to present new one to him.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had my new shaver a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> The Braun and the Panasonic were in my opinion equal at giving a close/smooth shave when the foil/blades are new.</li>
            <li> It totally outperforms my new Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> Hope this is my last one because i did not like the new Brauns.</li>
            <li> I like the easy to clean, cutting head, and the fact that they can be used &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;... I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It cant get a clean shave wet or dry...</li>
            <li> I wanted a close, comfortable shave, a precise cutting line, cordless ability, and some cleaning convenience.</li>
            <li> I use it dry and it gets very close.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaves really well for a dry cut...</li>
            <li> Panasonic does not pull my hair, is much less noisy, cuts with fewer strokes, and is just more enjoyable to use than my previous razors.&lt;br /&gt;The pop-out trimmer on this razor is average (doesn&#x27;t seem very powerful/sharp) and seems small to me.</li>
            <li> drawback is that this isn&#x27;t saving me as much time as I&#x27;d hoped when I decided to switch from a regular razor to an electric one; I have to go over some areas several times to get all the hairs.</li>
            <li> that I&#x27;ve been using for several years now, but that razor was also three times the price of this one when it came out and is only now a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I was very hesitant on changing to a different brand or shaver type, but I researched for a while on the current rotory &amp; foil shavers and have settled on the Panasonic ES-LT41-K.  </li>
            <li> Over the years I have use several Norelco and an expensive Braun in an attempt to get a good close shave without razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gets my my beard right down to the skin with no burning or irritation.</li>
            <li> After reading the high ratings and glowing reviews on this Panasonic I decided it was worth the few extra bucks and ordered one.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very satisfied with the performance of both shavers, with the Panasonic slightly out edging the Braun because of less irritation with longer facial</li>
            <li> In this case, the 13k cycle per minute cutting rate combined with the blade system, ergonomics, and price point will likely place this in the sweet spot for most users.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get used to the three circular heads on a Norelco and prefer one broad screen to work</li>
            <li> My first such razor, a modern one, broke when it fell, so I was using my great-grandfather&#x27;s 100+ year old razor for the past year or so.  </li>
            <li> My second es8243 is not bad, smooth on my face, but noisy, and the lcd failed after barely a year.  </li>
            <li> Also, this shaver has 3 blades compared to other razors and those with significant bear growth typically prefer 4 blade systems that I personally find too large.  </li>
            <li> Also, this shaver has 3 blades compared to other razors and those with significant bear growth typically prefer 4 blade systems that I personally find too large.  </li>
            <li> The shave on my tough chin whiskers is fast and clean.</li>
            <li> There are certain items on Amazon which seem to have wide price fluctuations, and Panasonic shavers are among them.  </li>
            <li> There are certain items on Amazon which seem to have wide price fluctuations, and Panasonic shavers are among them.  </li>
            <li> Stop missing the slightly longer hairs but overall pretty smooth shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using the Panasonic ES-LT41-K, I immediately noticed a few key differences, it has a slightly louder &amp; higher pitched sound than the Braun shavers.  </li>
            <li> So it may be worth tracking the price a little, or searching the web, to catch it on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So it may be worth tracking the price a little, or searching the web, to catch it on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a little bit noisebut powerful</li>
            <li> Now I can shave in half the time or less and with a better result.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure know tends to be a viscous cycle that can be tough to break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And parts were getting more difficult to obtain, particularly the pop-up trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Long battery life (4-5 weeks for me)&lt;br /&gt;- High quality LED display</li>
            <li> Fortunately it is the \\&quot;ones\\&quot; digit so that I at least know what percent of a charge remains.</li>
            <li> but this is in my near future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve apparently become a fan of Panasonic razors.  </li>
            <li> For me I&#x27;m going back to old reliable (the ES8086)</li>
            <li> I tend to have a rough, fast growing beard.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have never had a problem shaving with this razor and the proper cream.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Original:  I purchased this Panasonic shaver to replace a 5 year old Norelco triple head whose battery run time had gotten too short.  </li>
            <li> Wow it cuts, quiet compared to any</li>
            <li> only downside to this shaver is the loud buzz noise it makes.  </li>
            <li> I can get 4-5 shaves per charge-about the same as my old Braun (3-4).</li>
            <li> Even using a magnifying mirror I could barely see stubble.</li>
            <li> As far as noise levels go for an electric shaver, I would say it is very quiet.</li>
            <li> But at 12 years old, it was starting to show its age.  </li>
            <li> I replaced a similar Panasonic model with this unit after using the old for 5 years.</li>
            <li> I could simply drop my old shaver into a charging cradle</li>
            <li> so far charges well, can hold for about a week, without recharging, for daily shavings.</li>
            <li> Not as close as a razor blade, not even when used in shower with shaving gel, but still at top of game for expectations or an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> It is okay but not great.</li>
            <li> that, I was even more confused.  </li>
            <li> Not cheap, but definitely worth re-buying.</li>
            <li> I limited my budget to $100 and saw the Panasonic had decent reviews</li>
            <li> I charged it up fully for the first time, tried to run it all the way down (part of the battery memory</li>
            <li> The first one lasted 6 plus years and still works but has slowed down some</li>
            <li> I simply cannot get over the fact that my neck will not adjust to the new razor and the irritation has persisted for several weeks.  </li>
            <li> The unit seems to run at a much higher speed than my previous shavers.</li>
            <li> However, I purchased this electronic shaver for the days where I do not have adequate time to wash my face, lather, and manually shave ....and for those lazy days when I just don&#x27;t feel like shaving manually.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes I do have to go over my neck area a few extra times to get it perfectly smooth, and even then, I might notice later that it still missed a whisker here and there, especially if I haven&#x27;t shaved in a couple of days.</li>
            <li> - Takes a while to get a close, clean shave compared to a razor (but this is a general complaint against all electric shavers).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fine razor, but I found it difficult to get a really close shave.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to other reviewers, I decided to get this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shaves very closed but not irritating at all.  </li>
            <li> It is only about three quarters of an inch wide and the Remington was twice that and really made it easier to trim around my ears between haircuts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Two days ago I finally gave up and went back to my old es8066.  </li>
            <li> and this has almost eliminated razor bumps and ingrown hairs, only have problems when I get in a hurry and shave too fast or rough.</li>
            <li> But for daily use I am swapping it out with my \\&quot;secondary\\&quot; shaver, an old Norelco triple header I keep in my suitcase for occasional travel use.  </li>
            <li> but it was far more expensive.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is the best I ever found - at least within my meager price range.  </li>
            <li> I thought about rating it lower since it was a total fail for me, but everything else about it seems nicely made and well thought out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s 1/2 the mess and pretty close to the same shave!</li>
            <li> There was a close, even shave with no long hairs &#x27;leftover&#x27; at the bottom of the neck.</li>
            <li> I currently also have a more expensive Panasonic ES8228S which I&#x27;ve had for 2-3years and will make direct comparisons to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It evidently went by the way of our waste basket which was sitting under the table it was on.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time in 40 years of shaving that I have not had skin irritation from an electric razor - and I have tried quite a few.</li>
            <li> total shave time is not much better, of course I shave every morning and find myself passing over the same areas several times to get a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> This thing really gets down to the skin</li>
            <li> Finally, after lots of research on all current electric options I decided on the Panasonic ES-LT41-K due to its reviews, price and features.&lt;br /&gt;Now, after a month of use I&#x27;ve come to really like this razor for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used my blade other than to do a little clean up on the neck at times.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind this, too much, as it is just a slight inconvenience.</li>
            <li> I dry shave early in the morning before heading out and this shaver performs the job</li>
            <li> Blades are much sharper than previous razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> can not shave with the power cord plugged in, not much trouble because the battery can last a long time.</li>
            <li> I recently wanted to try another electric shaver, mainly because I&#x27;ve been feeling guilty about all the landfill I&#x27;m creating with cheap disposable razors (I break off the head and throw the shaft in the recycling,</li>
            <li> My first Linear finally needed replacement after quite a few years of use.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not so old that I can&#x27;t learn a few new tricks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I dislike about the new shaver is that it doesn&#x27;t cut as well as the old one (even with the old one&#x27;s dull blade).  </li>
            <li> I think I get the closest shave using shaving gel, but, dry or wet shaving is very serviceable as well.  </li>
            <li> Wet and Dry shaving a real plus, and so is the trimmer.</li>
            <li> If I have a few days growth then I will use a regular razor and switch to this for the rest of the week, but as long as you don&#x27;t let your beard go for more than a few days (or even a day for some of you lumberjacks)</li>
            <li> At first, the shave was a little rough (shaving dry), but then I tried another readers suggestion of just using normal liquid hand soap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey (for me) but it works absolutely as advertised and maintenance of it</li>
            <li> This razor absolutely shaves as close as a blade; and there is little to no irritation.  </li>
            <li> I know this is a really minor complaint and certainly will not prevent me from giving this razor high marks (5-stars).</li>
            <li> I wanted a new electric because my other one died.  </li>
            <li> Shaves the closest of any I&#x27;ve ever used, is light, sturdy, cuts through my tough beard, etc.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using a Gilette Fusion power razor and liked it fine except for the outrageous cost of replacement blades!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Shave performance, well to me, I have not seen a real improvement, even with my old dull foils in my ES8077,</li>
            <li> had  a VERY old Braun and one other type.</li>
            <li> I would have to hit my beard from EVERY angle, up, down, left, right, diagonal one way, diagonal the other way, back and forth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard good and bad about electrics, pros and cons, etc.  </li>
            <li> without getting technical (since i cant) i recommend this machine for the closeness of the shave, the ease it catches even long hair, the contour of the grip, the charge status (0%-100%) display, the quietness, the wet/dry ability and the general workmanship.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have only used dry, not wet.  </li>
            <li> , I was sick of paying the price for good blades.  </li>
            <li> My dad has a tough beard, if he lets his beard grow for more than 4-5 days he usually need to use a buzzer before using his old panasonic electric or a regular razor to shave.</li>
            <li> Extremely close, fast shave, minimal irritation.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this shaver despite all the good reviews unless you have a very very small and thin amount of facial/body hair to shave off.</li>
            <li> and wow!  it is a lot less messy than how i used to shave, and i am really supprised at how well the shaver shaved.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to electric razors: with 8 years in the military I am not new to shaving.  </li>
            <li> this Panasonic electric shaver which offered a shave no better than the cheap little</li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t trim close to the skin to trim your neck or other parts that are too sensitive for a closer shave (i.e. armpits).</li>
            <li> I rub very hard to get all the whiskers, and there is never abrasion, possibly an ephemeral mild non-irritating redness.</li>
            <li> of this stuff compares to the clean shave, simplicity and economy of my safety razor, but alas, I must switch to electric.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Men Sensitive Post Shave Balm (Active Comfort System)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now let&#x27;s see how long it will last, only time will tell.</li>
            <li> The only drawback I would point out, and it&#x27;s minor, is that I only get 7 or 8 shaves before the recharge indicator lights up.  </li>
            <li> It takes a few passes to get all the hairs, cuts close and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin as much as normal as a traditional razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 23 year old African American with thick facial hair and sensitive razor bump prone skin and this razor addresses all of those issues when used correctly.</li>
            <li> It only takes one hour to fully charge the battery, and though I haven&#x27;t tested this myself, the instructions say a full charge will give you up to 45 minutes (approximately 2 weeks) of cordless shaving.</li>
            <li> one down side with this shaver (as with almost any foil shaver) is that I frequently need to pass over an area several times to get all of the hairs.</li>
            <li> highly warn you not to waste your time and money on this shaver.</li>
            <li> First, let me say I work my electric shavers extremely hard as it must shave my face and</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t worry about this initially because I do realize that it can take a few weeks for your skin to adjust to a new shaver.</li>
            <li> So far shaved dry and wet.</li>
            <li> Most of the time I have owned Braun shavers, this is because my family is from Germany and they send them to me every year or so because the previous model has broken in some fashion.</li>
            <li> Reinstall the foil when everything is dry prior to your next shave.  </li>
            <li> This helps with control of the shaver during use.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; The power screen is perhaps less reflective or something - I find it easier to read.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; The power consumption / capacity thus far has been identical for the equivalent new units.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Weight of the LT41 seems to have been reduced slightly -</li>
            <li> This helps with control of the shaver during use.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; The power screen is perhaps less reflective or something - I find it easier to read.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; The power consumption / capacity thus far has been identical for the equivalent new units.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Weight of the LT41 seems to have been reduced slightly -</li>
            <li> ES-LT41 only has a basic charging cord and not the cleaning system / charging stand of the ES8228S and other more expensive Panasonic models.</li>
            <li> Long lasting battery.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that the blades and foil have such a long life period between replacement.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then came a Braun which was quiet but took a long time to get all my whiskers off.</li>
            <li> Batteries last a long time between charges.  </li>
            <li> When you find a shaver you like, you try to keep it running as long as possible.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a blade guy for a long time, with an occasional electric thrown in.  </li>
            <li> had to get used to the high-pitched whine, simply unfamiliar to someone who&#x27;s used Norelco so long, I guess.</li>
            <li> Battery last quite a long time and will not disappoint.</li>
            <li> have [very] sensitive skin and coarse [but light] leg hair, so it makes shaving weekly painful and ugly, as razor burn isn&#x27;t a good look on anyone.</li>
            <li> Much quieter than the Braun I used to have and easier to handle than my prior Panasonic which had four rows of blades, making that model too unwieldy and hard to get in curves around nose or chin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Options of Soft (flexible) or Hard (Fixed) razor top.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but when I use the trimmer to bring my 2nd day stubble down to a short enough length for the shaver to work, it has some issues staying open.</li>
            <li> Of course, that is not a major flaw.</li>
            <li> I have replaced the blades and foil cover because of everyday use and it shaves like new.</li>
            <li> This review is based on a few weeks of use, but perhaps my face must &amp;#34;adjust&amp;#34; to the new Panasonic model?</li>
            <li> I should point out that I only shave dry</li>
            <li> Panasonic recommends giving your face 30 days to adjust to the shaver; but as a &#x27;typical guy&#x27; with sensitive skin; I was sold from day one.</li>
            <li> It takes less than an hour to complete.</li>
            <li> Wipe away the residual moisture from the shaver housing (not really necessary), and then air dry separately from the foil.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After the return, I figured out how to replace the batteries in my old Braun which makes a much less obnoxious noise and which I can use while charging.</li>
            <li> The only negative for the Panasonic is it will not work while plugged to an outlet (I guess for legal reasons).</li>
            <li> I always dry it with a hand towel, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s required or even necessary.</li>
            <li> Compared to my old shaver the shaving experience has improved slightly for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m telling you, use this setup everyday (following instructions on the Cremo bottle), give it some time, and I think you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> It takes a few extra minutes to complete the shave compared to razor (maybe 7-8 min vs. 5-6 min).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect the blades to shave very close after just one pass, ESPECIALLY if the hair that is thick.</li>
            <li> It also has a five-minute quick charge feature, which allows just one shave, when the power has been exhausted.</li>
            <li> As with these types of batteries, let the battery run completely down before charging the first few times.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had to charge it twice in the 30-day period while using it every single day.  </li>
            <li> Settled on this Panasonic, ES-LT41-K Arc3, based on the positive reviews, ignoring the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> At first I noticed a few odd patches here</li>
            <li> I was using a regular razor everyday during my last deployment and it would get irritating because of the constant need to be clean shaven.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of typical disposable razors and have over the years tried a few different (Phillips / Norelco) electric shavers, but nothing to really make me convert.</li>
            <li> but the last one I bought just was &amp;#34;cheapened&amp;#34; up and did not live up to what used to be &amp;#34;The best&amp;#34;, in my opinion!</li>
            <li> I got this shaver to replace my 15 yo Braun electric shaver, which still worked, but got a little old.</li>
            <li> it also tells you when to rinse the head with a little faucet drip symbol.&lt;br /&gt;Better than my old Braun and Norelco...</li>
            <li> I have previously owned Phillips/Norelco shavers but this Panasonic delivers a much closer shave than my previous shavers.</li>
            <li> I recommend getting the hard case if you are going to be traveling much.</li>
            <li> After the last time I forgot to remove the little piece of tissue from my last facial nick before leaving the house I decided it was time to go electric.</li>
            <li> Important, because I shave my entire head with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped shy of 5 stars because the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as long as I expected - but that&#x27;s not to say it&#x27;s anemic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not wild about the trimmer on this model</li>
            <li> I like the lock ring to prevent it from coming on during travel, but find it&#x27;s placement curious because I have locked it numerous times during use.  </li>
            <li> With this Panasonic I can finally get a close shave, and that&#x27;s even without the wet option, which is even closer.</li>
            <li> Maybe my beard is just not compatible with this shaver, or maybe this thing only works as a wet shaver, but if this type of shaver isn&#x27;t doing it for you why not look at the Remingtin MS2- 390</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Braun shavers for many years, but after being disappointed with the declining performance of their more expensive shavers, I switched to Panasonic and haven&#x27;t looked back.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Braun shavers for many years, but after being disappointed with the declining performance of their more expensive shavers, I switched to Panasonic and haven&#x27;t looked back.  </li>
            <li> Battery lasts long.</li>
            <li> Holds a long charge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, and it holds a charge for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it catches some of the strangely angled neck hairs that are often missed with my ES8228S model.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion: minor nuisance aside about the noise it generates I can&#x27;t complain about its results.</li>
            <li> It ends up taking way too long to shave.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to buy this....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Above the Jawbone -  If the mouth, nose or ears weren&#x27;t there, it would be as simple as below the jawbone, but they are there, so it takes some careful maneuvering with a razor, so</li>
            <li> Time will tell how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> But for the price, these are almost too minor to mention.</li>
            <li> Long battery life.  </li>
            <li> The battery life lasts a long time, and it doesn&#x27;t take long to re-charge.  </li>
            <li> Hence i decided to try electronic shaver; its suppose to be way cheaper in long run</li>
            <li> I only use it in \\&quot;dry\\&quot; mode, so I can&#x27;t comment on its wet performance.  </li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT...SMOOTH GLIDE AND LONG CHARGE</li>
            <li> But baterry can not hold long for the trip.</li>
            <li> and I noticed moisture in the screen (I only shaved once wet).</li>
            <li> Now it just remains to see how long it lasts.  </li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, it stays charged for a while because he lost the charger for a few days, but it still worked.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been a long time Panasonic shaver user.</li>
            <li> 5 stars for quality, long battery life and close shave.</li>
            <li> I can go on a week long trip and not have to take the charger with me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic shavers for a long time.</li>
            <li> (daily use + wet).</li>
            <li> Irritation was minimal, but that will likely be a matter of your use.  </li>
            <li> long before I can wax again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It still gives a really close, which I appreciate as I have thick stubble.</li>
            <li> My beard is spotty and grows slowly, so I need a shaver that gets close without much help from the whiskers.  </li>
            <li> As a former blade only shaver (using several different single and multiple blade razors over the last 20+ years), and after developing a serious skin sensitivity, I decided to try the Panasonic ES-LT41-K Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DKKBRY/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title).</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a little hesitant to try electric due to the high purchase price.  </li>
            <li> The only down fall with this shaver is the battery life i would use it about 3 times and the battery would be totally drained.</li>
            <li> My previous shaver was a Norelcro much more expensive and not as well built.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, being a bit smaller (it has one less inner blade and is, I believe narrower than the LA63)</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it wet - only dry -</li>
            <li> Simply put, when confronted with an opportunity to switch to another manufacturer when my previous razor finally stopped working, I stayed with the Panasonic line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shaver can be used wet or dry and that&#x27;s a matter of personal preference.  </li>
            <li> so far has lasted about a week and a half and is only down to 50%.  </li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only have one complaint, in fact, and that is that it is very loud.</li>
            <li> The first thing that disappointed me is that I am only able to get about 4 shaves out of a single charge, this is a bit less than the previous Panasonic shavers I have had.  </li>
            <li> He says it doesn&#x27;t shave very closely, compared to other electric razors he has had in the past.  </li>
            <li> But, you probably don&#x27;t need it and you certainly don&#x27;t need a serious case to protect the shaver.</li>
            <li> The shave was overall quicker, slightly less irritating (with 3-day old beard), and had fewer missed hairs than the older Braun shaver.  </li>
            <li> With those shavers as a reference my expectations were not very high.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my facial hair type and other people wont have that issue.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s actually recyclable) and the rather expensive cost of the better quality disposable razors.  </li>
            <li> If you like neat sideburns, you will definitely need something other than this shaver to maintain them.</li>
            <li> As other people say it does take about a month for your skin to get used to it, and there is a learning curve for shaving your face once you figure out your facial hair patterns or directions.</li>
            <li> B000BUUVTE Gillette Fusion Manual Razor]], simply forget it despite what other may say.  </li>
            <li> B000BUUVTE Gillette Fusion Manual Razor]], simply forget it despite what other may say.  </li>
            <li> In that time I use it daily to trim my beard and mustache and shave the other parts of my face.</li>
            <li> I finally chose this shaver after exhaustive research, based on comparison with other Panasonics as well as price.</li>
            <li> This shaver blows them all away, and I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to find out!</li>
            <li> So I have to balance it in the corner of the cabinet and keep some other things next to it to keep it standing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried other shaving methods yet and will report back if any problem arrives.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> it did not hold a charge very long.</li>
            <li> and it stays charged a very long time.</li>
            <li> I use it for dry shaving</li>
            <li> OR DRY:  </li>
            <li> If you are planning for a dry shave</li>
            <li> but then I decided to try it dry.</li>
            <li> Did not irritate my skin (even dry) and did the trick on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using ES-LT41-K now for about a month, exclusively in the dry mode.  </li>
            <li> It works well with both dry and with shaving gel/foam on.</li>
            <li> then air dry before reinstalling onto the shaver.  </li>
            <li> I shave dry, but wash razor under running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dry shaved with an electric shaver for almost 20 years.  </li>
            <li> I use it dry.</li>
            <li> I use it dry.</li>
            <li> I found it cut closer dry rather then in shower.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m shaving dry than I use some LecrticShave stuff</li>
            <li> I even ran the razor over my cheek dry after I used this</li>
            <li> You can use it with water/shaving cream or dry.</li>
            <li> I do not use this razor in the shower, I shave dry</li>
            <li> I splash on some Lectric shave, let it dry</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want to just leave it lying on the counter to dry after cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for dry shaving with this.</li>
            <li> This shave does what it says...wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> The mesh can hurt a bit if you use dry</li>
            <li> The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is because although it shaves well I do have to go over the same area of my face a few times to get all the hairs.</li>
            <li> However, it seems to have an oil base that really allows the razor/shaver to glide smoothly.</li>
            <li> Down side is the battery doesn&#x27;t really last all that long.  </li>
            <li> You have to get EVERY SINGLE HAIR before you spray tan for a show.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic has a charger that plugs in, not quite as convenient, but a single charge gets me through 10 days to 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> every day I can get almost 2 weeks on a single charge.  </li>
            <li> , like I say, my hair is super thick and grows quickly so not sure if it will work for you.</li>
            <li> I had to go over the same area multiple times and press relatively hard to get the same results I always got with my Remington.</li>
            <li> The battery life is only average.</li>
            <li> For a close shave, I usually have to finish up with the old Remington.  </li>
            <li> It makes my old shaver look like it came of the cave man past.  </li>
            <li> Rotaries have to be disassembled completely (lots of small parts) to be thoroughly cleaned.</li>
            <li> I have owned and nearly exclusively used the ES-8103S shaver from Panasonic for the past 3 years.</li>
            <li> I believe it is due to the shape of the Panasonic head (the Panasonic is curved while the Braun is flat).</li>
            <li> I usually have to dig out a considerable amount with a toothpick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gives a close shave without irritating my skin, and this is in the first week if use.  </li>
            <li> Again, he is tired of buying the cleaning cartridges and, after trying mine, wants one too!</li>
            <li> The ES-LT41-K is about half as loud as my old ES8043SC, which made a very loud and annoying buzz (like, loud enough that when I was traveling I used to worry that I might be waking up people in adjacent rooms).  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think anyone could cut themselves without doing something ridiculous, and the fact that it is waterproof makes it that much safer in a wet environment.  </li>
            <li> One thing to keep in mind is that replacement blades and foils for this are slightly cheaper, and given that Panasonics do tend to require relatively frequent replacements (they recommend 1 year and 2 years, when practical use suggests half that time)</li>
            <li> Fourth, I am noticing my face is significantly less irritated, as compared to the Remington (I always dry shave).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried both dry and wet shaves (prefer the dry shave) and works well in both modes.</li>
            <li> electric shavers was with the Norelco RQ12 heads, but after their price increase and subsequent disappearance I was fed up with that brand, particularly given the poor performance of their RQ10 heads.</li>
            <li> Initially I started with a medium stubble and after 10 minutes I gave up and took it down with a razor.  </li>
            <li> If not, I&#x27;ll be back to down grade</li>
            <li> Basic up and down strokes may not work to give you a close shave.</li>
            <li> This cable will annoy me a little, but it does hold a charge well, so it&#x27;s only a minor annoyance</li>
            <li> This cable will annoy me a little, but it does hold a charge well, so it&#x27;s only a minor annoyance</li>
            <li> Although the shaver can be used either dry or wet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver, dry, wet, and with shaving gel.  </li>
            <li> Being that it weighs nearly a half pound, it will likely remain in the bathroom where it will be used under both wet and dry conditions, but will not travel.  </li>
            <li> You can use this shaver wet or dry</li>
            <li> Not a super close shave but close enough.</li>
            <li> I do like this one because it can be used wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> For this and all Panasonic shavers I&#x27;ve tried I like the quality of the shave, the comfort, the durability, and the ability to wet or dry shave.</li>
            <li> B004UQ6Q62 Braun 3Series 340S-4 Wet &amp; Dry Shaver]], [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it dry, wet, in shower</li>
            <li> It just did not work for me, tried it both wet and dry.  </li>
            <li> Wet or dry feature intrigued me.  </li>
            <li> Wet or dry</li>
            <li> One thing I especially appreciate is that it gets the longer hairs on my neck that my previous razor would miss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> use this Panasonic dry even though it too can be used in the shower or wet.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try it on a worst case senario, any thing longer than this should be trimmed first with a beard trimmer to prevent most shaving issues with any electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> looked in the $60.00 or less range, and they looked similar to what I had before.</li>
            <li> Dry or wet</li>
            <li> whether Wet or Dry shave, however seems to give a closer shave with shave gel or cream.</li>
            <li> It can be used wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Like:&lt;br /&gt;Can be used wet and dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping the weight-savings aren&#x27;t the result of less sturdy construction or of a lighter and smaller battery</li>
            <li> I have tried many \\&quot;womens\\&quot; electric razors, with varying degree of effectiveness, but ultimately have been disappointed because they break or stop working after a couple of months.  </li>
            <li> It is not as close a shave as a normal razor blade but that is theoreticly not possible since a razor has the blade on your skin and the electric shaver has a thin piece of metal (protection) between the blade and your skin...</li>
            <li> I found that this razor worked well when used in a wet shower environement versus on a dry face.</li>
            <li> I had used a Norelco, a Braun (lower end) and a Remington for brief periods previously.</li>
            <li> Can be wet or dry washed.</li>
            <li> Try it both dry and wet and see what works for you.</li>
            <li> I bought the LT41-K as a gift for my dad after his previous panasonic razor finally crapped out.</li>
            <li> Both shavers have the negative in that they always leave a few spots that are not close enough, particularly on bottom of the chin going to the neck.  </li>
            <li> Other than that minor inconvenience</li>
            <li> After only a few weeks I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t holding its charge very long.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re afraid you&#x27;re missing some special something from the more expensive models, you&#x27;re not.</li>
            <li> If you only use this shaver dry, you may be missing something.  </li>
            <li> I felt the consumables (foils and screens) were a minimal expense based on my previous experience and seem to last</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I tried several different shavers, from cheap models up to the very expensive models.</li>
            <li> I use mine in the shower and apply a very minimal amount of shaving creme, which completely avoids the irritation I&#x27;d had whenever using an electric shaver in the past.  </li>
            <li> I used the razor lotion that you can use before you shave but that only helped a little bit.</li>
            <li> but I have only had it for a little while.</li>
            <li> Trouble is it did not last very long about 11 months!</li>
            <li> but I have a heavy beard and shave my head also with little effort and dont have to shave when I get out of the shower when my beard is soft</li>
            <li> I wish the shaver came with a hard shell case and a cleaning brush like my old shaver did.</li>
            <li> It shaves well, but my old Phillips with dull blades and a NiCad battery is faster.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want your whiskers soft, you want them hard and bristly.</li>
            <li> I have a thick, tough beard and the Panasonic breezes through in a few passes in most cases.</li>
            <li> for cutting, it shaves smoothly.</li>
            <li> The trimmer engagement is made of cheap plastic and the arm that oscillates the cutter has popped out of place and doesn&#x27;t engage the cutting head.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda loud, or at least louder than Norelcos, but tolerable.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it does not work when plugged in which is why I give it only 4 stars.  </li>
            <li> shaver goes at least a week on one charge, shave quite close for an electric, washes up with soap and water and blows away much more expensive competition.</li>
            <li> Compared with ES-LT-71, it has no cosmetic design and useless c/c unit, rather functional / efficient shaver at reasonable price, quite simple to operate.</li>
            <li> I have learned to appreciate a wet shave with this razor.</li>
            <li> This product did not work as expected.</li>
            <li> It shaves whiskers in such microscopic particles that you&#x27;ll create a messy accumulation of them all over a vanity.  </li>
            <li> few days ago after dragging this thing over the same patch of stubble repeatedly, I got fed up.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that you can use it on a wet face as well, as dry-face shaving irritates my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> and I shave my entire head everyday.  </li>
            <li> I get skin irritations even when I use shaving cream for wet shave</li>
            <li> so i wet my face with water , and put a dab of shave gel on the blades</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it wet, but I will.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not used to using an electric shaver wet.</li>
            <li> I will always be buying Panasonic razors based on the last few I have had</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it wet</li>
            <li> It also cuts through my rough beard even when I haven&#x27;t shaved for 3 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like it a tad quieter, but for this price, that&#x27;s not a reasonable expectation.</li>
            <li> I had read where the 4 head was way too wide for some</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda wide too compared to what I&#x27;m used to</li>
            <li> spent quite some time doing research on Amazon</li>
            <li> not ascose shave I expected</li>
            <li> Aslo i haven&#x27;t foumd the need to wet shave yet.</li>
            <li> The product performs as expected.  </li>
            <li> Cremo Shave Cream to use with the shaver as a wet shave</li>
            <li> As an added bonus, the Panasonic can be used wet, if you so choose.</li>
            <li> I wet my face and use a shaving gel.  </li>
            <li> No matter how much I&#x27;d pay, the shave that I got was so much worse than the one that I got from my old-fashioned Sensor 3 razor.  </li>
            <li> used it once in the shower, but wet shaving isn&#x27;t for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t tried a wet shave yet, but will soon in the shower...</li>
            <li> I have sampled a few different brands of razors over the years and decided that the Panasonic razors gave me the features, comfort and performance I was looking for.</li>
            <li> JUST WHAT I EXPECTED.</li>
            <li> It charged fast, but the on/off switch was for some insane reason placed exactly where my thumb normally rested on my Panasonic razor</li>
            <li> it gives a Firm and deep shave, and is washable after shaving,</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the wet shave</li>
            <li> Worked as expected.  </li>
            <li> I was a devotee of wet shaving for about 5 years, I had my badger brush and my Speick shave stick and my Alum block, etc.etc., and IMHO</li>
            <li> But whereas I spent 20-30 minutes, zen-like, pre-treating my face, shaving, post-treating my face, I can now shave in about 3 minutes and be done with it.</li>
            <li> Cleaning was a breeze and delivery was faster than expected.</li>
            <li> no really.</li>
            <li> It performs as well as expected.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to be shaving on a daily basis and do not grow thick facial hair as I do, this product is for you.</li>
            <li> and all its features battery lasts long and even when it runs down</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even tried a wet shave yet and other reviews indicate it shaves even closer wet.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic actually provided a little blurb in the box that says they will accept the razor back within 30 days if you&#x27;re not satisfied, and I got close to that deadline, but I am now hooked.</li>
            <li> Due to the reviews and user manual I expected a month of pain and redness before the skin was used to this method of shaving...</li>
            <li> But eventually the built-in battery got weak and like the Braun a replacement battery was as much as a new razor.</li>
            <li> cleaning process for the Panasonic ES-LT41-K was very simple and took very little time.  </li>
            <li> The benefit of using this electric razor is that I can then razor shave weekly with much better and less painful results.</li>
            <li> Other 4/5 blade electric razors had this as a</li>
            <li> skip the pink ladies!</li>
            <li> Closer than any other razor I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It shaves extremely close.</li>
            <li> and I find that feature a must in a shaver whereas some of the other razors on the market no longer offer the pop-up</li>
            <li> Bought it after wading through reviews on Amazon for this and other razor options.  </li>
            <li> Takes a little while to get used to moving the razor a little slower, but once used to it, it&#x27;s terrific.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that other electric razors would be much different.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that other electric razors would be much different.  </li>
            <li> Shaving every other day with lather and water.  </li>
            <li> It performs like any other shaver.</li>
            <li> The other issue with this shaver is it cannot be used, while it is plugged up.</li>
            <li> I even tried to shave a small portion of my chest to see if that hair would be easier and it was the same result.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this razor shaves quicker than my other, never timed it and the other one has a shave time on the display.  </li>
            <li> Battery life last longer than the past two electric shavers from Norelco that I owned in the past ten years.</li>
            <li> There is a lock button on the front, which was sorely needed for travel and other applications.</li>
            <li> I looked at the reviews of other brands and models and got this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the ES-LT41 daily for the past 2 weeks</li>
            <li> And the flexibility has no discernible advantage (other than marketing) and may just introduce unneccessary mechanical and electrical complications.  </li>
            <li> Agree with other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> As with other rotary shavers, the shave isn&#x27;t as close as the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> As with other rotary shavers, the shave isn&#x27;t as close as the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;d still have to use a blade once every few weeks to remove long stray hairs from my neck.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t need all that other stuff anyway</li>
            <li> /&gt;So other than my frugal cheapskate side taking one star off</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various electric razors over the past 20 years or so.</li>
            <li> I settled on this since I did not like the idea of the cleaning fluids for the other razors.  </li>
            <li> it helps, I exfoliate every other day before shaving, and I use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> , I decided I had to consider other options when my Braun wore&lt;br /&gt;out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it dry ever since, a little over a month now.</li>
            <li> Recommend aftershave if used dry--- burns a little.  </li>
            <li> I use it dry for the closest shave, then rub a little jojoba oil on my skin afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I just use a little of the Lab series pre-shave and do it dry.</li>
            <li> Little to no irritation (he uses it dry).</li>
            <li> to clean the heads out almost every time you use it or the cutting ability goes way down.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve shaved dry, and have no problems!!!...</li>
            <li> : I have given the razor two weeks to allow an adjustment of my skin to the new blades, but alas</li>
            <li> Over the years I have had 3 Remingtons, but I was not real happy with the last one and when it went out I decided to try something else.  </li>
            <li> In fact, a slight knock on the trimmer is that if you aren&#x27;t careful, it \\&quot;bites\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I guess I have sensitive skin because I find Norelco rotary shavers way too irritating and while Braun shavers are not too irritating they are more difficult to get a close shave than with the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE HAD AT LEAST FOUR OTHER ONES OVER THE LAST 15 YEARS!</li>
            <li> I have a large Adams apple, and I can&#x27;t get this to cut those hairs at all unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to the ease at which this razor cut my tough bristles.  </li>
            <li> It requires a very delicate touch in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> It is quieter than the previous model but other than that, there are no improvements.    </li>
            <li> but I hardly used it on the last one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to compare brands otherwise; you either will like a Panny shave or you won&#x27;t, which is one reason why these offer a 30 day money back</li>
            <li> albeit it feels a little lighter but build quality is the same if not better.  </li>
            <li> I love Panasonic shavers, but I was a little disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> I should add that there are a two or three hairs on my neck that somehow always remain uncut, but I think that is because, as I said, I have very hard beard, and these are easily removed with the trimmer.</li>
            <li> plus I see in this shaver is the fact that a single charge will last at least two weeks!</li>
            <li> First I would say The only bad reviews are the ones that compare razors with blades.  </li>
            <li> I have owned various electric shavers over the years and find that this Panasonic gives the closest shave in the least amount of time of any of them.</li>
            <li> Also, since my hair is dark, I tend to get the five o&#x27;clock shadow at about 3 o&#x27;clock.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time Braun customer, my last Braun shaver (Braun Contour 5790) has lasted for approximately 11 years.  </li>
            <li> My electric razor experience is over, not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> I thought the Norelco was just average, but I assumed that all electric razors gave just an average, or below average shave.  </li>
            <li> On average, found it takes over 20 minutes to do 80% of my face.</li>
            <li> And I love that charging base.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this shaver for even a thick beard(like mine).</li>
            <li> I have a been a staunch hater of electric razors but a recent need for blood thinners because of knee replacements forced me to purchase another.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer on this shaver is much worse than the old one.</li>
            <li> And one had better shave every 24 hours because if you skip a day, both electric razors are worthless.  </li>
            <li> Put up with an old Norelco for years assuming that they all worked poorly.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower (not really sure if I can) but use it right after and am not impressed at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - It&#x27;ll cut down shaving time by 30%-50%.</li>
            <li> However, I broke down and gave this one a try after reading some of the reviews</li>
            <li> Still holds a charge forever and hasn&#x27;t let me down.  </li>
            <li> For my beard, I need to shave in three directions (down, up, then sideways).  </li>
            <li> Its charged lifespan went from  6 days down to 2.  </li>
            <li> Automatically Returned, coz&#x27; cannot ship out from US, but this is the only case like this I met during the past 3 years!</li>
            <li> (I shave dry - don&#x27;t want to waste water in the desert!)</li>
            <li> It remains very sharp and I don&#x27;t see the need for changing the head</li>
            <li> Of course, using the shaver, everyday or every other day should help, as well.</li>
            <li> Equally bad, when I shave up to my sideburn edge, it leaves an uneven edge on one side for some bizarre reason.</li>
            <li> Shaves close with no pulling and does it in half the time it used to.  </li>
            <li> The power plug is a hair off from previous models which means that my existing Panasonic charger/cleaner can not be used.  </li>
            <li> It gives me a closer shave in less time.  </li>
            <li> , I get a half dozen in-grown hairs per day with this shaver&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Recharging takes less than an hour once or twice a week depending on usage.</li>
            <li> B003V37ZDS Philips Norelco 1250x/40 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver, Black]]</li>
            <li> though less \\&quot;automatic\\&quot;).&lt;br</li>
            <li> If there was something less than a one star ...</li>
            <li> less time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shaver seems lighter and less well made, however it does work well.  </li>
            <li> I am comparing this product with the previous model Panasonic ES8109</li>
            <li> The shave from the ES-LT41-K is cleaner than previous Linear razors that I&#x27;ve owned (4 to date, I believe).  </li>
            <li> Shave getting less and less close.  </li>
            <li> my previous shaver didn&#x27;t have.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is slightly quieter than my Braun 8975, but no faster or closer.</li>
            <li> For those in transition from safety razor to electric shaver, do not expect a faster shave, but do expect less styptic pencil use.</li>
            <li> a lot less form walmart or target..</li>
            <li> All previous shavers have been Remington brand.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s $40 less</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Braun, Norelco (Phillips) and, most recently, Remington (the worst!)</li>
            <li> replacement blades and screen are half the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shave does seem slightly closer when using gel</li>
            <li> My previous Panasonic ES8065 lasted for 20 years</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s at an odd angle</li>
            <li> I just got this model after my previous one died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It cuts the hair on my neck without issue, and does it with less irritation to my skin than with the rotary.</li>
            <li> And by the way, it charges in an hour or less.  </li>
            <li> Cut my shaving time in half.</li>
            <li> /&gt; - Over time, less costly than buying shaving cream and blades.</li>
            <li> My previous shavers stopped working/charging after 2 years, but what can you expect?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems to charge faster than previous razor.</li>
            <li> Shaves decently, however, if the battery dies you can plug it in and use it to finish your shave, and, the display became useless after about a month, so</li>
            <li> In dry mode, it irritates my face pretty bad, pulls a lot&lt;br</li>
            <li> The dynamic head does not really do a good job</li>
            <li> as an aside, another reviewer mentioned that he tried to use this shaver with shaving foam, and it just created a mess.</li>
            <li> I was never able to get a close shave if I used it wet</li>
            <li> The first one I had the display started cutting out almost immediately</li>
            <li> - No water or mess.  </li>
            <li> I thought that I would spend a little less this time and opted for the 3-blade, 13000 rpm over the 14000, 4-blade.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that it loses charge faster than I expected and it takes a little longer to shave.</li>
            <li> However, a few months down the line the popup trimmer just stopped working.</li>
            <li> Previously I had been using one with the three round blade sections.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to store this razor vertically because there are no flat sides.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also lost a little weight, so my face is thinner, as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also comes with a little velveteen bag to carry or store it</li>
            <li> The neck is a little tricky, but the head of this razor conforms to the contours of my face.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if this is truly due to the razor since I know</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit louder</li>
            <li> I was prescribed blood thinners a little over a month ago and the doctor recommended switching to an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> detail trimmer on this shaver is a little wider than I would expect, which has both positives and negatives.  </li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about whether this style would work for me.  </li>
            <li> Even the moms and my little sisters noticed an improvement in my skin texture.</li>
            <li> SAYS IT SHAVES HIM CLOSER THAN ANY OTHER ELECTRIC SHAVER I HAVE PURCHASED FOR HIM IN THE PAST.  </li>
            <li> I used to usually get away with shaving every other day at work.  </li>
            <li> but I put a little electric pre-shave on my face</li>
            <li> He says it takes a little getting use to.  </li>
            <li> Could maybe shave a little closer, but he likes it.</li>
            <li> Yes, but the difference is not significant.</li>
            <li> Battery life could be a little longer, I get 9-10 shaves with a heavy beard</li>
            <li> It does a irritate my skin when I press to hard or go over same spot to get hard to get hairs.</li>
            <li> almost 40 minutes later, it still wouldn&#x27;t get the tough spots.</li>
            <li> I have some very thick facial hair and need to shave every day.  </li>
            <li> However, it does a worse job than a regular blade and it still irritates my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Which I have daily because using a manual razor is even worse.</li>
            <li> So on those few occasions I use the trimmer blade.</li>
            <li> Not cheaply made.</li>
            <li> However, having this happen after just a few months is a concern.</li>
            <li> When I wanted to upgrade a few years ago, I purchased the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> the few times I used it in the shower.</li>
            <li> Got tired of the problems in shaving my neck - was actually shaving that area with a blade to get it close.  </li>
            <li> Took me a few times to get used to after using a revolving head type of razor</li>
            <li> I do not have a heavy beard</li>
            <li> happened to be the third and worse shaver ever.</li>
            <li> I had to replace failed cleaning/charging stands nearly every year along with filters and bottles of cleaner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also having trouble with cleaning it as the soap and water doesn&#x27;t seem to flush out the stuff that&#x27;s in there.</li>
            <li> I think this was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I was already used to electric razors from my old, expensive Braun, which was of course a benefit, since switching to electric takes the skin a while to get used to.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy the bottom-of-the-line Panasonic that is missing this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few weeks, and the word &amp;#34;dinky&amp;#34; keeps coming to mind when I turn it on.</li>
            <li> Trimmer is too narrow .</li>
            <li> Then, after using the messy [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Just press and hold the power button for a few seconds and the blades will vibrate, vigorously.</li>
            <li> What a wasted of money.  </li>
            <li> Also no longer have to waste a bunch of plastic with the disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> She got tired of using a regular razor.  </li>
            <li> Although it may take a few passes, it gets all of the whiskers every time, even those stubborn neck hairs that go every which way.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard</li>
            <li> When I needed a replacement razor, I had a few requirements:</li>
            <li> I got tired of the cost of blades and the occasional unavoidable nick on my face.</li>
            <li> Have tried this for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Have had it for a few months.</li>
            <li> I shave everyday.  </li>
            <li> The ES8077 came with the cleaning station, while I used it faithfully for a few years, I soon stopped because I found the cleaning modules to be a costly expense.  </li>
            <li> And I have had a few razors)</li>
            <li> and I have gone through a few as I am 63.</li>
            <li> The head itself can rotate in all directions which will help those with the uneven bone structures.</li>
            <li> Failed at doing my neck completely, missed the majority of the hair on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> Works well on a few days growth too.</li>
            <li> With my heavy beard, this Panasonic buzz-saw gets the job done IF I shave EVERY DAY, but misses a bit if I skip a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall not a bad razor, I was a bit disappointed though as I thought it would shave a lot closer to the skin</li>
            <li> Would recommend to people with thin to medium facial hair, as it gives a close shave after a few strokes.</li>
            <li> The design of the trimmer is at an odd angle that makes it hard for the trimmer not to flip down and off.</li>
            <li> other shaver take for ever to get the hard angles.</li>
            <li> The blades are too sharp and its hard to trim because of the angle of the trimmer.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product and I am shocked as all previous razors have been much more expensive.  </li>
            <li> Before anyone comments, I realise that this shaver may in the long run be worse for the environment given the electricity usage and the heavy metals involved in making the battery, etc.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty thick and the razor seems to have problems cutting under my chin and neck area.</li>
            <li> have a very tough beard that dulls the cutting heads quickly.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the placement of the trimmer makes it difficult to see where the trimmer touches down to the skin.</li>
            <li> Whenever this one dies (hopefully a few years down the road at least) I will look for this model and buy another one.</li>
            <li> A little issue I have is that if I skip a day shaving, I get some small hairs that curl.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is weird, it flips out perpendicular with the shaver which is less convenient than the ones that slide up parallel with the shaver...</li>
            <li> For the past few years, I&#x27;ve been shaving with a disposable in the shower.</li>
            <li> When I researched the ES-LT41-K, I was a little afraid that the people that designed the ES8065 might have retired and not passed on the Panasonic tradition of quality, but I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> and my face is irritaded, raw and sore.</li>
            <li> The neck area is where the shaver has some difficultly, although a few extra attempts usually solves this issue.</li>
            <li> By making the center cutting head wider, the razor rubs the skin the wrong way and causes enough skin irritation on my neck to where this razor will not see daily service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The angle also makes it very hard to see exactly what you&#x27;re cutting so watch out around the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very little razor burn.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately does not shave as close as a much less expensive older Braun unit.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this did not have a stand, but I used one from a former model.  </li>
            <li> Finally I can say Goodbye to those expensive 5 blade razors.</li>
            <li> and I knew this was a wet/dry razor, but from the first time I tried it I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> It evens gives me, with some usual effort, a close shave on my neck.  </li>
            <li> I broke the pop-up trimmer on the first one while changing the battery :(.</li>
            <li> Razors in the past have caused all kinds of problems - razor burn, in-grown hair, etc.  </li>
            <li> A small loss there -</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s enough of a difference between this model and the more expensive ones to justify their sometimes outrageous prices.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s enough of a difference between this model and the more expensive ones to justify their sometimes outrageous prices.  </li>
            <li> I have been a 30 user of Norelco products but this is equivalent if not better.  </li>
            <li> I have always shaved with electric razors, and for the past 3 years I&#x27;ve been shaving with a Braun Series 7 razor with the self-cleaning/charging dock.  </li>
            <li> Not appropriate.</li>
            <li> Not sure why....</li>
            <li> No more razor burn.</li>
            <li> SO far after 6+ months use it&#x27;s still cutting close without pulling the whiskers.</li>
            <li> I will admit that the blades/foil on the Braun were past their prime, and this can contribute to a loss of performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t shave on weekends, lazy,</li>
            <li> In the past, I used a Remington rotary shaver and it felt like my hairs were being pulled, instead of cut.</li>
            <li> My only beefs with it are that its expensive and you&lt;br /&gt;need</li>
            <li> Panasonic used to be my preferred shaver but no more.  </li>
            <li> No more Panasonic; I&#x27;m off to check out the Braun shavers.  </li>
            <li> the past I used the shaving cream but with the shavers but there is no need.</li>
            <li> I usually shave with a manual double-edged razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a screen type and rotary type in the past.  </li>
            <li> I need to work my skin and beard areas with the Panasonic, as I did with my past Remington razors.</li>
            <li> It can even be used with shave foam or gel, but I tend not to with electric shavers unless they produce a small amount of lather.  </li>
            <li> I usually charge this once or twice a week and keep it in my car to shave on my way to work.</li>
            <li> This razor is no better or worse than other electric razors I have owned.  </li>
            <li> so by Monday morning I have a very heavy beard</li>
            <li> I cant speak to how well it performs on very heavy</li>
            <li> Both razors utilize a 3 cutting head design which puts two foils with round holes on either side of one row of the head down the center with a series of linear slots instead of holes.</li>
            <li> Major disappointment.</li>
            <li> This electronic shaver is not very good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sick of decent products cheapened in order to increase the profit margin.  </li>
            <li> My first was the &amp;#34;Wet or Dry&amp;#34; model with the inductive charging base.</li>
            <li> At first I thought I&#x27;d want a base to charge rather than the cable it has now.</li>
            <li> But then again, that cradle would probably just collect crap from hanging out near the other junk on the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> But then again, that cradle would probably just collect crap from hanging out near the other junk on the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Those with especially tough beards seem to swear by four blades, but to me the four blade shavers are just too large.</li>
            <li> Those with especially tough beards seem to swear by four blades, but to me the four blade shavers are just too large.</li>
            <li> Even with this shaver, as despite the foil screen over the blades shaving dry is still just too uncomfortable for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s hard to tell where my goatee ends.  </li>
            <li> Cuts even hard to get neck hair.</li>
            <li> He has MS and has a hard time standing infront of the mirror and shaving so with this he can sit in his chair and shave.</li>
            <li> This razor sucks.</li>
            <li> This razor sucks.</li>
            <li> They recommend using it at least a month to get used to it, but, I found that within 10 days to 2 weeks I was used to it</li>
            <li> and I can get at least 12 shaves with it before recharging.  </li>
            <li> The battery will fully charge in 70 minutes (at least that was my measured rate) and retain the charge for weeks.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;ONE complaint.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to every man who shaves at least twice a day like myself.  </li>
            <li> I still use this at least 4-5 times/wk.  </li>
            <li> Just not thrilled.</li>
            <li> duh.</li>
            <li> Also, per reviews the Braun build quality and included accessories seems to be dropping as of late.  </li>
            <li> complaint is the plug into the razor; could have been easier.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of a complaint about this Panasonic shaver.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;they at least took me 2 weeks before settled</li>
            <li> (DUH ...</li>
            <li> Electric shavers were the least reprehensible way I had found to do the deed.  </li>
            <li> (common problem with Remingtons)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for over a year, never had any problems with it and the charge holds for at least two shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t know if it can deal with a truly thick stubble.  </li>
            <li> If my beard is so thick that I need to pre-shave, I will just use a hair trimmer to make it manageable.</li>
            <li> My beard is thick and grows in all directions.</li>
            <li> Either I have some incredibly thick hair, which I don&#x27;t think is the case, or I&#x27;ve got a lemon.  </li>
            <li> It is too slow, it should have been,it will on April 10 to my home, but  today still no news.</li>
            <li> have always found it difficult to get a close shave, particularly due to the sensitivity of my skin and thick beard.</li>
            <li> His rotary style razor was painful and made his face bleed; he tried disposable blades and shaving cream/foam and that left his face raw, too.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t mean you SHOULD.    </li>
            <li> Other pop-up trimmers seemed useless, compared to this one.</li>
            <li> No more!</li>
            <li> you haven&#x27;t shaved for a few days, you will use about half the battery life and lots of time going over and over your face before you get a close shave, and that will come at the price of a few painful tugs at stubble.  </li>
            <li> Both units hold a charge for a long time so it&#x27;s not too inconvenient to plug it in once a week or so.</li>
            <li> It is very uncomfortable shaving my upper lip on the up stroke.</li>
            <li> However, the foil screen has very small holes</li>
            <li> Just expect to be disappointed if you are used to the old Panasonic Linears from a decade ago.</li>
            <li> We have tried others in the past and they worked so poorly that I haven&#x27;t bought one for him for years.  </li>
            <li> The good news is the difference isn&#x27;t terribly noticeable, but the bad news is that there&#x27;s a difference.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately that was not true for my case.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong for $72.00 spent on this razor!!!</li>
            <li> After years of having bad razors I finally found the one that works.</li>
            <li> I think the issue is that the center of 3 cutting heads on the LT41 has been made wider than it was on the ES8086.</li>
            <li> Wasted my money on this one unfortunately...</li>
            <li> found that it was nearly impossible to dry shave against the grain with the Panasonic ES-LT41-k.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The batteries are the weak link in cordless razors.</li>
            <li> His beard is so tough he went through 2 disposable razors each shave.</li>
            <li> and I admit I have a tough set of whiskers.</li>
            <li> This has been a tough combo to deal with.  </li>
            <li> problem with my beard is that it is both very thick and it grows every which way.  </li>
            <li> My wife got this for me as a gift for my birthday, I guess her cheeks were getting tired of my stubble.  </li>
            <li> it absolutely fails to shave the hair on my neck and under chin; no idea why&lt;br /&gt;  - forced to use trimmer, but trimmer isn&#x27;t that great&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does not shave closely...takes forever to get even a poor shave.</li>
            <li> I have never experienced as close of a shave.  </li>
            <li> I have never experienced as close of a shave.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of seeing the tissues with blood over his face as the kiddies ran in and out of the bathroom as he shaved.  </li>
            <li> I also bought Philips Norelco PT730/41 Shaver 3500 which gave even worse performance than this one.</li>
            <li> Not great.</li>
            <li> Without this method, it will leave some close stuff behind.  </li>
            <li> I get approximately 9 shaves per charge, which is still well beyond a week</li>
            <li> And because I was tired of Gillette ripping me off with blade cartridges that had a 1500% markup ($2.50 for a cartridge vs. 15 cents for a double-edged blade).  </li>
            <li> but I was tired of my head being nicked and razor burned from a blade.</li>
            <li> feel it leaves behind.</li>
            <li> but I was never happy with the performance of the Braun.  </li>
            <li> 20 + years using Braun shavers and tired of replacing them just cause the battery was shot.</li>
            <li> How can newer models perform worse?  </li>
            <li> The read-out is now totally gone and I hate playing a guessing game as to when it needs charging.</li>
            <li> ; you plug one end of the cord into the base of the shaver, and the other end -- a piece measuring about 2\\&quot; x 2\\&quot; x 1\\&quot; thick -- plugs into an outlet.</li>
            <li> Like some other reviewer said, it&#x27;s a bit noise but not too bad.  </li>
            <li> In actuality, it&#x27;s a dandy of a device, cutting as close and as well (if not better) than my 5-blade models.</li>
            <li> I HATE shaving, I hate wet, dry, electric and razor shaving, period.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been disappointed with these shavers and have bought Panasonics a few times.  </li>
            <li> And the Panasonic hasn&#x27;t even been broken in yet!</li>
            <li> micro stubble and difficult</li>
            <li> Not perfect on the neck but</li>
            <li> You will still have shadow after shaving, and at the end of the day will have a terrible shadow, more than you should, because it is a terrible razor.  </li>
            <li> My third eslt41 is the WORST EVER!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the performance of the shaver did not improved.  </li>
            <li> - The sideburn trimmer is COMPLETELY USELESS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed by the travel pouch, but it will work.  </li>
            <li> How wrong I was.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is useless and pulls the hair and hurts every time.</li>
            <li> (my hair will often grow in at weird angles).</li>
            <li> (my hair will often grow in at weird angles).</li>
            <li> I have owned the rotary style razors and was never impressed by them.  </li>
            <li> I also priced replacement cutting heads and they are cheaper than the Braun&#x27;s which I was replacing every 2-4 months and still not happy with the shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> did buy it knowing that I couldn&#x27;t shave while charging which seems like a silly oversight in the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was stolen out of my bf&#x27;s car.</li>

            <li> Boy am I sorry now.  </li>
            <li> - The unit could fail causing this to be expensive over manual shaving.</li>
            <li> This was an expensive lesson for me.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best electric razor I ever used.  I use for my head and face and it works great.</li>
            <li> There is a reason why 87% of Amazon customer reviewers give this shaver a 4 or 5 star rating.  It&#x27;s a great shaver, period.  Whether or not it has all the bells and whistles some people might want, I can&#x27;t say. And I don&#x27;t know if it can deal with a truly thick stubble.  But, speaking for myself, I can say that it gives me a smooth, easy, close shave that is at least 3 times better than my old Panasonic electric shaver ...and virtually ties in comparison to a wet blade shave. The very first shave convinced me.  I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> Upgraded from a Philips Norelco Powertouch with Aquatec that I had been happy with, but the charging port on the razor gave out on me in roughly 14 months of us. BUT I&#x27;m so happy I had a reason to switch to this Panasonic model. Just took my first shave with it and find it gives a MUCH better shave than the Phillips had. And the Panasonic hasn&#x27;t even been broken in yet! Haven&#x27;t tried the trimmer yet, and it might be premature to give a Five Star review, but thus far I&#x27;m really blown away by the performance. Picked it up on sale for $59.99 Best Buy but easily worth it for the $79.99 Amazon sale price. Don&#x27;t hesitate on this one! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of electric shavers in the past years but this has to be the best so far. Some of the ones I&#x27;ve bought in the past have cost more than double and triple the price of this Panasonic ES-LT41-K Arc3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**As far as closeness of the shave goes (one of the main points I look for more than anything in an electric shaver), it out-performs the shavers I used before and it&#x27;s has been seven months since first using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**It doesn&#x27;t pull your whiskers or leave your skin irritated and red like other shavers plus the trimmer is as good as my beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Another plus I see in this shaver is the fact that a single charge will last at least two weeks! (when you use it for 3 minutes at a time).v&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**It indicates power reserve in 10% increments as well as when to clean and charge it.</li>
            <li> I have used many models of shavers and this one does the job. I cuts fairly close but could do a better job. The battery life is only average.</li>
            <li> Doesnot come with a charger wire.. only the razor, I need to buy the wire separate..</li>
            <li> Have always used a different brand. This shaved is quieter than any I&#x27;ve ever had. I like the cleaning options with soap as well.shave is good enough for me, I&#x27;m not too picky so I can&#x27;t rate it on the stubble meter. For the price I think this was a great buy. The power meter is well worth it as well as I travel often.</li>
            <li> Excellent shave, well designed, easy to hold and comfortable to use.  Charge lasts several days.  Although the shaver can be used either dry or wet I have learned to appreciate a wet shave with this razor.</li>
            <li> This product did not work as expected. Bought it for my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday and ended up returning it.  It would not have at all after 5 passes and tons of skin irritation</li>
            <li> This is my 5th Panasonic razor in about 20 years.  Never had a problem with any of them.  I use it for dry shaving but it does have a better cut when your beard is wet.  I&#x27;m not wild about the trimmer on this model but I rarely use it.  I get about 9 shaves before a recharge.  Unfortunately this did not have a stand, but I used one from a former model.  I like the lock ring to prevent it from coming on during travel, but find it&#x27;s placement curious because I have locked it numerous times during use.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> My husband is an older man who has &amp;#34;gone&amp;#34; through lots of shavers in forty-plus years of our marriage.  This is one of the better ones; he especially likes that it shaves quickly.</li>
            <li> Simple breakdown&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;- charges fast&lt;br /&gt;- can use wet/dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- not as close a shave as it should be&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall not a bad razor, I was a bit disappointed though as I thought it would shave a lot closer to the skin then it does. I used the razor lotion that you can use before you shave but that only helped a little bit. It seems that within one day you would have to shave again to keep it smooth. Maybe it&#x27;s just my facial hair type and other people wont have that issue. I tried different combinations (after a shower, in the shower etc) but it seemed to work best when your face is dry and you apply the &#x27;pre-shave&#x27; lotion.</li>
            <li> My son likes this, has no complaints.</li>
            <li> Compared to my old Remington MS2, this thing is a joke.  Bought it about 3 mos ago.  Possibly its better with wet shaving, but dry shaving is an absolute chore.  It shaves whiskers in such microscopic particles that you&#x27;ll create a messy accumulation of them all over a vanity.  And you&#x27;ll have to rub, rub, rub to get any results.  I&#x27;ve tried various pressure and that&#x27;s the only method that works.  For a close shave, I usually have to finish up with the old Remington.  Its battery is giving up, and its still a better performer.  Don&#x27;t buy the hype on this one, and don&#x27;t buy it period.</li>
            <li> irritates the heck out of my face because I have to make many passes to get it done. I thought that if I have irritable skin, best to go electric. However, it does a worse job than a regular blade and it still irritates my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve switched to just using a beard trimmer for everything and foregoing a close shave.</li>
            <li> I am giving it as a gift so I have not used it but sm im[prssed by its style and versatility.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best electric razors I have used in my 30 plus years of buying them. Great job Panasonic!</li>
            <li> I love this razor, It does a good good and is gentle on the skin on my face.</li>
            <li> I have owned them all over the years - Norelco, Braun, Wahl, Remington. This is by far the Best of The Best. Great close shave, Super features Wet or Dry, Easy to clean, + voltage Monitor to guide you  on usage left. No razor burn, Fast, Linear Motor Drive&lt;br /&gt;A rapid-fire 13,000 cycles per minute linear motor drive delivers a faster, closer shave. The fast, linear motor ensures a quick cut, eliminating pulling, tugging and irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Panasonic Great Product. Would recommend to all.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor to replace a 10 year old panasonic shaver and I am very glad I did.  I didn&#x27;t realize how ineffective my old one had become until I used this one.  Shaves close with no pulling and does it in half the time it used to.  For the price this is a great shaver, the trimmer works great, a little odd on the angle but cuts really well.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> This works VERY well! I&#x27;ve used a handful of electric shavers over the years, none work really well. Some better than others, I&#x27;ve found that the foil type work better than the rotating ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a Braun series 3 that worked well, but it disappeared after a trip. I&#x27;m a physique competitor and my wife is as well, so we use this to shave our legs/arms/back etc. before we do a show or to maintain. Not that she&#x27;s hairy (I&#x27;m part gorilla) but it does a great job with my coarse hair and her almost invisible peach fuzz on her arms--so it&#x27;s versatile. You have to get EVERY SINGLE HAIR before you spray tan for a show. Competitors reading this you know what I&#x27;m talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge indicator is a HUGE plus, it&#x27;s nice knowing when you&#x27;ve got 10% left! Also, the button lock is a god send...lock it and it won&#x27;t turn on in your bag!</li>
            <li> OMG AMAZING! __I have tried different products, trimmer etc and by far this is the greatest investment I have ever done; I&#x27;m like super happy, completely satisfied with this product. It does exactly what it says it does and the results... WOW! Avery smooth close to the skin shave. Oh yeah, its like shaving honestly. Finally I can say Goodbye to those expensive 5 blade razors. This is the real deal. 5 stars definitely. The price is right, works perfectly for my legs and unwanted hairs on some other areas of your body. BTW... Getting this product the second day with this prime thing is AWESOME. Try it if you haven&#x27;t already done it. It works. Im very happy. Arriba, arriba yeeeeeha... Hahahaha</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding razor. I&#x27;ve had a much more expensive Arc4, ES8249 for several years, long enough to replace the blades more than twice, and I found that I wanted a replacement, that would be cheaper to replace blades on.  This is not only cheaper, but it does a better job of shaving for me!  I think that this is because my face is oval, not round, so the narrower head works better for me. I&#x27;ve also lost a little weight, so my face is thinner, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like shape and the power off lock button as well. It can travel in a soft bag, rather than need the harder traveling case that my ES8249 uses. That makes it more compact for traveling light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a Braun 5090CC, and it wasn&#x27;t nearly as comfortable, or as good shaving for me.  I have it up for sale locally, online.  A Braun Series 7, shaved as well, but it was far more expensive.  I am definitely a happy camper.</li>
            <li> I have owned numerous electric razors over the years, Norelco rotary cordless and corded, Remington cordless and corded, Wahl dual foil (only shaver made in the USA), Braun triple foil (Germany).  This is my first Panasonic (Japan/China).  I researched everything on the market.  I was looking for a corded razor in the $25 range. There are none any more. The batteries are the weak link in cordless razors. My prior experience confirmed that corded ones last due to not having a battery.  The shaves amongst them all were similar.... micro stubble and difficult to get the neck clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS PANASONIC is by FAR the closest electric shave I have ever had.  As good as a blade on the face.  Not perfect on the neck but NONE are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What sets this one apart: 30 degree angle nano blades, 13,000 oscillations in the motor, Li-ion battery, wet/dry, pop up trimmer.  Easy clean up, no costly add on alcohol bath required. The Arc 3 blade system flex and pivots to better conform to your facial contours.  The head of the razor is not oversized, which I prefer.  Other 4/5 blade electric razors had this as a complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oscillations in the blade are higher than a Braun (13K vs 10K)  at a much lower price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the neck, I have found that by using a 90 degree angle plus a letter &amp;#34;L&amp;#34; motion technique I can get the neck stubble.  Changing my technique improved the performance of this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this razor - it is the CLOSEST electric shave I have ever had.  I am sold on it.  I am now a fan of Panasonic cordless electric razors.  (Too bad they do not make a lower cost corded electric in tis style.)</li>
            <li> Did a lot of research on the shaver, and using it I don&#x27;t have any complaints</li>
            <li> I have been using these Panasonic razors for quite some time, and they perform well, and are reasonably priced. I like the easy to clean, cutting head, and the fact that they can be used &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;... I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love it so far.  After 2 months its working great and battery life is surprisingly long.</li>
            <li> The best shave I&#x27;d got so far with electric shavers was with the Norelco RQ12 heads, but after their price increase and subsequent disappearance I was fed up with that brand, particularly given the poor performance of their RQ10 heads. With this Panasonic I can finally get a close shave, and that&#x27;s even without the wet option, which is even closer. It&#x27;s kinda loud, or at least louder than Norelcos, but tolerable. I kept pressing the off button by mistake while shaving, until I used the lock lever to keep it on, so it&#x27;s helpful for that as well as for travel. If it keeps going the way it started it will have earned 5 stars, so far it&#x27;s a very good buy.  Update: just tried a wet shave with Body Shop shaving cream, and it gives an even closer shave, close enough to blades, without the cuts; very impressive. It cleans easily and charges very quickly. Updated to 5 stars!</li>
            <li> This razor sucks. I shouldn&#x27;t have to manipulate my neck and skin to get a close shave.  I have red bumps mostly on my neck and sometimes my face with every shave. Hopefully getting a new razor that won&#x27;t cause these problems for Christmas.  Not a close or effective shave at all.  You will still have shadow after shaving, and at the end of the day will have a terrible shadow, more than you should, because it is a terrible razor.  Here&#x27;s to not having a torn up red neck.  Which I have daily because using a manual razor is even worse. This razor sucks.</li>
            <li> Very useful razor which is good for my face.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver as a birthday gift for my cousin.  He has been using [[ASIN:B001DNE3KQ Panasonic ES8103S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Silver]] for years and wanted to have a new shaver.  I stop by at Best Buy and was informed this is the replacement of ES8103S Panasonic Nano shaver.  My cousin likes this shaver better because this one has a lock button -- it&#x27;s great for travel.  It&#x27;s a great choice.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> For many years I used a couple of different Remington Microscreen razors and was happy with them. About 8 months ago the old one wore out and rather than just ordering another one I decided to do so research and buy the best razor out there.  After reading the high ratings and glowing reviews on this Panasonic I decided it was worth the few extra bucks and ordered one. I should point out that I only shave dry and I knew this was a wet/dry razor, but from the first time I tried it I was disappointed.  It just took a lot longer to finish a shave with this thing.  I had to go over the same area multiple times and press relatively hard to get the same results I always got with my Remington. I told my myself that maybe the blades just needed to wear in and I decided to keep it. It never got any better. After only a few weeks I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t holding its charge very long. After six months I only get 6-7 shaves before I had to charge it again. My old Remington would go weeks before needing a charge. I also didn&#x27;t like the trimmer as well. It is only about three quarters of an inch wide and the Remington was twice that and really made it easier to trim around my ears between haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;A few days ago after dragging this thing over the same patch of stubble repeatedly, I got fed up. I got out my iPad and ordered another Remington.  It was cheaper than this Panasonic and I shaved with it this morning. I had forgotten how much simpler and quicker and more comfortable shaving can be. My perfectly good Panasonic is now in the trash. I really can&#x27;t say anything good about this shaver other than it will eventually do the job. Maybe my beard is just not compatible with this shaver, or maybe this thing only works as a wet shaver, but if this type of shaver isn&#x27;t doing it for you why not look at the Remingtin MS2- 390 which is the one I use.</li>
            <li> This shaver is the best I ever found - at least within my meager price range.  It&#x27;s put together very well, recharges in practically no time and hold the charge well.  Shaving is excellent - close with very minimal irritation and it does even better if you have a little soap on your face.</li>
            <li> This is my third panasonic rasor. My first es8066 (no longer offered) is the very best.  My second es8243 is not bad, smooth on my face, but noisy, and the lcd failed after barely a year.  My third eslt41 is the WORST EVER! I have been using it for a month now and my face is irritaded, raw and sore. Two days ago I finally gave up and went back to my old es8066.  I am trying to find out if and how to send this last rasor back.</li>
            <li> As far as razors go, this items does what it advertises, just like its predecessor.  The wet/dry feature is nice though I haven&#x27;t compared to other brands with the same feature.    It is quieter than the previous model but other than that, there are no improvements.    2 big negatives to explain my rating:    The power plug is a hair off from previous models which means that my existing Panasonic charger/cleaner can not be used.  Why?  Because they want to sell me new accessories.  I get the capitalism, but this is not the way to do it.    The price is the same or higher than what I paid over 5 years ago for virtually the same model.  Again, just because you CAN over charge for a razor with no improvements doesn&#x27;t mean you SHOULD.    Its an okay razor but I try not to do business with companies that don&#x27;t put the customer&#x27;s needs first so this will likely be my last Panasonic purchase.</li>
            <li> The electric razor was ok, I just didn&#x27;t like it. I gave it to my son and he loves it.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality - shaves very well.  Battery charges very quickly and holds it charge well - about a week or a little more for me.  Nice feel.  Particularly good price/quality value in comparison to other available shavers.</li>
            <li> Purchased the shaver for my father in November. He just told me over the weekend that he is very happy with it. Easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my husband for Christmas and he loves it.</li>
            <li> Panasonic shavers are among the best, from my experience, and the ES-LT41-K is right at the sweet spot.  It offers a high level of performance and useful features - good blades, 13,000 cycle per minute cutter - without unnecessary frills.  To match the shaver to your needs, see the charts in the product listing for a great summary of the differences in the models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GIVE IT TIME:  If you&#x27;re making the change to electric shavers, or switching brands, don&#x27;t be hasty in reaching a decision about the shaver.  Electric shavers are very different from a razor, and vary quite a lot among different brands.  It will take a little time to figure out how to best use a given electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, you really can&#x27;t get the same shave with a shaver that you can with a razor.  But then again, a shaver can be a lot more comfortable to use, especially on your lip and chin (where it can feel like your beard is being pulled out, rather than cut, with a razor).  To me it&#x27;s worth the tradeoff, though I do usually clean up with a razor to catch hairs and stubble I&#x27;ve missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GIVE IT TIME, PART 2:  You may find you need to shave a little longer than you&#x27;d like to, or go over the same spot more than you think you ought to.  But with a little bit of patience, you can get a remarkably close shave with this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WET OR DRY:  If you only use this shaver dry, you may be missing something.  It&#x27;s a different shave wet, and it&#x27;s great that this shaver is built to let you shave wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EASY TO CLEAN:  The wet or dry construction also makes it easy to clean - just run it under the faucet (with the cleaning mode on, if you like).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT BATTERY LIFE:  I can go weeks between charges.  If possible, it&#x27;s best to let the battery run all the way down and then recharge it fully to get the best charge capacity.  Also, while the charge indicator is useful, it seems it can stay at 10% for a long time.  Don&#x27;t put the shaver on the charger when it reaches 10% - use it for more shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THREE BLADES OR FOUR?  Those with especially tough beards seem to swear by four blades, but to me the four blade shavers are just too large. Personal preference will vary - neither one is right for everybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRICES FLUCTUATE:  There are certain items on Amazon which seem to have wide price fluctuations, and Panasonic shavers are among them.  So it may be worth tracking the price a little, or searching the web, to catch it on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SKIP THE CLEANING STATION:  Some may find it useful, but to me the cleaning station seems like a holdover from the days of harder-to-clean models.  I had one on my last Panasonic shaver and never used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Braun shavers for many years, but after being disappointed with the declining performance of their more expensive shavers, I switched to Panasonic and haven&#x27;t looked back.  The Panasonic ES-LT41-K is an excellent choice among electric shavers.er when it reaches 10% - use it for more shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THREE BLADES OR FOUR?  Those with especially tough beards seem to swear by four blades, but to me the four blade shavers are just too large. Personal preference will vary - neither one is right for everybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRICES FLUCTUATE:  There are certain items on Amazon which seem to have wide price fluctuations, and Panasonic shavers are among them.  So it may be worth tracking the price a little, or searching the web, to catch it on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SKIP THE CLEANING STATION:  Some may find it useful, but to me the cleaning station seems like a holdover from the days of harder-to-clean models.  I had one on my last Panasonic shaver and never used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Braun shavers for many years, but after being disappointed with the declining performance of their more expensive shavers, I switched to Panasonic and haven&#x27;t looked back.  The Panasonic ES-LT41-K is an excellent choice among electric shavers.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is very pleased with this razor as it is easy to hold and gets a close shave without nicking his face. He gets several shaves from one charging and it&#x27;s very easy to clean. (((And since the cleaning in this house always falls on me so that is a big plus.)))</li>
            <li> Very good choice.  I rate this Electric Shaver as a Five Star . Close Shaves every time, up-keep and cleaning&lt;br /&gt;  is so easy.</li>
            <li> I had been a Norelco fan for years but their quality suffered recently along with rising prices. I tried a Remington foil and it was bad. This shaver cuts closer and is quieter and with more features likes cleaning, shaving wet, etc. Only downside is like most foil shavers, if you miss a whisker 2 days straight the foil won&#x27;t pick it up. So on those few occasions I use the trimmer blade. It even tells you when to clean it!! Great shaver.</li>
            <li> My father said, he never used such a good shaver.</li>
            <li> I have owned various electric shavers over the years and find that this Panasonic gives the closest shave in the least amount of time of any of them. Closer and better in the neck and jaw area than the Braun 300 series and certainly better than any of the Remingtons I have owned. Second best is actually the Braun Total Control. If you can live with the fairly loud 13,000 cycle hum you will probably like this Panasonic.</li>
            <li> This is a solid electric shaver. Very accomodative of various curves and angles of the face. Gives a smooth shave. Battery lasts long. I like the fact that you can use it on a wet face as well, as dry-face shaving irritates my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> Wow. This is the best shaver ever. I don&#x27;t really care what the blades are made of, but if &#x27;nanotech&#x27; is the reason that this shaver makes me happy then so be it. The shave is smooth, with no burn. There was a close, even shave with no long hairs &#x27;leftover&#x27; at the bottom of the neck. Overall, this shaver is impressive and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This shaver is gentle and gives a good, close shave. It charges quickly, is easy to clean, and has a very convenient display to tell you how much power is left and whether it needs to be cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drawback is that this isn&#x27;t saving me as much time as I&#x27;d hoped when I decided to switch from a regular razor to an electric one; I have to go over some areas several times to get all the hairs. That&#x27;s the only problem I have, but it&#x27;s definitely a significant one.</li>
            <li> I previously owned 3 Panasonic electric shavers and I was very satisfied with them.  Unfortunately, my experience with this model has been very poor. The first thing that disappointed me is that I am only able to get about 4 shaves out of a single charge, this is a bit less than the previous Panasonic shavers I have had.  My second problem, The first couple weeks I used this shaver I did not think the shave was as good as my previous Panasonic electric, not horrible, but not as good. I didn&#x27;t worry about this initially because I do realize that it can take a few weeks for your skin to adjust to a new shaver. Unfortunately, the performance of the shaver did not improved.  After using this shaver for over 3 months I notice that I am spending more time shaving than normal and I am forced to go over areas on my face numerous times before it is smooth, something that rarely happened with my last Panasonic shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up, battery life isn&#x27;t good, and it doesn&#x27;t shave as close or as well as my previous Panasonic shavers.</li>
            <li> The first thing that stood out about the Panasonic was the noise. Sound level was measured at 2 inches from shaver head. Panasonic ES-LT41 measured 84 dB; my old Norelco 8140XL measured 78 dB, using an old but consistent and reliable dB meter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 6 dB difference seems consistent with what I hear; the Panasonic measures to be four times as loud as the Norelco, and it seems that way when shaving. (The dB scale is logarithmic; a 3 dB increase means a doubling in loudness.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for cutting, it shaves smoothly. It is the best electric I have used for cutting hair on the back of my neck, and it  does a good job on those stray hairs forward of my bald spot that now seem out of place. I suspect that it might be one of the best for those who want a shaved head, so I&#x27;m considering giving it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It charges quickly enough, cleans easily in the shower or under a faucet, holds a charge for several days, and keeps you informed as to the status of the battery. The trimmer seems OK as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of typical disposable razors and have over the years tried a few different (Phillips / Norelco) electric shavers, but nothing to really make me convert. I recently wanted to try another electric shaver, mainly because I&#x27;ve been feeling guilty about all the landfill I&#x27;m creating with cheap disposable razors (I break off the head and throw the shaft in the recycling, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s actually recyclable) and the rather expensive cost of the better quality disposable razors.  Anyway, due to the positive reviews I bought one of the Panasonic wet/dry shavers and it&#x27;s actually rather good... for an electric.  PROS:  - I find that the closeness of the shave is quite good, and while not as close as a razor, still close enough to make me happy.  - It&#x27;s also very safe and I don&#x27;t think anyone could cut themselves without doing something ridiculous, and the fact that it is waterproof makes it that much safer in a wet environment.  - The charging time and number of shaves seems reasonable.  - Cleaning is quick and easy, especially as it can be opened and run under the tap / faucet.  - The travel lock is handy.  - The build quality seems reasonable.  - Price if purchased from Amazon is *very* reasonable.  CONS:  - Takes a while to get a close, clean shave compared to a razor (but this is a general complaint against all electric shavers).  - Cost of replacement blades and foils (but this is also quite reasonable given the costs of good disposable razors in Australia).  - The sideburn trimmer is COMPLETELY USELESS. This is my main gripe with the unit and why I still need to intermittently use a disposable razor. If you like neat sideburns, you will definitely need something other than this shaver to maintain them. Grrrr! :/ If they improved this it would be a pretty amazing device.  PS: Before anyone comments, I realise that this shaver may in the long run be worse for the environment given the electricity usage and the heavy metals involved in making the battery, etc. However, it&#x27;s nice to not be regularly throwing things away and using dull razors.</li>
            <li> Going strong for five months - just as expected &amp; no complaints. Much quieter than the Braun I used to have and easier to handle than my prior Panasonic which had four rows of blades, making that model too unwieldy and hard to get in curves around nose or chin. This one is much better size, lighter, easier to handle, and seems more sturdy &amp; reliable.</li>
            <li> .Been a Braun fan for years but after reading reviews decided to try this one. So much quieter and smooth. More economical as well</li>
            <li> I have had the Panasonic for several months now and I shave my entire head everyday.  I have used a lot of different shavers but I like this one best so far.  It gives me a closer shave in less time.  It is also easy to clean and keep clean without the use of oils or a brush.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 6 months now and I&#x27;m happy with it.  Like some other reviewer said, it&#x27;s a bit noise but not too bad.  I was a Braun fan but glad I tried this one.</li>
            <li> Son in law loves it. Very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Very good shaver that operates as advertised. Very easy to use and clean. I get about 5 or 6 shaves between charges, and found that it recharges fairly quickly.  Will not shave as close as a manual shaver blade, however suffices for daily use. Trimmer works very well for sideburns, and around the ears. I have found that foamed soap, or electric razor pre-shave product (like Williams &amp;#34;Lectric Shave&amp;#34;), used before a shower, to be the most effective shaving method with this shaver.</li>
            <li> This worked fairly well for my husband.  It required three passes to get all the beard, but did the job eventually. It evidently went by the way of our waste basket which was sitting under the table it was on.  We looked everywhere but never found it.  I guess the trash yard got it.  I ordered another different model, same company and that one is excellent.</li>
            <li> This item is not what I expected, its better off using a razor then this shaver. If you are planning for a dry shave it&#x27;s almost impossible. I reccomend the Whal shaver instead of the Panasonic. The Whal does really close shaves my barber use&#x27;s it and I am now kicking myself in the butt for not purchasing it, If you purchase this you will soon learn you have made a mistake trust me !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey (for me) but it works absolutely as advertised and maintenance of it is simple, which has helped to keep the blades in good shape. I have had it for over a year now and am very pleased. It still gives a really close, which I appreciate as I have thick stubble. Whenever this one dies (hopefully a few years down the road at least) I will look for this model and buy another one.</li>
            <li> After reading about a thousand reviews I finally settled on this one. I decided that the 4 blade or larger shavers would probably be too big and this one has turned out fine. As other people say it does take about a month for your skin to get used to it, and there is a learning curve for shaving your face once you figure out your facial hair patterns or directions. I have very sensitive skin and this has almost eliminated razor bumps and ingrown hairs, only have problems when I get in a hurry and shave too fast or rough. I chose this shaver for the linear motor and higher rpm, and it gives me a smoother shave than mach whatever razors.</li>
            <li> We have bought many shavers in the past.. That&#x27;s all my husband uses! (And I use on my legs when he&#x27;s not working) 😍 haha&lt;br /&gt;This shaver has  such a nice clean shave. Does not leave stubs like most shavers. It&#x27;s easy to use. Holds a long charge. Not cheaply made. It&#x27;s high quality and very durable.</li>
            <li> My wife got this for me as a gift for my birthday, I guess her cheeks were getting tired of my stubble.  Before this I was a razor man and I&#x27;d go a week or so between shaves out of laziness and because I work from home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off the pro&#x27;s of this electric razor.  It really does offer a lot of nice features.  First and foremost you can use it in the shower which means while I&#x27;m washing I can also be shaving.  For me this is great, I don&#x27;t spend any extra time in the shower but my face gets shaved in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery so far has lasted about a week and a half and is only down to 50%.  That&#x27;s with shaving every day for maybe 5 minutes while I&#x27;m in the shower.  The digital readout lets me know how much juice is left so I don&#x27;t see myself ever getting in one morning and finding a dead razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razors materials are also really nice.  I really want nice things in my life.  I hate plasticy feeling objects that are badly designed and while this is made out of plastic it feels well built and the plastics that are used are nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the one and only downside.  This razor while nice for keeping my beard under control with daily shavings isn&#x27;t meant for much more then light stubble.  Initially I started with a medium stubble and after 10 minutes I gave up and took it down with a razor.  I&#x27;ve also noticed that you need to come at hair from different angles in order to get everything.  At first I noticed a few odd patches here and there that weren&#x27;t getting cut, but now things seem to be going fairly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this seems like a great electric razor to keep things under control.  Just be sure to have a backup razor if you decide to let things grow for a few days.</li>
            <li> Really good razor, close shave</li>
            <li> Read a review from a woman that recommended this. whoever you are-- THANK YOU! skip the pink ladies! This is the best! not anything fancy but better than my finances $250 braun!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my perennials so I don&#x27;t tear them out the following year before they emerge.</li>
            <li> I used the shaver for one month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros:&lt;br /&gt;- quality built&lt;br /&gt;- extremely easy to clean (no need to buy those auto-cleaners); takes seconds&lt;br /&gt;- battery lasts a good ~8 shaves; charges extremely fast&lt;br /&gt;- nice holding pouch&lt;br /&gt;- can wash out with water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;- it absolutely fails to shave the hair on my neck and under chin; no idea why&lt;br /&gt;  - forced to use trimmer, but trimmer isn&#x27;t that great&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t shave well enough, I get a half dozen in-grown hairs per day with this shaver&lt;br /&gt;  - using the trimmer helps with in-grown hairs somewhat&lt;br /&gt;- I have to go over the same area many times to get a clean shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;conclusion: the in-grown hairs were annoying to the point I no longer wanted to shave; I&#x27;ll just keep this as a travel shaver</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave every day since my skin just can&#x27;t handle it. This shaver works great but when I use the trimmer to bring my 2nd day stubble down to a short enough length for the shaver to work, it has some issues staying open. The design of the trimmer is at an odd angle that makes it hard for the trimmer not to flip down and off. Guess they should make the trimmer a little more stable for repeated use. The angle also makes it very hard to see exactly what you&#x27;re cutting so watch out around the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if the trimmer was designed/built a bit better but besides that it is a great shave!</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver. I used to shave with razor. I did&#x27;t expected that a machine can be better and closer than a three-bladed razor. The feel of smoothness and the power of linear motor is impressive.   If you need a electric shaver, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it. I don&#x27;t think it is necessary to buy a more expensive machine if you don&#x27;t care about having a automatic cleaner unit.  Note: I had to order an european plug adaptor with the shaver, because I will use it in Turkey:)</li>
            <li> Automatically Returned, coz&#x27; cannot ship out from US, but this is the only case like this I met during the past 3 years!</li>
            <li> The display starting glitching several months after purchase. Otherwise, it&#x27;s been a perfectly functional razor. It works well and has a good, solid build.</li>
            <li> Best electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned</li>
            <li> This beats my Panasonic Close Curves women&#x27;s shaver, in all respects.  It’s great on my legs, and to my surprise, isn’t irritating on my underarms—which the Close Curves was, so I couldn&#x27;t even use it there.  Compared to my CC, this charges in 1 hour (vs. 12), holds a charge longer, and has more features.  I especially like the digital battery level indicator and the vibrating cleaning cycle that shakes out the shaved hairs.  It has an indicator for when it needs cleaning, though I don&#x27;t rely on that as I clean it after each use.  The CC is much cheaper, but this was well worth the extra cost.  I&#x27;ll never buy a woman’s electric shaver again.</li>
            <li> This is a good shaver for the price. I also have a 4 blade Panasonic which does give a faster shave but the head is bulkier. Both Panasonics give a close, comfortable shave however overall i prefer the Arc 4 shaver.</li>
            <li> Nice cut, charge lasts a long time. I really like the battery strength meter.</li>
            <li> Very happy with shaver. Gives a close shave without irritating my skin, and this is in the first week if use.  Very easy to clean &amp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;comfortable to hold,  Love shaving with lather</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver, dry, wet, and with shaving gel.  They recommend using it at least a month to get used to it, but, I found that within 10 days to 2 weeks I was used to it and I like the shave that it provides.  I think I get the closest shave using shaving gel, but, dry or wet shaving is very serviceable as well.  AND I no longer have to worry about nicks like before with my double and triple edged razor blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been one for shaving. I always get one of two things&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Never a close cut, or&lt;br /&gt;2) Bloody face / Ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This electric gets very close to my face. Closer than any other razor I&#x27;ve had. I love that you can use shaving cream with it to keep it from getting too rough. Although I do use my bladed razor to finish up against the grain, it gets so close even the bladed razor is smooth. Battery lasts a very long time. Very nice product.</li>
            <li> Amazing product that performs flawlessly with precision gently shaving with unbelievable closeness unlike the many like assorted products I&#x27;ve used over the years. Recharging takes less than an hour once or twice a week depending on usage. This shaver is solidly built with quality &amp; performance that can be used in or out of the shower. Highly recommended for both men &amp; women.</li>
            <li> Gosh, I&#x27;ve been using a Norelco (a cheaper one), which was pretty good. But after reading these reviews I thought I&#x27;d trust these Amazon reviewers and try this Panasonic. Glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is great. No electric seems as close as a blade to me, although this one is VERY close to a blade. It&#x27;s sure is close enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it dry, but it&#x27;s really good even dry. I&#x27;ve owned many electric razors in my 60 years, but I&#x27;d have to say this one is clearly the best shave. It fits my hand like a glove. It&#x27;s VERY quiet and very fast. I have a medium beard, and shaving takes about 3-4 minutes. It charges very quickly, perhaps an hour (but that&#x27;s a guess).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gentlemen, this really is a better mousetrap. I am very pleased with this and I think you will be as well. As I write this, I&#x27;ve been thinking about any &amp;#34;cons&amp;#34; to report to you, but I honestly can&#x27;t think of any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and I believe it does it very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish you luck with your choice.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what is happening with electric razors.  This Panasonic is a nice sized product, but the battery life and the quality of the shave are not as good as I&#x27;ve had in the past with much older Braun and Norelco products.  The reason I chose the Panasonic was because of the price and the write-ups, so I have been mildly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to electric razors: with 8 years in the military I am not new to shaving.  This razor definitely convinced me of electric shaving. It takes a few passes to get all the hairs, cuts close and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin as much as normal as a traditional razor.&lt;br /&gt; My hair is pretty thick and the razor seems to have problems cutting under my chin and neck area. I would recommend this to newer shavers who want to try out electric shaving. But plan on upgrading in the future!</li>
            <li> I bought this to pack with my toiletries for travel.  I have the Panasonic 8243 also and find it shaves more comfortably and closer than this one.  I liked the reviews on this one and tried it.  It gives a decent shave, is smaller and faster.  It hurts the slightest bit when shaving while holding my skin taught, while the 8243 doesn&#x27;t.  This one doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close even after multiple passes.  Still, quite pleased with this.  I had a Norelco that I bought at Costco and this shaves much closer than that one.</li>
            <li> Gives me a smooth and close shave</li>
            <li> Right off the bat, I liked the look of the [[ASIN:B005DKKBRY Panasonic ES-LT41-K Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Black/Silver]].  It&#x27;s called a \\&quot;Men&#x27;s\\&quot; razor, but I didn&#x27;t let that scare me off.  After less than an hour, it was fully charged and ready to go, and has been going fine for about a month now.  It&#x27;s very easy to operate without reading the manual, cleans up beautifully with a little liquid soap and water, and retains it&#x27;s charge just fine.  The pop up trimmer works great and is an added feature I like, as are the clear LCD display, wet or dry capability and the lock.  I&#x27;m not impressed by the travel pouch, but it will work.  Not using this on a face, I haven&#x27;t encountered a sensitivity issue that many men experience.  On the contrary, it&#x27;s produced a nice close shave without pain.  Being that it weighs nearly a half pound, it will likely remain in the bathroom where it will be used under both wet and dry conditions, but will not travel.  I&#x27;ll recommend this shaver for women as well as men.</li>
            <li> My expectations were so low before using this shaver because I have several other more expensive electric shavers across many brands and thought surely this fairly cheap, no-frills model wasn&#x27;t going to be anything to get excited about. In actuality, it&#x27;s a dandy of a device, cutting as close and as well (if not better) than my 5-blade models. It charges up lightning fast and is able to get corners and hard to reach places. The pop out trimmer works very well too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only have one complaint, in fact, and that is that it is very loud. Like, the hum of an airplane loud. Not a deal breaker, obviously, but be warned the family will hear you in the morning when you&#x27;re doing your daily shave. Otherwise, fantastic model from Panasonic and I would recommend it with all my heart. If you&#x27;re afraid you&#x27;re missing some special something from the more expensive models, you&#x27;re not. It&#x27;s just as good.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo33RSI6N84T6MZ]]I give the Panasonic ES-LT41-K a solid 4 Stars. It delivers a close shave, but it does take getting used to. Check out my video review for more.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband to replace his old Remington and he hates it.  Does not shave closely...takes forever to get even a poor shave. He&#x27;s used it only periodically for three months and it just does not work.  Anytime we&#x27;re at our lake home, he uses and prefers his old Remington.</li>
            <li> I like it. It takes a little time for your skin to adjust but it&#x27;s convenient, relatively fast and gives a good shave. I have gotten between 3 and 4 shaves per charge, and that seems reasonable. Given that it&#x27;s a lot less expensive than many other electric shavers available, I consider it a good buy.</li>
            <li> I had used a rotary shaver for close to 30 years and it did take me a while to adjust to this as it made my neck break out badly at first...no longer an issue. I have read some reviews where people talk about great battery life; I can&#x27;t imagine how they shave as I am lucky if I get 5 days without a re-charge needed. I don&#x27;t mind this, too much, as it is just a slight inconvenience. I have had this razor for just over three months and one of the numbers in the digital read-out is no longer visible. Fortunately it is the \\&quot;ones\\&quot; digit so that I at least know what percent of a charge remains. However, having this happen after just a few months is a concern. Overall, I do find that I get a closer shave but I wish these \\&quot;mechanical\\&quot; issues did not exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update as of 4 months of having this shaver. I am very unhappy with this shaver and Panasonic. The read-out is now totally gone and I hate playing a guessing game as to when it needs charging. After originally being told that they would send me an advance replacement so that I would not be without a shaver, they called back to say that was an error and they could not do that. I was told I would have to send it back first and then they would send me a new one. So my only solution is to buy a razor to fill the gap between Panasonic razors...this is not going to happen. I will return to Norelco, even though I think the Panasonic gives me a slightly better shave. If this part is gone after only 4 months, what will happen over the next 4 months?</li>
            <li> nice smooth shave, does what its supposed to. It does a irritate my skin when I press to hard or go over same spot to get hard to get hairs. It also can&#x27;t be used while charging.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. The battery is good for couple of shaves, plus it recharges quickly&lt;br /&gt;2. Very easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;3. The razor for sideburns is effective&lt;br /&gt;4. It gives a smooth and close skin shaving&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. You have to repeat certain areas more than twice, especially the neck and area&lt;br /&gt;2. The dynamic head does not really do a good job&lt;br /&gt;3. The shaver is loud&lt;br /&gt;4. I get skin irritations even when I use shaving cream for wet shave</li>
            <li> I used it every day for 30 days... and my neck irritation has cleared. It&#x27;s a smooth shave and I use it on my face and head.</li>
            <li> Check the rating of  the rug.  It should be applied to this razor.  I think that I have written more than enough!</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver for 3 months and fairly satisfied with it.  It is very easy to handle and I can get at least 12 shaves with it before recharging.  However, it doesn&#x27;t shave any closer than my old Remington 407 shaver.</li>
            <li> My dad absolutely loves it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a lot of Panasonic Wet/Dry shavers, but this is by far the best one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shaves extremely close. It&#x27;s lightweight, and it holds a charge for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I really like this electric shaver, it fits nice in the hand and has plenty of speed and power. This shaver really hums along, much faster than my older model. I like the head tilt option from side to side that follows your faces different contours or you have the ability to lock this feature to keep it rigid. The trimmer works very well and it has a nice looking on/off button that also has a locking feature to prevent the shaver from accidentally turning on when not in use. It has a good looking no nonsense led readout that lets you know how much battery charge is left and also reminds you to clean it when it&#x27;s time. Cleaning is simple and effective, you just add a couple of drops of mild handsoap to the foils and turn on under a stream of water, the razor is so fast that it immediately starts to foam up and rense clean, ready for your next shave. You can use this shaver wet or dry but I haven&#x27;t tried using it with shaving cream yet but this is in my near future. Overall this is a nice shaver with good features for your buck!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good quality electric razor for quite some time. I&#x27;ve bought the basic drugstore $25-$40 type electric razors, none of which were good. They all tire my face up. I did a lot of research and decided to give this Panasonic a try. I&#x27;m glad I did!! This razor offers an amazingly close shave without chafing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any good electric razor make sure that you get a good cleaner/lubricant. I went with the Remington Shaver Saver. It&#x27;s a cleaner &amp; lubricant all in one. It will keep your blades razor sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin so I also purchased the Remington Face Saver stick. You just apply it prior to shaving. It does a fantastic job of protecting the skin while shaving.</li>
            <li> As a former blade only shaver (using several different single and multiple blade razors over the last 20+ years), and after developing a serious skin sensitivity, I decided to try the Panasonic ES-LT41-K Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DKKBRY/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title). At first, the shave was a little rough (shaving dry), but then I tried another readers suggestion of just using normal liquid hand soap. That was when the magic happened :). I to this day have never had a shave this smooth. Normally, as I have sensitive skin, after blade shaving, I would experience a slightly &#x27;raw&#x27; feeling, and applying aftershave was an &#x27;experience&#x27; to put it lightly. With this shaver, even after the first shave, I haven&#x27;t experienced any sensitivity (keep in mind that I only &#x27;wet&#x27; shave) at all. Cleaning the razor is amazingly easy too; as you can simply remove the foil, add soap directly to the blades, and clean the shaver in seconds, using the built in &#x27;sonic vibration cleaning mode&#x27;, which ups the CPM (cycles per minute) from 13,000 to 17,000, and will literally vibrate any debris free from the blades. The convenience is you can do this while in the shower, as the entire shaver is waterproof. Charging is also amazing, as the shaver can be recharged in under an hour, and that charge will last through the entire week. Another feature I love is the travel lock on the power button. This prevents the shaver from coming on unintentionally while packed away in a bag, if the power button in accidentally depressed. The case it comes with is a nice fabric pouch, that keeps in easily protected (though I still pack it in a shoe when traveling). Panasonic recommends giving your face 30 days to adjust to the shaver; but as a &#x27;typical guy&#x27; with sensitive skin; I was sold from day one. I cannot recommend this higher. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Wow, I really like this shaver.  This is the best shaver that I have ever owned.  Now I wish that I had not struggled so long trying to get a good shave with my Phillips Norelco rotary blade shaver.  It evens gives me, with some usual effort, a close shave on my neck.  It is SO MUCH easier to clean than my rotary shaver.  I recommend this shaver to anyone.</li>
            <li> Good product!  Having used a rotary for years wanted to try a foil.  Definitely doesn&#x27;t snag at all when shaving.  You do have to do a few more revolutions to get a close shave.  The trimmer is excellent it helps in spots that you want a little closer.  Noise wise it may be a little loud, but not irritating.  For this price great deal!!!</li>
            <li> I broke the pop-up trimmer on the first one while changing the battery :(. Second one&#x27;s battery not holding charge and couldn&#x27;t be replaced. This is my 3rd one and I expect it to last forever if I can change the battery. This one has 3 blades, spins at high RPMs and shows the charge level in decrements of 10,shavers with the same spec 10 years ago would cost 2-3 times more. Love how all tech related products are getting better and cheaper!</li>
            <li> I purchased the ES-LT41 to replace an old Braun that broke and a Remington that I used once before returning. I returned the Remington because it was too noisy. I could not imagine having to listen to it every morning...the volume was jarring. The panasonic, while not quiet, is much lower volume. Furthermore, the shave is great!  Much better than my old Braun was even when the Braun was new.  Very good trimmer as well.  I am very happy with this shaver. My only complaint is that it does not work when plugged in which is why I give it only 4 stars.  You need to charge it before using it but there is a charge indicator that lets you know when you are close to having to recharge.  In summary I am very happy with this shaver.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the performance of razor. Not a super close shave but close enough.I like the cleaning feature a lot.</li>
            <li> This razor might be the best value in this line of razors.  I have the ARC5 already. This cuts almost as well. It is not as loud. It is more manageable due to its smaller size. The price is about 1/3rd of the ARC5. It&#x27;s a no-brainer unless you have money to burn. This is a good quality razor at a very good price. It cuts like a beast. The lock works great. The trimmer is top of the line for a razor trimmer. This is a 5 star product.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t like electric shavers because they nick up my legs...(no, I&#x27;m not a man) - but with this foil razor, the blades are covered so my skin isn&#x27;t directly exposed to the blades.  I do like this one because it can be used wet or dry.  You will never get the same close shave with an electric as you so with a blade, but you also won&#x27;t get razor burn, which is a fair trade for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it a \\&quot;B\\&quot; because it is really loud.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Panasonic shavers for over ten years.  Before I got hooked on Panasonic, I tried the [[ASIN:B003V37ZDS Philips Norelco 1250x/40 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver, Black]] shavers but they didn&#x27;t work well on my face, even after many weeks of use.  I moved to the three-blade Panasonic ES8043SC system which was a great shaver for the price and lasted five years.  When I wanted to upgrade a few years ago, I purchased the [[ASIN:B002N5MHLU Panasonic ES-LA63-S Men&#x27;s 4-Blade (Arc 4) Multi-Flex Dual-Motor Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Silver]] which is absolutely the best shaving system that I&#x27;ve used.  I had an opportunity to test this Panasonic ES-LT41-K, and while it doesn&#x27;t compare to the Panasonic ES-LA63-S, it easily beats both the Philips Norelco and Panasonic ES8043SC in performance.  The Panasonic ES-LT41-K has some notable features - excellent blades that provide for a close shave, a side trimmer, and an easy-to-read battery status LED display.  In general, I&#x27;d suggest spending a little more for the ES-LA63-S, which provides more closeness, and faster shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ES-LT41-K Product Strengths:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Rock solid build, quality, design, and performance&lt;br /&gt;- Quick charging (0% to 100% in 30 minutes)&lt;br /&gt;- Long battery life (4-5 weeks for me)&lt;br /&gt;- High quality LED display&lt;br /&gt;- Excellent contour - easy to hold in your hand&lt;br /&gt;- Close shave - but not as close as the more expensive ES-LA63-S&lt;br /&gt;- Retains hair shavings between shaves (some shavers are very bad at this)&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;- Cheap replacement blades ([[ASIN:B001159UMM Panasonic WES9068PC Inner Blade Replacement for ES8109S and ES8101S]])&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ES-LT41-K Product Weaknesses:&lt;br /&gt;- There are none.  The only downside to this shaver is that is takes longer to shave than the 4-blade Panasonic ES-LA63-S.  This isn&#x27;t necessarily an \\&quot;apples to apples\\&quot; comparison because the ES-LA63-S is 50% more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this shaver fits your budget, it&#x27;s an exceptional device that&#x27;ll give you a close and comfortable shave for many years.  But if you can spend a little more, try the ES-LA63-S - It&#x27;ll cut down shaving time by 30%-50%.</li>
            <li> This shaver works great for me. For the past few years, I&#x27;ve been shaving with a disposable in the shower. I have pretty sensitive skin, and figured all that hot water would help soften my beard and make the whole process easier, although I was still getting some redness and irritation afterwards. When I got this wet/dry shaver, I used it in the shower the first few times, and it worked very well, but then I decided to try it dry. For me, it was an eye-opener, because I was actually able to shave more quickly, and without any irritation. I&#x27;ve been using it dry ever since, a little over a month now. I feel like it has \\&quot;liberated\\&quot; me from shower shaving; now I can just grab it and get a quick shave anytime I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver has a very \\&quot;cool\\&quot; look, but more importantly, it has some nice features. It only takes one hour to fully charge the battery, and though I haven&#x27;t tested this myself, the instructions say a full charge will give you up to 45 minutes (approximately 2 weeks) of cordless shaving. A 5-minute quick charge &#x3D; 1 shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a flexible, pivoting head, with a switch to select either \\&quot;locked\\&quot; or \\&quot;soft\\&quot; (\\&quot;soft\\&quot; allows it to pivot, which is how I always use it). There is also a lock ring on the front of the razor to lock the power switch while carrying/storing the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a pop-up trimmer. It also comes with a little velveteen bag to carry or store it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LCD panel on the front of the unit displays in a bright amber, which is nice (easy to read, even without my glasses). It shows the battery capacity and the charge status. It will also show a reminder when it&#x27;s time to use the sonic vibration cleaning mode. To do that, you apply some liquid hand soap and water to the outer foil (while it&#x27;s on the shaver), and press the power switch for more than 2 seconds, which activates the sonic cleaning mode (you hear a high-pitch sound as the blades vibrate super fast). It shuts itself off after 20 seconds, then youremove the foil section, activate the sonic mode once more while holding the blades under running water to rinse. It&#x27;s quick and easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I do have to go over my neck area a few extra times to get it perfectly smooth, and even then, I might notice later that it still missed a whisker here and there, especially if I haven&#x27;t shaved in a couple of days. But that was the case too when I was using a disposable in the shower, and even more so, actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;m through shaving, I remove the foil head and rinse it and the blades under running water. Again, quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention that there is no stand or cradle to put the shaver in while it&#x27;s charging; you plug one end of the cord into the base of the shaver, and the other end -- a piece measuring about 2\\&quot; x 2\\&quot; x 1\\&quot; thick -- plugs into an outlet. A stand or cradle might have been nice, but this configuration hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as an aside, another reviewer mentioned that he tried to use this shaver with shaving foam, and it just created a mess. If this is true for you, you might consider trying the Alba Botanica Moisturizing Foam Shave. [[ASIN:B000IM5AX2 Moisturizing Foam Shave Sea Mist - 5 - Fluid Oz.]] The reason I think this might work better, is because, despite the name, it&#x27;s not actually a \\&quot;foam\\&quot; like the conventional ones in cans. It comes out of the dispenser as a light foam, but virtually disappears when applied to the face. However, it seems to have an oil base that really allows the razor/shaver to glide smoothly. If you&#x27;ve ever used the Shaving Oil drops like they sell at the drugstore or supermarket, it&#x27;s akin to those. It&#x27;s just a very slight foam that provides good lubrication. It&#x27;s what I used with disposable razors to shave in the shower, and it did work well with this shaver the few times I used it in the shower. Just thought I&#x27;d mention that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this shaver, and happy that it freed me from myshower-shaving habit!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve apparently become a fan of Panasonic razors.  For years I went through multiple razors from different companies - Norelco, Braun, etc. - before finding Panasonic, a razor brand I&#x27;d seen but passed over because, well, they&#x27;re the company that makes radios, not razors, right?  How wrong I was.  These guys know their stuff.  I have had three different Panasonics for review now and each has turned out to be a joy, this one because of it&#x27;s more thrifty price while maintaining the same shave quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with my beard is that it is both very thick and it grows every which way.  Razors in the past have caused all kinds of problems - razor burn, in-grown hair, etc.  That all went away with the Panasonic razors that allowed me to take them in the shower and use them with shaving cream (I know, this sounds counter-intuitive, but trust me, it works wonders.)  The only problem has been price - unless Amazon dropped the price on these razors, they were usually way, way out of the range of the possible for most people, but luckily this razor is more sensibly priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some downsides, however.  The shave is not quite as close as the larger, more expensive [[ASIN:B002N5MHLU Panasonic ES-LA63-S Men&#x27;s 4-Blade (Arc 4) Multi-Flex Dual-Motor Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Silver]] that I&#x27;ve been using for several years now, but that razor was also three times the price of this one when it came out and is only now a reasonable price.  I find that the shave feels immediately the same - incredibly close, basically like using one of the better (multi-blade) disposable razors but doesn&#x27;t last as long.  You also give up the timer the more expensive razors offer on their display.  A small loss there - it was nice to know how long I&#x27;d spent shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, being a bit smaller (it has one less inner blade and is, I believe narrower than the LA63) it feels more maneuverable on my face.  It seems much easier to be able to get into the odd nooks of my neck/jawline that caused problems before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s enough of a difference between this model and the more expensive ones to justify their sometimes outrageous prices.  There are times when Amazon offers those at prices that beat the current, as of this writing new price, and then they are no-brainers, but I wouldn&#x27;t spend more than this on a razor knowing how good this one is.able to get into the odd nooks of my neck/jawline that caused problems before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s enough of a difference between this model and the more expensive ones to justify their sometimes outrageous prices.  There are times when Amazon offers those at prices that beat the current, as of this writing new price, and then they are no-brainers, but I wouldn&#x27;t spend more than this on a razor knowing how good this one is.</li>
            <li> Pros: This razor charges quick!  It takes less than an hour to complete. The shave head has a good size to it that allows for a quicker shave and comes with your standard head lock feature.  For the frequent traveler there is a way to lock the on/off switch so that while it is stored it won&#x27;t accidentally turn on. The pop up trimmer mechanism works great and I find that feature a must in a shaver whereas some of the other razors on the market no longer offer the pop-up feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I have given the razor two weeks to allow an adjustment of my skin to the new blades, but alas it seems as if the head is consistently producing irritation on my skin. The razor does not feel good on the skin and seems to pull hairs if you move the head too quickly. I did not have this issue with my ES8086. I think the issue is that the center of 3 cutting heads on the LT41 has been made wider than it was on the ES8086. Both razors utilize a 3 cutting head design which puts two foils with round holes on either side of one row of the head down the center with a series of linear slots instead of holes. By making the center cutting head wider, the razor rubs the skin the wrong way and causes enough skin irritation on my neck to where this razor will not see daily service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I have used several Panasonic razors over the years, but I&#x27;m not convinced about the foil razors versus the three circular head design. Both Panasonics before this one performed flawlessly and lasted several years so I believe in the Panasonic brand.  I simply cannot get over the fact that my neck will not adjust to the new razor and the irritation has persisted for several weeks.  For me I&#x27;m going back to old reliable (the ES8086)</li>
            <li> For this and all Panasonic shavers I&#x27;ve tried I like the quality of the shave, the comfort, the durability, and the ability to wet or dry shave. (I&#x27;ve settled on Panasonic as my favored brand over Braun and Norelco long ago). I currently also have a more expensive Panasonic ES8228S which I&#x27;ve had for 2-3years and will make direct comparisons to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both have the same basic shape and ergonomics - excellent in my opinion. However, this one feels noticeably lighter and has a more secure/textured surface to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both have the same 13,000 cpms and similar sound so I&#x27;m assuming they share the same motor. Again, this is good. The motor is strong, not too loud, and dependable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ES-LT41 only has a basic charging cord and not the cleaning system / charging stand of the ES8228S and other more expensive Panasonic models. Both units hold a charge for a long time so it&#x27;s not too inconvenient to plug it in once a week or so. As for the cleaning stand, I use mine mostly for charging and rarely for cleaning because simply cleaning the razor with soap and water is faster, cheaper, quieter, and just as good (though less \\&quot;automatic\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think both use the same double cutter but different shaving heads. The head on the ES8228S is more complex with more moving parts but the cheaper ES-LT41 provides a better shave over all. I don&#x27;t know why but it catches some of the strangely angled neck hairs that are often missed with my ES8228S model. It may be that I need a new head and razor for it but I do replace them and don&#x27;t recall that razor ever having such an easy time with the most difficult neck hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a 5 star razor that also makes a great travel companion: It&#x27;s light, durable, holds a charge a long time, has a form fitting carrying case, has a \\&quot;lock\\&quot;  button to prevent the razor from turning on while in your luggage, and provides a great shave - wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Am 56 and have used Norelco since I started shaving.  I don&#x27;t have the latest Norelco technology but my razor is a fairly new model.  Got tired of the problems in shaving my neck - was actually shaving that area with a blade to get it close.  Decided to do some research, check reviews and such to see if I could get better results with an electric.  Saw all the positive reviews on this Panasonic and gave it a shot.  As soon as it arrived I tackled a 3-day growth without any pre-electric shave.  Even dry with a bit of beard the shaver was GREAT!  Did not irritate my skin (even dry) and did the trick on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutley a great shave on all counts.  And for the price it is a much better deal than the Braun foil shavers.  Can&#x27;t wait to try it on a wet shave - if it was that good dry....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellect product!</li>
            <li> Bought it after wading through reviews on Amazon for this and other razor options.  Took me a few times to get used to after using a revolving head type of razor but I like it and find it to do a very good job.  Not as close as a razor blade, not even when used in shower with shaving gel, but still at top of game for expectations or an electric razor.  Also like ability to wash out in sink or shower.  Liked it enough to buy a second one for father in law when his died.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about Panasonic products...owned just about every consumer product they have made. Power tools are top notch, pricey but worth every penny. This razor is no exception. Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver.  Very good design.  Like the indicator showing how much battery life is left.  Good pop-out sideburn trimmer.  Good handle.  Shaves very closed but not irritating at all.  It takes me a little longer to shave than my prior shaver, but the result is a much better shave.  Takes a little while to get used to moving the razor a little slower, but once used to it, it&#x27;s terrific.</li>
            <li> My husband has used Philips Norelco shaver for more than 10 years. I decided to present new one to him. First time, I thought another Norelco. But recently I bought a Panasonic hair clipper and it was really good.&lt;br /&gt;Then I decided to buy Panasonic ES-LT41-K.&lt;br /&gt;My husband thanks to me for this choice. He said it really works well.&lt;br /&gt;Shave quick, easy and evenly. The price was good to me too.&lt;br /&gt;Engine was strong and calm.  After shaving he feels very soft feeling on his chin and cheek.&lt;br /&gt;The price was good to me too.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to recommend this to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> Not the best shaver I ever used but not the worst either.  I find that you have to go over areas a few times to get the desired close shave but easy to clean and quick charging time...</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;m a woman, so this may be a fantastic product for men.  I bought it as a bikini shaver based on a glowing review from another woman.  It&#x27;s horrible.  It doesn&#x27;t shave anything.  I had to use the beard trimmer (haha), which pulled.  I tried the razor itself on my legs.  It took forever and it still didn&#x27;t shave all the hair off.  $95 mistake.  Hoping my husband can use it, since he doesn&#x27;t need a close shave.</li>
            <li> It is very good for shaving.</li>
            <li> I shopped the many shaving offerings from Panasonic and others.  The feaures in the ES-LT41-K fit my intended usage.  I was favorably surprised when I used the shaver that gave me the best shave from an electric razor.  I have had 3 shavers over the years and this is the best one.</li>
            <li> i bought this shaver to replace my old panasonic ,which did a great job, but the battery was to the point it did not hold a charge very long. i also tried something new. being in a hurry, i noticed the picture that showed putting a dab of what i thot was shave gel on the blade. ( if you read the instructions you will know different ). so i wet my face with water , and put a dab of shave gel on the blades and wow!  it is a lot less messy than how i used to shave, and i am really supprised at how well the shaver shaved.  maybe i found the new hot set up?  is a great shaver.</li>
            <li> The razor has some nice features and ergonomics, but for the price I expected a better shave.  I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for 35 years,  You can get a pretty close shave with this product, but besides stretching your skin, not pressing too hard, and shaving in multiple directions--I still find I have to spend the time to go over the same areas more times than I should have to to get a satisfactory shave.</li>
            <li> I have been happy with the purchase..The unit was delivered quickly and the price was great.  Cuts well.  I do not have a heavy beard but it is smooth and a  nice change to a razor.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product and I am shocked as all previous razors have been much more expensive.  He likes it because it works really fast and his skin is nice and smooth when done</li>
            <li> Shaves closer than my old Braun 5770 and is much quieter too. I guess that could have something to do with my Braun being 10+ years old haha. I really like the LED battery display so I know the percentage of power left (increments of 10%). It charges quickly and battery life is excellent. I wish the shaver came with a hard shell case and a cleaning brush like my old shaver did. The drawstring bag it came with doesn&#x27;t offer the same protection when I put it in my duffel bag. Other than that, I&#x27;m very satisfied and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been a 30 user of Norelco products but this is equivalent if not better.  I like the different feel and motions.  The battery power gauge is great.</li>
            <li> If there was something less than a one star ... I would do that.&lt;br /&gt;This happened to be the third and worse shaver ever. My first shaver from HITACHI was phenomenal. Norelco Philips was average.&lt;br /&gt;It misses a lot of hair, pathetic performance with shaving cream. The trimmer is useless and pulls the hair and hurts every time. It missed hair so much and I repeated the shaving so many times that I literally bled.&lt;br /&gt;After returning this shaver I bought BRAUN of same price category 70 dollars. Amazing experience. It gives me such a close and smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;I highly warn you not to waste your time and money on this shaver. Go BRAUN .... Germans are good at making machines.</li>
            <li> Works way better than I thought it would, very happy.</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected.Great packaging.Charged up fast...So far shaved dry and wet.Easy to take apart to clean.&lt;br /&gt;This is my first Electric shaver and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I have been using Panasonic shavers for 20 years in the shower with dove bar soap for the shave cream. This is the best one so far, much better shaving the neck area and cutting a two day old growth.</li>
            <li> a little bit noisebut powerful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been much of an electric razor fan because I&#x27;ve always felt that they didn&#x27;t provide the level of shave that I need/want.  However, I broke down and gave this one a try after reading some of the reviews and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  The shaving head has the option for you to lock it in place or let it follow the contours of your face and the ability to do both really provides a good, clean shave.  The battery life is excellent as electric razors go and I&#x27;m a huge fan of the wet/dry capabilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best pieces of advice I can offer is one that I read after digging through all of the reviews on this site and that is to give this 30 days.  I just passed my 30 days and I use this razor just about every day of the week.  If I have a few days growth then I will use a regular razor and switch to this for the rest of the week, but as long as you don&#x27;t let your beard go for more than a few days (or even a day for some of you lumberjacks) you should be good.</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver. I haven&#x27;t tried it wet, but I will. I&#x27;m not used to using an electric shaver wet. I&#x27;ve been using after the shower. I use it with Lectric Shave abd the works really good.</li>
            <li> This shaver is perfect for me.  Great to actually enjoy shaving a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Only one thing I&#x27;d like:  To be able to shave while plugged into the charger.</li>
            <li> i like this razor cause it is does its job quickly, i shave with in 5-10 minutes. other shaver take for ever to get the hard angles.</li>
            <li> Works great. Close comfortable shave. Excellent grip. Trimmer is well-designed, too. And it&#x27;s nice to know when the battery is getting low - especially with the nifty e-meter! Worth the extra twenty or so bucks over the cheaper model/competition.</li>
            <li> I have owned a number of electric razors over the years including the [[ASIN:B004UQ6Q62 Braun 3Series 340S-4 Wet &amp; Dry Shaver]], [[ASIN:B001AJ6YS2 Philips Norelco 7310 Men&#x27;s Shaving System]], and [[ASIN:B001DNE3KQ Panasonic ES8103S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Silver]], and now the the ES-LT41.  I always ended up preferring the razors that were in the sub- $75 range actual cost (not retail price), just like this one. This particular razor was actually confiscated by my daughter for her use (legs and arm pits) she loved it so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic razors typically come out on top when considering price point and quality.  In this case, the 13k cycle per minute cutting rate combined with the blade system, ergonomics, and price point will likely place this in the sweet spot for most users. This particular razor can be used wet or dry, which is an important point because wet shaves, in my opinion, yield better results (and makes it even more usable for women).  The [[ASIN:B005DKKBRY Panasonic ES-LT41-K Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Black/Silver]] does not come with a cleaning system or charging stand; hence the reason for lower price when compared to products like the [[ASIN:B00176V2SK Panasonic ES8228S Men&#x27;s Linear Vortex Nano Arc Foil Shaving System, Silver]].  In my opinion, the charging stand is not necessary and the cleaning system is a throwback to a bygone error because newer products are easily cleaned compared to the older systems.  The battery will fully charge in 70 minutes (at least that was my measured rate) and retain the charge for weeks.  As with these types of batteries, let the battery run completely down before charging the first few times.  This will condition the battery and extend its like significantly. The LCD is simply fabulous and easy to read.  It primarily shows the battery and cleaning status.  The sonic cleaning system is simple to use (just some liquid soap and water on the foil)by pressing and holding power button until it initiates for 20 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for experience while shaving, keep in mind that personal preferences vary greatly.  I have friends who swear by rotary heads as opposed the foil types (this type).  Also, this shaver has 3 blades compared to other razors and those with significant bear growth typically prefer 4 blade systems that I personally find too large.  Another point with foil versus rotary head razors is irritation, which I infrequently experience but some friends experience at a far greater rate.  Also, for anyone looking to get as close of a shave as with products like the [[ASIN:B000BUUVTE Gillette Fusion Manual Razor]], simply forget it despite what other may say.  I have never experienced as close of a shave.  For many, that may take some getting used to.  In my neck area for example, I often have to make repeat passes at various angles (my hair will often grow in at weird angles). So, if you are really looking for a close shave, I suggest trying something along the lines of [[ASIN:B0046GHZFW The Art of Shaving Fusion Chrome Collection - Proglide Power Set 6 piece]]. Finally, if you are someone who lets your beard grow out at length before shaving, this razor, and most electric razors are not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this razor 5 stars based on its design, quality, usefulness, and price point at the sub-$75 range.  Advertised prices for this product will change and you will often see a $20 fluctuation.e (just some liquid soap and water on the foil)by pressing and holding power button until it initiates for 20 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for experience while shaving, keep in mind that personal preferences vary greatly.

            <li> it works for me couple of days 1st night face feels little flushed but not bad I&#x27;ve taken it 1hr before and 4hrs before</li>
            <li> I got this shaver to replace my 15 yo Braun electric shaver, which still worked, but got a little old.( just to clarify, i am a woman and got this to shave parts of my body that are too sensitive for razor). The shave is great, i only use it dry, but love that i can run it under water for cleaning afterwards. The only thing i did not like was the shape of it, thinner handle. I will assume, however, that it would be perfect for face shaving, as that is the way it was intended. I just hold it differently. And after using it for couple of months i am used to it</li>
            <li> After over 10 yrs of faithfull service my remington electric gave out. This panasonic is everything that is promised and i am very pleased. Great value.</li>
            <li> I have owned several Panasonic razors over the years and this is the best. It shaves close, is quiet and I love the digital readout of the  amount of charge left.    UPDATE: I have had this shaver for over a year and still believe it is the best. I shave not only my beard &amp; mustache area, but also my entire head so it appears bald. One thing that I didn&#x27;t mention before is that the shaver notifies you via icons when it needs a charge and also when it needs a cleaning (washing).</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard and have sported a goatee for more than 20 years which requires a good trimmer to maintain.  I have always shaved with electric razors, and for the past 3 years I&#x27;ve been shaving with a Braun Series 7 razor with the self-cleaning/charging dock.  The Braun that I used is nice but does not offer a wet-shave mode and is not easy to keep clean when traveling unless you pack (and check) the cleaning dock &amp; cleaning solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic ES-LT41 has proved to shave as close and comfortable as the Braun.  It is also very easy to maintain, cleaning does not require $6 solutions or a cleaning station, I simply remove and rinse the head and cutting blades under the faucet making the Panasonic much more convenient to travel with.  The battery life performs as advertised requiring the razor to be charged once a week, I have not had to depend on the quick charge feature yet so I can&#x27;t comment on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like to shave on the weekends so by Monday morning I have a very heavy beard, it&#x27;s hard to tell where my goatee ends.  Many electric razors are not as comfortable shaving longer whiskers, they tend to pull them out rather than cutting them off.  The Panasonic has performed very well in this situation, in fact it is as comfortable as the Braun and gets the job done in less time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is very effective and makes trimming the edges of my goatee a neat and simple task, my only complaint is that the trimmer is on the back side of the razor so it&#x27;s not as easy for me to flip it open as the Braun&#x27;s trimmer which is mounted on the \\&quot;thumb\\&quot; side of the razor.  I know this is a really minor complaint and certainly will not prevent me from giving this razor high marks (5-stars).</li>
            <li> Good use of an electric razor!It is suitable as a gift。&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is the battery life a bit short!</li>
            <li> easy to use and clean, affordable, but more noisy than philips</li>
            <li> I got this to replace a panasonic pulsonic shaver, which is a higher end device.  This shaver seems lighter and less well made, however it does work well.  Its easy to clean and its wet/dry which is nice. It gives a good shave and I like the LED readout for the battery life.  Overall I think it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> just what my son wanted  gives a great close shave... can&#x27;t wait to shave tomorrow morning!  my old razor is shot...came at the right time for sure...</li>
            <li> close shave, simple  to clean, priced right all amounts to a good value.&lt;br /&gt;You can not shave with the power cord plugged in, not much trouble because the battery can last a long time. Recharging is very fast...impressed</li>
            <li> I am comparing this product with the previous model Panasonic ES8109 ([[ASIN:B003H9HPAO New - PANASONIC MENS SHAVER - ES8109S]]) that I bought 3 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic ES-LT41:&lt;br /&gt;(1) a bit heavier&lt;br /&gt;(2) quieter (maybe because it is brand new)&lt;br /&gt;(3) has lock mechanism&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both products are very much alike. But when I examine it more closely, they are the same products with different skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic is a brand I trust. The shaver lasts longer than I thought. I give it 4 stars because of the lock mechanism.</li>
            <li> After going through many electric razors in the $30 to $100 range, I have now found a new favorite, and it&#x27;s not even a rotary!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Panasonic gives me the closest shave I&#x27;ve experienced, around ALL areas of the face and neck, and with no burn, snags, or other problems. It&#x27;s loaded with USEFUL featuresm including a percent power remaining indicator, a pop-up trimmer that actually works, a lock,&lt;br /&gt;a razor head that detaches for EASY cleaning and re-attaches firmly and easily, and extremely quick recharging (I went from 0 to full power in less than one hour).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I previously liked the [[ASIN:B003V360NY Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver, Metallic Blue]], it also works smoothly and efficiently, but there&#x27;s no question that the Panasonic gives a closer shave, and includes much better features.  The Phillips has a pop-up trimmer, but it&#x27;s not part of the shaver, you have to store it until ready for use.  Besides the closer shave (the sine non quo of shaving), the Panasonic is much easier to clean, and is moreforgiving of user error (I accidently broke the head of the Philips when trying to clean it for the first time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE complaint.  This is one LOUD shaver.  Not motorcyle or electric mower loud, but I suppose all that power comes at a price.  If you shave in the same room with someone who&#x27;s trying to sleep or read or otherwise concentrate, they will NOT share your enthusiasm for this shaver.  I close the bathroom door or shave while driving (I know, EWWWWW....), and I don&#x27;t consider it a \\&quot;deal-breaker,\\&quot; but you should know there is a trade-off.  At least it&#x27;s not a broken-shaver sound with rattling and the sound of loose parts, just a loud BUZZ. To me, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I dry shave early in the morning before heading out and this shaver performs the job admirably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downsides to this shaver are:&lt;br /&gt;1) One does have to closely monitor the battery level to avoid being caught without charge - corded shaving isn&#x27;t an option.&lt;br /&gt;2) This shaver is LOUD! Maybe I have sensitive hearing but I&#x27;ve taken to wearing earplugs while using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: minor nuisance aside about the noise it generates I can&#x27;t complain about its results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I wanted ... I thought I was buying an electric razor that would trim a beard too ... Not appropriate.</li>
            <li> My son has 4 young ones running around as he shaves in the morning.  I was tired of seeing the tissues with blood over his face as the kiddies ran in and out of the bathroom as he shaved.  He is thrilled with this gift and his handsome face has no more cuts!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to the ease at which this razor cut my tough bristles.  This instrument is light and handles my shaving needs in and out of the shower.  It is also very easy to clean after every shave and the battery is good for 10 to 12 sessions before it actually tells you to insert the charger.  I would recommend this product to every man who shaves at least twice a day like myself.  The inner blades are so sharp, you do not have to put any pressure on the skin of your face, which makes the shaving experience all the more satisfactory!  Panasonic has put up a great affordable product in this competitive market.</li>
            <li> Good quality shaver and good performance.....especially when used with shaving cream and hot water.  Holds a charge for a long time and recharges quickly.  Good hand-held fit design.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Ain&#x27;t Nuthin to complain about.  I charged it up fully for the first time, tried to run it all the way down (part of the battery memory prevention)-- I couldn&#x27;t!!  It worked about 25 times before it eventually drained.  I&#x27;ve used it dry, wet, in shower etc.  Very close shave.  Recommend aftershave if used dry--- burns a little.  But no, it&#x27;s excellent, should&#x27;ve bought it earlier.  Now let&#x27;s see how long it will last, only time will tell.</li>
            <li> I had no idea that shavers had evolved to such a high degree of excellence.  It makes my old shaver look like it came of the cave man past.  Fast to charge,  holds a charge for many shaves, cuts with fewer passes, waterproof, quiet.  Whats not to like.</li>
            <li> I tend to have a rough, fast growing beard. I could actually stand to shave twice a day. I started using a Remington rotary a number of years ago that included a charging/cleaning stand and got hooked on the automatic cleaner. While the shaver did OK (replaced once under warranty) I had to replace failed cleaning/charging stands nearly every year along with filters and bottles of cleaner. It started getting rather expensive! I switched to a Braun 3 Series, highly recommended by a large consumer test organization, hoping the system would hold together better. The shaver and charging/cleaning stand held together pretty well (again, one shaver replacement under warranty) but it typically took over 5 minutes to get a clean shave! I would have to hit my beard from EVERY angle, up, down, left, right, diagonal one way, diagonal the other way, back and forth. Again, purchasing the cleaning cartridges, which need to be changed about once a month, also became pretty expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I would give this Panasonic a try, hoping the Wet/Dry feature might make it easier to manually clean than a conventional model. The unit seems to run at a much higher speed than my previous shavers. This makes it much quieter, more of a hum than growl. Good deal if you are an early riser like me. I have had it two months and it still cuts smooth as silk and doesn&#x27;t require the back-and-forth effort my former shavers have required. The closeness of the shave was immediately noticeable compared to my former shavers, even with their replacement blades, and there was no irritation, even during the \\&quot;face break-in\\&quot; period. My former shavers would charge every time I put them in their cleaning stand. The Panasonic has a charger that plugs in, not quite as convenient, but a single charge gets me through 10 days to 2 weeks. Cleaning is also very easy. The display on the unit will indicate when a cleaning is needed, about once every week to 10 days. The unit has a special high speed mode thatis supposed to make it easier to clean under the faucet. I have found it much easier to just take a shaver brush (which really should be included) sweep the dry whiskers out of the blades and top foil, then give it a quick rinse under water. 90 seconds tops and no $6 cleaning cartridges! I am writing this review as I order another one of these shavers for my son. Again, he is tired of buying the cleaning cartridges and, after trying mine, wants one too!</li>
            <li> It just did not work for me, tried it both wet and dry.  I couldn&#x27;t get anything from my neck to shave, the only thing it could shave is the joke I can grow for a mustache..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I have a nice paperweight now..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had my new shaver a couple of weeks but I am impressed. Smooth, comfortable, and fast shave. I like the info on the led read out. Shaving isn&#x27;t something to dread anymore. Fast, free shipping from Amazon plus the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> Great shaver replacing my old one. Shave is very close and price is better than I would have thought. I will always be buying Panasonic razors based on the last few I have had</li>
            <li> I got a fast, smooth, close shave. So far, the Li ion battery lasted two weeks plus. Good price also.</li>
            <li> My husband thanks me every time he shaves.  His beard is so tough he went through 2 disposable razors each shave.</li>
            <li> I have previously owned Phillips/Norelco shavers but this Panasonic delivers a much closer shave than my previous shavers. Easy to use and clean. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is my second Panasonic electric razor. The first one lasted 6 plus years and still works but has slowed down some so I have to work harder to get a clean shave. When I purchased the new one I was right back to a quick clean shave immediately. The Panasonic is superior to any other electric razor I&#x27;ve used over the years, which includes most major brands.</li>
            <li> It cuts very well, is flexible and easy to clean with water.  Quiet performance and holds the charge very nicely.</li>
            <li> This razor is amazingly quiet and also efficient. It is smaller than some other brands and that makes it even more desireable. I like the fact that it is easy to clean and gets a closer shave than other brands as well. I have always used another brand, but will stick with Panasonic from here on in.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor as a replacement for a [[ASIN:B0009DT342 Panasonic ES8043SC Pro-Curve Pivot Action Linear Wet/Dry Shaver, Silver]] that I have been using since 2008.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Panasonic Linear series foil razors since the mid-90s.  I switched from Norelco rotaries, because the Linear razors gave me a better cut than the rotaries.  I have very fine hair, and the Linear razors just seem to cut closer to the skin than the rotaries do.  That&#x27;s not to say that Linears were all that great either... I have always used electric shavers as a convenience issue, not for the quality of the shave.  They&#x27;re definitely not as good as a blade shave, but they&#x27;ve been \\&quot;good enough\\&quot; to allow me to dodge having to blade shave every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the ES-LT41-K is actually a huge improvement over the previous Linear series razors that I&#x27;ve used:&lt;br /&gt;* The shave from the ES-LT41-K is cleaner than previous Linear razors that I&#x27;ve owned (4 to date, I believe).  It&#x27;s seriously *almost* as good as a blade shave at this point, which is amazing to me, since previously I have never been able to get a truly close shave from an electric.&lt;br /&gt;* The ES-LT41-K moves more smoothly over my face, thus creating less razor burn than previous Linear razors (rotaries didn&#x27;t create as much razor burn for me, but they didn&#x27;t shave me as well, either).&lt;br /&gt;* The ES-LT41-K is about half as loud as my old ES8043SC, which made a very loud and annoying buzz (like, loud enough that when I was traveling I used to worry that I might be waking up people in adjacent rooms).  The ES-LT41-K produces a very moderate hum, much more acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update the review if I have any issues with the durability of it, but my initial impression is that this is a biggest improvement I&#x27;ve had in shaving since I originally switched from rotaries to foil razors.</li>
            <li> I had been using a rotary shaver for many years. I purchased a foil type portable shaver (Braun) for travel and liked it. This Panasonic was low priced and well rated by buyers so I bought it. It&#x27;s a great machine and gives a better shave than my rotary shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Panasonic Wet/Dry razors for many years.  Just purchased this new one for the holiday.  It is a vast improvement in blade speed and is much quieter. It gives a wonderful smooth shave when using with shaving cream.  I have sensitive skin and have never had a problem shaving with this razor and the proper cream.  The new swivel head is very nice and the charge lasts for weeks.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the Panasonic ES-LT41-K and think it provides a good 3-4 minute shave. I found it to be a very good value.</li>
            <li> Does not shave as closely as the older models. It is okay but not great. I was disappointed in it. It does have a nice feature in the cut off switch in front of the shaver and I admit I have a tough set of whiskers.</li>
            <li> June 17th,2017 Update:  Well, I&#x27;m still using this razor and finally replaced the blades and foil.  Rumor has it that this is supposed to be done every 18 months, but I did not know that.  It still worked well before changing those items (very inexpensive and easy to change), but now that I&#x27;ve changed them, it&#x27;s like a brand spankin&#x27; new razor.  I still use this at least 4-5 times/wk.  Still holds a charge forever and hasn&#x27;t let me down.  This has been a great shaver, and I even added another star to make it 5.  Get it. You won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my mid 40&#x27;s and have never owned or used an electric razor.  Not sure why....I guess it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve always been satisfied using a blade. I&#x27;ve heard good and bad about electrics, pros and cons, etc.  I got a wild hair (no pun intended) up my you know what and decided that I think I want to try an electric.  After reading review after review after review of different brands, models, tri blade this, dual blade that, I was even more confused.  Did I need a rotary one or not?  Well, I pulled the trigger on this Panasonic and figured I&#x27;d use it for one full month to be able to really see if it was worth it or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pros: Very easy to use, very easy to clean, and holds a charge for a good while.  I&#x27;ve only had to charge it twice in the 30-day period while using it every single day.  Surprisingly to me it does a great job of shaving my face.  I noticed that I have to go over a spot a couple of times, and it seems to help if I tighten my skin a bit by blowing out my cheeks while shaving certain spots.  This is not a hindrance to me though.  No cuts, no pulled hairs (which is what I had always heard about electrics), and a really close shave.  It&#x27;s near blade quality I must say.  The neck is a little tricky, but the head of this razor conforms to the contours of my face.  My hair is a little coarse and this thing just does a great job.  I haven&#x27;t used my blade other than to do a little clean up on the neck at times.  This is also easy to clean as the manual says to run it under water after applying liquid soap.  Very, very easy to maintain. Overall, I am really glad that I made this purchase.  I doubt that I&#x27;ll use the blade again unless this razor quits working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cons: I really don&#x27;t have a true complaint about this razor.  I guess I have to drop it one star only because of having to go over an area more than once sometimes.  Also, since my hair is dark, I tend to get the five o&#x27;clock shadow at about 3 o&#x27;clock.  Not sure if this is truly due to the razor since I know my face doesn&#x27;t stay smooth all day after using a blade. I&#x27;m not sure that other electric razors would be much different.  After all, it&#x27;s NOT a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope its lifespan is many, many years, because I really do like this razor.  I wish I would&#x27;ve invested in one years ago as it makes shaving on the run a snap.  It&#x27;s compact enough to put it in a pocket for later use at work or on the way to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I have no other electric razor to compare this to for you, I can say for certain that I do not regret my purchase, and since I use this every day, I would recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and as far as body hair----it does ok on the chest.....I still prefer to use a blade for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review helps, especially since I do not write too many, but I was asked to rate this by Amazon.due to the razor since I know my face doesn&#x27;t stay smooth all day after using a blade. I&#x27;m not sure that other electric razors would be much different.  After all, it&#x27;s NOT a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope its lifespan is many, many years, because I really do like this razor.

            <li> It&#x27;s a fine razor, but I found it difficult to get a really close shave.  I missed the instructions to find out any more about this, but as of now I don&#x27;t get a regular razor close shave.  I&#x27;m also having trouble with cleaning it as the soap and water doesn&#x27;t seem to flush out the stuff that&#x27;s in there.</li>
            <li> The first thing that caught my eye was the price.  This is a great shaver for the price.  I had never tried a Panasonic shaver before.  When this one goes out, I will definitely buy another Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I think this was a waste of my money. I eventually went back to my Gillette shavers. It cant get a clean shave wet or dry...</li>
            <li> My husband had never been able to find a razor that didn&#x27;t give him razor burn. His rotary style razor was painful and made his face bleed; he tried disposable blades and shaving cream/foam and that left his face raw, too. He hated shaving because of what a pain it was. When he tried this shaver, it amazed him. He got a close, comfortable shave the first time, just using it dry. No more razor burn.</li>
            <li> Well our last Panasonic shaver died so this is the updated replacement.  This model is noticably lighter and more efficient than our old model.  It&#x27;s definitely the preferred shaver in our household (we have two).</li>
            <li> without getting technical (since i cant) i recommend this machine for the closeness of the shave, the ease it catches even long hair, the contour of the grip, the charge status (0%-100%) display, the quietness, the wet/dry ability and the general workmanship.&lt;br /&gt;FYI, i didn&#x27;t give it 5 star since nothing is perfect although i cant find anything wrong with this machine yet.</li>
            <li> I have been using ES-LT41-K now for about a month, exclusively in the dry mode.  It gives a very fine shave with one day and two day old beards, and is easy to keep clean without the bells and whistles of it&#x27;s much more expensive relatives.</li>
            <li> Quick close shave. Long lasting battery. Far superior to the remington it replaced. Watch out using the trimmer anywhere super sensitive, ie downstairs.</li>
            <li> I ordered for my husband.  He says it doesn&#x27;t shave very closely, compared to other electric razors he has had in the past.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this, especially as it is pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> This product is really awesome. I get a close shave and I like how easy it is to clean. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Great razor for me as I have shaking hands so by using this razor I I do not cut myself also use it wet and have been very happy with it and all its features battery lasts long and even when it runs down can be back at full charge  Very happy with it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Panasonic shavers for years because of the wet part of it; you clean them with soap and water, you can shave in the shower, etc. This replaced my Panasonic ES-SA40 single-head shaver bought 5 years ago (the single head is still better at shaving under the nose). This new Panasonic is a generation ahead of the older one. It operates at a much higher vibration rate and even has a supersonic cleaning speed that works very well under running water. This shaver is very fast at shaving and I have discovered that a circular motion is best (the single-head shavers don&#x27;t work as well with the circular motion). The trimmer is weird, it flips out perpendicular with the shaver which is less convenient than the ones that slide up parallel with the shaver...but that&#x27;s just me. Oh yes, the shaver charges up in about an hour. That&#x27;s great news.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my brother-in-law.  He was happy to get it as he is handicapped and needs a good electric razor for his very heavy beard.  It works great and is easy to use.  The only problem he has had is cleaning the blades, but once he understood it could be washed clean, he was happy.</li>
            <li> This is a well made and easy to clean razor. You can take the head off quickly and wash off the blades, it&#x27;s a fast cutter and shaves you quickly. I don&#x27;t think you can do any better than this.</li>
            <li> Have not tried electric razor in 30 years.  Wet or dry feature intrigued me.  Doesn&#x27;t shave as close as regular Mach 3 razor, but no cuts or abrasions.  Recharges very quickly.  Very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum: Have now used razor for 3 months.  Shaving every other day with lather and water.  Shave getting less and less close.  Tried no lather (just warm water) and no water - same disappointing result with some razor burn.  Lower rating; would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for his birthday. He always kept a shaver in his car the only thing with this is I had to buy a car adapter so he can keep it in his car, but he love the shaver.</li>
            <li> I have used a strait razor for years but this is amazing!!! Wet or dry it&#x27;s 1/2 the mess and pretty close to the same shave!</li>
            <li> I have been a Panasonic user for many years now and the last wet shaver I had gave me a good 6 years before the battery started acting up (had to only replace the blades once in the 6 years). This one is more basic with no cleaning unit but I hardly used it on the last one. It works well with both dry and with shaving gel/foam on. What I like it charges fast and is very easy to clean. The trimmer at the back can be extended and used as an effective hair trimmer. For the cost can’t complain. Hoping this time the battery last longer than six years.</li>
            <li> Extremely close, fast shave, minimal irritation.  I was already used to electric razors from my old, expensive Braun, which was of course a benefit, since switching to electric takes the skin a while to get used to.  However, this Panasonic gives a far better shave than the Braun ever did. The alternative was to replace the foil, battery etc in my old razor, which would have cost as much as this new one did.  I am very glad I opted for the new razor instead.</li>
            <li> Great until it stopped working. No idea what happened but this razer was great for a year until it simply wouldnt turn on.</li>
            <li> Shaves very close and much easier than the Norelco which cost twice as much and in 6 months thrown away.</li>
            <li> I used to be a Braun man since college back in the 80s.  But the last 3 8000 series Brauns I had were all junk--they would quit shaving well after a couple months, and replacing the screen and cutter didn&#x27;t make a difference, or they would just fall apart.  I miss the old, pre-P&amp;G Brauns and the old Victor Kiam Remingtons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;1) Shaves baby&#x27;s-bottom smooth in about half or 2/3 the time of the Braun.  Saves strokes, saves time, and saves your face.&lt;br /&gt;2) Your five o&#x27;clock shadow will be running several hours late.&lt;br /&gt;3) You don&#x27;t need powder sticks or Lectric Shave to get a good, comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;4) The comb cutter with the slots gets those pesky throat hairs, or makes a shaveless weekend easy shaving Monday morning.  Don&#x27;t buy the bottom-of-the-line Panasonic that is missing this feature.&lt;br /&gt;5) Doesn&#x27;t dribble beard trimmings all over your shirt or your sink.&lt;br /&gt;6) The lockable power button and secure shaver head cap make travel easy.&lt;br /&gt;7) Has good vibration protection--doesn&#x27;t wear out your hand.  Brauns used to be good with this, not so much lately.&lt;br /&gt;8) Charges FAST.  You can charge it enough for one shave in 10-15 minutes.  That&#x27;s good, because you can&#x27;t shave with it plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;9) Power stays strong all the way down to 10%.&lt;br /&gt;10) Battery is good for about a week&#x27;s worth of shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad (not significant):&lt;br /&gt;1) Yes, you can clean it with plain tap water.  But if you don&#x27;t use soap like the directions say, the shaver will smell of rotting hair the next time you use it.&lt;br /&gt;2) No cleaning brush, but you could use your old one.&lt;br /&gt;3) The free carrying case is the cheapest thing I have seen.  But, you probably don&#x27;t need it and you certainly don&#x27;t need a serious case to protect the shaver.</li>
            <li> I dont think this product is worth the money. It performs like any other shaver. Miss spots under the chin and on the neck. I just have to go over it repeatedly. I would expect this out of a cheaper razor.</li>
            <li> I got this for my son when he started to shave. We both have sensitive skin and this little guy works good with out the rash. I have been using Norelco for the past 40 years and this shaves closer, but it makes more noise.  it is a great price!!&lt;br /&gt;It has been about two years now and it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as it did when new, or a close as my old Norelco (but better than the new cheaper Norelco my wife got me). Perhaps a new head is in order...</li>
            <li> This is by far the best electric shaver that I have used after switching from an old-fashioned double edge safety razor a few years ago.&lt;br /&gt;None of this stuff compares to the clean shave, simplicity and economy of my safety razor, but alas, I must switch to electric.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver goes at least a week on one charge, shave quite close for an electric, washes up with soap and water and blows away much more expensive competition.</li>
            <li> Its a upper middle of the line razor. It doesn&#x27;t cut well. I suppose it will do for now. Given the choice if I were to go back in time I probably would have gotten a different one. The one thing I have to say is that it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I have owned the rotary style razors and was never impressed by them.  The last three razors I have purchased were Remington foil style and have always liked the shave.  These shavers are a lot louder than this Panasonic one.  I really like how well it does shave and is very comfortable to hold.  I also like the fact that the blades and foil have such a long life period between replacement.  I love this razor.  I would recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> It is very uncomfortable shaving my upper lip on the up stroke. Electric shave does not seem to help. It ends up taking way too long to shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son as a gift.  He had an electric razor before with 3 rotating heads and needed a new one.  He said pick out one you think I might like.  I like the description and reviews on this, so took a chance.  He loved it and is very happy with it.  Better than his older one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric razors since I could shave and this one doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  Very good razor.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had bought this one sooner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using rotary razors for years. This is my first foil razor. It provides a closer shave than rotaries by far, but I have to admit I have not been using high dollar rotaries. The wet/dry aspect is great. Although I do not use it in the shower, I can use shaving cream or electric pre-shave. Cleaning is much easier than the rotaries. Rotaries have to be disassembled completely (lots of small parts) to be thoroughly cleaned. The fast charging is impressive, and the battery holds a charge well. It&#x27;s a little bit louder (sounds like an angry bee) than the rotary, but it isn&#x27;t annoying at all. The trimming tool is better than the rotaries.</li>
            <li> I prefer electric shavers and have had my share of foil covered multi-head models. Most of the time I have owned Braun shavers, this is because my family is from Germany and they send them to me every year or so because the previous model has broken in some fashion. So far I have owned this Panasonic for almost 6 months. In that time I use it daily to trim my beard and mustache and shave the other parts of my face. It remains very sharp and I don&#x27;t see the need for changing the head yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+ Fast&lt;br /&gt;+ Efficient; I charge it once a week sometimes once every 2 weeks and it stays charged a very long time. (Anecdotal thing here: I left town for a month and left my shaver at home. When I got back the charge was 80% not bad).&lt;br /&gt;+ Cheap replacement parts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Tone of the shaver is not tuned as well as the Braun (no joke they tune the sound of the motor to be pleasing) who cares really, I guess some pedantic types might.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great razor for people like myself (mild beard). I cant speak to how well it performs on very heavy beards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading my review!</li>
            <li> Over the years I have had 3 Remingtons, but I was not real happy with the last one and when it went out I decided to try something else.  I am glad i did.  This Panasonic got great reviews and the price was good.  It cuts closer than my old Remington and nearly as close as a blade.  It holds a charge for a full two weeks.  One thing I especially appreciate is that it gets the longer hairs on my neck that my previous razor would miss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy this and hope it lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and wanted to replace my ageing Norelco Smooth Skin razor. This product not only irritates my skin but does not provide a close shave. I have been cut on my face by the middle part of the shaver head and have to go over my neck, cheek and chin area over and over again to get a smooth shave. Would not recommend this shaver to any one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with electrics since the days of the corded Norelco double-header. Then Victor Kiam pitched the Remington Microscreen and I bought one of those. It gave the best shave at the time but it was so loud it was like shaving with a chainsaw. After burning through 2 sets of replacement blades for the Microscreen I tried the Norelco triple-header. But I have a lot of contours on my face and rotary shavers just don&#x27;t seem to do well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then came a Braun which was quiet but took a long time to get all my whiskers off. So when that battery died and I saw that a replacement was almost as much as the razor, I switched to Panasonic. My first was the &amp;#34;Wet or Dry&amp;#34; model with the inductive charging base. It beat all comers at the time, and it shaved great. And I love that charging base. But eventually the built-in battery got weak and like the Braun a replacement battery was as much as a new razor. So I bought a Linear Motor wet/dry model (E077?). Once again, it was the best I had ever used. It has outlasted all others. But after two blade set replacements I decided to try THIS one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gives a fantastic shave and it&#x27;s quiet. In fact my wife can talk to me while I shave and I can hear every word. My last Linear motor model was just a shade noisy for that. And this one has really micro-close shaving heads. I gets my my beard right down to the skin with no burning or irritation. And it&#x27;s the fastest one I&#x27;ve used yet. It also gets my neck right under my chin line perfectly on one or two passes. That must be related to the arc head shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light weight worried me at first but this is a solidly-built device. I haven&#x27;t tried it wet yet but I can shave with a damp face and it works perfectly. And the battery meter is very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost bought the 4-head model for $50 more, but I&#x27;m glad I chose this one. For under $100, it can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> I bought this item and used it for one month then returned it. I don&#x27;t think this item will work on you if you are a skinny guy. I also bought Philips Norelco PT730/41 Shaver 3500 which gave even worse performance than this one.</li>
            <li> I purchased the razor as a gift.  The recipient uses it daily and loves it.  Great ;product, easy to use and easy to clean</li>
            <li> I have had the razor for 2 weeks now and so far I have not been impressed. I have heard it takes 2-3 weeks to adjust to each electric razor, but so far I am not a fan. The razor does a good job of cleaning up all hair above the chin line, but once you get below that, its like trying to shave a gorilla with a disposable razor. If I rub the razor 30 times across my chin and neck, the hair finally starts to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see a lot of people saying they still need to use a straight edge razor once they are done with this. Well, doesn&#x27;t that defeat the purpose of having this guy? If my beard is so thick that I need to pre-shave, I will just use a hair trimmer to make it manageable. I bought this item so that I didn&#x27;t have to shave with my Mach 3, as everyone said it provides a close shave. I would be cool with some shadow after I was done, but everything above my neck line is smooth, while my neck still has hairs significantly longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About ready to return this for not providing the close shave it promises.</li>
            <li> Great electric shaver.</li>
            <li> does a good job shaving. Stop missing the slightly longer hairs but overall pretty smooth shave.</li>
            <li> A good close shave. Better than my last Panasonic, which was very good at the time. Full 14 shaves on a charge.</li>
            <li> As most folks know faces and whiskers come in various types and not all electric razors work well for all faces. Over the years I have use several Norelco and an expensive Braun in an attempt to get a good close shave without razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Norelcos really burned my face - all three models I used for years. Even when using the wet model with the special gel it would burn and not cut close enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun was much better but it still burned in sensitive areas of my face. I was never able to get a close shave if I used it wet so I stuck with using it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this Panasonic dry even though it too can be used in the shower or wet. I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much after the Braun which has a pretty good reputation. Much to my surprise the Panasonic works much better for me. I specifically bought the LT-41 with the smaller head so that it might reach recesses in my chin without burning. It does a pretty good job and by far is the best electric shaver I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a very tough beard that dulls the cutting heads quickly. SO far after 6+ months use it&#x27;s still cutting close without pulling the whiskers. I also priced replacement cutting heads and they are cheaper than the Braun&#x27;s which I was replacing every 2-4 months and still not happy with the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic is smaller and lighter than the Norelcos and Braun. It fits my hand well and the battery charge lasts a week or so for me. The charger recharges the battery quickly in 1 hour and it&#x27;s reasonable sized for travel use. I&#x27;m surprised and pleased with the Panasonic. It&#x27;s performed far better than I expected. I would recommend it to others based on my experience.</li>
            <li> close comfortable shave wet or dry</li>
            <li> I bought the ES-LT41-K when an older Panasonic model finally began to wear out.  It does an okay job, but I can&#x27;t say it shaves any better than the older, less expensive model I used for 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I actually like the ultrasonic cleaning mode: it works quite well and was a feature my previous shaver didn&#x27;t have.&lt;br /&gt;It provides a decent shave (but not noticeably better than previous shaver)&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Large bulbous shaving head makes it somewhat difficult to get a close shave just under my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it works fine.  Just not thrilled.</li>
            <li> This think works great!  Now I can shave in half the time or less and with a better result.  Don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to buy this....duh.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with electric shavers for many years.  I have used products from a number of companies, including Panasonic.  However, this particular shaver is probably the best electric shaver I have had.  It gives a nice, smooth, comfortable shave and is the most quiet electric shaver I have used.  I would definitely recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time Braun customer, my last Braun shaver (Braun Contour 5790) has lasted for approximately 11 years.  I was very hesitant on changing to a different brand or shaver type, but I researched for a while on the current rotory &amp; foil shavers and have settled on the Panasonic ES-LT41-K.  I was very close to pulling the trigger on another Braun in the same price range (Series 3-530cc), but many of the reviews claim that the Braun shavers have been inconsistent with shaving &amp;#34;closeness/smoothness&amp;#34;.  Also, per reviews the Braun build quality and included accessories seems to be dropping as of late.  I simply cannot justify spending more money just to have the accessories included or to improve the actual shaving quality when other brands can provide these improvements and accessories for a lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the Panasonic ES-LT41-K, I immediately noticed a few key differences, it has a slightly louder &amp; higher pitched sound than the Braun shavers.  It&#x27;s lighter in weight, and more comfortable to hold.  The shaver-head lock, power-button lock, and LCD display features are nice upgrades that you typically pay more for with Braun shavers and it includes a protective plastic foil-cover and a storage bag for travel. The cleaning method is a little more echonomical, since you can use either water or water and liquid/gel anti-bacterial soap vs buying a cleaning cartridge for the Braun cleaning system.  Panasonic does sell foil shavers with an included cleaning system, but why go out of your way to buy it and then have to pay for the cleaning supplies when you can go without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawbacks that I&#x27;ve noticed with the Panasonic ES-LT41-K is that the foil/blade replacement parts are more expensive than Brauns, and you cannot use the shaver while it&#x27;s charging (for water/electrical safety reasons, being that this is a wet/dry shaver).  My Braun contour 5790 was a wet/dry shaver (although I never used it in the shower), and it could be used while it was charging.  I&#x27;m not sure if Braun sells any newer models that offer this feature (it has proven useful many times in the past, when the battery was dead/low), but nowadays it seems that most wet/dry shavers, including the Braun shavers, have disabled the &amp;#34;use while charging&amp;#34; feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first shave with the Panasonic ES-LT41-K was on 3-day old facial hair.  I wanted to try it on a worst case senario, any thing longer than this should be trimmed first with a beard trimmer to prevent most shaving issues with any electric shaver.  Most electric shavers are not designed to handle beard growth more than 3-4 days.  I noticed that with a 3-day old beard the shaver worked best with a light touch to simply trim the beard down to a more manageable length, then go over the entire area once more with a slight pressure to get the closest shave.  Prior to this final pass, I also used Williams Lectric Shave.  The shave was overall quicker, slightly less irritating (with 3-day old beard), and had fewer missed hairs than the older Braun shaver.  I will admit that the blades/foil on the Braun were past their prime, and this can contribute to a loss of performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the trimmer attachement, Both the Panasonic and Braun trimmer attachments could have been made better and performed about the same.  My Braun trimmer attachment fell apart after about 3 years.  I no longer rely on the integrated trimmers and have a separate beard trimmer to handle the trimming job properly.  The Braun and the Panasonic were in my opinion equal at giving a close/smooth shave when the foil/blades are new. Overall, I am very satisfied with the performance of both shavers, with the Panasonic slightly out edging the Braun because of less irritation with longer facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning process for the Panasonic ES-LT41-K was very simple and took very little time.  Remove the foil then press and hold the power button for 2 seconds to activatethe  cleaning mode (higher frequency). Then pass the blade portion of the shaver under cool tap water until the shavings are rinsed off.  Rinse the foil separately under cool water, shake to remove most of the moisture and then air dry before reinstalling onto the shaver.  To help dry the shaver, re-activate the cleaning mode to shake off most of the moisture.  Wipe away the residual moisture from the shaver housing (not really necessary), and then air dry separately from the foil.  Reinstall the foil when everything is dry prior to your next shave.  Once per week or per recharge, add liquid/gel anti-bacterial soap to the foil while it is installed over the blades and turn on the shaver to help lather up the soap and clean the metal surfaces.  Remove the foil and rinse the foil and blades separately under cool tap water.  Only activate the cleaning mode while rinsing or drying the blades with the foil removed from the shaver.</li>
            <li> With shaving, I see it as two areas. above the jawbone and below it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below the jawbone - It&#x27;s a simple straight up swipe with a blade razor and it&#x27;s done. Not so easy getting at the cross-growing hairs with an electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Above the Jawbone -  If the mouth, nose or ears weren&#x27;t there, it would be as simple as below the jawbone, but they are there, so it takes some careful maneuvering with a razor, so an electric really works well for me up there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had  a VERY old Braun and one other type. The batteries died and I decided it was time to see what&#x27;s new, rather than replace the batteries again. With my OLD electrics they&#x27;d get most of it, above and some below. I&#x27;d end up having to use the blade to touch-up unless I used it every 12 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked in the $60.00 or less range, and they looked similar to what I had before. After reading the reviews on some that looked OK I decided I might want more so I increased the price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fell in my new price range and had a decent rating, so I read what others thought, like you are doing. Thanks to other reviewers, I decided to get this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My expectations on this razor were based on my OLD electric razors. Some things are the same, and some are much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below the Jawbone - Same issue pretty much. It will get a good amount, but because of the flat hairs, I still have to give a quick swipe with a blade razor, depending on length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Above the Jawbone - I was really happy to see how well this worked. Dry or wet I was able to get the top done faster and easier than with my old electrics or a blade.  If I did 1/2 with a blade and 1/2 with this you could feel the blade did a closer job, but I highly doubt anyone couldn&#x27;t see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Build Quality. - YES!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This thing feels and acts like a solid built unit so far&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;- Options of Soft (flexible) or Hard (Fixed) razor top.&lt;br /&gt;- Options of Wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to rinse off and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I think could be better would be the way it&#x27;s connects to the charging cable. At first I thought I&#x27;d want a base to charge rather than the cable it has now. But then again, that cradle would probably just collect crap from hanging out near the other junk on the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My annoyance is the wire it has now can only go in one way. It&#x27;s marked which side is up, but not so easy to see with my eyes. So, it&#x27;s not as easy as it could be.to connect and charge.  My old one had the a non-polarized connection and  the rectifier in the shaver. That made it a no-brainer connecting it and racing off to work. This cable will annoy me a little, but it does hold a charge well, so it&#x27;s only a minor annoyance and I know I am being too picky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any way, I am really happy so far and can see it&#x27;s going to make my shaving live so much easier.

            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few weeks, and the word &amp;#34;dinky&amp;#34; keeps coming to mind when I turn it on. It&#x27;s very dinky. Its long-hair trimmer is okay if it&#x27;s just trimming very fine or sparse hairs, but on my face, where my hairs are dense, it is close to useless. Other than that, it&#x27;s okay. It doesn&#x27;t let you charge it while you&#x27;re using it, which I don&#x27;t really like. But overall it&#x27;s alright. Not great. Dinky.</li>
            <li> Excellent razor, especially for the money.  Wet/Dry function is a nice option for sensitive skin.  It charges quickly and is easier to clean than my previous Panasonic.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My first shave with this razor was great, felt smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind. But since then, it hasn&#x27;t done that great a job, leaving neck hairs and actually chafing the skin right under my chin. I still use it, mostly as a wet shaver now, but still have to tidy up with a blade.</li>
            <li> This is the first time to use electric shaver. It is so nice and even cheap. I think it is good enough for you.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this electric shaver.  Works great whether Wet or Dry shave, however seems to give a closer shave with shave gel or cream.</li>
            <li> Wish we had bought this earlier.  Love, love this thing.  I can now trim the back of my hubby&#x27;s head and he loves the razon for shaving.  Love, love!</li>
            <li> Near perfect so far. Been using it 4 months now. Time will tell how long it lasts. It is small and light but seems well made. Love the fact that it is water proof. I shave dry, but wash razor under running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gives me a close, smooth shave without irritation. This is the first time in 40 years of shaving that I have not had skin irritation from an electric razor - and I have tried quite a few. It also cuts through my rough beard even when I haven&#x27;t shaved for 3 days. It takes a while, but it does get through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery last me for 3 shaves. Recharging goes quickly. I follow instructions precisely and clean it each time with soft soap under water.</li>
            <li> The razor works great but I&#x27;m frustrated with Panasonic and the display.  The first one I had the display started cutting out almost immediately so I took it back and replaced it. The second one lasted longer but now its doing the same. Maybe I&#x27;m being too picky but this was a very useful feature when you want to take it traveling so you know how much charge is left. Panasonic never answered my support email.</li>
            <li> I really liked the version of electric razors with rotating circular blades, but I read the reviews on this one and was convinced to try it after my old electric razor broke down. This will get the job done, but if you have stubborn, bristly hair like me, it will take a while to get a satisfactory shave. That being said, the trimmer on the back is really useful.</li>
            <li> Fantastic shaver, keeps a charge for many shaves.  The only thing I liked better on my former Braun was the pop up trimmer is much better on the Braun.  I still use the old Braun for side burn trim or to shave off neck fuzz, just easier.  I get a real close shave, but to get it, go vertical and then at the end go horizontal.  Without this method, it will leave some close stuff behind.  I had to do this with the Braun as well. Overall, fast motor, keeps a great charge and able to place under water for rinsing which I only do once in awhile.</li>
            <li> The razor shaves close and is easy to clean up. I had a braun before and this shave closer and you do not have to buy refills.</li>
            <li> I actually never got to use the shaver.  The package arrived, I opened it, turned it on, shut it off and put it back in the box right away.  The shaver makes a relatively high-pitched noise which doesn&#x27;t seem to bother most people here but does bother me.  It would definitely be too much to take as part of the wake up routine.  I thought about rating it lower since it was a total fail for me, but everything else about it seems nicely made and well thought out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did buy it knowing that I couldn&#x27;t shave while charging which seems like a silly oversight in the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the return, I figured out how to replace the batteries in my old Braun which makes a much less obnoxious noise and which I can use while charging.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good shaver for sensitive skin , i bought this shaver for my husband&#x27;s gife , and he is very happy this shaver . And we just charge it for 1 hr that already full battery . Besides , this shaver outlooks is very modern , pretty and light . The most important is really close shave.</li>
            <li> Awesome shaver at a great price. I would definitely recommend this shaver for even a thick beard(like mine). It is a clean cut.</li>
            <li> &#x27;Great shaver . . . closest I have ever achieved, even with all earlier Panasonics.  Two criticisms:  Trimmer is too narrow . .. . should be wider, and unit doesn&#x27;t have a charging cradle.  But for the price, these are almost too minor to mention.</li>
            <li> This is a fine product for the money. It gives a good shave for a shaver of this price. It&#x27;s easy to clean and maintain. It fits my hand well. I&#x27;d like it a tad quieter, but for this price, that&#x27;s not a reasonable expectation.</li>
            <li> Update:  After 3 months of daily use I want to add:&lt;br /&gt;This is still a very good shaver.  But for daily use I am swapping it out with my \\&quot;secondary\\&quot; shaver, an old Norelco triple header I keep in my suitcase for occasional travel use.  The Norelco design just fits my face much better overall and provides a more natural hand grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original:  I purchased this Panasonic shaver to replace a 5 year old Norelco triple head whose battery run time had gotten too short.  I have used Norelco triple head shavers for decades and thought I would try this Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Feels better going over my face&lt;br /&gt;- Cuts as well as the new Panasonic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco cons:&lt;br /&gt;The triple head design does not allow me to get as close to some areas as I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Feels better in my hand&lt;br /&gt;- The head design allows better access to nooks and crannies around my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am keeping the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> It is perfect the main reason I bought it was because its hypoallergenic one complaint I thought the blade would be a little better when I&#x27;m done shaving I notice I miss a lot of hairs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the rounded foil razors for 40 yrs, started with Ronsons and then used Brauns.  Rotary heads don&#x27;t work for me.  This one got such good reviews I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the tilted head, I&#x27;m used to a straight razor in my hand.  I&#x27;ve only had this 2 weeks and I&#x27;m still adjusting.  I&#x27;ve shaved with this thing 9-10 times now and I&#x27;m at 40% charge and it does charge in 1 hour. I had read where the 4 head was way too wide for some so I went with 3 head.  It&#x27;s kinda wide too compared to what I&#x27;m used to so if you&#x27;re trying to get around a stache, I&#x27;d stick with 3 heads, maybe even 2.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t shave on weekends, lazy, so Mon’s I use a Gillette Fusion razor in the shower because there&#x27;s no way a foil head will do the job.  Until now!!  My first Mon I jokingly gave it a shot and WOW, it did a fantastic job.  Took probably 1 minute or 2 longer but I was impressed!  I&#x27;m very happy with this razor, I&#x27;d probably be thrilled spitless if the head was straight.  But I&#x27;m not so old that I can&#x27;t learn a few new tricks.&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:  Wow it cuts, quiet compared to any I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:  That damn tilted head.</li>
            <li> My 96 year old father has used many razors over his 75+ years of shaving.  Every time I speak to him he says how fantastic a product this is. Terrific, he keeps saying.  Terrific.&lt;br /&gt;An excellent product for the price point.  Extremely quiet, but very effective.  He&#x27;s not one to give out praise too freely,&lt;br /&gt;so I decided to post here. The reviews we read were true.  This is a great product in the under $100 price range.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this razor!</li>
            <li> Husband really likes this razor, does a great job.</li>
            <li> A blade shaves closer, but this is pretty darn close.</li>
            <li> Guzel kesiyor , hiç bu kadar beklemiyordum. Boyun bölgesinde bir haftalık donmus kılları bile alıyor. Hiç tahriş yapıp , yanma yaptırmadı. Alacak Turk musterıler için fikir olsun.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor because of the reviews on Amazon. I expected it to be an amazing difference compared to all my other razors, but that wasn&#x27;t the case. It&#x27;s not bad at all though. I like it very much, just don&#x27;t expect it to neccesarily live up to the reviews.</li>
            <li> My beard is spotty and grows slowly, so I need a shaver that gets close without much help from the whiskers.  This has been a great replacement for my old Braun and a huge improvement over the Norelco I tried.  I couldn&#x27;t get used to the three circular heads on a Norelco and prefer one broad screen to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this shaver is the loud buzz noise it makes.  Takes getting used to, but worth it for a good shave.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my husband who has really sensitive skin. I picked this one because of the reviews mentioning it works for sensitive skin and also because it has a travel switch, and my husband travels a lot. I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave hair bits all over the sink when he uses it, and he likes it too.</li>
            <li> I have never been one to use an electric razor. I have always shaved with a Gillette hand razor with shave cream. I had a three day growth and this thing right out of the box after charged. did a great job. I have noticed the more I shave with this the smother the shave. I believe some one else mentioned this. The feel in your hand allows you to mention a really good grip even if hands are wet. I had no problems with the shape around my ears right below the jaw line. This was a problem with a regular hand held razor and would always cut myself in this area. This thing is just really a work of art more than a razor. Highly recommended. And for the prize I was impressed with the performance. Hope this helps some one if you are on the fence about which model to get this might really be worth a try for you.</li>
            <li> it doess the job and is easy to charge and holds a charge longer than most shaver do and my man is has no trouble using it</li>
            <li> Was hoping for more from all the positive reviews. It is slightly quieter than my Braun 8975, but no faster or closer. I can get 4-5 shaves per charge-about the same as my old Braun (3-4). I do make many passes to get a close shave, but this is the case for all electric shavers. One pass is only for safety razors and barbers straight razors. For those in transition from safety razor to electric shaver, do not expect a faster shave, but do expect less styptic pencil use. I rub very hard to get all the whiskers, and there is never abrasion, possibly an ephemeral mild non-irritating redness.</li>
            <li> My first Linear finally needed replacement after quite a few years of use.&lt;br /&gt;This newer model feels great and I like the charge indicator; the old one did not have one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not excited about its prompt to clean it with soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is the plug into the razor; could have been easier.</li>
            <li> No reason to spend more for a shaver.  Very close shave.  Long battery life.  Travel lock-out feature is nice to have.</li>
            <li> Wasted my money on this one unfortunately...I have some very thick facial hair and need to shave every day.  This product does not do as well as a smaller one I bought for a lot less form walmart or target..I haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower (not really sure if I can) but use it right after and am not impressed at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, like I say, my hair is super thick and grows quickly so not sure if it will work for you.</li>
            <li> Having using a Braun for over 30 years I am now sold on Panasonic. It is far superior to the last Braun that I had.</li>
            <li> The razor worked fairly well, gave a decent shave. However, a few months down the line the popup trimmer just stopped working.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST PANASONIC SHAVER I&#x27;VE EVER HAD AND I&#x27;VE HAD AT LEAST FOUR OTHER ONES OVER THE LAST 15 YEARS!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dry shaved with an electric shaver for almost 20 years.  All previous shavers have been Remington brand.  I went with the Panasonic based on so many positive reviews.  I rated a 4 because: It takes me about 4+ minutes per shave because I like a really smooth finish.  As such, it requires me to go over the same area multiple times.  I don&#x27;t fault the shaver, rather a byproduct of my method.  Also because it does take me longer per shave, I don&#x27;t get the manufacturers suggested 14 shaves in between charges.  I get approximately 9 shaves per charge, which is still well beyond a week so I&#x27;m happy with the battery life.  A little issue I have is that if I skip a day shaving, I get some small hairs that curl.  Often this shaver won&#x27;t get them so I use the trimmer, which does work well.</li>
            <li> This was a far better value and shaver than I ever imagined.  I had used a Remington electric shaver for 30 years and had try others, but this one impresses me each time I use it.  I recommend others that have not wanted to try a different one to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Shaves OK and is better on neck than a rotary  shaver.</li>
            <li> I have a been a staunch hater of electric razors but a recent need for blood thinners because of knee replacements forced me to purchase another.  I really like this razor. I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard and have had a great experience using this with Williams Lectric Shave as well as shaving cream in the shower.</li>
            <li> A must buy for anyone considering an electric razor. This will without a doubt be replacing my old razors. If ya try it I&#x27;m sure you will do the same.</li>
            <li> In the past, I used a Remington rotary shaver and it felt like my hairs were being pulled, instead of cut. In the end, my skin suffered. Therefore, I was done with electric razors. Then, after using the messy [[ASIN:B0048ZIFA0 Soft Sheen Carson Magic Fragrant Shaving Powder]], which can only be used 36 hours after an initial shave, I went to using razors, such as the [[ASIN:B003987CL0 Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor, 1-count Package]]. However, the cartridges were too pricey, so I would try to prolong them by shaving, twice a week. Therefore, I figured I would try some kind of electric razor, so I could get a good shave, everyday. This time, I was looking for a foil shaver because the rotary shaver irritated my skin. Then, I discovered the high ratings of the Panasonic Arc three on Amazon and decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features: This electric shaver is very versatile. It can be used wet or dry. In fact, regular shaving cream can be used with this shaver. The flexible pivoting head allows for a more precise shave around the contours of your face. The shaver can also be used, without the heads pivoting because there is a \\&quot;lock\\&quot; switch, which keeps the heads steady, during shaving. The pop-up trimmer is surprisingly effective. It actually trims better than my Remington trimmers. It trims the side burns and beard very quickly and surprisingly close. Other pop-up trimmers seemed useless, compared to this one. Keep in mind, the heads may block your vision on the desired areas to trim. Therefore, turning the shaver in a way to get a better look on where you want to trim should help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance: The 30 degree Nanotech blades gives a fairly close shave, depending on how your hair grows. Don&#x27;t expect the blades to shave very close after just one pass, ESPECIALLY if the hair that is thick. With that being said, I would recommend using this shaver, when the hair is not very thick. Of course, using the shaver, everyday or every other day should help, as well. Either way, a smooth and comfortable shave will be the aftermath of complete use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning: Cleaning this shaver could not have been easier. After shaving, just put some hand soap on the foils of the shaver. Turn the shaver on and wait for the soap to lather. Remove the foil. Then, rinse the blades and the foil with water. It is that simple. For a more intense cleaning, you can use the Sonic Vibration Mode. Just press and hold the power button for a few seconds and the blades will vibrate, vigorously. Then, hold the blades under water and any access hair caught up in the shaver will be rinsed and shaken away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging: A full charge only takes and hour. Also, this shaver can be used for 45min. of cordless shaving. It also has a five-minute quick charge feature, which allows just one shave, when the power has been exhausted. Of course, this would only be necessary if you were in a hurry to get a quick shave. The percentage of the charge can be see on the illuminated indicator on the front of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very good and versatile shaver. The only downside to this shaver is it does not cut close, without a number passes. The other issue with this shaver is it cannot be used, while it is plugged up. Of course, that is not a major flaw. Overall, this shaver is worth owning, especially for the price it has dropped to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exactly one year, later........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the owners manual, the creators have a strong clam that the user won&#x27;t have the desire to shave with anything else, if used for a minimum of 30 days. Of course, they claim this is the duration for a person&#x27;s face to get used to various methods of shaving. Prior to that minimum of 30 days, I was not totally satisfied because of impatience, but the more I shaved, I realized that they were right. This shaver has totally cleared up my skin on my neck area. After using a razor for months, my skin was smooth, but it had somewhat of an irritated look on my neck area.Now, that is ALL cleared up. People have also noticed the difference in how smooth my skin is, since I have been consistently using this shaver. This tells me that the shaver is good for people with sensitive skin. If you buy this shaver and have any reservations after using it a couple of times, give it at the very minimum, 30 day chance. After owning this shaver for a whole year, it is still gives me a very comfortable shave. I will NEVER shave with anything else, again.Now, that is ALL cleared up.

            <li> Ladies, don&#x27;t shave your face!  But if, like me, you have to, this razor is great.  I use it dry and it gets very close. Even using a magnifying mirror I could barely see stubble. Thank you to the female reviewer who said ladies, stop fooling around with a ladies razor and go with a mans. It is worth the extra cost. The digital display tells you when it needs to be charged. Great choice!</li>
            <li> After using razor blades for shaving my head and got some spots bleeding, This did the trick, I love it</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband who has been through a lot of electric shavers, so far he&#x27;s had this one about a yr and still loves it, charges fast and gives good shave!</li>
            <li> Does not shave close enough</li>
            <li> This is by far the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used. I typically use the Gillette manual razors for a close clean shave and use an electric for maintenance on day 2. This razor is the closest to a razor shave I have ever experienced from an electric</li>
            <li> My husband has always used the rotating blade razors. He loves the closeness of the shave with this razor, and I love it as well! Even 12 hours after shaving, his face is still smooth! He declares it his favorite razor ever.</li>
            <li> Like:&lt;br /&gt;Can be used wet and dry&lt;br /&gt;can be rinsed easily&lt;br /&gt;has rinsing reminder&lt;br /&gt;has side shaver&lt;br /&gt;has visual battery indicator&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislike:&lt;br /&gt;sometimes cause some irritation</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend, and he loved it!  He really liked how much smaller, and sleeker it was than other electric razors.  It is easy to clean, and gets really close.  The battery life lasts a long time, and it doesn&#x27;t take long to re-charge.  I should note that he isn&#x27;t super hairy, and I don&#x27;t know how it would compare to someone that grew thick facial hair, but for trimming and keeping the face clean it is top-notch.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot. charges last awhile and it&#x27;s still going. enough said.</li>
            <li> I was prescribed blood thinners a little over a month ago and the doctor recommended switching to an electric razor.  I limited my budget to $100 and saw the Panasonic had decent reviews and so I purchased one. What a wasted of money.  I used it twice and threw it in the cabinet and switched back to my regular razors in the hopes that I do not cut myself too deep.  I first tried it in the shower and honestly, I spent over 10 minutes just trying to get a decent shave that was even.  The next time I used it, I decided to use it after my shower.  I saw the same splotchy results and decided to just throw it in my cabinet and consider it money lost and lesson learned.  Since then, I have asked other electric razor users about their experiences with electric razors and most like them however they are furtunate not to have aggressive whiskers like I have and so it is pefect for them.  I even tried to shave a small portion of my chest to see if that hair would be easier and it was the same result.  My electric razor experience is over, not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> I have been using razor blades for years. However the price of the cartridges are getting more and more ridiculous. Hence i decided to try electronic shaver; its suppose to be way cheaper in long run i guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent quite some time doing research on Amazon, i read that this shaver is the new version of the highly rated ES8103S. It is probably the top rated shaver which cost less than $100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an Asian, I have sensitive skin and quite a number of acne on my face. The first time i use this shaver, i was amazed by how close it can shave; it is nearly as good as razor blades. However, there were some mild skin irritation after the shave. I read some reviews saying that it takes ~1 month for your skin to get use to a new shaver? Unfortunately that was not true for my case. I have been using this shaver for near 3 months, and i still get some mild skin irritation after shaving. Anyway, not a big deal, i got a after-shave lotion and it solved my irritation problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far everything is great - water proof (or at least splash proof), easy to clean, and 1 full charge gets approximately 10 shave. Most important of all, it produces similar shaving results as razor blade. I stopped using razor blades after i got this shaver. Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> As above excelent razor</li>
            <li> Close shave.  Good upgrade from my 7 year old norelco.</li>
            <li> Compared this head to head against a Braun 700 series.  This one won!</li>
            <li> not ascose shave I expected</li>
            <li> The foil dents easily so I had to get a replacement. The replacement had issues with the beard trimmer. I really liked it until I bought a Wahl which I now use everyday.</li>
            <li> I researched a bunch of razors and settled on this one. Great bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> I was using a regular razor everyday during my last deployment and it would get irritating because of the constant need to be clean shaven. I had also has used a 3 blade rotary Norelco previously and it did ok, but the battery died too quickly and I had to keep it plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the ES-LT41-K for my current deployment and it is a huge upgrade. It&#x27;s very easy on the skin with everyday use. It does everything an electric razor should do well: close shave, great battery life, easy to clean. The flip-up razor does a great job trimming sideburns and my mustache, much better than the Norelco. It is especially nice being able to use it in the shower with or without shaving cream. The battery lasts at least a week of good use and charges rapidly (less than an hour).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a lock on the power button which is perfect since I travel a lot. I&#x27;ve had this razor for about 6 months and it still works like the day I got it. I was weary spending the 80 or so bucks on this, but I can see that it is a great value and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this electric razor!  Great buy!</li>
            <li> I can never get as close of a shave as with a manual shaver, but the speed and ease of use makes up for it.  Also no longer have to waste a bunch of plastic with the disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also own the Panasonic ES-LV61 shaver, so this will primarily be a comparison between the two.  Both shavers have the negative in that they always leave a few spots that are not close enough, particularly on bottom of the chin going to the neck.  It doesn&#x27;t matter how many times I go over that area in varying angles and speeds, can never truly get it cut.  So after the shave I take the detail trimmer and just trim the area, again not as close as the shave but end result looks reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The detail trimmer on this shaver is a little wider than I would expect, which has both positives and negatives.  As I do have to use it in more than just &#x60;detail&#x27; areas, it is useful that it is wide.  But when I have to use it around my sideburns, I wish it were thinner.  It can&#x27;t be perfect for all occasions I guess...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest positive that I see with this razor compared to the ES-LV61, is that the battery seems to last noticeably longer.  I don&#x27;t know if this razor shaves quicker than my other, never timed it and the other one has a shave time on the display.  Shaving every day I can get almost 2 weeks on a single charge.  Combined that with it supporting 100-240V charging, it makes it a great razor for travelling.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver.  It works well for daily removal of stubble, although you won&#x27;t have the baby-bottom skin like you do after using cream and razor.  And if you go two or three days without shaving, you&#x27;ll probably also want to use the cream and razor instead of this.  Anyways, in about five minutes with this shaver, you can get a decent shave.  For my beard, I need to shave in three directions (down, up, then sideways).  I use it dry for the closest shave, then rub a little jojoba oil on my skin afterwards.  It&#x27;s a bit loud, if that&#x27;s a concern.  It seems well-built, and it has good battery life.  It&#x27;s very easy to clean.  The facial hair trimmer works very well.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this razor. Unfortunately, it was stolen out of my bf&#x27;s car. Not cheap, but definitely worth re-buying.</li>
            <li> That is what I want ! I am enjoying it ! Light and let me have a clean shaving !</li>
            <li> Works very well and gives as close a shave as any electric razor I have used.  My only beefs with it are that its expensive and you&lt;br /&gt;need to clean the heads out almost every time you use it or the cutting ability goes way down.  And you can not use it while it is&lt;br /&gt;plugged into the charger which I have mixed feelings about.  Still, an excellent option if you don&#x27;t want a real razor.</li>
            <li> I had a Norelco razor that broke, and I was going to buy another one.  I thought the Norelco was just average, but I assumed that all electric razors gave just an average, or below average shave.  I was amazed by this Panasonic razor.  Perfect form fitting function.  Easy to use and gives great shaves!!!!!  Not as perfect as using a blade - but pretty darn close.  I was, and am, very impressed.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Better shave than my Braun or Norelco.</li>
            <li> Excellent&lt;br /&gt;After two about two years of work, it&#x27;s still perfect!</li>
            <li> New to electric razors, works good.</li>
            <li> excellent shaver, Love Panasonic</li>
            <li> Used for a month. No problems. Better shave than my old Norelco rotary. Like the wet/dry capability. Holds a full week charge, and recharges in about an hour.</li>
            <li> An excellent shaver!!!!</li>
            <li> For the past few years I&#x27;ve been using a double-edged safety razor (the old-school kind) because my first two electric shavers, one a Panasonic and the other a rotary Norelco, weren&#x27;t all that great.  And because I was tired of Gillette ripping me off with blade cartridges that had a 1500% markup ($2.50 for a cartridge vs. 15 cents for a double-edged blade).  My first such razor, a modern one, broke when it fell, so I was using my great-grandfather&#x27;s 100+ year old razor for the past year or so.  It was much more aggressive but I got used to it.    I really dislike shaving, a lot, but I look better when I&#x27;ve shaved and my fiance really appreciates me not having sandpaper-face.  I decided to give this shaver a try because an electric is way faster and easier and cheaper to use, so I knew I&#x27;d use it more.  It&#x27;s really good!  It shaves just as close as the blade setup I was using.  Mind you, I don&#x27;t shave against the grain because my skin gets highly irritated when I do that, so I&#x27;ve never had ultra-turbo-close shaves, but plenty smooth.  This shaver probably doesn&#x27;t get as close as an against-the-grain razor but it&#x27;s just as good as what I was doing with a blade, but far more convenient.  It&#x27;s also very good for those \\&quot;unmentionable\\&quot; areas, both on myself and my fiance, who agrees that it causes less irritation than a razor.    Battery life hasn&#x27;t impressed me much yet (I&#x27;ve had it for about 3 weeks) but there are many factors in that so I can&#x27;t fault the shaver too much.  It&#x27;s easy to clean, does a great job, charges quickly, and the blades and foil are supposed to go a fairly long time before needing replacement.    It boggles my mind that anyone would spend any more money than this on a shaver when this one does such a good job.  Panasonic makes a FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR shaver!  There is zero chance that it&#x27;s $400+ better than this one.  All I can figure is that it appeals to the \\&quot;look at how much expensive stuff I have!\\&quot; crowd.</li>
            <li> this shaver is as advertised. A good buy, with nice features. It is a bit noisy, but it&#x27;s just a different kind of pitch for a shaver. You won&#x27;t have as many passes to clear your face and the tilting head is a great option</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, battery life is good, about 10 days per charge and it shaves close.</li>
            <li> I had been using Braun electric razors for years.  I found my most recent purchase, a Series 3 razor, to be a big step backward in terms of closeness and speed of shaving.  I bought this razor as a replacement.  The difference is like night and day.  This razor absolutely shaves as close as a blade; and there is little to no irritation.  I only use it in \\&quot;dry\\&quot; mode, so I can&#x27;t comment on its wet performance.  The programmed cleaning cycle works great and doesn&#x27;t require a cleaning stand or purchase of cleaning solution.  Some people have commented about the sound of the razor.  Because of the 13,000 cycles-per-minute speed, the razor definitely has more of a high-pitched buzz rather than a hum.  The sound, however, is not annoying and within a week, you won&#x27;t even notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;- Extrememly close shave&lt;br /&gt;- Fast, you don&#x27;t need to go over the same area multiple times&lt;br /&gt;- Easy cleaning without a cleaning stand&lt;br /&gt;- Very light weight&lt;br /&gt;- Comes with a travel case&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- Battery life could be a little longer, I get 9-10 shaves with a heavy beard</li>
            <li> The three blade Panasonic ES-LT41-K is a good Panasonic razor.  That is, it gives a closer shave than pretty much any comparable razors of other brands at this price point, specifically Braun and Norelco.  It&#x27;s hard to compare brands otherwise; you either will like a Panny shave or you won&#x27;t, which is one reason why these offer a 30 day money back guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real question is how this compares to the higher price point 4 and 5 blade Panasonics.  The good news is the difference isn&#x27;t terribly noticeable, but the bad news is that there&#x27;s a difference.  It does take more passes to shave with the 3 blade than with the 4 blades, and a bit more effort.  Whether or not this is worth a price point that&#x27;s $40 less is really up to the buyer.  One thing to keep in mind is that replacement blades and foils for this are slightly cheaper, and given that Panasonics do tend to require relatively frequent replacements (they recommend 1 year and 2 years, when practical use suggests half that time) you may save a bit more by buying this over the 4 blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars.  Good razor, just not their best.</li>
            <li> It did not meet my expectations as not that successful at neck and jawbone area. But if your beard is not problematic on the neck area, you can give a try. 4 or 5 blade ones may be better.</li>
            <li> There are so many options out there! I finally chose this shaver after exhaustive research, based on comparison with other Panasonics as well as price. I&#x27;ve had Braun, Norelco (Phillips) and, most recently, Remington (the worst!) before. This shaver blows them all away, and I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to find out! Quality throughout!</li>
            <li> This is used by my wife for her legs.  She got tired of using a regular razor.  After about a week of getting used to it, she now likes it a lot.  She did not like the electric razors for women as they were not as well built, were expensive for what they delivered, and didn&#x27;t work any better.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I tried several different shavers, from cheap models up to the very expensive models. I found that none of them performed any better than the others, so I ended up keeping a cheap model. After seeing the excellent reviews of this shaver, I decided to take the plunge and get one. I am very pleased with the results! I haven&#x27;t had this close of a shave in years. It works best with shaving cream, but I have very good results with just a pre-shave lotion as well. Very pleased with this purchase! As with any shaver, there are a few stray neck hairs, but overall the shave is much closer than most others I&#x27;ve tried. I gave this one 4 stars, as the only shaver that&#x27;ll ever get 5 stars will never leave a stray neck hair - something that will likely never happen in my lifetime.</li>
            <li> Best electric shaver I have ever used. Bought this shaver aprox. 2 years ago. I have replaced the blades and foil cover because of everyday use and it shaves like new. I would happily buy this razor again.</li>
            <li> Husband thinks it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I have had this for just over a month now and very pleased with it. Battery life last longer than the past two electric shavers from Norelco that I owned in the past ten years. I do think that the batteries now being used in the current electric shavers have improved much. I am getting a closer shave now.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of a complaint about this Panasonic shaver.  It performs its intended task very well.  I have some soft, wispy hairs on my neck.  They take more than one pass because they easily bend away -- but my old Norelco rotary took many more to get them.  On the regular whiskers, it shaves close with one pass, and entirely smooth with a second pass at right angles.  I also like the ease of cleaning it.  It comes apart easily, and also has a cleaning setting which does help.  Finally, the state-of-charge indicator is helpful, as the shaver won&#x27;t run off the charger.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for myself, and liked it so much, I purchased 2 more for my sons!... This razor is very quiet, very fast,(blades rotating @ 13,000rpm) and smooth!!...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned several Braun razors for about 10 years now, and LOVE this panasonic compared to them!!...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve shaved dry, and have no problems!!!...clean-up is quick with soap &amp; water!!!....LOVE THE DIGITAL BATTERY STRENGTH READOUT!!!...&lt;br /&gt;My only con, would be, that the construction of this razor seems a bit \\&quot;lighter\\&quot; and \\&quot;plasticy\\&quot;(if that&#x27;s a word)....more like a \\&quot;toy\\&quot;....&lt;br /&gt;If it holds up as good as my Brauns, I&#x27;ll be back!!!!....DEFINITELY!!!....If not, I&#x27;ll be back to down grade my rating!!!....&lt;br /&gt;Recommend????.....YOU BET!!....Can&#x27;t go wrong for $72.00 spent on this razor!!!</li>
            <li> Warning, it shaves, but do not buy it thinking it will shave close to your skin!</li>
            <li> This is just a great shaver!</li>
            <li> The best electric razor I have ever owned.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to wonder if another brand will replace it. While I love the idea of no charging/cleaning station, Panasonic needs to rethink the needs of American men. This one holds a charge better than the last 2 but still needs a recharge at 60% and below. Even at 100% charge I find I&#x27;m going over the same places too many times to get a smooth shave. Nice touch is I&#x27;m in the comfort of a hot shower.</li>
            <li> I first order the Norelco PT720 electric razor from Walmart and that thing really caused my neck to rash. I bought this Panasonic for $76 and really like it. I have not used an electric razor for 25 years. I do use Afta pre-shave and it shaves almost as close as a razor. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best shaver I have had by far. It is quite, runs with alot of smooth power that really does an effficient job in short order. I can always rely on Panasonic to produce great products. Thanks!</li>
            <li> so much better than my old remington 5300 I owe my wife a kiss for ruining the old one.  It&#x27;s easy, much quieter and I don&#x27;t have to follow up with a razor.  I&#x27;ve had it about 2 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for over 25 years. I&#x27;ve tried the rotary style, but it wasn&#x27;t for me. For the most part, I&#x27;ve used Remington models. When the trimmer on my latest Remington quit working, I decided to see what else was out there. I quickly homed-in on the Panasonic models and chose this one over the other Panasonic models for a couple reasons. First, I thought more than 3 blades would be too bulky (plus more expensive to replace blades). Second, I didn&#x27;t want to pay $20 extra for the cleaner; based on my experience with other shavers, just removing the cap and tapping it clean has always been more than sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for over 1 week now, and am very happy with the oveall performance. First, for others who think it is very loud, my Remington sounded like a chainsaw compared to this thing. As far as noise levels go for an electric shaver, I would say it is very quiet. Second, for the closeness of the shave, it does a very good job; again, better than my Remington was with new blades. Third, it is very comfortable due to the high speed. Fourth, I am noticing my face is significantly less irritated, as compared to the Remington (I always dry shave).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, I have really become a fan of Panasonic products. I have 65\\&quot; plasman TV, a surround sound system, two digital cameras (one underwater), a cordless phone. and now a shaver, all made by Panasonic, that I have been very happy with. And, no, I do not work for Panasonic, or know anyone who works for Panasonic.</li>
            <li> As a modern day Sasquatch, this razor is a god send. It cuts close, doesn&#x27;t pull the hair, and easy to clean. I highly recommend using this in the shower. It is also great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, plastic quality.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT...SMOOTH GLIDE AND LONG CHARGE</li>
            <li> Works great, provides a shave as close as a blade.  However, the foil screen has very small holes so you cannot shave as fast as you could with a Remmington shaver.  I&#x27;ve had it for two weeks and I&#x27;m liking it more and more each day.  Would recommend and purchase again.</li>
            <li> Well made and easy to use.  I love this shaver!!</li>
            <li> best electric portable shaver i&amp;#34;ve used good shave .</li>
            <li> It shaves close but you need ear plugs to use. The cleaning under the water is easy to use. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Razors are too close for me and cut my skin. This electric razor gkves me a close shave, but not too where it leaves a \\&quot;baby face\\&quot;. The only complaint I have is that it loses charge faster than I expected and it takes a little longer to shave. Aslo i haven&#x27;t foumd the need to wet shave yet. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving so I can&#x27;t say I love it but it&#x27;s the 2nd one I&#x27;ve owned and works great in the shower.</li>
            <li> Had for several months now and still like it. Easy to use, clean and charge. Like the lock button for travel. Not the closest shave ever but it&#x27;s man daily curse so good enough. Want closer use a razor.</li>
            <li> Works well for shaving my head. I use it dry. Sure it takes a little longer than a blade but I was tired of my head being nicked and razor burned from a blade. Its nice to be able to rinse it under the tap. Quality seems good but I have only had it for a little while. Otherwise would give 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The product performs as expected.  I&#x27;ve owned other Panasonic electric razors and they work the best compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> This thing is great... I don&#x27;t have a super-thick beard, but have sensitive skin in general. Some of my facial hairs do not grow out in a consistent direction or grain, so I have some spots that are particularly prone to in-grown hairs, and mildly acne-prone skin.  This has been a tough combo to deal with.  I have tried different electrics before, most recently a 7 series Braun, which was still too harsh.  For a while I used 2-blade disposable razors, which would work OK if I hadn&#x27;t shaved in a couple days, but towards the end of the work week the bumps/irritation/nicks would increase, which as many of you I&#x27;m sure know tends to be a viscous cycle that can be tough to break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give the LT41-K a try using it as a wet shaver 100% of the time, and after a couple weeks, in addition to some other essential components, I&#x27;ve been having great results.  If what I described above applies to you, set yourself up with the following &amp;#34;cocktail&amp;#34; (all available at Amazon):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  This shaver (ES-LT41-K)&lt;br /&gt;2.  Cremo Shave Cream to use with the shaver as a wet shave (this stuff is incredible)&lt;br /&gt;3.  Nivea For Men Sensitive Post Shave Balm (Active Comfort System)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m telling you, use this setup everyday (following instructions on the Cremo bottle), give it some time, and I think you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTE GARBAGE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this razor.  Had to go over my neck 20 times and it still didn&#x27;t shave, but it did manage to cut my skin, which was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up having to use a regular razor just to get the job done.  Returning this right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS RAZOR.  Caveat emptor.</li>
            <li> Panasonic makes the best electric shavers. This unit has a rubberized exterior allowing for a solid grip. The cut is rock solid and gives a close shave. They added a wonderful new feature. There is a lock button on the front, which was sorely needed for travel and other applications. Digital display and easy to clean with soap and water. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves it.  He says it is the best electric shaver he&#x27;s used.  He says it shaves very close and does not pull his skin at all.  He hasn&#x27;t tried using it with shaving foam, but I think he&#x27;ll like it either way.</li>
            <li> I looked at the reviews of other brands and models and got this one. I gave up some rpm on the blade 1300 compared to 1400 rpm  like the $200 to $350 models. replacement blades and screen are half the price. The shave is close but a razer blade is still better. but I have a heavy beard and shave my head also with little effort and dont have to shave when I get out of the shower when my beard is soft like I have to when I use a razer blade. yes i can shave dry and fast and its a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;  I dont know how a 4 and 5 blade electric razer shaves but it cant be that much better than my 3 blade ya I am very happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for the last 50 years.  I&#x27;ve owned most models, from Ronson and Remington to Braun, Norelco and Panasonic, wired and rechargeable, with rotary, foil and bar cutters.  None have topped my recent Panasonic ES-8068.  But at 12 years old, it was starting to show its age.  Its charged lifespan went from  6 days down to 2.  And parts were getting more difficult to obtain, particularly the pop-up trimmer.  So, I elected to replace it with the ES-LT41.  I&#x27;ve used the ES-LT41 daily for the past 2 weeks and I&#x27;ve formed some early opinions.  First, it&#x27;s lighter in weight compared to the ES-8068.  That makes it easier to hold but it doesn&#x27;t have the same heft.  I&#x27;m hoping the weight-savings aren&#x27;t the result of less sturdy construction or of a lighter and smaller battery but I&#x27;m not holding my breath.  Second, the ES-LT41 is more difficult to push through my stubble, whereas the ES-8068 moved smoothly across my face and objected only when presented with a 2-day growth of beard.  The ES-LT41 reminds me of the Norelco rotary shaver I once owned and gave away because of my feeling that I had to &amp;#34;push&amp;#34; it through my beard.  The ES-LT41 feels the same way.  Once it gets the rough stubble down to a shorter length, though, the ES-LT41 does a very good job of getting all the hairs removed down to the smooth skin.  In this regard, it&#x27;s as good as the ES-8068 was on its best day.  Third, the flexible head seems like a gimmick.  It&#x27;s not actually needed, as I&#x27;ve tried the shaver in both the &amp;#34;locked&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; positions and seen no difference in how well either mode performed.  And the flexibility has no discernible advantage (other than marketing) and may just introduce unneccessary mechanical and electrical complications.  So, I&#x27;m still undecided about this razor.  Sure, it gives a close shave but so did my ES-8068 when it was brand new.  Both use the &amp;#34;linear&amp;#34; motor at 13,000rpm, yet the ES-LT41 is a bit quieter than the ES-8068, perhaps because it&#x27;s a later design.  The ES-LT41 is cheaper than my old ES-8068, by a long-shot, which may account for my perception that I&#x27;ve &amp;#34;stepped down&amp;#34; in class.  I guess the only way I&#x27;ll know is if it lasts me 12 years.  If anything changes, I&#x27;ll update this review.  Update April 2015: This has lasted all of 2 years and has done a fairly decent job.  However, now the trimmer won&#x27;t work.  The trimmer engagement is made of cheap plastic and the arm that oscillates the cutter has popped out of place and doesn&#x27;t engage the cutting head.  No amount of coaxing will move it back into place.  Panasonic used to be my preferred shaver but no more.  I&#x27;m sick of decent products cheapened in order to increase the profit margin.  I expected better than this.  No more Panasonic; I&#x27;m off to check out the Braun shavers.  But my expectations are lower, given that this is what the market now offers.</li>
            <li> Bought this razor for my son and he absolutely LOVES it! He has acne and using a regular razor would break him out terribly. We have tried other electric razors, but this one is by far the best! The &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; shave is an added bonus for that extra clean shave, but shaving dry gets the job done almost as good! Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this razor!!</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my beloved 13 year old Braun 6000 series (which was still working, but battery was finally dying).  I love everything except the cord, which is a wall wart design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry shaving experience - 5/5&lt;br /&gt;Wet shaving - don&#x27;t use&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning - 5/5&lt;br /&gt;Holds a great charge.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t have the nice curly cord that my Braun did.</li>
            <li> This is my second Panasonic shaver. It works great with pre-shave lotion and if I want a closer shave I use shaving cream. Cleaning it is simple. Put some hand lotion on the foil, turn on the shaver, hold it under water.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaves really well for a dry cut...haven&#x27;t tried wet cut, but i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charges fast and I can get more than several days worth of shaves.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm.  Made an excellent birthday gift for my father.  And I understand I have to write 1 more word for this review.</li>
            <li> Agree with other reviewers.  Takes about about 2 weeks for your face/stubble to adjust to a foil shaver from a rotary. So glad I made the switch back.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean - run it under hot water &amp; in about 15 seconds it&#x27;s done.&lt;br /&gt;Charges last about a week.  Like being &amp;#34;mobile&amp;#34; with a cordless.</li>
            <li> I have used Remington for years but I thought I would try this Panasonic.  Glad I did.  It seems to do a better job for me.  Very satisfied.  Requires charging every 9 - 10 days.  You need to pay attention to the display when you turn it off because the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; indicator turns off and does not come back the next day to re-remind you to clean it.</li>
            <li> Very nice shave, not load at all. Comfortable to hold. Charge lasts over a week.</li>
            <li> Just purchased this shaver...so far so good.  Shaves closely, no irritation, powerful, and fast.&lt;br /&gt;Convenient charge level indicator....it also tells you when to rinse the head with a little faucet drip symbol.&lt;br /&gt;Better than my old Braun and Norelco...&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend for performance and value.</li>
            <li> Previously I had been using one with the three round blade sections.  I was a little nervous about whether this style would work for me.  It didn&#x27;t take longer than the first shave for me to be sold on it!  It gives a closer shave than the old Norelco one ever did.  I also just love the style of this one aesthetically - it is very nice.  The pivoting head it great, and it&#x27;s great that it can be made rigid for those who might prefer it that way (though I&#x27;m not sure why someone would.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used it wet - only dry - and I&#x27;m very happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about a month I think and no complaints.</li>
            <li> The best electric I ever owned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other Panasonic razors but this is the best so far.  The reviews I read about this model were very accurate. I just recommended this model to a friend who shaved his beard and didn&#x27;t know what brand to try</li>
            <li> I have owned and nearly exclusively used the ES-8103S shaver from Panasonic for the past 3 years. I recently upgraded to the newer ES-LT41K to try something new - I was debating whether to buy another 8103, which I have very much loved. Please find my review of the 8103 here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AZAAWEOZRTJI/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rdp_perm The previous review repeats a significant part of my review below as the products are very similar, but also describes my positive experience with Panasonic customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review of the ES-LT41K&lt;br /&gt;I have always found it difficult to get a close shave, particularly due to the sensitivity of my skin and thick beard. The first and only product that has ever been able to provide me with a close and comfortable share has been the Panasonic foil shavers. I found this with the ES-8103S and again with the ES-LT41K. I would say 99% as smooth as razor, the difference is nominal - I can&#x27;t tell the difference visually. I have a thick, tough beard and the Panasonic breezes through in a few passes in most cases. I get even better results on shaving the mustache than I do with my razor. The neck area is where the shaver has some difficultly, although a few extra attempts usually solves this issue. I almost never get any razor burn or in-grown hairs, whereas I do get these with razors. It takes a few extra minutes to complete the shave compared to razor (maybe 7-8 min vs. 5-6 min). Simply put, when confronted with an opportunity to switch to another manufacturer when my previous razor finally stopped working, I stayed with the Panasonic line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparison of ES-LT41K to ES-8103S&lt;br /&gt;The product comparison chart shows the two shavers to be nearly identical - and they are. the LT41 has an added travel lock, which is a nice feature, although I had never had problems with my 8103 turning on during travel. However, there are some notable differences that I believe are improvements with the LT41 line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; First the feel of the shaver has been improved through the addition of a more textured plastic material. This helps with control of the shaver during use.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; The power screen is perhaps less reflective or something - I find it easier to read.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; The power consumption / capacity thus far has been identical for the equivalent new units.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Weight of the LT41 seems to have been reduced slightly - although I never had fatigue from weight using the 8103.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Charge times are not noticeable different, perhaps a bit faster with the LT41&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Price: ~ 5% lower cost with the LT41 at the time of my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: Great shaver, highly recommended. A few nice but modest upgrades from the ES-8103S line.feel of the shaver has been improved through the addition of a more textured plastic material.

            <li> I am a woman and I use this for my legs. I have tried many \\&quot;womens\\&quot; electric razors, with varying degree of effectiveness, but ultimately have been disappointed because they break or stop working after a couple of months.  I&#x27;ve moved on to heavier duty, men&#x27;s razors for durability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have [very] sensitive skin and coarse [but light] leg hair, so it makes shaving weekly painful and ugly, as razor burn isn&#x27;t a good look on anyone. With the electric razor I can use it a couple of days after I have shaved with a razor and maintain. While it does not give me the same results as a razor does, I am very pleased with the job that it does. The benefit of using this electric razor is that I can then razor shave weekly with much better and less painful results. I believe it is because the razor helps with exfoliation much better than my standard loofah and scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is performing well and I expect many more years of trusty service. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My first Panasonic lasted 15 years ,, this one feels just as good,  holds a charge for about 14 shaves. Close shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this shaver to be very easy to use and it cuts very well.  Batteries last a long time between charges.  Clear % of battery readout.  This shaver is a good value.</li>
            <li> Compared with ES-LT-71, it has no cosmetic design and useless c/c unit, rather functional / efficient shaver at reasonable price, quite simple to operate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several Panasonic shavers in the past (wore them out) and this one appears to be the best I&#x27;ve used yet... You just can&#x27;t beat the wet/dry shave.</li>
            <li> Seldom have I been so happy with a purchase.  This shaver has been very well designed to shave well, clean easily, and maintain.  It does require a learning process to use intelligently.  One cannot just fly over the whiskers like an ordinary razor.  One gets better results by going over the skin at a snail&#x27;s pace, allowing the skin to compress, unroll, and conform to the shape of the razor head, thus presenting the whiskers at maximum advantage to the blades for best &amp;#34;off with her head&amp;#34; performance.  So I shave like King Henry, ok.  Also, feeling the whiskers remaining as you go helps align the stroke with the best direction for cutting performance, as you seek the lay of the whiskers to approach from the opposite direction.  After shave is essential for me to prevent infection after this close a shave.  The skin toughens up after a few months, and the result is a very close shave every day.  Well worth the price.  Only one note:  the shaver head comes out of the detachable mount, and I did not know that.  Accidently pushed the metal head and plastic mount assembly out and it fell into the drain.  Luckily, I had the tools to retrieve it, but now I am very careful to handle that removeable head with no chance of dropping it.  All in all, an excellent buy, and if I lose this one, or wear it out, I would buy another.</li>
            <li> Electric razors seldom work well on my face but this one is the best one yet.  I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the razor except he wishes he got a closer shave.  This is a great value for the price and has nice features.</li>
            <li> I allways like parasonic. The best name on market. I buy this for replace my old one. My old one buy from 2000. 13 years only one blade, incredible. But baterry can not hold long for the trip. Thanks Parasonic</li>
            <li> This is the best unit on the market. For years, I have used Braun. However, I got one for my father for Christmas and tried it. It totally outperforms my new Braun shaver. Unlike the Braun, it does not pull whiskers!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an electric razor user for decades. I&#x27;ve gone through more than one Braun, more than one Norelco, and I&#x27;m on my second Panasonic. Of the three brands, Panasonic is the best. The Braun shavers feel the best made and have lasted forever; I still have a Braun Synchro I keep around, just in case (it still keeps a charge, more than 10 years later!). But, the two Panasonics gave me a closer shave. As a test, I shaved with the Braun with essentially new foil and cutters. I then followed with the Panasonic. I could hear and see the Panasonic cutting hair the Braun could not. The Panasonic is much better on the neck area. I believe it is due to the shape of the Panasonic head (the Panasonic is curved while the Braun is flat). I also still have a Norelco Speed XL. While the rotary shaver does well on the neck area, it can&#x27;t compare to the foil shavers for overall closeness. As an added bonus, the Panasonic can be used wet, if you so choose. The only negative for the Panasonic is it will not work while plugged to an outlet (I guess for legal reasons). I also occasionally wet shave with an old school safety razor. If the quality of the shave with the razor is a 10, I would rate the Panasonic a solid 9; 9.5 if you factor in convenience. I also sometimes shave my head with it. Works great on my head as well. Panasonic&#x27;s Arc 3 line is a steal for the price. It pays for itself in 6 months compared to buying replacement cartridges, while giving a shave that is faster, more convenient, and just as close. A winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE*&lt;br /&gt;After 1 year and 10 months, this razor died. At first, the readout started going wacky (just like my Panasonic es8109). A month or two later, the screen went blank and I noticed moisture in the screen (I only shaved once wet). A week later, the shaver would not start. My es8109 (the same as the es8103) is somewhat working 5 or six years later (for two of those years, the es8109 was not being used); the motor has gotten noisier and it doesn&#x27;t seem to vibrate as fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just replaced this shaver with a Norelco SensoTouch 3D model 1260x. The Norelco is much quieter than the Panasonic (and Braun). I&#x27;ve only used the Norelco once. As with other rotary shavers, the shave isn&#x27;t as close as the Panasonic. I&#x27;ll continue using the Norelco for a month to see if it does better after my face adjusts to it. I&#x27;ll write a full review of the Norelco at that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dropped a star from the original review. I&#x27;ve had 2 Panasonic shavers and both have not lasted more than 4 years. If Braun and Norelco can make a shaver that lasts more than 10 years, then so should Panasonic.&#x27;t seem to vibrate as fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just replaced this shaver with a Norelco SensoTouch 3D model 1260x. The Norelco is much quieter than the Panasonic (and Braun). I&#x27;ve only used the Norelco once. As with other rotary shavers, the shave isn&#x27;t as close as the Panasonic. I&#x27;ll continue using the Norelco for a month to see if it does better after my face adjusts to it. I&#x27;ll write a full review of the Norelco at that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dropped a star from the original review. I&#x27;ve had 2 Panasonic shavers and both have not lasted more than 4 years. If Braun and Norelco can make a shaver that lasts more than 10 years, then so should Panasonic.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve gone back and forth between blades and electric shavers - blades for closeness and the ability to get stray hairs, and electric for convenience and comfort. I&#x27;d been using a Norelco shaver, and replaced the (expensive) heads yearly as they recommended. But I&#x27;d still have to use a blade once every few weeks to remove long stray hairs from my neck. And, if I missed a day, the blade was my only hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the positive reviews for the Panasonic ES-LT41-K I decided to give it a try. My Norelco was starting to irritate and pull, and I just wasn&#x27;t eager to drop another $45 for replacement blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To put it simply, this shaver is fantastic. Three hours after shaving this morning and my face is still smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. Although it may take a few passes, it gets all of the whiskers every time, even those stubborn neck hairs that go every which way. No pulling and no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the shaver dry, and it works just fine. I&#x27;ve used it wet with my face soapy, and it does even better. My favorite way of shaving is to use William&#x27;s &#x27;Lectric Shave before shaving, which provides nice lubrication without the mess of shaving cream. The results are excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is easy. Unlike other reviewers I have only cleaned the shaver after every three or four shaves, and this seems to work fine. If I used it with soap or shaving cream I&#x27;d probably want to clean more often to avoid scummy build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a solid five stars. Why pay more?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: A year later, and I&#x27;m still in love with this shaver, and I still haven&#x27;t needed to use a blade to \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; hairs that it&#x27;s missed. An excellent product at an excellent price.</li>
            <li> This shaver meets all my expectations and is an improvement over the Remmington shavers I&#x27;ve used over the years. Panasonic is light-weight, holds a charge for up to about 2 weeks of shaving, is quiet and almost vibration-free. Shave is close and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I have an ES8025 from 10+ years ago. When you find a shaver you like, you try to keep it running as long as possible.  Unfortunately, it was time to retire the ES8025.  The newer series from Panasonic (ES-LT41-K) is lighter than my old shaver and I really like the charge display indicator and the travel lock button.  The pivoting head and special cleaning mode don&#x27;t do anything for me.  What I dislike about the new shaver is that it doesn&#x27;t cut as well as the old one (even with the old one&#x27;s dull blade).  The new one seems to be underpowered and tugs a bit even with brand new blades.  So, it takes longer to shave because you have to go slower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, it isn&#x27;t a bad shaver.  Just expect to be disappointed if you are used to the old Panasonic Linears from a decade ago.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my partner and he loved it. Works as described and is worth it&#x27;s price. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Have been using a normal razor for 25 years. Due to the reviews and user manual I expected a month of pain and redness before the skin was used to this method of shaving... But that was never the case.. It went smooth from the very first use. It is not as close a shave as a normal razor blade but that is theoreticly not possible since a razor has the blade on your skin and the electric shaver has a thin piece of metal (protection) between the blade and your skin... I &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; shave about 98% of the time and haven&#x27;t had any irritation since it I used it dayly for the last 3 months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Remington, Norelco, Braun, and now Panasonic.  I&#x27;ve owned them in that order.  Remington was horrible.  Norelco was fine until years later when my skin started becoming more sensitive.  I had to switch and bought a Braun which was Great until it died.  Just stopped working.  I had it a while so I&#x27;m not really disappointed.  I liked it enough that I almost bought another Braun but thought I would take a chance on the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun was definitely a smoother shave.&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic is definitely a closer shave.  In fact after 3 months I still say to my wife after I shave &amp;#34;what a baby face ... huh&amp;#34;.  I am totally impressed with the closeness.  It&#x27;s not as smooth a shave as the Braun, but it&#x27;s not bad.  My skin is Really Really sensitive and I have no problem using this razor and if it died I would buy another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave in the shower.  I wet my face and use a shaving gel.  I do NOT wet the razor as that dilutes the gel and causes the shave to not be as smooth.  I find this gives me the closest and smoothest shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;m finished shaving I pop the head off the razor and rinse it under the shower head.  I always dry it with a hand towel, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s required or even necessary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several months, and have been pleased. Shaves as close as any other shaver I&#x27;ve owned, comfortable to hold, can use wet/dry. Battery charges quickly and lasts about a week between charges. Reasonably quiet &amp; easy to clean. Built in trimmer is usable, but not the best design... Ok for sideburns, but tricky for a beard or mustache.</li>
            <li> I went and purchased a Panasonic for the first time as I have been a Norelco owner for over 30 years.&lt;br /&gt;This razor does not measure up to the Norelco...it is not bad, only not as clean and balanced as the Norelcos. Will give  it to my son and go back to Norelco.</li>
            <li> My 5th Panasonic razor in 12 years. By far, the best. Would buy 10 times over if I needed to.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor as a gift for my husband.  He said it cut beautifully, whether he had a light beard or a heavy mustache.</li>
            <li> Works well, no bells and whistles but does adequate job for the money. Didn&#x27;t need all that other stuff anyway</li>
            <li> This was bought as a Christmas gift for my son-in-law.  He was glad to get it and has said that he likes it a lot.</li>
            <li> I replaced a similar Panasonic model with this unit after using the old for 5 years. Its battery was lasting only 2-3 days.  While similar in price to the old unit, this new model has one nice feature- a rotating switch the locks the on/off button. Thus when packed for travel, it will not accidentally turn on when it moves when the suitcase is tossed about. I have had it for a month, The battery show 20% charge remaining after using to shave for two weeks. I should note that I have a light beard. I have tried the Norelco type electric shavers twice in the past , and this back and forth foil type shaver has worked best for my shaving purposes. It cleans itself well with soap and water. It has another lock on the shaving head that can allow it to flex or be rigid; I have always just locked the head to the rigid position.</li>
            <li> I have always hated electric shavers.  No matter how much I&#x27;d pay, the shave that I got was so much worse than the one that I got from my old-fashioned Sensor 3 razor.  Recently I read an article that mentioned this shaver.  It sounded too good to be true, but I decided to give it a try.  I have had the ES-LT41-K for just over one month now.  If it were to break today, I would not hesitate to buy another one immediately -- even if I had to pay full price.  There are two primary reasons that I simply love this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the shave I get is equal to or better than the one I get from the hand held razor, and I&#x27;ve never come close to that experience with any other electric shaver (including Panasonic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the comfort and ease of shaving that it provides is outstanding.  I use mine in the shower and apply a very minimal amount of shaving creme, which completely avoids the irritation I&#x27;d had whenever using an electric shaver in the past.  When done, you simply push the button and put the shaver under the shower faucet to clean.  Amazingly easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one hour charge feature, which is faster by far than most of its competitors (including other Panasonic electric shavers), is another nice plus.  A superb product.</li>
            <li> Okay, I am new to electric razors, and female. I was looking quick and easy maintenance, do the job without fuss, close enough to do facial hair, ez charge and fast. It fit all the bills. It does a fine job on my teensy chin hairs and post menopausal mustache, and in a pinch it can do your legs or arms.  It charges quickly. I haven&#x27;t used it much, We&#x27;ll see how it cleans. But, so far, so good</li>
            <li> This razor isn&#x27;t for someone looking for a quick shave. I also wouldn&#x27;t suggest this to men with courser, maturer beards. However, this is a great razor for high-school/college age guys with sensitive skin. I&#x27;m a 23 year old African American with thick facial hair and sensitive razor bump prone skin and this razor addresses all of those issues when used correctly. First I do a dry run, then after a splash of water and a pea sized amount of shaving gel I mow the lawn again, quick rinse, and swipe a moistened alcohol swab across my freshly shaved face. Even the moms and my little sisters noticed an improvement in my skin texture. Gave me a nice smooth feeling without the irritation and rawness of a regular razor. It&#x27;s also pretty quiet and it holds a charge well. Overall, I REALLY like it!!!</li>
            <li> This shaver gives a nice and smooth shave. Mostly I use it for a wet shave and I am very satisfied with the result.</li>
            <li> Perfect and works very good.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Fast charging.&lt;br /&gt;Every charge holds for 4 to 5 shavings.</li>
            <li> it was a gift for my dad he loved it</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son, he loves it.</li>
            <li> Excellemt shaver. Highly recommemded.</li>
            <li> Works well enough. It requires a little more patience but I get a good shave.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard but I do have very sensitive skin. I tried every combination of razor (disposable, cartridge, safety) and creams, but still wound up with a bloody, irritated neck every time. I got immediate relief with this Panasonic. My skin is smooth to the touch after shaving and zero irritation. I just use a little of the Lab series pre-shave and do it dry. I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited 20 years to use an electric, but I&#x27;m glad I finally did.</li>
            <li> Pro&#x27;s:  easy to clean; not excessively noisy; recharges rapidly&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s: does not shave as rapidly as two older models I have; cannot operate when plugged in - my Norelco, and older Panasonic models will do so &amp; it&#x27;s handy if battery is discharged.</li>
            <li> This razor is no better or worse than other electric razors I have owned.  None shave as close as a blade, despite ads to the contrary.  This one charges fast and cuts well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my husband about six months ago. It was a different style and brand than he usually used, but he has been extremely happy with it. He often comments on what a close shave he gets.</li>
            <li> shut clearly, like it</li>
            <li> The title is my review.  Like all things electronic it took me a while to learn the parts.  Now it just remains to see how long it lasts.  I had a Braun for 25 years.  Hope this is my last one because i did not like the new Brauns. So if this is my last razor, i&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li> I found that this razor worked well when used in a wet shower environement versus on a dry face. Compared with my Norelco rotary razor I found that it takes a couple minutes longer to achieve a close shave with this razor. In the beginning it felt as if I was getting a close shave; however, after about 6 weeks I noticed the performance of the razor was not as it was when purchased. Great concept; however, I think I would rather stay with my 3 head razor.</li>
            <li> My husband is enjoying &amp;#34;getting to know&amp;#34; his new razor.  He has used twin edge plastic blades for decades, and is excited at this different approach.  Says that he&#x27;s not going back!</li>
            <li> Replaced an old Panasonic razor with this one. Stuck with the brand because they&#x27;re the best I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is a nice upgrade. I use it dry. Faster, smoother shave, and easier work. Important, because I shave my entire head with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped shy of 5 stars because the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as long as I expected - but that&#x27;s not to say it&#x27;s anemic. I get between 3 and 4 full-head shaves. Pretty good.</li>
            <li> My husband has told me multiple times that he loves this electric shaver. He said its the best he&#x27;s ever had. He uses it on his face, neck and head. He said it takes him 20-25 do get shave all three. Little to no irritation (he uses it dry). He said the nicest feature it has is the cleaning process. Easy to remove the head/guard and rinse with water and in 20 seconds or less its completely clean.</li>
            <li> This is a quality razor...all you have to do is look at the ratings for all electric razors...the question is where can you get the best price...for me the answer was Amazon where I found the best price!</li>
            <li> I have worn a short cropped full beard and mustache for 40 years. When I needed a replacement razor, I had a few requirements: I wanted a close, comfortable shave, a precise cutting line, cordless ability, and some cleaning convenience. This razor hits all my requirements to a high degree. I like the easy cleaning and the smooth skin feel it leaves behind. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the placement of the trimmer makes it difficult to see where the trimmer touches down to the skin. This would be fine if used only for sideburns, but not so good to make a clean continuous line defining the neck beard. Luckily, the main shaver head actually does a good job there!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been disappointed with these shavers and have bought Panasonics a few times.  This one shaves very quickly and smoothly.  They had 4 or even 5 blade models available too, but the cost difference didn&#x27;t make sense to me.</li>
            <li> After years of being a blade shaver, I thought I&#x27;d try an electric. I did my homework and this one seemed the best for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it once in the shower, but wet shaving isn&#x27;t for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a couple of areas that the hair grows rather fast, so I shave with a razor once a week as electrics aren&#x27;t the best for longer hair and do the clean up with this the rest of the week. It cleans easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;d never be without it. I can do a quick clean up before going out or before bed and it works great. Has a great trimmer also.</li>
            <li> Cleaning is easy. Shaving is good as long as your skin gets accustomed to it and you shave according to the direction your hair grows in. Basic up and down strokes may not work to give you a close shave.</li>
            <li> I had an older model Panasonic for 4-5 years and it still got the job done. I ended up buying this shaver because I lost my old one, not because it stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver works so much better than my older one! It does not irritate my skin at all and it gets very close. Charge lasts a long time and this thing has not disappointed at all! Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This replaced an earlier model of the same shaver that I was very happy with. This one shaves as well, but is much quieter. I like the readout of % battery left.</li>
            <li> VERY happy with this purchase.  Shaves the closest of any I&#x27;ve ever used, is light, sturdy, cuts through my tough beard, etc.  And is quiet.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> GIVES A CLOSE CUT AND LOOKING FOR MORE TO CUT</li>
            <li> Product arrived very promptly and as described. Very happy with vendor.</li>
            <li> I have been using Panasonic Wet/Dry shavers for last 14 years and this is the 4th and the best I ever had.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this shaver for last one year and nothing really to complain about.&lt;br /&gt;It worked well for me from the day one with a very smooth shave. I was very surprised as in the past&lt;br /&gt;they at least took me 2 weeks before settled in.&lt;br /&gt;If anyone is really looking for a criticism, the only thing I can say is it is easy to hit the off button inadvertently and turn the shaver off in the middle of the shave but it is not a big deal at all.&lt;br /&gt;In the past I used the shaving cream but with the shavers but there is no need. It just does a great job on a wet face!!!</li>
            <li> I have been a blade and shaving cream shaver for most of my life. I got tired of the cost of blades and the occasional unavoidable nick on my face. After the last time I forgot to remove the little piece of tissue from my last facial nick before leaving the house I decided it was time to go electric. I had used a Norelco, a Braun (lower end) and a Remington for brief periods previously. This Panasonic is fabulous and far superior to any of the electrics I had used briefly in the past.  It feels substantial yet comfortable in your hand. It gives a good, clean, close shave. The noise level is on the lower end of what you can expect from any electric razor. The charge lasts for 8-10 days (3-4 minutes/shave); this is fabulous. I took on a week trip to California and didn&#x27;t even consider taking the charger. The display is exactly what you need (% charge left; charging; when shaver needs to be cleaned). I haven&#x27;t used it wet or with shaving cream, so I cannot comment on performance in that scenario; but I suspect it would be superb. As one would expect with a wet-dry razor, it will not function when plugged in.  (DUH ... do you want to have the chance of electrocution ... ?)&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this razor for a close, comfortable shave at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have had it over a year holding up nice.I found myself using it in the shower more than I would have thought .if my shaver broke today I would probably buy another one</li>
            <li> Shaves decently, however, if the battery dies you can plug it in and use it to finish your shave, and, the display became useless after about a month, so I don&#x27;t know when the battery is going to die. I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> absolutely the greatest razor I ever had.</li>
            <li> It does a good job overall, but it&#x27;s definitely not a viable option for someone with sharp angles in their face/neck. I have a large Adams apple, and I can&#x27;t get this to cut those hairs at all unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Just like every electric shaver ever. Takes hours to mow. Signed up for dollar shave club.</li>
            <li> just what I wanted for a great price</li>
            <li> very impressed with panasonic in general, and this one gets it right.  the motor vibrates the head perfectly and the pivoting head is just the right tension for moving along angles.  very good feel in the hand, and easy to wash/rinse.  haven&#x27;t tried a wet shave yet, but will soon in the shower...</li>
            <li> Close shave and battery last over a week! Love it!</li>
            <li> Super!  High quality!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this electric shaver. Definitely a great upgrade from cheap electric shavers without spending hundreds on the top models. Cleans easily, charges in about an hour and battery lasts for about a 8 to 10 shaves. Wet and Dry shaving a real plus, and so is the trimmer. Nice looking shaver as well.</li>
            <li> After shaving for most all of my life with blades, this is a pleasant change. On some parts of my face, this electric shaves closer than a blade. It does take a few passes to accomplish that, but that&#x27;s OK. Overall, the shave is fine. I shave and go to work, and would shave before going out for an evening and not worry about the quality of my shave.&lt;br /&gt; Clean up is easy and battery life seems generous.&lt;br /&gt;I think that the Panasonic was worth the price paid.</li>
            <li> It works fine, so 4 stars is a little severe.. My criticisms are just that it&#x27;s not the closest shave in the world, and I&#x27;d really rather that it just plugged in rather than running off a battery, the battery is just something that will have to be replaced eventually, and I always use it where there&#x27;s a mirror (and places to plug it in), Most models do seem to be battery based now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, it works fine so far, quiet and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I really wonder if the coarseness or thickness of your beard affects how well foil shavers work for you. I haven&#x27;t tried a foil shaver in over 10 years for multiple reasons, but decided the technology must have improved - with the nanotech blades, the 3 heads, and the flex pivoting head. However after giving the Panasonic wet/dry a really fair shake, I still experienced the same problems I&#x27;ve always had with foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you like foil shavers, there are a lot of nice things to say about this one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It charges *fast* (about an hour)&lt;br /&gt;* Battery life is very good&lt;br /&gt;* The swivel head is great&lt;br /&gt;* Shaving in wet mode is a very nice feature (plus, you can rinse it in water, making cleaning easier)&lt;br /&gt;* The on/off switch locks in place. Many times while traveling, I&#x27;ve had shavers turn on in my bag, then its dead when i needed it&lt;br /&gt;* The pop-up trimmer is a nice feature&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, here are my complaints:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* In dry mode, it irritates my face pretty bad, pulls a lot&lt;br /&gt;* The first time I used it, I tried it at a right angle as per instructions. I tried for 10 minutes, took a break, another 10 minutes, took a break, etc ... almost 40 minutes later, it still wouldn&#x27;t get the tough spots. I gave up.&lt;br /&gt;* I tried this for almost 2 weeks, using a variety of techniques and angles. On average, found it takes over 20 minutes to do 80% of my face. will never get the last 20%&lt;br /&gt;* Wet mode is really cool, no pulling, no irritation, and works a lot faster (10 minutes). But it still left the last 20%, which I had to hit with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;* The pop-up trimmer is too small/narrow&lt;br /&gt;* Even if it worked, $80 seems a bit steep&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, the 3 rotary head shavers have always worked better for me. My 15-year old Norelco (similar to [[ASIN:B001AJ6YS2 this model - Norelco 7310]] does a superb job in 3-4 minutes. It cost about $50, has lasted this long with original parts. For days I want a stubble, I can do my entire face with my iStubble in under 90 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big vindication for this shaver is that my wife likes it for her legs, with no pulling or irritation. So I&#x27;m conflicted on how to rate it, but giving it 3-stars.tire face with my iStubble in under 90 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big vindication for this shaver is that my wife likes it for her legs, with no pulling or irritation. So I&#x27;m conflicted on how to rate it, but giving it 3-stars.</li>
            <li> Have tried this for a few weeks and I just can&#x27;t seem to get that close of a shave from it.  I&#x27;m used to a mach 3 razor (not electric) and I don&#x27;t think this is going to do it for me to make the jump to electric.  It&#x27;s a nice design though so maybe ok for those who do like electrics better.  Just not working for me as a traditional razor replacement</li>
            <li> My husband loves this razor!  He Would buy again!  He wishes that he would have tried this brand years ago!</li>
            <li> Just as good as advertised.</li>
            <li> After my old Braun gave up I decided to try this unit because of so many good things I read about it. I&#x27;m totally satisfied and would definitely recommend it to others. The price was right and the shave is much better than my old Braun.</li>
            <li> GOT TH IS FOR MY HUSBAND THAT IS RETIRED AND H ATES TO SHAVE EVERY DAY.  HE LOVES THIS RAZOR SAYS IT SHAVES HIM CLOSER THAN ANY OTHER ELECTRIC SHAVER I HAVE PURCHASED FOR HIM IN THE PAST.  UNLIKE ROTATING BLADES THAT PULL OUT THE HAIRS ON HIS FACE, THIS HAS A SMOOTH SHAVING EXPERIENCE FOR HIM.  HOLDS THE CHARGE PRETTY GOOD TOO.</li>
            <li> Works great ,tho I found it cut closer dry rather then in shower.No nicks, pulling or pain. Have had it for a few months. Easy to clean under tap.So far, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Best shaver I ever have.</li>
            <li> Great product! Works perfect!</li>
            <li> A great razor for the price. I usually shave once a week, so it does take awhile to get a smooth shave. Cleans easily and has pivoting head. I heard the foil is better if you don&#x27;t shave often. You can also shave with shaving cream if you want. Stays charged for a long time and has a handy trimmer. I read an independent review that said this was the best shaver under $100.</li>
            <li> Gives a very clean shave. Cuts even hard to get neck hair. Would recommend to anyone looking for a moderately priced electric shaver. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. The feedback of others is what sold me on buying this razor. Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I usually shave with a manual double-edged razor. However, I purchased this electronic shaver for the days where I do not have adequate time to wash my face, lather, and manually shave ....and for those lazy days when I just don&#x27;t feel like shaving manually. For the price it is a good razor. Compared to a double-edged razor this electronic razor does not give as close a shave, but which electronic razor does? A fully charged unit will last you between 1-2 weeks. Overall, a solid unit that has become my go to shaver when I need to leave the house quick while looking professional.</li>
            <li> I love this model. It&#x27;s fit my face and clean any part of my face. It&#x27;s very comfortable when you use it.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for a lady! The female razors didn&#x27;t have very good reviews so I bought this for a lady to use on her legs and she says it is MUCH better than any of her other more expensive razors she&#x27;s used over the years. Product arrived on time and undamaged.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this shaver despite all the good reviews unless you have a very very small and thin amount of facial/body hair to shave off. This shaver cannot shave thicker hairs. It does have a pop out trimmer for thicker hairs, but it is very cheap and it irritates the skin when using. The trimmer option does not do a good job unless you&#x27;re ready to spend a serious amount of time using it. The trimmer does not have a good locking mechanism so it constantly keeps folding back onto the device when trimming. If you&#x27;re going to be shaving on a daily basis and do not grow thick facial hair as I do, this product is for you. It personally did not meet my needs.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric razor I have ever used or owned.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I never had one before but I have no complaints about this one.  It&#x27;s easy to use, holds a charge well, and gives a good shave.  You can even use it in the shower.  I used to dread shaving.  It was just about the worst thing to do.  Now I don&#x27;t mind, shave nearly everyday, and have even starting shaving on my days off because this things is so quick and easy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little hesitant to try electric due to the high purchase price.  But I&#x27;ve been using mine almost everyday for 8 months now and the razor still feels great.  And even if I bought new blades once a year (I think about $70) it would be cheaper than a year&#x27;s worth of Gilette razor cartridges ($3 per week X 50 weeks &#x3D; $150).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a super coarse or fast growing beard.  I used to usually get away with shaving every other day at work.  But now that I have this electric razor I shave everyday.  It&#x27;s just so easy.  If I shave in the shower or right after than I don&#x27;t even need any pre-shave product.  If I&#x27;m shaving dry than I use some LecrticShave stuff and the razor does well with this application as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to know, Panasonic mentions in the owners manual that your face will take up to a month to get used to this razor.  I think this is pretty true.  I didn&#x27;t like the feel too much for the first week but then after about two weeks it started feeling great.  No looking back since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really I think the only thing I could have better for me is that I share my medicine cabinet with 3 roommates so I don&#x27;t have much room.  It&#x27;s very hard to store this razor vertically because there are no flat sides.  So I have to balance it in the corner of the cabinet and keep some other things next to it to keep it standing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelcos for years to shave both my face and head. However, over time I&#x27;d become dissatisfied with the quality of the shave and high price of replacement heads. Finally, after lots of research on all current electric options I decided on the Panasonic ES-LT41-K due to its reviews, price and features.&lt;br /&gt;Now, after a month of use I&#x27;ve come to really like this razor for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Shaves much closer than any of the Norelcos I&#x27;d used previously, much less skin irritation, quick recharge time, very easy to clean, helpful % of charge remaining indicator, selectable floating or locked shave head, wet/dry shave option and lockable power button (I don&#x27;t use the integral trimmer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Louder than any of my Norelcos, battery life could be just a bit more for my needs (barely a week, but remember I shave both face and head which takes considerably longer and so uses more battery charge), requires multiple passes for the closest shave. All of these are pretty minor and don&#x27;t detract from my 5-star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave does seem slightly closer when using gel but I&#x27;ve discovered I can get almost as close a shave if I dry-shave immediately after showering.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Surprisingly close shave for an electric, I can think of no reason not to recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Ordered on 9/16/12 and received on 9/24.  After coming off using a Norelco Rotary for over 10 years, I thought it was time for a change.  I chose the Panasonic shaver because of the favorable write-ups.  I also have many Panasonic products in my home and have had excellent service from them.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver performs as advertised with no problem.  The instructions says to try it for 30 days to adjust to getting use it.  I use Williams Lectric Pre-Shave.  I haven&#x27;t tried other shaving methods yet and will report back if any problem arrives.</li>
            <li> Shave it clean. Cheek. The price is very affordable, easy to use. Can be wet or dry washed. Easy to carry.</li>
            <li> Great shaver. Good value for money. Would recommend to people with thin to medium facial hair, as it gives a close shave after a few strokes.</li>
            <li> I have been using Panasonic shavers for many years, and liked them. I always thought I can only get them in Japan or in airports&#x27; duty-free shops. When I browsed Amazon, I was surprised to see them -- and the price was much lower than that in Japan! Love it.</li>
            <li> I would love to give this a 5th star, but it just has one flaw, which i&#x27;ll get to shortly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say it earns the rest and then some, it is extremely quiet.  I&#x27;d say on the order of 30% the volume of my old Norelco titanium 3 and 4s.  And it shaves WAY closer than them too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to shave for work since the chief has a no facial hair except mustaches policy, but it makes me look like one of those 70&#x27;s cop movies if I grow just a mustache so it all has to go.  I HATE shaving, I hate wet, dry, electric and razor shaving, period.  Electric shavers were the least reprehensible way I had found to do the deed.  I tried rotary and they pulled too much, then foils seemed better, but not much.  I was getting tied of my old 10+year old Norelcos and wanted to give this a shot, since it had so many good reviews.  Boy am I happy I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said not only is this so much quieter, but I get as good a shave as a razor, but without the razor burn.  (hence why I only shave with a razor MAYBE twice a year, sometimes not even once).  I even ran the razor over my cheek dry after I used this and it came up with nothing.  I never liked wet razor shaving and found the best was dry, and even though this shaver says it can do wet, I haven&#x27;t tried it, nor I plan on trying it.  It&#x27;s not broke, so I&#x27;m not messing with what works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the only reason it is not getting a 5th star is because it doesn&#x27;t work as a corded shaver.  You plug it in while shaving and, boop, off it goes into charge mode.  I like to use corded ones, since you don&#x27;t have to rely on batteries and their pathetic life spans.  My old Norelcos are 10+ years old, and their batteries are shot, but they still work if plugged in and you don&#x27;t have to throw  them away.  So that is the only problem I see with this.  For the price of it and the replacement foils/blades, I&#x27;d rather not buy another $80 shaver in 3-4 years because someone forgot how to make it work while its plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So other than my frugal cheapskate side taking one star off It&#x27;s a great shaver and deserves all the 4 &amp; 5 star ratings.</li>
            <li> This by far has been the best shaver i have owned thus far. It easy to use, clean, and maintain. the charge last a long time, and the blades are adequately sharp after many uses. The only thing that this shaver does not come with is a case which would be nice to use if you travel.  The only thing I do not like is the pop up trimmer. The blades are too sharp and its hard to trim because of the angle of the trimmer. its very difficult to trim using that option.</li>
            <li> I used this for a year.  It&#x27;s the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned.  Love it.  Bought 2 more of them for Christmas -- one for each of my sons.  They LOVE them too.</li>
            <li> Time will tell, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the readout to know how much charge is left, so I don&#x27;t have to guess (even though it displays in hundredths, it&#x27;s only accurate to tenths - 100%, 90%, 80%, etc.).  I also love the button lock feature, so when I travel it doesn&#x27;t accidentally turn itself on in my luggage.</li>
            <li> Over the last 14 years I have owned four electric shavers, starting with Norelco, Braun and Panasonic.  Of all the Panasonic lasted the longest, in 2005 I got a ES8077 for Christmas and after a few foil and head replacements, it still worked great, eventually though it started showing it&#x27;s wear and battery life diminished, the flip out trimmer broke and it was time for a replacement.  The ES8077 came with the cleaning station, while I used it faithfully for a few years, I soon stopped because I found the cleaning modules to be a costly expense.  I eventually just used hot soap and water to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The time soon came where I was thinking of getting a replacement, looked at them all, thought about Norelco, but I still felt pulled by the quality of my old Panasonic and felt out of all I used it gave me the best overall performance and shave.  Everyone is different, we have different hair types and coarseness, my neck hair has always been a problem, I never found a electric razor that does a better job over another.  So while searching for a replacement,  I knew I did not want to invest in one with a cleaning station and the ES-LT41-K appeared to be priced well and offered some improvements in design that looked like a good choice for me.  I felt the consumables (foils and screens) were a minimal expense based on my previous experience and seem to last quite long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some features I liked about the ES-LT41-K, the % of charge left LCD as well as notifying you to clean it is very nice as is the travel lock, as I do travel often and nothing more annoying then finding my shaver dead because the button got bumped by TSA or in transit.  The overall feel and quality of the shaver is much improved over my ES8077, albeit it feels a little lighter but build quality is the same if not better.  As well the textured handle is nice providing a much better grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave performance, well to me, I have not seen a real improvement, even with my old dull foils in my ES8077, total shave time is not much better, of course I shave every morning and find myself passing over the same areas several times to get a clean shave.  I was hoping to reduce the shave time, but I really feel it&#x27;s as good as it can get even with using a regular razor and dealing with the cuts and razor bumps.  I do notice if I wait a few days and the beard growth is longer, it&#x27;s like butter and gives me a much cleaner shave.  I do not use any shave creams or shave in the shower, tried that and found myself doing touch up afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though I am happy with the shaver and feel it works well and is a good replacement for my older model, whether it will beat the record of 7 years is another question?ls in my ES8077, total shave time is not much better, of course I shave every morning and find myself passing over the same areas several times to get a clean shave.  I was hoping to reduce the shave time, but I really feel it&#x27;s as good as it can get even with using a regular razor and dealing with the cuts and razor bumps.

I do not use any shave creams or shave in the shower, tried that and found myself doing touch up afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though I am happy with the shaver and feel it works well and is a good replacement for my older model, whether it will beat the record of 7 years is another question?</li>
            <li> I had a Norelco and wanted to give Panasonic a try. Not a bad product, however I did not see any improvement in my shaving results when compared to my old Norelco. Actually, I&#x27;ll keep the Norelco and replace the heads when necessary.</li>
            <li> I thought that I would spend a little less this time and opted for the 3-blade, 13000 rpm over the 14000, 4-blade. I shave my head in the shower and this one does not do as good of a job at all. I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic shavers for many years and this is the first time I&#x27;ve noticed a less than perfect shave. I do like the LED panel that doesn&#x27;t try to give me too much information. The one reason I tried a different shaver was the ES 63 version got water into the display which made it useless. Panasonic replaced it and the second one did the exact same thing. The shave was great but quality control was not.</li>
            <li> This is the cleanest, closest shave that my husband has ever gotten.  His skin is pretty sensitive and he is prone to getting red spots from other razors, but this worked great.  His skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Takes about 30 days for beard to get used to electric shave but after that wow.  Great close shave.  Have to go over face multiple times but razor does a fantastic job giving a close shave. Down side is the battery doesn&#x27;t really last all that long.  I can get through about 3 to 4 shaves before I have to charge it again.  Other than that minor inconvenience this is an excellent razor. Blows away some of the more expensive razors out in the market.  This by far is the best bang for the buck!  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Shaver does a very good job and I would recommend it. It is easy to clean and recharges in about an hour. Update - real good while it lasted! Trouble is it did not last very long about 11 months! Just died with no warning and would not take a charge. I actually liked this thing when it worked. Going back to Norelco. Hope the rest of you have better luck.</li>
            <li> I normally use a disposable razor but this Panasonic 3-blade has made a big difference for me. While I still use a disposable razors I like having this one on hand as well. Being able to use this wet/dry shaver in the shower is something I was never able to do with other electric shavers I&#x27;ve owned, so its a new experience for me and a positive one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that you can use shaving cream with this razor is one advantage; even electric razors can nick your skin and I find that regardless of the shaver I am using (electric or disposable) I prefer to use shaving cream. Even with this shaver, as despite the foil screen over the blades shaving dry is still just too uncomfortable for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I travel overseas on occasion too so the dual 100-240v option is nice, and it comes with a travel case and a lock for the power switch for it to prevent it from accidentally turning on in your luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I have not used an electric shaver in a number of years prior to owning this one, I&#x27;m glad I got it. I don&#x27;t use it all the time, but it provides a close comfortable shave when I do use it wet.</li>
            <li> I love the convenience that an electric razor has to offer so much that I purchased a couple to keep one in the car so I can spruce up when I have a late appointment with a client. I have sampled a few different brands of razors over the years and decided that the Panasonic razors gave me the features, comfort and performance I was looking for. So if your looking to make the switch from blades, which are increasingly more expensive over time, this razor is among the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a blade guy for a long time, with an occasional electric thrown in.  I&#x27;ve used a screen type and rotary type in the past.  From my experience none of the ones I&#x27;ve used shave as close as a blade, and neither does this one.  But I didn&#x27;t think it would when I bought it.  I wanted a new electric because my other one died.  The only time I use it is when I don&#x27;t \\&quot;have\\&quot; to have a super close shave.  It doesn&#x27;t bother me to have stubble and look a little scraggly, the electric is easy just to keep it under control.  All that being said, this thing works really well.  It has a real sturdy, well built feel,and I really like being able to use it in the shower.  The lock is a nice feature because I will take it when I travel and I have had a razor turn on in the bag before.  The battery percentage readout is handy, not sure how accurate it is, but at least it puts me in the ballpark of when it will die. All in all it&#x27;s perfect for what I wanted! Very happy with it.  Only had it a couple weeks, only time will tell how it will hold up, but it feels like it should last a while.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Panasonic ES-LT41-K shaver after reading many positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I have used the shaver several times since I purchased it and have been very pleased with it.  You can use it with water/shaving cream or dry. I found it to give me a close shave and very easy to use and clean.&lt;br /&gt;I have a Braun shaver as well and find the Panasonic to be better and gives me a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic charges easily and holds the charge for several shaves.  There is a switch on the shaver to prevent it from turning on when it&#x27;s stored.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great purchase and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This seems like a quality product but I&#x27;m disappointed. I find it uncomfortably loud. Shaving near the ear makes me think I&#x27;ll damage my hearing. It shaves well, but my old Phillips with dull blades and a NiCad battery is faster.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S A VERY GOOD RAZOR. JUST WHAT I EXPECTED.</li>
            <li> This is my third Panasonic. My \\&quot;old\\&quot; one had served me well for five years or so and was in need of a new screen and blade. However in shopping around, I discovered the ES-LT41-K. It had a couple of features I liked - travel lock on off/on switch and digital readout on charge. So I ordered it and am quite pleased. Good shaves, and I know when the charge is running low.</li>
            <li> Seems to be very good quality.</li>
            <li> After my old Panasonic wet/dry shaver died I switched to a Sanyo.  BIG mistake.  It charged fast, but the on/off switch was for some insane reason placed exactly where my thumb normally rested on my Panasonic razor so I was frequently turning it off during shaving by mistake, causing the razor at that point to PULL out the whiskers, not cut them.  And then there was the noise.  I felt like I was shaving with a Cesna airplane engine.  So I bit the bullet and ordered this Panasonic shaver.  How wonderful to be back to a shaver that is QUIET, shaves close, and does what I expected from it.  I also like the battery life warning LCD feature.  I&#x27;ve found each shave so far uses 10% of the power, i.e., I started at 100%, was at 90% after shave one, 80% after shave two, etc.  At 50% I recharged it.  I&#x27;d been using a Gilette Fusion power razor and liked it fine except for the outrageous cost of replacement blades!  Crazy expensive!!!!!  Glad to have a Panasonic shaver back again.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Works for a couple of months.</li>
            <li> It is a little noisy, but it is one of the best razors I&#x27;ve ever had! it gives a Firm and deep shave, and is washable after shaving,</li>
            <li> This razor is a quality Panasonic product.  My previous Panasonic ES8065 lasted for 20 years so I thought this might be a good investment.  I had tried a Braun after the Panasonic but I was never happy with the performance of the Braun.  I ended up giving it to my son and reverting back to the ES8065.  When I researched the ES-LT41-K, I was a little afraid that the people that designed the ES8065 might have retired and not passed on the Panasonic tradition of quality, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I have owned the ES-LT41-K for almost a year and I am as pleased with it as the day I bought it.  It gives a close shave.  It takes a bit of work and moving against the grain, stretching the skin, but I can get a smooth and close shave with no razor-burn in 3-5 min.  It performs equally well against 3 day growth as it does against 1 day growth.  It is also easy to clean and quick to charge.  Overall this is a great product.  It needs recharging about once every 10 days with daily use.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a birthday gift for my fiance, and he loves it.  It does a great job for a quick dry shave, and it does an even closer shave as the wet option.  As far as I can tell, it stays charged for a while because he lost the charger for a few days, but it still worked.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me and tend to Amazon research products before you buy, this is a great, quality product, and I would put this up against the very expensive ones from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.</li>
            <li> Provides a closer, cleaner shave than my last electric.  Ability to clean under running water is great! Holds a charge as well as recharging quickly. Well balanced and comfortable to hold. (Just keep an eye on any females in the vicinity.  They will be borrowing it!)</li>
            <li> I really like the feel and ease of use.</li>
            <li> I have not used an electric razor for years, but this one is wonderful.  It holds a charge very well, is very easy to use, has a meter to show how much charge is left and has a nice head to contour around your face.  It can be used with shaving cream and I have done so and it works great.  I have found you don&#x27;t really need shaving cream though because it is so gentle.  Although the shave is not as close as a disposable or re-usable razor-you don&#x27;t have the re-current charges for blades.  If you think about it over time, this would save you a good amount of money if you are shaving once a day.  I do still use my regular razor, but only when I need a very close shave for professional purposes.  When I just want something fast and clean I will use this.  Electric shavers aren&#x27;t going to replace manual ones any time soon, but if you are looking for one, my experience over 6 weeks as far as the durability, battery life and shaving experience of this one are great.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is only the third electric razor I ever purchased and I&#x27;m 70 years old. It really work for me. I haven&#x27;t used the wet shave but I put a little electric pre-shave on my face and I&#x27;m ready to go. It&#x27;s soft on the face and does on heck of a job.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my Micro Screen 280. The MS was still working after 11 years, but the rubber cover came off the switch. This is much zippier and seem to cut much faster, but then I hand never replaced the foil or blade on my old razor. Love that you can clean it with water. Nice rubbery grips. Like the one hour charge. My old one took about 12 hours. I was skeptical about the value of the trimmer because of where it it located. The MS was better in that respect. Still, the trimmer cuts well and isn&#x27;t as awkward as I though it would be for trimming the neck hairs below my beard once a week. This seems positioned near the point of diminishing returns in the Panasonic line. Has all the most desirable features but doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg. I recommend getting the hard case if you are going to be traveling much. Well worth the minimal price. It only comes with a velvet bag.</li>
            <li> A great razor. Been using it for about a year now. Replaced the blades once for $30, although they were still going decent. I&#x27;ve dropped it multiple times from a good 4 feet and it thankfully didn&#x27;t break so its got some durability.</li>
            <li> I had another Panasonic shaver for 12 years which was no longer holding charge so decided to buy this product after reading good reviews about it. Compared to my old shaver the shaving experience has improved slightly for me. Number of times to go over the same area has reduced may be 1 or 2 to get a clean shave. After the shave skin does not feel as dry/beaten up as before. Charges in about 45 minutes which is better than the old shaver. Overall I think it is a good shaver for the price, which was key for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only quality which is poorer now compared to the side attachment for trimming. This used to work great on my old shaver it is almost useless now. That would be only pet peeve, hence not a 5 star.</li>
            <li> I have always used Norelco Rotary razors....but the last one I bought just was &amp;#34;cheapened&amp;#34; up and did not live up to what used to be &amp;#34;The best&amp;#34;, in my opinion! Beside that, done a lousy job on the ole stubble....This razor feels good in the hand and the motor is really strong sounding and it does a fabulous job doing what razors are supposed to do!!!!! This is my NEW FAVORITE razor!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought a Panasonic wet-dry electric shaver in 2000 and used it every day until this year when the battery would no longer hold a charge. It was so awesome I decided to stick to Panasonic. This looked like a good choice thanks to all the reviews. I am comparing this to my old shaver. It shaves amazingly smoothly and close. An extremely comfortable shave - it glides over my skin. The feel and closeness is much better than my old razor. (I shave dry - don&#x27;t want to waste water in the desert!) I could simply drop my old shaver into a charging cradle so it was always charged up. This has a cord which I have to plug in and unplug, however the battery lasts a couple of weeks with daily shaves so not too big a deal. The trimmer on this shaver is much worse than the old one. It&#x27;s at an odd angle so you can&#x27;t trim close to the skin to trim your neck or other parts that are too sensitive for a closer shave (i.e. armpits). This trimmer is meant for sideburns and nothing else. Scratches and scrapes if you try to get close to the skin. My old trimmer was at a 90 degree angle which was perfect. I guess they want you to buy a separate trimmer now.</li>
            <li> Panasonic 3 blade Razor.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best electric razor I have ever used and as a senior I have a few</li>
            <li> I like this razor.  The shaves aren&#x27;t as close as a blade, but it&#x27;s close enough for most purposes. My beard is totally white, and for me, this shave is quite satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Love it, best razor &amp; closest shave I have ever experienced (And I have had a few razors) Very nice.</li>
            <li> Have been using this Panasonic razor for 5 months now. I am happy with the way it cuts my beard. I had been purchasing cheap Remington foil razors, and after the last one started loosing the cutters every time I cleaned it (common problem with Remingtons), I decided to purchase a more expensive foil type electric razor. Settled on this Panasonic, ES-LT41-K Arc3, based on the positive reviews, ignoring the negative reviews. After 5 months, the foil is still intact and it all seems to be working as advertised. The shaving time in the manual is misleading. I can&#x27;t get a good shave in 5 minutes. Never have been able to, even with a safety razor. I need to work my skin and beard areas with the Panasonic, as I did with my past Remington razors. But, I can get a close shave, with work. Maybe takes 15 minutes. One plus over the cheap Remington, the cutoff beard pieces stay inside the Panasonic head, as opposed to flying all over the bathroom sink and vanity as they did with the Remingtons. Per another reviewer, I lock the moveable shaver head so that I have total control of it. Works better that way on my beard/face.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time Panasonic shaver user. I have the bigger more expensive model and it works fine but I was shocked how expensive the replacement head and blades were.  So for the same price almost I got this model for my trip and it worked fantastic. The head is smaller but it shaved close and held its charge for a couple of weeks, because of the smaller size and long battery life it made a perfect travel shaver for long trips.  And it&#x27;s compatible for charging in Europe.  5 stars for quality, long battery life and close shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m medium beard, daily shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I found that it was nearly impossible to dry shave against the grain with the Panasonic ES-LT41-k.&lt;br /&gt;So I tried a Braun 190s-1.  The Braun worked fine (and half the cost of the Panasonic).</li>
            <li> I had been using rotary shavers for years. I tried several and always had a lot of skin irritation. About three months ago I decided it was time to try something totally different. After quite a lot of research and looking at several brands and models, I settled on this one. I am very glad I did. I am consistently getting a closer, quicker shave than with any of the rotary shavers I used in the past, with none of the skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver charges quickly and the battery lasts a reasonably long time. I can go on a week long trip and not have to take the charger with me. Cleaning is quick and effortless.</li>
            <li> Replace a decade old Panasonic Electric Razor.  Worked as expected.  Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  My husband is finally able to get a clean shave with an electric razor.</li>
            <li> great razor...close smooth shaves....and fast</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic shavers for a long time. I just got this model after my previous one died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They all die on me after around 1.5 years (daily use + wet). It used to bother me a lot that are so unreliable since this is the only thing that I can use for shaving. But after a while I figured it out that this predictable unreliability is a good thing so now I get an extended warranty for 15-20 bucks and every 1-2 year it basically costs me 20$ to get a new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this is the only electric razor I can use (and I&#x27;ve tried several others) this is far from perfect. I can&#x27;t get a good shave in the neck area and I need to use a Gillete mach razor to finish that part but this combination gives me a very good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some guys really have trouble shaving and I&#x27;m one of them. My beard is thick and grows in all directions. I get cuts easily and shaving used to be a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend to give this razor a try. Try it both dry and wet and see what works for you.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver.  Had a Braun 7000 series that I liked but after 10 yrs but it was showingit&#x27;s age.  Panasonic works great though not noticibly faster than my Braun.  Being able to use it wet or with soap or shaving cream is great.  Love the feature where it reminds you when to clean.  Cleaning is easy - just put liquid soap on head and switch on ultrasonic mode.  Then rinse.  Much better than the Braun that has you buying cleaning fluid.  Also feels great in hand and is light.</li>
            <li> Purchased this shaver for my husband which was a replacement for a Remington.  Unsure of what brand to purchase and knowing the one he had was not the greatest, I relied on reviews for the decision making process.  I LOVE THIS SHAVER!  It gives him the closest shave I have ever seen an electric razor give him in the 30 years we have been together.  He had a Braun and Norelco prior to the Remington.  I cannot say enough about this product.  It does not tear up his neck or miss any whiskers, exceptionally quiet and holds the charge better than the last ones he has had.  Buy this and you will be happy.</li>
            <li> I have used a rotary electric for years but wanted to try a foil style.  This is perfect especially since it&#x27;s a wet - dry which I think is the best of both worlds.</li>
            <li> Shaves really nice and clean. Light weight, battery lasts well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I have to say i am very impressed with this shaver, i have used foil shavers before but the quality of the shaver is amazing. The shave is almost as close as it is with a regular razor without the razor burn. I use this for my face and head so it takes me about 10 minutes for a complete shave but the results are amazing. My previous shaver was a Norelcro much more expensive and not as well built. I would change the razor heads every 3 months so it was a big expense for me and on top it would cause ingrown hair and irritation all over. The only down fall with this shaver is the battery life i would use it about 3 times and the battery would be totally drained.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have used many different types and brands of electric razors.  Some have been more gimmicky than others and a few have been top performers.  The Panasonic ES-LT41-K Arc 3 Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver is a performer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver can be used wet or dry and that&#x27;s a matter of personal preference.  However, having tried it in both scenarios, I can say that it performs great in either setting.  It can even be used with shave foam or gel, but I tend not to with electric shavers unless they produce a small amount of lather.  Otherwise, it just gets messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging the Panasonic shaver is super quick, about an hour or a little longer.  If you are used to using a shaver while plugged in you&#x27;ll have to adjust to this one as it cannot be done. Not a big deal for me, just keep it charged and don&#x27;t run out of power one morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave was fairly close and I would rate it among the top tier of electric shavers in terms of closeness.  Irritation was minimal, but that will likely be a matter of your use.  Some people prefer foil, some people do not.  Do give this shaver and your skin time to adjust though.  You really have to use a shaver for a few weeks or longer, so do not give up in just a week.  They always get better.</li>
            <li> Clean shave from the start, and I have a heavy beard. Also easy to clean. Does not chafe giving a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> After years of having bad razors I finally found the one that works. I&#x27;ve owned this for over a year, never had any problems with it and the charge holds for at least two shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, look no further.</li>
            <li> I was a devotee of wet shaving for about 5 years, I had my badger brush and my Speick shave stick and my Alum block, etc.etc., and IMHO that really is the only way to get a really superlative, BBS (baby bottom smooth) shave. This electric, and I think all electrics, will never be able to do that. But whereas I spent 20-30 minutes, zen-like, pre-treating my face, shaving, post-treating my face, I can now shave in about 3 minutes and be done with it. Very, very convenient if you&#x27;re a busy person who needs to save some time in the morning. A couple more notes: 1) yes Virginia, it does take time to acclimate to an electric razor, about 3 weeks. Panasonic actually provided a little blurb in the box that says they will accept the razor back within 30 days if you&#x27;re not satisfied, and I got close to that deadline, but I am now hooked. You will get unimpressive shaves the first couple of weeks, but it does get better; 2) Williams Lectric Shave really is great stuff, our fathers and grandfathers were on to something. I do not use this razor in the shower, I shave dry and I think it works better. You don&#x27;t want your whiskers soft, you want them hard and bristly. So don&#x27;t necessarily buy this or any electric razor for its wet-dry capability. I splash on some Lectric shave, let it dry and then just shave in front of the mirror. I finish off with a good splash of Witch Hazel, a little Nivea aftershave balm and I&#x27;m good to go. All in all, I recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> Works well for already more than 2 years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various electric razors over the past 20 years or so. I&#x27;ve always stuck with the Norelco rotary razors, because I could never find a foil razor that would adequately cut the hair on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor seems vastly superior to all foils I&#x27;ve used previously. It cuts the hair on my neck without issue, and does it with less irritation to my skin than with the rotary. It does seem to take a few more passes to get all the hair (I&#x27;ve probably increased by shave time by about a minute), but the final result is very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I owned another Panasonic razor prior to this one which I used strictly for the pop-up trimmer. I bought this one with the thought that I was just going to use the trimmer as well, but was pleasantly surprised to find it very effective overall. In fact, a slight knock on the trimmer is that if you aren&#x27;t careful, it \\&quot;bites\\&quot;. It will actually grab the skin and gouge it. It requires a very delicate touch in sensitive areas. If you don&#x27;t use the trimmer, then this won&#x27;t be an issue for you.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use while healing from extensive cerical fusion surgery which severely limits my ability to move my neck.  I have no prior experience to go by but I have to admit i&#x27;m impressed.  As suggested, I&#x27;ve used this for 30 days and found it to be as smooth a shave as I got from my Gilette blade razor when I use it with wet lather and almost as smooth when I use it dry.  It cleans as easily as promised.  The only drawback I would point out, and it&#x27;s minor, is that I only get 7 or 8 shaves before the recharge indicator lights up.  And by the way, it charges in an hour or less.  Overall I&#x27;m quite happy.</li>
            <li> I used an older version of this shaver for 5 or 6 years and loved it. It still works well but I wanted all the newer features and lighter weight of this model. I&#x27;ve now used this one for a month and I like it even more than my old one. It meets all my expections and I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. Over the years I&#x27;ve used all the major brands and some were better than others, but this Panasonic stands head and  shoulders above all the others. It is simply the best.</li>
            <li> High quality shaver, but is maybe too good for my skin. If you do not have sensitive skin this may be the shaver for you.</li>
            <li> Product works great.  I don&#x27;t mind shaving as much anymore, quick and easy.</li>
            <li> First I would say The only bad reviews are the ones that compare razors with blades.  It is like comparing apples to oranges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, this is a Great shaver.  One charge will last up to 2 weeks, so I can go a trip without take the charger.  Soap and water will clean this razor, no need for chemicals.  Skip the daily cleaning ones, I can&#x27;t tell the difference between a razor that was just cleaned and one that has not been cleaned for a week. It tells you how much charge you have left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply a great razor!!!</li>
            <li> great, thanks very much.</li>
            <li> This is easily the best electric razor I have ever used.  I liked mine so much I bought the same one for my son.  He loves it.</li>
            <li> Much better than the Remington that it replaced.</li>
            <li> Purchased this Panasonic razor for my husband. He LOVES it. Panasonic is the only razor he&#x27;ll use!</li>
            <li> Someone recommended this Panasonic Razer. Love it - even with 3 day growth. Cuts clean.</li>
            <li> Excellent shave.  Love it.!</li>
            <li> Works great - a good shave</li>
            <li> 20 + years using Braun shavers and tired of replacing them just cause the battery was shot. Thought I&#x27;d take a chance on a Panasonic and am delightfully pleased. Excellent shaves. Well designed, light and fits the hand, extremely easy to clean. Love the battery recharge meter and fast recharge. On/off lock also essential, as I heard it turn on first time I squeezed my suitcase shut! Will certainly buy another next time around.</li>
            <li> In 7 years of marriage this is the FIRST gift I&#x27;ve given him that he uses, loves and is truly grateful for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this Panasonic Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver.  It provides a smooth shave and is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Cut my shaving time in half. Charges very fast. Easy to clean. Light weight. What&#x27;s not to like.</li>
            <li> Mainly electric razor good. Good shave, low noise, long kept charging. A great advantage is the presence of wet shaving. From minuses can be noted - not an informative display. But for this price is all good!!!</li>
            <li> This is my fourth or fifth Panasonic razor - there just isn&#x27;t anything better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a high end Norelco rotating blade electric shaver for nearly ten years, which finally bit the dust...man,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad it did!  My son told me two years ago he ditched his Braun and his Norelco for a Panasonic model,&lt;br /&gt;and it was better than both of them.....so, I researched and found this Lt-141 had good reviews and bought one.&lt;br /&gt;It is MUCH better than the Norelco I had...cuts closer everywhere on my face, especially up under my nostrils, which&lt;br /&gt;has always been a problem for me.  I&#x27;ve also been able to quit using Lectric Shave.  I would recommend this shaver&lt;br /&gt;to anyone....but if your first, you need to get used to it, and expect to make multiple passes over areas.  I like&lt;br /&gt;living cut free!</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver. I get a close shave with no skin irritation even after the first use. I guess I have sensitive skin because I find Norelco rotary shavers way too irritating and while Braun shavers are not too irritating they are more difficult to get a close shave than with the Panasonic. I am very well pleased and the price was quite reasonable also.</li>
            <li> I am new to electric shavers, but this appears to be best rated for a reason. I just did my first dry shave and I am impressed. It was painless and reasonably fast, and almost perfectly smooth. I have very strong facial hair and and people were telling me that electric razors always irritate the skin, but this was really milder than the best razor I ever used. Cleaning was a breeze and delivery was faster than expected. So the first impression is five stars, but I will come back after a month of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: After a month of use, I am still very satisfied. It takes some patience to get used to going over same areas again and again for perfect smoothness, and doing the chin is really demanding. Still, the results are impressive and the best of all--there is no skin irritation *at all*. For the first time in my life, I am actually shaving every day. Plus, since it is cordless it can be used anywhere in the house, and it is perfectly mess-free. I should add that there are a two or three hairs on my neck that somehow always remain uncut, but I think that is because, as I said, I have very hard beard, and these are easily removed with the trimmer. I really like how it works and how easy it is to clean and handle.</li>
            <li> Read a lot of reviews and was torn between several brands. I settled on this since I did not like the idea of the cleaning fluids for the other razors.  As far as the shave goes its good but not great.  It&#x27;s very comfortable and leaves very little rash.  I do need to over areas multiple times, but I can shave every morning with it in 2 mins.  I shaved once with 5 days growth and it worked vey well.  Again, it took several passes.  Overal, I would highly recommend.  I have had it two months and use it close to daily. No complaints at all and good value for money</li>
            <li> Husband liked shaver.  We have tried others in the past and they worked so poorly that I haven&#x27;t bought one for him for years.  He says it takes a little getting use to.  Could maybe shave a little closer, but he likes it.</li>
            <li> This is my sons first razor, so I wanted something simple and with a good review. This fills the bill</li>
            <li> I used to have another well known electric razor by another manf with 3 rotary blades.  This one works much better providing a closer and more comfortable shave.  I&#x27;m sold on Panasonic&#x27;s razors now.</li>
            <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric razor. No cuts, no irritation, no pulling, no ingrown hairs. I have very sensitive skin and cannot use a razor blade or the circular style electric razors. This is a gem, I am so happy with it. Plus the lcd screen removes all of the guesswork as to when i will need to charge the shaver. I rate this 5-stars. Fully charged in only 1 hour!</li>
            <li> this Panasonic electric shaver which offered a shave no better than the cheap little Braun I use for traveling.  So I upgraded to the Panasonic ES-LA63-S for another $42.  Does it shave better than this ES-LT41-K?  Yes, but the difference is not significant. And one had better shave every 24 hours because if you skip a day, both electric razors are worthless.  You will have to use a straight razor.  I will say this without equivocation, my Schick disposable razors shave better than this razor AND the $120 Panasonic ES -LA63-S. If straight razors did not irritate my neck, I would never bother with these electric shavers.</li>
            <li> My opinion is that this razor does not give as good of a shave as a Braun. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be as fast. The shave is OK, but takes longer than I am used to. The battery seems to last about 15 shaves.</li>
            <li> Short charge time. You can use this in the shower and with shaving cream. Even as a dry shaver it does a great job.</li>
            <li> This thing really gets down to the skin and you don&#x27;t even feel it and won&#x27;t get a cut.  For the clean cut look this is a must.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shaver I have ever had and I have gone through a few as I am 63. The shave on my tough chin whiskers is fast and clean. My sensitive neck area is never irritated. I never achieved a good neck shave with an electric before - always had to get out the Gillette for that. No more! The clean up is so easy - hold under water flow - no messy mini brush. The charge state indicator is also very handy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks now, mostly once a day. I switched over from proglide 5 razor shaving as it was tearing up my neck hoping for a convenient solution. This product was not the solution. I have to go every which way about 20 times to get 80% of the hairs, 20 % do not come out no matter what I do unless I resort to my old razor and that simply isn&#x27;t good enough. It just completely fails at getting any hair that isn&#x27;t perfectly set up for it to grab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be trying it for 1 more week before attempting to return it.</li>
            <li> Had many razors over many decades, this one really is the best one yet and delivers a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Really nice razor for the price. It cuts close and works well. Very little razor burn. It holds a charge for a very long time, and charges fairly quickly. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Having used Norelco shavers for 40 years, I felt ready to try something else. I don&#x27;t want to spend a fortune, just want a simple, reliable, portable, easy-to-clean shaver that gives me a close shave without burning. I like the compact feel of the ES-LT41-K, and love being able to rinse it out. The travel lock switch is a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to get used to the high-pitched whine, simply unfamiliar to someone who&#x27;s used Norelco so long, I guess.</li>
            <li> Put up with an old Norelco for years assuming that they all worked poorly.  Thankfully it finally gave up the ghost and I purchased the Panasonic. Much, much better shave.</li>
            <li> My last electric shaver was the noreclo one with the goo.  Remember those commercials.  That one I thought was a better shaver.  This one is a good shaver but the stubborn neck hairs (under the side of your jaw) it doesn&#x27;t always get them all so I have to finish with my disposable razor.  Other than that it is a good fast shaver.  Easy to clean, and battery last pretty good.  I have owned it about month and half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Eric</li>
            <li> I am 55 and have used a blade most of my life.  I used a top of the line Braun shaver for a couple of years and then tried a high-end Norelco for the past year.  With those shavers as a reference my expectations were not very high.  Boy was I surprised!  This thing shaves darn near as close as a blade.  In fact, I really can&#x27;t tell the difference.  I haven&#x27;t even tried a wet shave yet and other reviews indicate it shaves even closer wet.  With the Braun and Norelco my practice was to let my face rest over the weekend, shave with a blade on Monday, then use the shaver the rest of the week.  With the Panasonic, I don&#x27;t have to let my face rest on the weekend, but if I do I don&#x27;t have to use a blade on Monday.  This thing deals with the three-day stubble just fine, including my neck.  Only real gripe, as others have said, it should have a stand.  You don&#x27;t want to just leave it lying on the counter to dry after cleaning.  I just kept the stand from the Norelco and it fits well enough, but I still have to lay it on the counter to charge once a week.  Botton line:  This will give you an exceptional shave and that this price, I can easily overlook the lack of a stand.</li>
            <li> I love Panasonic shavers, but I was a little disappointed with this product.  I love the travel lock, but it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as my previous Panasonic model.  How can newer models perform worse?  This review is based on a few weeks of use, but perhaps my face must &amp;#34;adjust&amp;#34; to the new Panasonic model?</li>
            <li> I have a shaving allergy so I have to use an electric shaver. I would wax, but living in tropical climate, I&#x27;m in shorts all the time, and I hate having to wait for my hair to grow long before I can wax again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using the Panasonic wet/dry shaver for women and I hated it. It never got a close shave, and would scratch up my legs even with a new foil. I switched to this after the reading the reviews. Sure, I wish I could the $200-$300 shavers, but&#x27;s that a pretty ridiculous price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Mom was always skeptical about these shavers and never thought you could get a close shave. Well you can with this! I had her feel my legs and she was shocked that I didn&#x27;t use a razor. If you shave with this everyday, you&#x27;ll get a really close shave. If you shave every other day, you may have to make more passes just to get the close shave. But like I said, I&#x27;m always in shorts and therefore I shave every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it helps, I exfoliate every other day before shaving, and I use it in the shower. I can&#x27;t speak for dry shaving with this. I highly recommend this shaver!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product to own if you find yourself trimming everyday. The arc&#x27;d blades make trimming shorter hair very easy. The head itself can rotate in all directions which will help those with the uneven bone structures. The included travel switch seemed useful at first but I don&#x27;t find it all that worthwhile (Doesn&#x27;t make it any less of an awesome shaver though!). It&#x27;s just a switch you flip to lock the power button.</li>
            <li> I was always a Remington user but I had my whiskers pulled for the LAST TIME.&lt;br /&gt;No more Remington for me, thanks.&lt;br /&gt;This Panasonic does not pull my hair, is much less noisy, cuts with fewer strokes, and is just more enjoyable to use than my previous razors.&lt;br /&gt;The pop-out trimmer on this razor is average (doesn&#x27;t seem very powerful/sharp) and seems small to me. The Remingtons I used had better trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;Supposedly, you can go a year without changing the foil and blade on this razor. I&#x27;m guessing more like 8-10 months.&lt;br /&gt;All that being said, I would certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li> This electronic shaver is not very good. It is light and sleek. However, it leaves patches of hair unshaven. Equally bad, when I shave up to my sideburn edge, it leaves an uneven edge on one side for some bizarre reason. I ended up being the more expensive Braun, which had none of these problems. Major disappointment.</li>
            <li> I use this in the shower and then follow up with a blade razor for the best shave ever.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my boyfriend and he told me he didn&#x27;t like  it really didn&#x27;t shave well</li>
            <li> Best shave I have had in 50+ years.  Fantastic wet shave with gel.  Wish I had bought this years ago.</li>
            <li> Nice razor, great for traveling</li>
            <li> I had hoped for a closer shave. Spent more to get this razor and having second thoughts.</li>
            <li> Exceeded my expectations</li>
            <li> This is a well constructed unit that shaves well but not as close as the Remington MS2-390.  It is very easy to clean using the procedure outlined in the manual.  The cleaning notification does not come on very often though.</li>
            <li> This does the job and works perfectly.  I am very happy with this razor and Panasonic.  They have the best electric razors.</li>
            <li> Quite possibly one of the worst shaves of my life... I can&#x27;t comprehend how this shaver has gotten as wonderful reviews as it has considering it just took me a solid 10 minutes to just do the left side of my face, and I only had to go over it about 50 times to get all the hairs! Amazing... no really. Failed at doing my neck completely, missed the majority of the hair on my cheeks.  Either I have some incredibly thick hair, which I don&#x27;t think is the case, or I&#x27;ve got a lemon.  Or this shaver is truly one of the worst shavers I&#x27;ve had the luck to come into contact with.</li>
            <li> It is too slow, it should have been,it will on April 10 to my home, but  today still no news.</li>
            <li> Great shave! Easy to use and clean. Quiet running and quick charge battery.  Cool running and performed much better than Norelco rotary shaver.</li>
            <li> I had only used Braun shavers for many years.  I  thought about Panasonic, but never made the switch.  Boy am I sorry now.  I could have been getting a great shave years ago.  I know that this shaver is not on the top tier but Amazon had such a good price that I thought I would try it.  It shaves close on my cheeks but so did my Braun.  The real problem area was my neck. This razor does a much better job on my neck than any of my Brauns ever did.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy an electric shaver after buying blades for years.  That&#x27;s just it though, I was sick of paying the price for good blades.  I finally pulled the trigger on the Arc 3 and glad I did.  Best shave I&#x27;ve had with an electric.  I&#x27;ve owned a couple electric shavers in the past, but they left my face irritated most of the time.  The Arc 3 is smooth and comfortable.  It&#x27;s also quite powerful, which is a bonus, because I&#x27;ve got thicker facial hair.  I&#x27;d recommend this shaver for anyone in the market.</li>
            <li> Great Battery life, close shave, waterproof, easy to clean, and minimal irritation. I usually charge this once or twice a week and keep it in my car to shave on my way to work. I have had it for 6 months so far and see no reduction in the battery life or shave quality. My wife has even asked to use it several times and she also loves the shave quality and ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the pop up trimmer on the back side. It is great for side burns, neck line, and other sensitive areas that need to be trimmed down slightly so that the foil shaver can be more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one down side with this shaver (as with almost any foil shaver) is that I frequently need to pass over an area several times to get all of the hairs. This is mostly just in areas with hair growing in different directions like the jaw line, neck, and Adam&#x27;s apple.</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for several months. It shaves very clean and fast. It also charges very fast and shows the percentage of remaining charge, which is very useful and convenient. I am 65 and I have had lot of shavers during my life, but I have never had such a nice one. I consider this charger absolutely perfect as I cannot fine a single fault in it and gladly give 5 stars to it. The price is also very good for such a nice device.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shaver. He was so happy when his other shaver died so he could purchase this one.</li>
            <li> Great razor for the money.</li>
            <li> This is a great shave. Works well on a few days growth too. A quick and comfortable shave. Charges quick and holds a long time. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> This is a nice shaver, I should point out that the razor only goes into a horezontal position, not the up right that I am used too. If you are mainly looking for the shaver and not the part in the back that comes up, then this should be good.</li>
            <li> First, let me say I work my electric shavers extremely hard as it must shave my face and head.&lt;br /&gt;I first had (2) Braun electric shavers ochancever a span of approx. 8 years, and each worked well.&lt;br /&gt;But, at a price of over $100 each, I decided I had to consider other options when my Braun wore&lt;br /&gt;out.  When that day came, I started shopping for a new shaver and stumbled upon a Panasonic on&lt;br /&gt;a clearance rack for CHEAP.  I took a chance on the bargain Panasonic and have never looked back.&lt;br /&gt;I find I prefer the wet/dry performance of the Panasonics.  Plus, the Panasonics are easy to clean with&lt;br /&gt;plain liquid soap and hot water.  After 5 years the time had come to replace my first Panasonic and did&lt;br /&gt;not hesitate to buy this model.  It performs as well as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this new purchase and highly recommend it. I think it shaves closer than any electric razor I&#x27;ve owned, with fewer passes. Also it holds its charge longer; and I appreciate the % charge indicator. This replaced a Braun model 340s-4.</li>
            <li> My husband says it&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given it 2 months and so far so good.  No problems.  I had the 8096 model for 8 years which I liked (it was 3 times the price even back then).  I do like the cleaning warning and I find it seems sharper after doing a cleaning - the higher pitched clicking sound of hairs being cut seems restored after cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for an electric shaver to be as good (or better) than a triple (or more) blade shaver, it&#x27;s just not possible.  One chooses an electric shaver for it&#x27;s advantages (and you get the disadvantages) over manual shaving.  Getting as close a shave is not one of the advantages.  You don&#x27;t buy a Camry and expect a Lexus, do you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advantages:&lt;br /&gt; - Faster than manual shaving.  Though the more you go over your face, the closer the shave will be.&lt;br /&gt; - No water or mess.  I can quick shave in 5 minutes at 5pm before going out.  With a manual shaver maybe I wouldn&#x27;t need to do this, but if I did I wouldn&#x27;t because of the hassle.&lt;br /&gt; - Over time, less costly than buying shaving cream and blades. And Band-Aids. :-)&lt;br /&gt; - Less to take with you traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;br /&gt; - Really just the opposites of the advantages.&lt;br /&gt; - The battery will eventually wear out.  It can be replaced if you&#x27;re so inclined.&lt;br /&gt; - The unit could fail causing this to be expensive over manual shaving.</li>
            <li> Got this for my dad. He has MS and has a hard time standing infront of the mirror and shaving so with this he can sit in his chair and shave. No mess, no cords, no standing and shaves close like a razor. He loves it.</li>
            <li> Well designed and constructed and recharges quickly. Lots of nice features but unfortunately does not shave as close as a much less expensive older Braun unit.</li>
            <li> This is my third Panasonic shaver.  By far the best wet and dry shaver out there.  My previous shavers stopped working/charging after 2 years, but what can you expect?  I shave in the shower and this really does the job.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely thrilled to own this razor.  It is the easiest and smoothest shave in years.  My beard has always been difficult and used a regular blade and shaving cream, this is better!!</li>
            <li> I had used a Norelco rotary for years. With my heavy beard, this Panasonic buzz-saw gets the job done IF I shave EVERY DAY, but misses a bit if I skip a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The number of shaves per charge decreases drastically if you have any kind of heavy growth.  My old Norelco packed in more shaves per charge, but I misplaced it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;added 10/10/2013:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t shaved for a few days, you will use about half the battery life and lots of time going over and over your face before you get a close shave, and that will come at the price of a few painful tugs at stubble.  This may work for a light beard, but not mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a charger to replace the one I lost for my Norelco rotary shaver, and went back to using it. This was an expensive lesson for me.</li>
            <li> Blades are much sharper than previous razor.&lt;br /&gt;I like the lock feature.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to charge faster than previous razor.</li>
            <li> This replaced another Panasonic model that gave up after 4+ years of use. Works very well - the fast motor makes shaving a 5 minute task. I have tried both dry and wet shaves (prefer the dry shave) and works well in both modes.</li>
            <li> This shave does what it says...wet or dry.  The only problem I have with it &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; is that it does not feel good on my upper lip.  It feels like it is trying to cut vines instead of hair.  When I use it with shaving cream, it is great overall.</li>
            <li> I bought the LT41-K as a gift for my dad after his previous panasonic razor finally crapped out. I stayed with panasonic as he really liked his last one and it last about 10 years. My dad has a tough beard, if he lets his beard grow for more than 4-5 days he usually need to use a buzzer before using his old panasonic electric or a regular razor to shave. After reading reviews on a bunch of different panasonic razors and looking for something between $70-$100 i decided on the LT41-K. He has used it a few times now and is extremely happy. He didn&#x27;t experience any pulling sensation on his beard and got a very close, clean shave. The razor charges quickly and is pretty quiet. I am sure there are better razors on the market but this is very impressive quality for the price. If this last model lasts 10 years, i am sure i will purchase another Panasonic razor to replace this one.</li>
            <li> This was quite a change from my old, worn-out, rotary shaver.  Yes, it takes some time to get used to; and yes it is very good if wet shaving.  Dry shaving performance is just ok.  I have a full beard so don&#x27;t have to shave much except my throat and small patches on my cheeks but it takes many passes (more than 10) to get the job done.  Each shave uses about 10% of the battery charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is a bit of a pain.  The debris accumulates in the head and it can&#x27;t just be shaken, or rinsed, out.  I usually have to dig out a considerable amount with a toothpick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m able to use the carrying case from my old shaver and don&#x27;t bother using the little bag that is supplied with this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, battery life is good enough and it recharges quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to do it again I&#x27;d probably try a different product.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Charges quickly.  Easy to use and to clean.  Good power.  Have only used dry, not wet.  Recommend for purchase.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaving for people with sensitive skin, as you can apply foam and soften your skin to reduce irritation. It can be washed, and cleaned well. Battery so far charges well, can hold for about a week, without recharging, for daily shavings.</li>
            <li> The new Panasonic Wet/Dry shaver works great in and out of the shower. The mesh can hurt a bit if you use dry and you have sensitive skin. Battery last quite a long time and will not disappoint.</li>
            <li> The Es-Lt41-K is everything that it is advertised. Works great in the shower and great the old fashion dry way. Easy to clean. Battery holds enough charge for 4 to 5 shaves before recharging. Delivery time from Amazon was only 2 days.</li>
            <li> My Braun 3 works much better and doesn&#x27;t nick me.  This product runs at an amazing speed and does give you a close shave, but it is not a smooth shave and if it catches your skin just right it can nick you.</li>
            <li> Product shipped fast and works very well. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is because although it shaves well I do have to go over the same area of my face a few times to get all the hairs. It is comfortable in my hands and I like how easy to clean it. I would recommend to purchase this shaver.</li>
