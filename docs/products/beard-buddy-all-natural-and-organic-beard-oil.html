            <li>Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Smelled great in the bottle but, once the nice smelling fragrance wore off, I was left with a pretty bad lingering smell that lasted for days, after several washes.  </li>

            <li>Keep it wild!</li>

            <li> I buy this for my hubbin.  I love it when he grows out his facial hair, but usually it&#x27;s very brittle and his skin gets so dry!  Not with Beard Buddy, though! He uses the beard wash and beard oil both.  No more face dandruff and less brittle and damaged beard hairs - which is nice if you&#x27;re on the receiving end of a kiss from someone with a beard.&lt;br /&gt;We got a 100% natural boar bristle brush, which he puts the Beard Buddy oil into before brushing through his beard, and it makes the beard so soft!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve not really noticed any scent from either the oil or the wash - well, there is one but it&#x27;s barely noticeable and has a kind of woodsy hint to it.</li>
            <li> I recently went for a haircut and a beard trim at a more hipster-oriented shop, and was educated about beard oil. I have had a beard for nearly 20 years but had never heard bothered. This one has a slight coconut smell that is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> bf likes it. he said &amp;#34;helps it straighten out a bit, keeps it from looking / feeling so dry &amp; it seems fuller&amp;#34; he brushes his hair after he gets out of the shower then works this through. he said his skin is not as dry &amp; he doesn&#x27;t &#x27;break out anymore&#x27;</li>
            <li> Has a great smell and works great to smooth out my beard!</li>
            <li> Keeps my husbands beard soft and yummy. Highly kissable.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Smell is decent and helps keep the beard tame.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a life saver for my beard.  I always had problems with dry flakey skin in my beard.  I just use this stuff once a week and it does wonders.  It also has a very good scent!  Totally the best beard oil out there and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using BB Beard Oil for a year now... Keeping my beard from getting weird. Has a nice subtle scent to it that seems to please all involved in my close encounters. Keep it coming.</li>
            <li> Awesome gifts for your hairy guys!!!  Always a go to for great products and accessories........the co-founder is a brillant  guy!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good enough oil, but I prefer something a little stronger in scent.</li>
            <li> I bought Beard Buddy last fall to treat my beard the way it deserves to be treated. It makes your beard smell like the wilderness which is great for the days your are stuck and work and unable to go be a man in the wild. It also leaves your beard smooth (which makes my girlfriend happy). Totally worth every penny! Keep it wild! Cheers!</li>
            <li> I bought this to try out, the co-founder Gareth Stehr is one of my favorite skateboarders and artists. He also has an epic beard. My girlfriend loved the scent, and the beard wash is also really good. (check it out, seriously)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company is really awesome, I back them! Plus they have an awesome summer playlist on soundcloud.</li>
            <li> Smells so good and makes my husband&#x27;s beard so soft!!</li>
            <li> Bought based on the Amazon reviews but it did very little to help control my longer beard.  Was expecting much more from a premium priced product...</li>
            <li> So, I received a sample as a joke from someone I work with. Unbeknownst to them, I actually tried it out. Beard Buddy left even my short beard soft and smelling awesome - like I spent a day working sandalwood. Bonus that my girl digs it. I&#x27;ve also noticed it acts like cat nip and my cats get crazy with my beard. It would seem all types of pussy - from tuxedo to Siamese - love it.</li>
            <li> From the high end to the low, I&#x27;ve shopped a lot of beard products and I can wholeheartedly say Beard Buddy is my absolute favorite. The deliciously fragrant blend of essential oils found in Beard Buddy are a pleasure to massage into my bearded face morning after morning.&lt;br /&gt;Still learning how to care for your new beard? Do yourself a favor and invest in some beard buddy, you&#x27;ll be looking, smelling, and feeling fresh in no time able to rest securely knowing you&#x27;ve taken the right measures to keep your beard from being weird!</li>
            <li> This is great. Highly recommend it.  It is pricey which led me to purchase another brand as I am getting low on my original bottle.  The cheaper beard oil product left me very dissatisfied after having beard buddy.  You can&#x27;t beat the smell of this product if you don&#x27;t want to smell like perfume.  I will bite the bullet and pay the extra amount for this brand.</li>
            <li> I never knew I needed this until I tried it. Moisturizes my face and beard very well leaning me feeling comfortable. The smell is great, too. It is quite calming. Seems that it will last a long time as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend uses Beard Buddy. It is great because when we make out - I don&#x27;t break out. Since they use only essential oils (vs synthetics) and bases like coconut oil it&#x27;s great for his beard &amp; skin and doesn&#x27;t create any reaction with mine. Love the scent, and the packaging.</li>
            <li> Smelled great in the bottle but, once the nice smelling fragrance wore off, I was left with a pretty bad lingering smell that lasted for days, after several washes.  The only words I can come up with to describe it was some strange mix of the scent of felt and bile.  I literally spent half a day thinking my baby son kept spitting up on his clothes before I realized it was my face. Maybe it&#x27;s just my body chemistry, I don&#x27;t know.  Three stars because my beard was noticeably softer but the smell just didn&#x27;t cut it for me.</li>
