            <li>Smells great and makes my hair nice and shiny.</li>
            <li>They just wouldn&#x27;t stick a sulfate in with the good for you oils like argan, grapeseed, etc.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is really good..</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo, and it arrived in a timely manner!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 3 months now , and the result is amazing  ;</li>
            <li>Mythic oil is amazing....</li>
            <li>leaves your hair oily, not the kind of silky</li>
            <li>I have very fine, yet medium thickness hair that I&#x27;m growing out.</li>
            <li>I work in a salon and this is one of the top selling shampoos across the board.  </li>
            <li>Just love it.</li>
            <li>I have definatley had better shampoos.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>love...</li>
            <li>love...</li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>the shampoo coupled with the conditioner is phenomenal</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>So I took a leap of faith, making what I thought was an educated assumption since there were so many healthy oils included.</li>
            <li>oh so lovely.</li>
            <li>if I don&#x27;t wash it so often and if I do I need a healthy and hearty shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Over priced, but a pretty good shampoo.</li>
            <li>Very good fragrance, applies easily and cleans my hair well but conditions it at the same time.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo has significantly helped reduce the frizz and my curls seem much more defined.</li>
            <li>also ordered the unisex leave-in oil from the same line and am greatly anticipating seeing the results of that.</li>
            <li>Wish it came in a larger container, but a great product.</li>
            <li>Contacted L&#x27;Oreal &amp; they had no clue if this shampoo was paraben or sulfate free.</li>
            <li>By the time I had washed it out my hair felt clean but not stripped.</li>
            <li>I was at a point where I figured that my hair would only look beautiful after a blow-out but the effects of the shampoo and conditioner are making me strongly consider going natural again.</li>
            <li>But both the shampoo and conditioner quickly emptied when I put it in the guest bathroom</li>
            <li>My ends still crunch a little, but that&#x27;s my own fault for having put so many highlights in forever ago.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has been okay so far.  </li>
            <li>Smells fabulous, leaves hair soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>said that, if your hair is fragile and thirsty this shampoo is most probably right for u.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and the same brand of conditioner.  </li>
            <li>and it creates a gentle lather, but I can feel the healthy oils as I rinse.it leaves no film on my hair, as I have used it the last two shampoos and my hair is straight and silky to the touch.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re hair feels dry or has static, try it.</li>
            <li>Expensive but worth the price for great hair.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see benefit</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Nourishing in a refreshing way, does not weight down my hair.</li>
            <li>It was without box but looks new !</li>
            <li>/&gt;It made my hair very shiny, soft and I can go two days without washing instead of having to wash every</li>
            <li>Well worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this shampoo in addition to the conditioner for a few days and am very satisfied with the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the product for a week, but so far I haven&#x27;t had to use conditioner with the shampoo because it is pretty gentle.</li>
            <li>I noticed how shiny her hair was looking and decided to try it on my fine, flat, short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like any other shampoo nothing special about it,</li>
            <li>soft silky hair</li>
            <li>I do not have a sensitive scalp but this product made me break out in hives.</li>
            <li>I began using it a week ago and was surprised that my scalp hurt after using it.</li>
            <li>Today, I developed a rash and hives.</li>
            <li>Since I only use salon professional products, I was very surprised to notice this.</li>
            <li>A few years of this left my hair with very dry ends, frizzy and much more prone to split ends and breakage.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize the bottle was only 8.5 oz because I didn&#x27;t read the product description clearly.  </li>
            <li>I guess the natural plant oils are essential and beneficial.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally wavy/curly hair which has always been highly complimented in the past</li>

            <li> I like this shampoo than any other.</li>

            <li> Since I cannot get this in any U.S. Store, I usually buy it online.</li>
            <li> it restores your hair and provides an unbelievable shine and brilliance....</li>
            <li> Since my hair is very thin and oily, before I use it I always wash my hair with a deep cleansing shampoo and then I  apply the Mythic Oil.</li>
            <li> I purchased via Amazon as the cost was a little less expensive even with my salon employee</li>
            <li> I lost at least 40 ml of the shampoo.</li>
            <li> It also became difficult to grow my hair past my shoulder blades as I needed to have the damaged ends cut</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t realize how expensive it was until I got it in the mail.  </li>
            <li> Useless product.</li>

            <li> L&#x27;oreal Paris did its job and made a great product. I use this with the conditioner and the mythic oil colour glow!</li>

But both the shampoo and conditioner quickly emptied when I put it in the guest bathroom so my family must have loved it.</li>
            <li> it works good on my hair! all this loreal line &amp;#34;mythic oil&amp;#34; nourishes hair and them looks great after this product.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, and it arrived in a timely manner!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this hair treatment and her hair is healthier and less split ends.</li>
            <li> My hairy were frizzy before using loreal . I have been using it for 3 months now , and the result is amazing  ; soft silky hair</li>
            <li> Great Shampoo.........I do not use anything else.  Well worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has been okay so far.  But I didn&#x27;t realize how expensive it was until I got it in the mail.  I didn&#x27;t realize the bottle was only 8.5 oz because I didn&#x27;t read the product description clearly.  Yikes!  Don&#x27;t think I can afford to buy this product again in the future. I&#x27;ve only used the product for a week, but so far I haven&#x27;t had to use conditioner with the shampoo because it is pretty gentle.</li>
            <li> I work in a salon and this is one of the top selling shampoos across the board.  I purchased via Amazon as the cost was a little less expensive even with my salon employee discount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair feeling wonderful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this shampoo in addition to the conditioner for a few days and am very satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally wavy/curly hair which has always been highly complimented in the past and I took great care to never over-process it. When I was laid off from my job 6 yrs ago however, I decided to only use box dyes instead of seeing my stylist for a color-retouch every 6 weeks. A few years of this left my hair with very dry ends, frizzy and much more prone to split ends and breakage. It also became difficult to grow my hair past my shoulder blades as I needed to have the damaged ends cut regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently began taking prenatal vitamins to help with the growth and have been routinely doing moisture treatments in addition to using protein infused leave-in sprays (Tiger). This shampoo has significantly helped reduce the frizz and my curls seem much more defined. My hair is ridiculously softer too - I have a much more difficult time resisting my natural compulsions to touch and play with my hair as a result. I also find that I do not need to use an after-shower product to help define the curls. I was at a point where I figured that my hair would only look beautiful after a blow-out but the effects of the shampoo and conditioner are making me strongly consider going natural again. My hair is looking lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also ordered the unisex leave-in oil from the same line and am greatly anticipating seeing the results of that.</li>
            <li> Very good fragrance, applies easily and cleans my hair well but conditions it at the same time.  Just love it.</li>

            <li> Wish it came in a larger container, but a great product. Smells great and makes my hair nice and shiny. I have long blonde hair, and it makes it feel weightless.</li>
            <li> Bottle was covered with a sticky residue like stickers had been removed</li>
            <li> I do not have a sensitive scalp but this product made me break out in hives. I began using it a week ago and was surprised that my scalp hurt after using it. I also noticed my hair felt like there was a wax coating building up on it. Since I only use salon professional products, I was very surprised to notice this. Yesterday, I began to feel itchy. Today, I developed a rash and hives.Even after I shampooed it out, my skin was burning. Just an FYI.</li>
            <li> did not like this product.  leaves your hair oily, not the kind of silky I wanted.  I have definatley had better shampoos.</li>
            <li> Over priced, but a pretty good shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  Too bad it isn&#x27;t easily available in the US.  But, the item arrived in great shape.</li>
            <li> Mythic oil is amazing.... love...love...love...love... this stuff... it restores your hair and provides an unbelievable shine and brilliance....the shampoo coupled with the conditioner is phenomenal</li>
            <li> Useless product. It&#x27;s like any other shampoo nothing special about it,</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. By the time I had washed it out my hair felt clean but not stripped. It was silky to the point of me thinking conditioner wasn&#x27;t necessary. I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait for this shampoo to come in the mail. Prior to my purchase, did my due diligence researching the product. Contacted L&#x27;Oreal &amp; they had no clue if this shampoo was paraben or sulfate free. They were going to research my question &amp; follow-up with me, but it&#x27;s been weeks now &amp; they never did. So I took a leap of faith, making what I thought was an educated assumption since there were so many healthy oils included. They just wouldn&#x27;t stick a sulfate in with the good for you oils like argan, grapeseed, etc. The reality - the 2nd ingredient is sodium laureth sulfate. I don&#x27;t get it. What a spoiler!</li>
            <li> My hair is base-colored and highlighted.  I love this shampoo and the same brand of conditioner.  It leaves my hair shiny, well-hydrated, and the scent is oh so lovely.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is really good.. it was delivered on time,but the bottle was not secured properly, hence there was a spill inside the box. I lost at least 40 ml of the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have very fine, yet medium thickness hair that I&#x27;m growing out. I&#x27;ve always washed my hair daily, but with having blonde on my ends I&#x27;m finding it&#x27;s healthier four my hair if I don&#x27;t wash it so often and if I do I need a healthy and hearty shampoo and conditioner. I&#x27;ve always used Aveda and Kiehls, but lately, probably with moving to the south, my hair has needed something different. I&#x27;ve even started putting Moroccan and argan oils in my conditioners.having said that, if your hair is fragile and thirsty this shampoo is most probably right for u. I use four pumps and it creates a gentle lather, but I can feel the healthy oils as I rinse.it leaves no film on my hair, as I have used it the last two shampoos and my hair is straight and silky to the touch. My ends still crunch a little, but that&#x27;s my own fault for having put so many highlights in forever ago. When they grow out my hair will be perfect and now I know I have a shampoo that I love</li>
