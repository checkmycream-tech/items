            <li>Loved this nude lipstick from MAC .</li>
            <li>I think I will order over and over again as I think I found my favorite color!</li>
            <li>its kind of a rip off.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s , creamy kind off matt</li>
            <li>It is high quality and it is the perfect match for her skin color.</li>
            <li>The color is actually more taupe than the picture (and the name suggests).</li>
            <li>I just LOVE MAC.  </li>
            <li>I love this lipstick</li>
            <li>I actually tried it on at the M.A.C store and it was perfect!</li>
            <li>I love this Mac lipstick Honeylove</li>
            <li>Love this lipstick</li>
            <li>More earthy nude.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous neutral color, that adds just a bit of color to the lips.</li>
            <li>For reference, I have a light olive complexion.</li>
            <li>great color, nude brown not so much pink</li>
            <li>Great with black liner and a sweet colored blush.</li>
            <li>But stays on good, doesn&#x27;t dry my lips out.</li>
            <li>I actually ordered 3 colors and each is amazing one</li>
            <li>the only downsider is it&#x27;s a bit light to my skin tone but love to wear it the MAC&#x27;S whirl lip liner &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s surprisingly creamy, but the color was not right for me.</li>
            <li>I did not know this would be a nude, i thought it would be more pink, luckily i am a nude lover</li>
            <li>Still nice but less flattering than I wanted.</li>
            <li>From the picture I expected it to be a bit more rosey pinkish color, but it turned out to be brown.</li>
            <li>I learned my lesson and I&#x27;ll be buying my mac cosmetics from a reasonable place(maccosmetics.com or nordstrom.com) where they keep the price as retailed...</li>
            <li>I think it is a must have color because it is very wearable and adds just a bit of color to your lips.</li>
            <li>Color is universal and very pretty.</li>
            <li>color is very light pink not for olive skin colors is not same what it look on computer.</li>
            <li>I was researching nude lipsticks for days on end, trying to find one that would look not too light or dark for my olive skin tone.</li>
            <li>It is a matte formula so the color is flat, however, that is easily fixed by applying lip balm either under or over it.</li>
            <li>so it stays on pretty well, a little drying</li>
            <li>I understand the sellers trying to make a profit but a 45% profit is a little much not including that if you get a mac pro-card they run for a bout 9-10 bucks witch is ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It is matte, but just creamy enough so it doesn&#x27;t dry and clump.</li>
            <li> So check online other color shots then come back &amp; buy</li>
            <li> Not as pink as in picture.</li>

            <li> When it comes to the price however, I would say get it in store for $15 without shipping or else it&#x27;s an over $20 lipstick and who doesn&#x27;t want to save a few bucks?</li>
            <li> It can be hard to tell color from a pic, so I guess I will stick to buying my lipstick in person.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with this product per say.</li>
            <li> I hate that mess!</li>
            <li> I received the MAC lipstick Honeylove, and was extremely disappointed.</li>

            <li> From the picture I expected it to be a bit more rosey pinkish color, but it turned out to be brown. It can be hard to tell color from a pic, so I guess I will stick to buying my lipstick in person.</li>
            <li> The color is actually more taupe than the picture (and the name suggests). Still nice but less flattering than I wanted.</li>
            <li> I received the MAC lipstick Honeylove, and was extremely disappointed. The color was a chalky almost white color. Truly horrendous and nothing like the color shown on the page. I sent it back immediately. I can&#x27;t think of any complexion it would flatter.</li>
            <li> I actually ordered 3 colors and each is amazing one I think I will order over and over again as I think I found my favorite color! The items arrived within the time frame!  Definitely recommend</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always hard to decide if the color you envision online will be flattering when you actually have the chance to try it.  In this case, it was not, and I didn&#x27;t like the texture of the lip color, either.</li>
            <li> I just LOVE MAC.  I found it to be the best make up and I have tried just about all of them (just about).  The color did not match the color I saw online but the name was the same.  No problem though because I blend so I made it work.  The texture and lasting color is what I like. It never flakes or turns sticky.  MAC is the best I have found to make my lips look naturally smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick it&#x27;s a mate finish so it stays on pretty well, a little drying but it is mate after all...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was good, but for this price? its kind of a rip off. Mac lipsticks re-tale for about $15 I understand the sellers trying to make a profit but a 45% profit is a little much not including that if you get a mac pro-card they run for a bout 9-10 bucks witch is ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion I learned my lesson and I&#x27;ll be buying my mac cosmetics from a reasonable place(maccosmetics.com or nordstrom.com) where they keep the price as retailed...</li>

            <li> great color, nude brown not so much pink</li>
            <li> I did not know this would be a nude, i thought it would be more pink, luckily i am a nude lover so i like it. The packaging was excellent.</li>
            <li> I love this Mac lipstick Honeylove</li>
            <li> Beautiful color. Anyone can wear. Great with black liner and a sweet colored blush. Put some philosophy over it for extra shine or wear as is. Color is universal and very pretty. Mac Attack!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with this product per say. It is a matte formula so the color is flat, however, that is easily fixed by applying lip balm either under or over it. It&#x27;s surprisingly creamy, but the color was not right for me. For reference, I have a light olive complexion.</li>
            <li> Love this lipstick it&#x27;s , creamy kind off matt the only downsider is it&#x27;s a bit light to my skin tone but love to wear it the MAC&#x27;S whirl lip liner &amp;#60;3</li>

            <li> color is very light pink not for olive skin colors is not same what it look on computer.</li>
            <li> I placed an order and they stated I would receive this item ny 2/15 which would have been great for me trip. Now Im off vacation and still havent received the item!!!</li>
            <li> Loved this nude lipstick from MAC . would definetly buy again!</li>
