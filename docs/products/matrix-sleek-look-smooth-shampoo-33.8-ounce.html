            <li>Shampoo reeked of plastic to the extent that we wound up not even being able to use it.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to worry about buying it more often.</li>
            <li>I have been using Sleek Look for almost 15 years and my hair always looks silky smooth.</li>

            <li>Leaves hair clean, soft and smooth looking</li>

            <li>The smoothing effect does not feel greasy and you don&#x27;t need that much product in the first place.</li>
            <li>it is gentle and doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering scent.</li>
            <li>I have been using Matrix Smooth and Sleek shampoo/conditioner for a long time.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, but it dried my hair out.</li>
            <li>and I keep coming back to it as it smells delightfully fresh and leave my hair silky but not flat.</li>

            <li> great for treated hair and curly hair</li>
            <li> This product works perfectly on my hair which is super fine but thick.  It definitely makes my hair look and feel sleek. A great price for this liter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Shampoo (teamed it with the matching conditioner) on and off for years and I keep coming back to it as it smells delightfully fresh and leave my hair silky but not flat.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying this shampoo.  I must say its wonderful.  I received several compliments about my hair the day that I used it.  I didn&#x27;t purchase the conditioner that pairs with it, instead I purchased another recommended leave in conditioner that works perfectly with it.  5 starts from me!</li>
            <li> Best Shampoo product out there.</li>
            <li> The product I ordered was not what I received</li>
            <li> Not quite sure if the problem is with the shampoo or I chose the wrong one&lt;br /&gt;It did not suit my hair. when I started using it I noticed a lot of hair fall, so I stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;My friend wanted to try it and was happy with it</li>

            <li> I love this product. But I paid the same for just this shampoo as I did for the duo. Next time I will just get the Duo.</li>
            <li> this product delivers, honestly haven&#x27;t had any shampoo that i really liked other then neutrogena, pantenne that i thought delivered. After using this one...it changed my mind. pull every bit of residue off of the hair and leaves it clean and smelling fresh...high recommendations for this on</li>

            <li> Shampoo reeked of plastic to the extent that we wound up not even being able to use it. Smelled as if it had been stored for a while in a non temperature moderated environment and then shipped</li>
            <li> I have been using Matrix for years now and it&#x27;s the best&lt;br /&gt;for the price.  Leaves hair clean, soft and smooth looking</li>
            <li> This has made my hair its softest and smoothest for the past several years.  I don&#x27;t even want to look for something &amp;#34;better.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> been using for years. it is gentle and doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering scent.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this shampoo. It&#x27;s is a big bottle so I don&#x27;t have to worry about buying it more often.</li>
            <li> There are more expensive shampoos out there, and we do like the quality of this brand and item, but it is a bit pricey.</li>
