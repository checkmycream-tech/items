            <li>Granted, you may need frequent reapplications, but for the price, I&#x27;d say it serves well.</li>

            <li> /&gt;The only reason I give it 4 and not 5 stars is out of pure frustration that I have lost the past 5 of these I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>

            <li> Provides my eyes with moisture relief when I&#x27;m wearing contacts for a few hours</li>
            <li> I usually keep one in my bag and one around the house.</li>
            <li> Really small</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad too because the packaging is adorbs and I payed a lot.</li>

            <li> super cute. thank you so much for the sweet gift!</li>
            <li> These arrived before the estimated delivery date even with standard shipping. I used these with my circle lens to prevent them from drying out/causing eye irritation, and they worked great! By using these every so often, I was able to wear my contacts for hours for my three day convention. They are gentle and small enough to take with you during the day.</li>
            <li> really helpful for my eyes</li>
            <li> Favorite eye drop ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰ love it! Packaging is so cute too.... Wish they sold these in the drugstores</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cute! Love it!</li>
            <li> very cute eye drop. easy to bring and put it in the purse. feel cool and watering when I drop it. I like it.</li>
            <li> I did use it while I had my contacts on. My eyes get very very dry, but this helps with that. I did find myself using it a few times when I&#x27;m wearing my contacts. My eyes still gets red, but at least I can bare it without the feeling of dryness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used these as I wear contact lenses every day. They provide fast relief for very dry lenses and eyes. A slight cooling sensation that feels wonderful! Plus they&#x27;re so cute and convenient to carry around! I usually keep one in my bag and one around the house.</li>
            <li> Best eye drops I have ever used. I have extremely dry eyes..and these are the only thing that helps.</li>
            <li> These make my eyes feel really cool when I&#x27;m wearing contacts- which is good because my eyes burn from dryness when I wear some lenses. Granted, you may need frequent reapplications, but for the price, I&#x27;d say it serves well.</li>
            <li> Good product, but a little pricy</li>
            <li> I love this tiny eye drops and am carrying everywhere.</li>
            <li> The packaging is adorable and the lid is slightly sparkley and the drops themselves smell faintly of lychee. A great product overall, it helps manage eye fatigue at work!</li>
            <li> I love the packaging, it looks like a piece of candy! Provides my eyes with moisture relief when I&#x27;m wearing contacts for a few hours</li>
            <li> I love these drops. I had previously been using the rewetting drops from Optifree and I didn&#x27;t like them because they never made my circle lenses any more comfortable. This Rohto drops did. I could wear my lens for over 8 hours.</li>
            <li> I love these eye drops for contacts. As far as I know, these are the only rohto&#x27;s for contacts out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is adorable, and the drops themselves burn much less than the regular ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I give it 4 and not 5 stars is out of pure frustration that I have lost the past 5 of these I&#x27;ve purchased. (these seem to be the only Rohto&#x27;s I lose because I have a couple others that I&#x27;ve had for months)</li>
            <li> You will be surprised at how tiny this eye drop is. Really small but It&#x27;s SO cute! I found that this made wearing lenses more comfortable especially when reaching (or surpassing) the suggested 8hr wear time. The entire product and packaging is in another language so I don&#x27;t know whats going on in it but it works. I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Really great for those who wear contacts a lot.</li>
            <li> What did I ever do before this product? Invigorating, gets the red out and makes wearing contacts, especially when you&#x27;re tired, easy.</li>
            <li> really good~find this eye drop for a long time~thank you~</li>
            <li> my eyes feel very comfortable,when i use it.</li>
            <li> I simply cannot get over these eye drops. They are life-savers! I use my contacts a lot and need these when they get dry. They are strong and burn when you put them on, but the clarity you will get after the burn stops is definitely worth it. I don&#x27;t even mind paying extra for these, they are totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I really like these drops because they make my eyes feel so good while wearing contacts.  I do think it is a little pricey and the amount you get isn&#x27;t a lot but it is a good product and I plan to order some more from them.  Got this from Mild Japan and they sent the item quickly (within 2 days quick) and I ordered on the weekend!  Ordered Saturday; received it on Tuesday.  Thanks, Mild Japan!</li>
            <li> This is the only eye drops can use for contact lens.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this because my contacts were always blurry and dry and they worked for about thirty minutes and it would feel like a miracle eye drop and then my contacts would start to harden up on my eye balls to the point it hurt to blink and I would need to take them out immediately and rinse them with solution. I wanted to be cool like all the other stoners and have my own mentholated contact rhotos.... But, I&#x27;m pretty sure there is a reason I have not seen these on the shelves in the U.S. It&#x27;s too bad too because the packaging is adorbs and I payed a lot. So im Still on the hunt for comfort when wearing contacts.</li>
            <li> Love these drops! They work well with rigid gas permeable contact lenses.</li>
            <li> so cute and portable!!!</li>
