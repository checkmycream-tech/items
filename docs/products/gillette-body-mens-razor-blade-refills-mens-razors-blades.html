            <li>Loved the easy to change cartridges!</li>
            <li>This is amazing blade i found until searching for body shave.</li>
            <li>Works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>Gets a great smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because the gillette body cartridges are amazing.</li>
            <li>Work great on your body includes better for neck line area where blade give up mostly, like the three blade work all together without leaving scratches so would definitly buy again.</li>
            <li>make sure that your partner is in a GOOD</li>
            <li>lets be honest</li>
            <li>nice work gillette</li>
            <li>I liked the way the blade works even though it isn&#x27;t a 5 blade.  </li>
            <li>I liked using the Gilette Body razor.  </li>
            <li>My wife has nicer cartridges on her Venus razor to be honest.</li>
            <li>My skin felt great after using the razor, even after trying a quick shave with just water.</li>
            <li>To be honest they don&#x27;t shave as well as my electric but its ok</li>
            <li>After using the razor I discovered that three blades on the cartridge were perfect for those sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>but all in all great product, thanks Gillette for letting me try this out!</li>
            <li>The razor is very comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>The blades are super close together and the rounded edge is good in theory</li>
            <li>Got this product for free from Gillette and love it!</li>
            <li>It works beautifully but the price is kinda high.</li>
            <li>Good job Gillette, you really outdid yourselves with this one!! :)</li>
            <li>Solid product from Gillette and functions perfectly for a close shave.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t use this product without shaving cream, but when used properly this is an amazing tool!!!</li>
            <li>The blades for ladies are better</li>
            <li>per blade/shave compared to Venus or men&#x27;s Mach-3 blades - Venus is twice as many blades for $4 more&lt;</li>
            <li>i really enjoyed.</li>
            <li>love the product that i got.</li>
            <li>I would love a wider blade with a detailer on the reverse side of the cartridge.</li>
            <li>and I was definitely not disappointed!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how smooth it makes me.</li>
            <li>The ergonomic design of the razor, with its replaceable moving head, provides more control and a closer shave.</li>
            <li>I love this razor</li>
            <li>If they were cheaper I would purchase more often.</li>
            <li>Perhaps with another blade or two the quality would be better.</li>
            <li>I think the power version would work better and get a closer shave</li>
            <li>/&gt;Received this item for free from the brand in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>My Gillette pro glide fusion is better.  </li>
            <li>Leaves the area so smooth!</li>
            <li>Excellent, especially when used with Gillette&#x27;s body shave gel.</li>
            <li>This is perfect, because these last me about a month, so 4 months out of these!</li>
            <li>safe assured that this isn&#x27;t as bulky of a package as most out there.</li>
            <li>I love these cartridges.</li>
            <li>so you love them as well</li>
            <li>I have tried a great many razors &amp; this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I was given the opportunity to try this free from Gillette and honestly the cartridge itself wasn&#x27;t anything special.</li>
            <li>The Gillette Body Razor was extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li>They are easy to replace.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Easy.</li>
            <li>They are easy to assemble to the razor.</li>
            <li>The package was easily opened, and the razor itself is strongly build and fits comfortably in my hand.</li>
            <li>This is for sure my new favorite razor!</li>
            <li>I also had issues with clogging, and I have fine to medium</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for &amp; expecting something special and buying based on that, there is probably something better out there if you&#x27;re willing to spend more.</li>
            <li>They are great for shaving my private parts</li>
            <li>wide-flat head works smoothly over body curves (preventing digging)&lt;br /&gt;No wire-strips covering the blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i had a chance to try this product for free #gotitfree.</li>
            <li>It tugged at my hair like a cheap razor.  </li>
            <li>The cartridge is smooth and cuts effortlessly.</li>
            <li>Got it free from the brand</li>
            <li>I got this from Gillette for free.</li>
            <li>I received these blades from the brand as part of a free trial with bzzagent.  </li>
            <li>Received this product Free to try from Gillette.</li>
            <li>smooth shave and gets everything I need it to get.</li>
            <li>I received the Gillette Body Razor free from Gillette to review.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I received this for free from Gillett.  </li>
            <li>The cartridge fit snuggly on the blade and stayed in place while shaving.</li>
            <li>* given to me as a free sample by Gillette</li>
            <li>great for manscaping because of the flexible blade head and giant pads.</li>
            <li>I received this product free from Gillette to review.</li>
            <li>I did however like how smooth and close my shave was.</li>
            <li>I received Gillette body cartridge for free from Gillette</li>
            <li>They are a bit pricey but very worth it.</li>
            <li>Smooth clean shave, no complaints here.</li>
            <li>Gillette was awesome enough to send me this new razor and shave gel</li>
            <li>It also has 3 lubricating strips which helps ensure an outstanding glide, and also has 3 PowerGlide floating blades for a close shave, which is much needed!  </li>
            <li>works wonders and leaves a clean cut.</li>
            <li>These have an interesting design; however, the design which is intended to &amp;#34;protect&amp;#34; while shaving &amp;#34;sensitive areas&amp;#34; really hinders a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>I received my Gillette Body Razor &amp; Cartridges in the mail about 2 weeks ago and the first week I was very impressed with how well the blades lasted and still got the job down.</li>
            <li>Instead I do one glide over the area I need to shave and in one swipe it is so smooth and my pores feel so fresh.</li>
            <li>I give them a 10 out of 10 and highly recommend them to anyone who shaves often! :)</li>
            <li>But thanks Gillette for sending me the free product in exchange for the review!</li>
            <li>Sharp and great.</li>
            <li>But other then me begin picky its a great cartridge.</li>
            <li>I used to use the Gillette Mach 3 Turbo until I was able to try the Gillette Body Razor out as a free sample from Gillette, but now I&#x27;ll be switching to the Body Razor completely.</li>
            <li>Gillette was nice enough to send me a free sample to review and with that here we go.</li>
            <li>&quot; but i&#x27;m not playing around with a dozen and a half things while trying to clean up this work great on my arms, legs, chest, neck and even touch up to my face.</li>
            <li>I was given a chance to try the Gillette Body Razor free from Gillette and found it to be amazing, but the real deal engineered part that actually makes all the difference in a good shave-the blades and soft gel pads.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to change and keep a smooth soft shave every time!</li>
            <li>The razor leaves the whole body clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>Gillette Razor Cartridge gave a great smooth, gentle shave with extreme comfort.</li>
            <li>Also unlike many other razors, the Gillette Body Razor has three lubricating strips for a more comfortable shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very flimsy and cheap feeling like a disposable razor.  </li>
            <li>I ordered a set because seemed like something worth trying as I like to keep my sensitives areas neat.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;All-in-all, good solid razor, but there are many out there that offer the same features and work just as well.  </li>
            <li>yes so far better then</li>
            <li>/&gt;Being the same price as Venus and others this so far is by far the best</li>
            <li>I use a Mach 3 and have used it pretty much since they came out and works perfectly fine</li>
            <li>My only issue is it could use a more pivot to give it a better range of motion and maybe comfortable grip overall.</li>
            <li>The first one on the unit wore out pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Small changes may improve this product and i&#x27;d be happy to retry this product again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s in the name!&lt;br /&gt;Unlike electric body groomers which tend to irritate the skin and leave cuts in loose skin, the razor in this pack utilizes three perfectly-placed blades for a smooth shave your body will love.</li>
            <li>also it is easy to get into, unlike most other packages out there.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve thought this would work better than a &amp;#34;woman&#x27;s razor&amp;#34;, but this is nothing more than a green Venus (which are cheaper, as I pointed out).</li>
            <li>Both areas went very smoothly with zero irritation the next day which matches the claims of Gillette.</li>
            <li>and it got a very smooth, close shave without leaving red razor</li>
            <li>Like I said pretty decent razor but nothing special.</li>
            <li>rather well I might add ;)</li>
            <li>From first stroke, I realized this may not be the razor for me.</li>
            <li>It is the best design I have ever used all these cartridges are way to expensive if you ask me.</li>
            <li>These blades are a tad expensive but they are great!</li>
            <li>When I first received my Gillette Body Razor and cartridge from Gillette</li>
            <li>does what it says and is better in the shower than my regular mach3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On the more expensive side but still good.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work better than my standard Gillette razor cartridges, but it&#x27;s better than a single blade.</li>
            <li>This cartridge got really clogged up the first once over.</li>
            <li>; with a soapy gunk&lt;br /&gt;Blades clog very fast, even if only shaving light stubble&lt;br /&gt;Cost</li>
            <li>Shaving each day and exercising care in doing so is just as effective and much less costly.</li>
            <li>I used to think these multi-blade arrangements were pure marketing hokum</li>
            <li>It cut really well and left smooth skin without irritation.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Shaves very well and does not &amp;#34;nick&amp;#34; you.</li>
            <li>Will be buying again real soon.</li>
            <li>Thanks again,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These cartridges truly get the job done when it comes to getting a soft, fresh shave.</li>
            <li>so well its fast its east to snap on.</li>
            <li>With the Gillette Body Razor, even the hair grew back smoothly and without causing irritation or rashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>unless you enjoy the irritation caused by regular razors or groomers, do yourself a favor and try the Gillette Body Razor.</li>
            <li>The shave was very close</li>
            <li>I really like these cartridges for the razor.</li>
            <li>Also it is a lot easier and faster doing the whole body and not worrying about the nicks.</li>
            <li>They clog up way to fast and take forever to use.</li>
            <li>These are the only ones that fit that razor.</li>
            <li>I really like how it had a rounded head for body comfort.</li>
            <li>But the price could really be cheaper.</li>
            <li>The gel from the razor itself was slimey and moisturizing, which I really like.  </li>
            <li>The hair does not get clogged up in the blades and the stay sharp for a longer period of time than most blades.  </li>
            <li>It takes a lot more effort and time than I&#x27;ve had to do with other products.</li>
            <li>It was just average, It probably needs more blades, because it dulled really fast.</li>
            <li>These blades really aren&#x27;t any better or different than a standard gillette blade.</li>
            <li>Most razors are much more expensive and don&#x27;t get a closet shave.  </li>
            <li>Price is a bit high though, but you get what you pay for in life.</li>
            <li>the price is a bit high and the handle I have seems to take some effort to taking them off.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It glides smooth over the skin with minimal tugging.</li>
            <li>So, this is nothing more than a green Venus (Mach3 blade-set with a wider head), marketed for men.  </li>
            <li>For this Gillette Body Razor blades to be cost effective for me, it would need to allow me at least 4 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks Gillette for the opportunity to examine your new product, the &amp;#34;Gillette Body Razor.&amp;#34; As far as the cartridge goes, they get the job done</li>
            <li>They seem to last and stay sharp, the lubricating strip starts out great but fades soon after the first few shaves.</li>
            <li>I needed to change my blade more frequently than my previous razor.  </li>
            <li>This razor works much better than any other I have used prior for shaving my &amp;#34;man parts&amp;#34; and I have thicker than normal hair.</li>
            <li>(Gillette&#x27;s Sensor), there is a clear difference!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of razors and power groomers, but not only do they irritate the skin, they cause rashes once the hair starts growing back.</li>
            <li>Just discharge the old cartridge, snap on the new one and your all set.</li>
            <li>like all of todays popular multi-blade razors are flat and do not flex so shaving around curved areas takes repetitive swipes.</li>
            <li>Clean up is easier and hair washes down the drain.</li>
            <li>Super sharp.</li>
            <li>So, buy a Venus, and if you don&#x27;t want the blades to dull as fast, use Mach-3 heads and go slower, being more careful over certain sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>They completely remove body hair to my liking.</li>
            <li>It seemed to me that my hair didnt grow back as fast either.</li>
            <li>Gillette is taking advantage of the &amp;#34;manscaping&amp;#34; fad, and charging more for a Green Venus, over the Blue ones marketed for women.  </li>
            <li>The gel pads seem adequate, but I have a feeling they won&#x27;t last as long as the blades will.</li>
            <li>lubricating strips dry out after the first use and flake away</li>
            <li>The razor cartridge allowed for a close shave without any nicks due to the smooth rounded edges and helpful strips above and below the blades.</li>
            <li>They last a long, long time and they&#x27;re easy to glide and use.</li>
            <li>The only thing I can say these do better than the regular blades is travel conveniently, as each individual blade is packaged in a waterproof packet, not like the 5 packs of regular gillette blades that get rusty if you leave them in the shower or anywhere humid enough (like the bathroom)</li>
            <li>Overall I would highly recommend this product and all of Gillette&#x27;s shaving products.</li>
            <li>Even with the multiple strokes, I was left with a little more than stubble on my chest.</li>
            <li>exactly what i expected.</li>
            <li>Not a single cut so far.</li>
            <li>By the way guys, if you work it right all you have to do is lie down and let your partner do all the work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they get dull pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Great to get a close shave and avoid painful stinging afterwards.</li>
            <li>The moisturizing strips seem to work very well and appear to be long lasting.</li>
            <li>Paying that much is not really in my budget.</li>
            <li>The soap strips make your skin feel extra soft.</li>
            <li>It is designed to remove body hair from the shoulders down &amp; that&#x27;s exactly what it does...</li>
            <li>It doesnt last very long and they are very pricey for what they are.</li>
            <li>They work pretty well and all, but I fail to see the point of owning two types of razor blades that work pretty much the same.</li>
            <li>While the cartridges do get the job done, I do feel as though the purchase price was far to high for such a average quality razor.</li>
            <li>The blades were quite sharp and provided me with a close shave, which lasted for a decent time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>NOPE, I don&#x27;t like them at all, they cut like a butter knife and dull way too quickly.</li>

            <li> Awesome!</li>

            <li> /&gt;It does a very good job for the area it is designed  for .</li>
            <li> It does a very good job for the area it is designed for.</li>
            <li> Brilliant product..</li>
            <li> They are incredible and work great with the Gillette Body Gel.</li>
            <li> I am now at the end of week 2 using these cartridges and I still am very pleased!</li>
            <li> They work just great.</li>
            <li> Not to happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Skin feels great after the shaving.</li>
            <li> It does get the job done and it&#x27;s great for body shaving when you want to show off the muscles.</li>
            <li> Delivers a great body shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from Gillette and it seems like the razor doesn&#x27;t do a great job at removing the hair like the product says it does.  </li>
            <li> The Gillette Body Blades themselves are great.</li>
            <li> Times 1-2 great.</li>
            <li> They work amazing!</li>
            <li> The blades on this razor dulled after just one use, though they did a good job.</li>
            <li> This product does a good job .</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a good shower blade that I will buy replacement cartridges for.</li>
            <li> No matter how good it is.</li>
            <li> Good shavers, but could be cheaper in my opinion.</li>
            <li> would reccommend this razor to anyone who is looking for a good shave.</li>
            <li> Are they good?</li>
            <li> price seems fair for Name Brand razors</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> they shaved very smoothly!</li>
            <li> Thank you Gillette for the free sample!!</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing some more cartridges here soon!</li>
            <li> I look forward to spending more time on the beach this summer!</li>
            <li> Better than disposable razors and at an amazing price!  </li>
            <li> I love this razor!</li>
            <li> Loved the easy to change cartridges!</li>
            <li> This is amazing blade i found until searching for body shave.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> Gets a great smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because the gillette body cartridges are amazing.</li>
            <li> Work great on your body includes better for neck line area where blade give up mostly, like the three blade work all together without leaving scratches so would definitly buy again.</li>
            <li> make sure that your partner is in a GOOD</li>
            <li> lets be honest</li>
            <li> nice work gillette</li>
            <li> I liked the way the blade works even though it isn&#x27;t a 5 blade.  </li>
            <li> I liked using the Gilette Body razor.  </li>
            <li> My wife has nicer cartridges on her Venus razor to be honest.</li>
            <li> My skin felt great after using the razor, even after trying a quick shave with just water.</li>
            <li> To be honest they don&#x27;t shave as well as my electric but its ok</li>
            <li> After using the razor I discovered that three blades on the cartridge were perfect for those sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> but all in all great product, thanks Gillette for letting me try this out!</li>
            <li> The razor is very comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> The blades are super close together and the rounded edge is good in theory</li>
            <li> Got this product for free from Gillette and love it!</li>
            <li> It works beautifully but the price is kinda high.</li>
            <li> Good job Gillette, you really outdid yourselves with this one!! :)</li>
            <li> Solid product from Gillette and functions perfectly for a close shave.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t use this product without shaving cream, but when used properly this is an amazing tool!!!</li>
            <li> The blades for ladies are better</li>
            <li> per blade/shave compared to Venus or men&#x27;s Mach-3 blades - Venus is twice as many blades for $4 more&lt;</li>
            <li> i really enjoyed.</li>
            <li> love the product that i got.</li>
            <li> I would love a wider blade with a detailer on the reverse side of the cartridge.</li>
            <li> and I was definitely not disappointed!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how smooth it makes me.</li>
            <li> The ergonomic design of the razor, with its replaceable moving head, provides more control and a closer shave.</li>
            <li> I love this razor</li>
            <li> If they were cheaper I would purchase more often.</li>
            <li> Perhaps with another blade or two the quality would be better.</li>
            <li> I think the power version would work better and get a closer shave</li>
            <li> /&gt;Received this item for free from the brand in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> My Gillette pro glide fusion is better.  </li>
            <li> Leaves the area so smooth!</li>
            <li> Excellent, especially when used with Gillette&#x27;s body shave gel.</li>
            <li> This is perfect, because these last me about a month, so 4 months out of these!</li>
            <li> safe assured that this isn&#x27;t as bulky of a package as most out there.</li>
            <li> I love these cartridges.</li>
            <li> so you love them as well</li>
            <li> I have tried a great many razors &amp; this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try this free from Gillette and honestly the cartridge itself wasn&#x27;t anything special.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Body Razor was extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li> They are easy to replace.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Easy.</li>
            <li> They are easy to assemble to the razor.</li>
            <li> The package was easily opened, and the razor itself is strongly build and fits comfortably in my hand.</li>
            <li> This is for sure my new favorite razor!</li>
            <li> I also had issues with clogging, and I have fine to medium</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for &amp; expecting something special and buying based on that, there is probably something better out there if you&#x27;re willing to spend more.</li>
            <li> They are great for shaving my private parts</li>
            <li> wide-flat head works smoothly over body curves (preventing digging)&lt;br /&gt;No wire-strips covering the blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i had a chance to try this product for free #gotitfree.</li>
            <li> It tugged at my hair like a cheap razor.  </li>
            <li> The cartridge is smooth and cuts effortlessly.</li>
            <li> Got it free from the brand</li>
            <li> I got this from Gillette for free.</li>
            <li> I received these blades from the brand as part of a free trial with bzzagent.  </li>
            <li> Received this product Free to try from Gillette.</li>
            <li> smooth shave and gets everything I need it to get.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Body Razor free from Gillette to review.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I received this for free from Gillett.  </li>
            <li> The cartridge fit snuggly on the blade and stayed in place while shaving.</li>
            <li> * given to me as a free sample by Gillette</li>
            <li> great for manscaping because of the flexible blade head and giant pads.</li>
            <li> I received this product free from Gillette to review.</li>
            <li> I did however like how smooth and close my shave was.</li>
            <li> I received Gillette body cartridge for free from Gillette</li>
            <li> They are a bit pricey but very worth it.</li>
            <li> Smooth clean shave, no complaints here.</li>
            <li> Gillette was awesome enough to send me this new razor and shave gel</li>
            <li> It also has 3 lubricating strips which helps ensure an outstanding glide, and also has 3 PowerGlide floating blades for a close shave, which is much needed!  </li>
            <li> works wonders and leaves a clean cut.</li>
            <li> These have an interesting design; however, the design which is intended to &amp;#34;protect&amp;#34; while shaving &amp;#34;sensitive areas&amp;#34; really hinders a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> I received my Gillette Body Razor &amp; Cartridges in the mail about 2 weeks ago and the first week I was very impressed with how well the blades lasted and still got the job down.</li>
            <li> Instead I do one glide over the area I need to shave and in one swipe it is so smooth and my pores feel so fresh.</li>
            <li> I give them a 10 out of 10 and highly recommend them to anyone who shaves often! :)</li>
            <li> But thanks Gillette for sending me the free product in exchange for the review!</li>
            <li> Sharp and great.</li>
            <li> But other then me begin picky its a great cartridge.</li>
            <li> I used to use the Gillette Mach 3 Turbo until I was able to try the Gillette Body Razor out as a free sample from Gillette, but now I&#x27;ll be switching to the Body Razor completely.</li>
            <li> Gillette was nice enough to send me a free sample to review and with that here we go.</li>
            <li> &quot; but i&#x27;m not playing around with a dozen and a half things while trying to clean up this work great on my arms, legs, chest, neck and even touch up to my face.</li>
            <li> I was given a chance to try the Gillette Body Razor free from Gillette and found it to be amazing, but the real deal engineered part that actually makes all the difference in a good shave-the blades and soft gel pads.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to change and keep a smooth soft shave every time!</li>
            <li> The razor leaves the whole body clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> Gillette Razor Cartridge gave a great smooth, gentle shave with extreme comfort.</li>
            <li> Also unlike many other razors, the Gillette Body Razor has three lubricating strips for a more comfortable shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very flimsy and cheap feeling like a disposable razor.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a set because seemed like something worth trying as I like to keep my sensitives areas neat.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;All-in-all, good solid razor, but there are many out there that offer the same features and work just as well.  </li>
            <li> yes so far better then</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being the same price as Venus and others this so far is by far the best</li>
            <li> I use a Mach 3 and have used it pretty much since they came out and works perfectly fine</li>
            <li> My only issue is it could use a more pivot to give it a better range of motion and maybe comfortable grip overall.</li>
            <li> The first one on the unit wore out pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Small changes may improve this product and i&#x27;d be happy to retry this product again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s in the name!&lt;br /&gt;Unlike electric body groomers which tend to irritate the skin and leave cuts in loose skin, the razor in this pack utilizes three perfectly-placed blades for a smooth shave your body will love.</li>
            <li> also it is easy to get into, unlike most other packages out there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve thought this would work better than a &amp;#34;woman&#x27;s razor&amp;#34;, but this is nothing more than a green Venus (which are cheaper, as I pointed out).</li>
            <li> Both areas went very smoothly with zero irritation the next day which matches the claims of Gillette.</li>
            <li> and it got a very smooth, close shave without leaving red razor</li>
            <li> Like I said pretty decent razor but nothing special.</li>
            <li> rather well I might add ;)</li>
            <li> From first stroke, I realized this may not be the razor for me.</li>
            <li> It is the best design I have ever used all these cartridges are way to expensive if you ask me.</li>
            <li> These blades are a tad expensive but they are great!</li>
            <li> When I first received my Gillette Body Razor and cartridge from Gillette</li>
            <li> does what it says and is better in the shower than my regular mach3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On the more expensive side but still good.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work better than my standard Gillette razor cartridges, but it&#x27;s better than a single blade.</li>
            <li> This cartridge got really clogged up the first once over.</li>
            <li> ; with a soapy gunk&lt;br /&gt;Blades clog very fast, even if only shaving light stubble&lt;br /&gt;Cost</li>
            <li> Shaving each day and exercising care in doing so is just as effective and much less costly.</li>
            <li> I used to think these multi-blade arrangements were pure marketing hokum</li>
            <li> It cut really well and left smooth skin without irritation.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Shaves very well and does not &amp;#34;nick&amp;#34; you.</li>
            <li> Will be buying again real soon.</li>
            <li> Thanks again,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These cartridges truly get the job done when it comes to getting a soft, fresh shave.</li>
            <li> so well its fast its east to snap on.</li>
            <li> With the Gillette Body Razor, even the hair grew back smoothly and without causing irritation or rashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> unless you enjoy the irritation caused by regular razors or groomers, do yourself a favor and try the Gillette Body Razor.</li>
            <li> The shave was very close</li>
            <li> I really like these cartridges for the razor.</li>
            <li> Also it is a lot easier and faster doing the whole body and not worrying about the nicks.</li>
            <li> They clog up way to fast and take forever to use.</li>
            <li> These are the only ones that fit that razor.</li>
            <li> I really like how it had a rounded head for body comfort.</li>
            <li> But the price could really be cheaper.</li>
            <li> The gel from the razor itself was slimey and moisturizing, which I really like.  </li>
            <li> The hair does not get clogged up in the blades and the stay sharp for a longer period of time than most blades.  </li>
            <li> It takes a lot more effort and time than I&#x27;ve had to do with other products.</li>
            <li> It was just average, It probably needs more blades, because it dulled really fast.</li>
            <li> These blades really aren&#x27;t any better or different than a standard gillette blade.</li>
            <li> Most razors are much more expensive and don&#x27;t get a closet shave.  </li>
            <li> Price is a bit high though, but you get what you pay for in life.</li>
            <li> the price is a bit high and the handle I have seems to take some effort to taking them off.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It glides smooth over the skin with minimal tugging.</li>
            <li> So, this is nothing more than a green Venus (Mach3 blade-set with a wider head), marketed for men.  </li>
            <li> For this Gillette Body Razor blades to be cost effective for me, it would need to allow me at least 4 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks Gillette for the opportunity to examine your new product, the &amp;#34;Gillette Body Razor.&amp;#34; As far as the cartridge goes, they get the job done</li>
            <li> They seem to last and stay sharp, the lubricating strip starts out great but fades soon after the first few shaves.</li>
            <li> I needed to change my blade more frequently than my previous razor.  </li>
            <li> This razor works much better than any other I have used prior for shaving my &amp;#34;man parts&amp;#34; and I have thicker than normal hair.</li>
            <li> (Gillette&#x27;s Sensor), there is a clear difference!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of razors and power groomers, but not only do they irritate the skin, they cause rashes once the hair starts growing back.</li>
            <li> Just discharge the old cartridge, snap on the new one and your all set.</li>
            <li> like all of todays popular multi-blade razors are flat and do not flex so shaving around curved areas takes repetitive swipes.</li>
            <li> Clean up is easier and hair washes down the drain.</li>
            <li> Super sharp.</li>
            <li> So, buy a Venus, and if you don&#x27;t want the blades to dull as fast, use Mach-3 heads and go slower, being more careful over certain sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> They completely remove body hair to my liking.</li>
            <li> It seemed to me that my hair didnt grow back as fast either.</li>
            <li> Gillette is taking advantage of the &amp;#34;manscaping&amp;#34; fad, and charging more for a Green Venus, over the Blue ones marketed for women.  </li>
            <li> The gel pads seem adequate, but I have a feeling they won&#x27;t last as long as the blades will.</li>
            <li> lubricating strips dry out after the first use and flake away</li>
            <li> The razor cartridge allowed for a close shave without any nicks due to the smooth rounded edges and helpful strips above and below the blades.</li>
            <li> They last a long, long time and they&#x27;re easy to glide and use.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can say these do better than the regular blades is travel conveniently, as each individual blade is packaged in a waterproof packet, not like the 5 packs of regular gillette blades that get rusty if you leave them in the shower or anywhere humid enough (like the bathroom)</li>
            <li> Overall I would highly recommend this product and all of Gillette&#x27;s shaving products.</li>
            <li> Even with the multiple strokes, I was left with a little more than stubble on my chest.</li>
            <li> exactly what i expected.</li>
            <li> Not a single cut so far.</li>
            <li> By the way guys, if you work it right all you have to do is lie down and let your partner do all the work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they get dull pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Great to get a close shave and avoid painful stinging afterwards.</li>
            <li> The moisturizing strips seem to work very well and appear to be long lasting.</li>
            <li> Paying that much is not really in my budget.</li>
            <li> The soap strips make your skin feel extra soft.</li>
            <li> It is designed to remove body hair from the shoulders down &amp; that&#x27;s exactly what it does...</li>
            <li> It doesnt last very long and they are very pricey for what they are.</li>
            <li> They work pretty well and all, but I fail to see the point of owning two types of razor blades that work pretty much the same.</li>
            <li> While the cartridges do get the job done, I do feel as though the purchase price was far to high for such a average quality razor.</li>
            <li> The blades were quite sharp and provided me with a close shave, which lasted for a decent time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> NOPE, I don&#x27;t like them at all, they cut like a butter knife and dull way too quickly.</li>
            <li> Having only 3 blades made me slightly worried, as my normal razor has 4, but I was worried for nothing.</li>
            <li> and my hair is pretty thick.</li>
            <li> Lubricating strips also last a long time, thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I usually use an electric shaver, but last night I tried this new one  </li>
            <li> Minimal irritation (and he has sensitive skin) and blade stay surprisingly sharp compared to others.</li>
            <li> Its stayed sharp enough, but at this point (about 7-8 uses)</li>
            <li> I have used products in the past that claim to be full body razors when the implementation at least one time consisted of a strange \\&quot;wire guard\\</li>
            <li> Now, for the single downside I can find with this razor--</li>
            <li> The razor seemed to have to work extra hard (and my hair isn&#x27;t very coarse) and it took multiple strokes to get anywhere.</li>
            <li> only down fall is the price.</li>
            <li> As a women who cares but a male friend purchased a few (must have had a pretty girl behind the counter) and gave me the $100.00 razor.</li>
            <li> These cartridges tend to last at an average rate as other razor cartridges.  </li>
            <li> Okay it wasn&#x27;t that bad, but I had a couple slices  </li>
            <li> Sadly, the Venus blades last much longer, probably because of the difference in the lubricating strips?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not much difference</li>
            <li> these blades did everything i expected it to and even more.its</li>
            <li> only knock is that it&#x27;s not available for subr &amp; save, but that&#x27;s about Zon and not the product..</li>
            <li> it needs a trim blade located on the head like the other men&#x27;s Gillette razors for hard to reach areas and to complete it versatility of use for your face and body.</li>
            <li> It not really strong enough to take care of everything by itself.</li>
            <li> I have very little hair and while it did perform, it only did so once.</li>
            <li> I just got these in the mail the other day from Gillette</li>
            <li> During shaving the area, I did not receive any of the usual nicks as with a regular razor.  </li>
            <li> This razor that I received from Gillette to try out was just average.  </li>
            <li> and I feel it was just average</li>
            <li> I threw them away after two uses, not worth you money or time.</li>
            <li> Venus and the other sticky mess with all the moisturizing and gels that they now add on, ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would suggest trimming down and then using this to finish up.</li>
            <li> This razor goes above and beyond any razor i&#x27;ve ever used in the past!</li>
            <li> Less shaking out of the blades</li>
            <li> The cartridges have a very long time until they get dull.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had no cuts at all which with other razors I usually do get.</li>
            <li> I received this razor from Gillette for testing and review a little while ago.  </li>
            <li> Little to no irritation anywhere.</li>
            <li> works (a few times)&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Times 3-4 I noticed the built in lube strip dried out and was wearing off.</li>
            <li> First of all they are very expensive as you know if you bought the shaver.</li>
            <li> Also, with it having round edges it moves and cuts effortlessly.</li>
            <li> It was sharp cut through the pubes nicely no pull no tugging.</li>
            <li> lubricating strips work to dull the blades faster by &amp;#34;coating them&amp;#34</li>
            <li> and I have thick hair.</li>
            <li> &quot; that covered the blades to keep nicks and cuts to a minimum, the result was a product that had lots of drag ad plucked hairs instead of cutting.  </li>
            <li> I would reccomend these cartridges to any man who is tired of unwanted body hair.</li>
            <li> burn behind.  </li>
            <li> Once they get dull they start cutting</li>
            <li> i do think its expensive to buy 2 razors one for body n one for face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been seeing advertisements for these like crazy in the mens magazine and health sites.  </li>
            <li> but maybe it&#x27;s time to consider a wider cutting path.</li>
            <li> but it makes it very difficult to get those area&#x27;s where the rounded edge is helpful shaved.  </li>
            <li> Broke apart and the blades dulled and It started pulling Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have to say I got it and was very disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> They are great for shaving my private parts</li>
            <li> They work just great. I like them. Once they get dull they start cutting but otherwise they work well.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Solid product from Gillette and functions perfectly for a close shave.  I used to think these multi-blade arrangements were pure marketing hokum but after comparing shaves with these triple blade Body razors and twin-blade set-ups (Gillette&#x27;s Sensor), there is a clear difference!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  Shaves very well and does not &amp;#34;nick&amp;#34; you.</li>
            <li> I have tried a great many razors &amp; this is by far my favorite. It is designed to remove body hair from the shoulders down &amp; that&#x27;s exactly what it does...rather well I might add ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t use this product without shaving cream, but when used properly this is an amazing tool!!!</li>
            <li> exactly what i expected.</li>
            <li> Not to happy with the product. The blades for ladies are better</li>
            <li> Hubby uses these to shave his head. Minimal irritation (and he has sensitive skin) and blade stay surprisingly sharp compared to others.</li>
            <li> So, this is nothing more than a green Venus (Mach3 blade-set with a wider head), marketed for men.  Gillette is taking advantage of the &amp;#34;manscaping&amp;#34; fad, and charging more for a Green Venus, over the Blue ones marketed for women.  Sadly, the Venus blades last much longer, probably because of the difference in the lubricating strips?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It works (a few times)&lt;br /&gt;The wide-flat head works smoothly over body curves (preventing digging)&lt;br /&gt;No wire-strips covering the blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It works for about 3 shaves per head&lt;br /&gt;The lubricating strips dry out after the first use and flake away&lt;br /&gt;The lubricating strips work to dull the blades faster by &amp;#34;coating them&amp;#34; with a soapy gunk&lt;br /&gt;Blades clog very fast, even if only shaving light stubble&lt;br /&gt;Cost per blade/shave compared to Venus or men&#x27;s Mach-3 blades - Venus is twice as many blades for $4 more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve thought this would work better than a &amp;#34;woman&#x27;s razor&amp;#34;, but this is nothing more than a green Venus (which are cheaper, as I pointed out). So, buy a Venus, and if you don&#x27;t want the blades to dull as fast, use Mach-3 heads and go slower, being more careful over certain sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> Thank you Gillette for the free sample!! after using this i&#x27;d have to say its one of he nicer razors i have tried.  Price is a bit high though, but you get what you pay for in life.</li>
            <li> Gillette Razor Cartridge gave a great smooth, gentle shave with extreme comfort. Lubricating strips also last a long time, thumbs up! I would recommend for anyone.  5 stars.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Body Razor was extremely easy to use. The package was easily opened, and the razor itself is strongly build and fits comfortably in my hand. I used the razor to shave the back of my neck and my upper arms. Both areas went very smoothly with zero irritation the next day which matches the claims of Gillette. The only issue I had is the blades, like all of todays popular multi-blade razors are flat and do not flex so shaving around curved areas takes repetitive swipes.</li>
            <li> i had a chance to try this product for free #gotitfree. i really enjoyed. i would recommend to my friends . the only thins is that 3 bladesare kinda not enough for shaving and they get dull pretty fast. but overall the shaving was smooth and without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> The blades on this razor dulled after just one use, though they did a good job. For this Gillette Body Razor blades to be cost effective for me, it would need to allow me at least 4 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are someone who has a lot of body hair, this isn&#x27;t the razor for you. I have very little hair and while it did perform, it only did so once.</li>
            <li> This is amazing blade i found until searching for body shave. Work great on your body includes better for neck line area where blade give up mostly, like the three blade work all together without leaving scratches so would definitly buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been seeing advertisements for these like crazy in the mens magazine and health sites.  I ordered a set because seemed like something worth trying as I like to keep my sensitives areas neat.  I use a Mach 3 and have used it pretty much since they came out and works perfectly fine but like I said kept seeing the adverts for this and ordered it to give it a shot.  I have to say I got it and was very disappointed.  Mid shave I tossed it and got the Mach 3 out.  It is very flimsy and cheap feeling like a disposable razor.  The blades are super close together and the rounded edge is good in theory but it makes it very difficult to get those area&#x27;s where the rounded edge is helpful shaved.  Not a fan.</li>
            <li> This razor that I received from Gillette to try out was just average.  It tugged at my hair like a cheap razor.  I will stick to the fusion blades for my shaving needs!</li>
            <li> I used to use the Gillette Mach 3 Turbo until I was able to try the Gillette Body Razor out as a free sample from Gillette, but now I&#x27;ll be switching to the Body Razor completely. The cartridge is smooth and cuts effortlessly. My skin felt great after using the razor, even after trying a quick shave with just water. It&#x27;s just perfect!</li>
            <li> Brilliant product..wouldr ecommend.. They last a long, long time and they&#x27;re easy to glide and use. must have item. Brill!</li>
            <li> Sharp and great. My wife was trying to steal them from me. Skin feels great after the shaving. Recomend to everyone. Got it free from the brand</li>
            <li> This product does a good job . It is not that expensive as most products are.  I got this from Gillette for free. Thank you and also&lt;br /&gt;It does a very good job for the area it is designed  for . Did not leave any nicks at all. A plus</li>
            <li> love the product that i got. works wonders and leaves a clean cut. Will be buying again real soon. thank</li>
            <li> Thanks Gillette for the opportunity to examine your new product, the &amp;#34;Gillette Body Razor.&amp;#34; As far as the cartridge goes, they get the job done but maybe it&#x27;s time to consider a wider cutting path. I would love a wider blade with a detailer on the reverse side of the cartridge. I also had issues with clogging, and I have fine to medium hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good shower blade that I will buy replacement cartridges for. Thanks again,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Floyd</li>
            <li> I received this from Gillette to try out. It was just average, It probably needs more blades, because it dulled really fast.</li>
            <li> These cartridges truly get the job done when it comes to getting a soft, fresh shave. I just got these in the mail the other day from Gillette and I was definitely not disappointed!! They are incredible and work great with the Gillette Body Gel. I have no red spots after I shave from my skin getting irritated from the blades. Instead I do one glide over the area I need to shave and in one swipe it is so smooth and my pores feel so fresh. This is for sure my new favorite razor! I will be purchasing some more cartridges here soon! Good job Gillette, you really outdid yourselves with this one!! :)</li>
            <li> I received my Gillette Body Razor &amp; Cartridges in the mail about 2 weeks ago and the first week I was very impressed with how well the blades lasted and still got the job down. I am now at the end of week 2 using these cartridges and I still am very pleased! The cartridges have a very long time until they get dull. I use mine almost every 2-3 days and my hair is pretty thick. Especially my chest hair... And these cartridges have continued to get the job done for me! I give them a 10 out of 10 and highly recommend them to anyone who shaves often! :)</li>
            <li> This razor goes above and beyond any razor i&#x27;ve ever used in the past! It&#x27;s amazing how smooth it makes me.</li>
            <li> My current razor would get so clogged up all the time when shaving my body. So i tried this razors that were given to me by gillette.But this one does the trick so well its fast its east to snap on. the price is a bit high and the handle I have seems to take some effort to taking them off. But other then me begin picky its a great cartridge.</li>
            <li> I received these blades from the brand as part of a free trial with bzzagent.  I use these blades to shave my head and they work perfectly.  The hair does not get clogged up in the blades and the stay sharp for a longer period of time than most blades.  The moisturizing strips seem to work very well and appear to be long lasting.</li>
            <li> Not all men shave below the neck, but for those that do, Gillette just made your life easier. The Gillette Body Razor was specifically made for body hair. It&#x27;s in the name!&lt;br /&gt;Unlike electric body groomers which tend to irritate the skin and leave cuts in loose skin, the razor in this pack utilizes three perfectly-placed blades for a smooth shave your body will love. The ergonomic design of the razor, with its replaceable moving head, provides more control and a closer shave. Also unlike many other razors, the Gillette Body Razor has three lubricating strips for a more comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of razors and power groomers, but not only do they irritate the skin, they cause rashes once the hair starts growing back. With the Gillette Body Razor, even the hair grew back smoothly and without causing irritation or rashes.&lt;br /&gt;So unless you enjoy the irritation caused by regular razors or groomers, do yourself a favor and try the Gillette Body Razor. Your body will thank you for it.</li>
            <li> I love this razor i just wish they had a bulk size container of cartridges so i dont have to keep buying them every couple months</li>
            <li> Received this product Free to try from Gillette. It does get the job done and it&#x27;s great for body shaving when you want to show off the muscles. Less shaking out of the blades and I&#x27;ve had no cuts at all which with other razors I usually do get. Excellent blades. only down fall is the price. No matter how good it is. Paying that much is not really in my budget. If they were cheaper I would purchase more often. For the cartridge itself I give 4 starts. smooth shave and gets everything I need it to get.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Body Razor free from Gillette to review. From first stroke, I realized this may not be the razor for me. The razor seemed to have to work extra hard (and my hair isn&#x27;t very coarse) and it took multiple strokes to get anywhere. Even with the multiple strokes, I was left with a little more than stubble on my chest. Perhaps with another blade or two the quality would be better.</li>
            <li> Best razor for shaving your head.  Easy to clean.  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> These Gillette razor cartridges disarm from the razor effortlessly. They are easy to replace. Just discharge the old cartridge, snap on the new one and your all set.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well. Gets a great smooth shave. The sample I received from Gillette has left me silly smooth and non irritated! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I received this for free from Gillett.  I&#x27;ve used one of these for about a month now.  I use it about 2 times per week.  Its stayed sharp enough, but at this point (about 7-8 uses) it&#x27;s time to change the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, good solid razor, but there are many out there that offer the same features and work just as well.  This does the job, but I couldn&#x27;t notice anything special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation: If you like the price and want a specific razor for areas besides your face, buy it, it&#x27;ll work well.  If you&#x27;re looking for &amp; expecting something special and buying based on that, there is probably something better out there if you&#x27;re willing to spend more.</li>
            <li> My only criticism is price. It works beautifully but the price is kinda high. Delivers a great body shave. Not a single cut so far.</li>
            <li> The cartridge fit snuggly on the blade and stayed in place while shaving. The shave was very close and I only cut myself once or twice... But that should improve with practice. Overall I would highly recommend this product and all of Gillette&#x27;s shaving products. I look forward to spending more time on the beach this summer! ** given to me as a free sample by Gillette</li>
            <li> I received a Gillette Body Cartridge to test out with my Gillette Body Razor from Gillette as a BzzAgent, and was very happy with the product.  I have used products in the past that claim to be full body razors when the implementation at least one time consisted of a strange \\&quot;wire guard\\&quot; that covered the blades to keep nicks and cuts to a minimum, the result was a product that had lots of drag ad plucked hairs instead of cutting.  No such folly in this product the blades appear to be set in such a manner where I had nary a worry of snags, cuts, or nicks.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold. The rounded head allows easier shaving of intricate areas.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from Gillette and it seems like the razor doesn&#x27;t do a great job at removing the hair like the product says it does.  It takes a lot more effort and time than I&#x27;ve had to do with other products. Small changes may improve this product and i&#x27;d be happy to retry this product again.</li>
            <li> Gillette was nice enough to send me a free sample to review and with that here we go. I know this thing is for the \\&quot;body\\&quot; but i&#x27;m not playing around with a dozen and a half things while trying to clean up this work great on my arms, legs, chest, neck and even touch up to my face.My only issue is it could use a more pivot to give it a better range of motion and maybe comfortable grip overall.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Body Blades themselves are great. On the more expensive side but still good. They seem to last and stay sharp, the lubricating strip starts out great but fades soon after the first few shaves. It glides smooth over the skin with minimal tugging. I think the power version would work better and get a closer shave but all in all great product, thanks Gillette for letting me try this out!</li>
            <li> I really like these cartridges for the razor. Smooth clean shave, no complaints here. Works well with the Gillette Body shaving gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received this item for free from the brand in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> Received this from Gillette to try! Loved the easy to change cartridges! This razor gave a close shave and lasts! No complaints here, this is a product I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Meh. The first one on the unit wore out pretty quickly. I wouldn&#x27;t bother with this razor and it&#x27;s refills. Here&#x27;s my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Gillette was awesome enough to send me this new razor and shave gel but I used it and I feel it was just average and here&#x27;s why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Idk about you but when I shave body hair I do it in the shower. Clean up is easier and hair washes down the drain. Easy. I used this razor 4-5 times. Times 1-2 great. It was sharp cut through the pubes nicely no pull no tugging. No problems. Times 3-4 I noticed the built in lube strip dried out and was wearing off. :/&lt;br /&gt;4-5th time it was gone. Broke apart and the blades dulled and It started pulling Very disappointing. My Gillette pro glide fusion is better.  But thanks Gillette for sending me the free product in exchange for the review!</li>
            <li> Good shavers, but could be cheaper in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This razor works much better than any other I have used prior for shaving my &amp;#34;man parts&amp;#34; and I have thicker than normal hair. I reccommend you try it for yourself.</li>
            <li> Better than disposable razors and at an amazing price!  Most razors are much more expensive and don&#x27;t get a closet shave.  I get a close shave!</li>
            <li> Got this product for free from Gillette and love it! It&#x27;s super easy to change and keep a smooth soft shave every time!</li>
            <li> These have an interesting design; however, the design which is intended to &amp;#34;protect&amp;#34; while shaving &amp;#34;sensitive areas&amp;#34; really hinders a smooth shave.  Shaving each day and exercising care in doing so is just as effective and much less costly.</li>
            <li> I received this razor from Gillette for testing and review a little while ago.  These cartridges tend to last at an average rate as other razor cartridges.  The blades were quite sharp and provided me with a close shave, which lasted for a decent time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would reccommend this razor to anyone who is looking for a good shave.</li>
            <li> Great to get a close shave and avoid painful stinging afterwards. Leaves the area so smooth! Slides well and fits through the contours of the skin. I love this razor!</li>
            <li> First of all they are very expensive as you know if you bought the shaver. It does a very good job for the area it is designed for. During shaving the area, I did not receive any of the usual nicks as with a regular razor.  Also it is a lot easier and faster doing the whole body and not worrying about the nicks. The razor leaves the whole body clean and smooth. OH, yes my partner loves the razor. By the way guys, if you work it right all you have to do is lie down and let your partner do all the work.&lt;br /&gt;JUST make sure that your partner is in a GOOD MOOD!!!!&lt;br /&gt;OH, what we do for our partners!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> NOPE, I don&#x27;t like them at all, they cut like a butter knife and dull way too quickly. They clog up way to fast and take forever to use. I threw them away after two uses, not worth you money or time.</li>
            <li> Excellent, especially when used with Gillette&#x27;s body shave gel.</li>
            <li> great for manscaping because of the flexible blade head and giant pads. doesn&#x27;t leave any razor burns or bumps like cheaper ones do. it is a bit more expensive however the skin care seems to pay off</li>
            <li> Someone bought (or got suckered into buying) a razor for $80.00! They have these stores here in NYC that just do shaves and sell shaving materials. As a women who cares but a male friend purchased a few (must have had a pretty girl behind the counter) and gave me the $100.00 razor. It is the best design I have ever used all these cartridges are way to expensive if you ask me. These are the only ones that fit that razor. Are they good? yes so far better then Venus and the other sticky mess with all the moisturizing and gels that they now add on, ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being the same price as Venus and others this so far is by far the best but I am not shaving my face this is known for your body. Not much difference then the 99 cent Bic disposable but it was a gift so I accepted it graciously lol!</li>
            <li> Ouch. Okay it wasn&#x27;t that bad, but I had a couple slices  I won&#x27;t be risking that again...  I&#x27;ll stick with body groomers.</li>
            <li> These blades are a tad expensive but they are great! Super sharp. Little to no irritation anywhere. I don&#x27;t have the clogging problem and I have thick hair. Maybe people just don&#x27;t rinse it out enough.</li>
            <li> I was given a chance to try the Gillette Body Razor free from Gillette and found it to be amazing, but the real deal engineered part that actually makes all the difference in a good shave-the blades and soft gel pads. This combination allows the ability to use it on my face and body without having to have two specialized razors, which is a big plus. To me the head design looks like a women&#x27;s razor in shape and layout, I have yet to set it side by side my fiance&#x27;s razor but eh close enough. Also, with it having round edges it moves and cuts effortlessly. Having only 3 blades made me slightly worried, as my normal razor has 4, but I was worried for nothing. It cut really well and left smooth skin without irritation. The gel pads seem adequate, but I have a feeling they won&#x27;t last as long as the blades will. Now, for the single downside I can find with this razor--it needs a trim blade located on the head like the other men&#x27;s Gillette razors for hard to reach areas and to complete it versatility of use for your face and body.</li>
            <li> I received this product free from Gillette to review. I really like how it had a rounded head for body comfort. It also has 3 lubricating strips which helps ensure an outstanding glide, and also has 3 PowerGlide floating blades for a close shave, which is much needed!  This is perfect, because these last me about a month, so 4 months out of these! Awesome!</li>
            <li> While the cartridges do get the job done, I do feel as though the purchase price was far to high for such a average quality razor.</li>
            <li> avoid razor burn and buy these. well with all the packaging that we have in this world. safe assured that this isn&#x27;t as bulky of a package as most out there. also it is easy to get into, unlike most other packages out there. so just save time and money, buy the razor and refill cartridges. lets be honest this is the best for your money.</li>
            <li> I got these from the brand! They work amazing! no nicks and no complaints here they shaved very smoothly! nice work gillette</li>
            <li> I liked the way the blade works even though it isn&#x27;t a 5 blade.  I needed to change my blade more frequently than my previous razor.  I did however like how smooth and close my shave was.</li>
            <li> This cartridge is perfect. One of these lasts about a month for me. So I will get 4 months out of these razors. They are perfect!</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because the gillette body cartridges are amazing. They completely remove body hair to my liking. They are a bit pricey but very worth it. They are easy to assemble to the razor. I would reccomend these cartridges to any man who is tired of unwanted body hair. It seemed to me that my hair didnt grow back as fast either. The razor is very comfortable to hold. The soap strips make your skin feel extra soft. I love these cartridges. I would reccomed you try them so you love them as well</li>
            <li> these blades did everything i expected it to and even more.its a close shave with no raxor burn and bumps. i do think its expensive to buy 2 razors one for body n one for face i think this raxor sjouls have been all in one.</li>
            <li> It doesnt last very long and they are very pricey for what they are. I received Gillette body cartridge for free from Gillette</li>
            <li> I like them, They shave well. But the price could really be cheaper. To be honest they don&#x27;t shave as well as my electric but its ok</li>
            <li> I liked using the Gilette Body razor.  I usually use an electric shaver, but last night I tried this new one  and it got a very smooth, close shave without leaving red razor burn behind.  The gel from the razor itself was slimey and moisturizing, which I really like.  It was gliding over my skin and didnt seem to have a problem with the coarse hair on my chest area.</li>
            <li> They shave so well. It&#x27;s a must have.</li>
            <li> When I first received my Gillette Body Razor and cartridge from Gillette I didn&#x27;t think three blades were enough. After using the razor I discovered that three blades on the cartridge were perfect for those sensitive areas. The razor cartridge allowed for a close shave without any nicks due to the smooth rounded edges and helpful strips above and below the blades.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that it didn&#x27;t come with the handle. I have a Gillette razor and that handle is not compatible.</li>
            <li> does what it says and is better in the shower than my regular mach3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my only knock is that it&#x27;s not available for subr &amp; save, but that&#x27;s about Zon and not the product.. price seems fair for Name Brand razors</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work better than my standard Gillette razor cartridges, but it&#x27;s better than a single blade.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try this free from Gillette and honestly the cartridge itself wasn&#x27;t anything special. My wife has nicer cartridges on her Venus razor to be honest. This cartridge got really clogged up the first once over. I would suggest trimming down and then using this to finish up. It not really strong enough to take care of everything by itself. Like I said pretty decent razor but nothing special. I wouldn&#x27;t get this one again personally.</li>
            <li> These blades really aren&#x27;t any better or different than a standard gillette blade. They work pretty well and all, but I fail to see the point of owning two types of razor blades that work pretty much the same. The only thing I can say these do better than the regular blades is travel conveniently, as each individual blade is packaged in a waterproof packet, not like the 5 packs of regular gillette blades that get rusty if you leave them in the shower or anywhere humid enough (like the bathroom)</li>
            <li> The razor does not shave well at all. I wonder if I could return it?</li>
            <li> They do just what they are supposed to do, almost no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> Best blades I have found for body shaving!</li>
