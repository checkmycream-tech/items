            <li>story short; I decided to try this and was truly impressed.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this stuff to anyone and just ordered more :)</li>
            <li>I hope this helps someone anyway &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Really it makes me happy.</li>
            <li>My Hair has never looked so healthy and shiny (shiny not greasy).  </li>
            <li>I Love it.</li>
            <li>Many Argan oil&#x27;s are amber in color</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll need to change your pillow case more often.</li>
            <li>Slice of Nature&#x27;s argan oil is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I never let myself run out of it and considering the amount of money I have blown through the decades on acne, wrinkle, creams, washes, and more</li>
            <li>This product is much better and a lot more healthy.</li>
            <li>After started using this Argan Oil, my face looks much better</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not spending a lot of money on it any more.</li>
            <li>I am much pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I am much very much pleased.</li>
            <li>Slice of Nature service was so helpful and they even provided more insight and instructions on how to use their products and the benefits they bring.</li>
            <li>Her hair has never been better.</li>
            <li>She gets so many more complements on her hair now.</li>
            <li>I use this oil on my face &amp; scalp &amp; love the results.</li>
            <li>I am very much satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>I use it morning and night, and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>so I decided to purchase the three organic ones offered on Amazon that interest me the most.</li>
            <li>I am dermographic and have allergies to most OTC acne products (anything with benzoyl peroxide) and fragrance (balsam of peru).</li>
            <li>but i am glad to say that i dont use ANY of the prescriptions anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil has saved my skin.</li>
            <li>cant tell you how much i love this product.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>I also use it on my hair, and it makes my hair softer and more managable.  </li>
            <li>but my face feels more supple and I will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>but I would like to give it more time.  </li>
            <li>Has many uses.  </li>
            <li>Im glad I tried this</li>
            <li>I ordered this oil, and was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Well, we&#x27;re really glad we got it.</li>
            <li>I am much satisfied.</li>
            <li>I have been using Argan Oil for a year now and love the benefits of it.</li>
            <li>Ok I have had acne since I was 14.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for many months now.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>So far so good !</li>
            <li>This is an effective budget friendly serum to brighten my skin.</li>
            <li>I have used many brands and types of Argan Oil but the “Slice of Nature” Argan Oil seems to be showing results very quickly.</li>
            <li>With a recent order you sent along a free sample of argan oil and boy, let me tell you, this oil is the best!  </li>
            <li>mostly use it on my face and sometimes my hair, to smooth static and to prevent split ends.</li>
            <li>I was happy because it is natural but was concerned the oil would cause more breakouts.  </li>
            <li>and I have not seen a single split end which is awesome.</li>
            <li>Loving it so much!!</li>
            <li>I also love how moisturized and smooth my face feels now.</li>
            <li>This is the ideal step to add to your daily routine after blow-drying.</li>
            <li>Great natural product everyone should have in the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>This brand performs equally as good, and very affordable.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly into my skin without making me feel oily.</li>
            <li>The smell is very mild and I dont mind it.</li>
            <li>For some, the cost my seem high, but for the length of time it lasts, it is a good value compared to department store products.  </li>
            <li>This oil is very light and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>THIS IS THE REAL STUFF (very many sellers on the market today sell fakes,</li>
            <li>Argan oil is hands down the best oil I have ever used on my hair.</li>
            <li>Its light, absorbs easily into the skin with no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>This stuff is so pure and amazing.</li>
            <li>I think it moisturizes perfectly and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or gross...nice and light.</li>
            <li>I use it to moisturize my lips and around my eyes, which has helped to keep them in sound look.</li>
            <li>also appreciate your fast courteous service.  </li>
            <li>This oil brought back memories lol.</li>
            <li>I think the smell is rather nice, and it doesn&#x27;t really linger afterward.</li>
            <li>The product is light on the skin and non greasy.</li>
            <li>use it on my face and hands daily, then I rub the excess through my hair, stopping fly aways and moisturizing the ends.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth on your skin, and practically heals over night the blemishes and breakouts.  </li>
            <li>This oil is so gentle and repairs skin so nicely.</li>
            <li>I think this Slice of Nature brand is far superior.</li>
            <li>Applied to my hair, it&#x27;s ok, not as good as the ONE N ONLY ARGAN OIL from Sally&#x27;s though.</li>
            <li>so I took it as a good sign that the product was indeed 100% natural.</li>
            <li>I am loving this stuff it really moisturize and absorbs quickly in my skin.</li>
            <li>Nothing to worry about because the natural scent dissipates quickly and the fact that this oil is undeodorized is a good thing.</li>
            <li>It feels, what I guess you would call, rich.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to find this one.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t notice a significant difference with my brown patch on my face.</li>
            <li>I love this oil so much!  </li>
            <li>Out of sheer curiosity with no expectation of anything remarkable, I started to apply this to an area of my tummy where I have stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it does exactly what it says,  </li>
            <li>Two drops at the most for your whole face will suffice!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought many other argan oils and this has been the best quality by far in texture, smell, and result.</li>
            <li>The Slice of Nature company is fabulous for quick efficient service.</li>
            <li>and I put this on at nite on after I clean my face and by AM</li>
            <li>Gentle, healing and soothing; great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this product before and will continue to do so since Amazon offers it at such a great price!  </li>
            <li>Organic, cold pressed, fair price, quality is excellent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for dry hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean and keeps dryness at bay without being &#x27;oily&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I use argan oil on my face and hair and its such a great way to hydrate your skin and keep it looking healthy, bring back that healthy glow we all want.</li>
            <li>The antioxidant properties of Argan oil will certainly make you age more gracefully.</li>
            <li>I love this Slice of Nature Pure Virgin Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li>My skin drinks it right up!</li>
            <li>Great for after being in the sun for too long also!!!</li>
            <li>to prove even MORE how great this oil is, i ran out when i was moving to another state (for about 5 days), and after about 48 hours my allergies returned and i started breaking out in all the usual places.</li>
            <li>thanks me for it every day : )  </li>
            <li>What a nice and unexpected surprise.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true to its description.</li>
            <li>They are both light oils that are well absorbed into the hair.</li>
            <li>Oh...and it&#x27;s also a good facial moisturizer</li>
            <li>You can research it easily to find out what kind of benefits it actually has for your skin and the lengthy processing that has helped women&#x27;s rights in Morocco.</li>
            <li>Very quick to get this at my home, man you are fast!</li>
            <li>It is the ideal hair conditioner and it even helps to treat my split ends and tame frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I am happy with its outcome and I will be trying it on my hair for other results.</li>
            <li>For almost two years I have gone the organic route in terms of my haircare and skincare and I have benefited tremendously for it.</li>
            <li>has no odor, and absorbs quickly into the skin, I like to add it to lotion myself but works well alone.</li>
            <li>Received this item quickly and packaged well.  </li>
            <li>My daughter developed wrinkles and stretch marks and wasn’t feeling great having at this early age.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended it to all my friends, as most of us have scalp issues.</li>
            <li>I really love this company and their high quality products.</li>
            <li>Argan Oil has become my new favorite moisturizer, hair treatment, lip balm, etc...</li>
            <li>I have a new favorite product and thank you so much for sending that free sample</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found another amazing natural all-in-one eye product that works really well.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin very silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>Argan is oil is pricey but it is so worth it.</li>
            <li>so I have to be more conscious of what I use.</li>
            <li>So far I am very much pleased with its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>I stumbled upon argan oil and figured it was worth a shot for her problem.</li>
            <li>Well pleased so far and would be ordering again from them.</li>
            <li>It was hard at first getting over the stigma of putting oil on my face but let me tell you this stuff is amazing!!</li>
            <li>I was introduced to this product by a friend several months ago and fell in love with it since..it is easy to apply and spread easily on this old skin:-0</li>
            <li>Fine lines have pretty much disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>and right now i feel the diference is drastic.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t want to get processed Argan Oil just for the scent because you&#x27;ll lose some of the amazing benefits of a pure natural oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Jose Moran&#x27;s oil was much lighter in texture, color, and no unpleasant smell like Slice of Nature.</li>
            <li>i used this alone for some weeks with only smooth skin till i decided to get some tea tree oil to clean my skin 1st then put the argan oil after</li>
            <li>Anyways I have super dry skin when I don&#x27;t moisturize and oily when I do and most every moisturizer breaks me out eventually.</li>
            <li>Remember, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;- Excellent under foundation and make-up.</li>
            <li>my face is perfectly clear now but there is a huge difference in that instead of an all over breakout</li>
            <li>Okay: FINALLY I am going to start</li>
            <li>Virgin coconut oil was better than any lotion I have ever used because it deeply hydrates your skin.</li>
            <li>Unlike most body lotions, which basically sit on top of your skin and get washed off the next time you shower, coconut oil&#x27;s effects would last for days.</li>
            <li>I bought the smaller bottle and that is so much better</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have tried (or even heard of) argan oil.</li>
            <li>I personally want every magical bit of my Argan oil, smell and all.</li>
            <li>It is soft, moist and smooth.</li>
            <li>I always soak my face cloth in hot water &amp; place over my argon application.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t fall for other cheap imitations!!</li>
            <li>The real deal!  </li>
            <li>Mostly under my chin and here and there on my back.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>After my shower, I sometimes will use it on my whole body and it soaks in really quickly, does NOT feel greasy, and I really don&#x27;t notice the temporary smell that some people have mentioned.  </li>
            <li>I just want to say this oil is amazing for the skin in short and long terms, in short you will have a smooth skin you may not notice more than that until you use it for months thats where you start seeing a lot of changes.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s hair is frizzy, has split ends, tangles ridiculously easy, and is generally unmanageable.</li>
            <li>The uses of this Argan oil are endless and the results are astounding.</li>
            <li>and I will recommend it to anyone who wants soft, shiny, smooth hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason I absolutely love argan oil is not only because of my skin however, this oil really does wonders for my hair, something that I have struggled with for years.</li>
            <li>When I am getting ready in the morning, by the time I finish blowdrying my hair, the oil has been absorbed and I&#x27;m ready to put on my makeup.  </li>
            <li>However, when I mix it in with coconut oil, lavender oil, and other essential oils, the smell disappears and the benefits are great-</li>
            <li>started out with cold pressed coconut oil (which is awesome because it is healthy to eat as well as use externally).</li>
            <li>Coconut oil feels oily for a while before it soaks in(though when it soaks in, your skin is healthy and moisturized for a long time), while Argan oil feels rich and makes your whole body feel soft and &#x27;dewy&#x27;.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product daily, AM and PM, since early November of 2011 and have experienced the following improvements:&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, out of sheer frustration, I felt that it was more important to find something that actually works.</li>
            <li>Usually whatever is good for you</li>
            <li>This argan oil works really great on itchy dry skin &amp; dry hair/scalp.</li>
            <li>The differences are subtle and most consumers probably would not be able to tell the difference at all.</li>
            <li>The last scratch healed super quick with out the faintest of scars.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and has eased my 61 year old wrinkles</li>
            <li>I wish the large 100 ml bottle came with a dropper.</li>
            <li>it certainly can&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I buy the large bottle and it lasts for about a year</li>
            <li>I try to use it daily and in combination with these other products and the fact that it does not cause additional breakouts (as do many other synthetic moisturizers I have tried), I believe it has greatly helped improve the appearance and feel of my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m elated to find a skin care product that is not only 100% pure and natural, but works better than I ever could have imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazingly, within few days, she found successive up gradation on everything.</li>
            <li>a real find</li>
            <li>very moisturized.</li>
            <li>This keeps my face very moisturized without the worry.</li>
            <li>I buy this brand because it is the only one that explained the difference in the types of Argan oil available in the market place.  </li>
            <li>The argan oil makes the appearance of my complexion much nicer.</li>
            <li>Their Argan oil absorbs very well into my skin, is not greasy</li>
            <li>I would much rather use this rather than the chemical laden products on the market today.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to keep products I use for health and wellness as simple and free of all petro ingredients and this oil</li>
            <li>You can also use it for acne inflammation, as it really helps that as well.</li>
            <li>This was an intense treatment</li>
            <li>I like it so much.</li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t any smell to it.</li>
            <li>so I may not use it very often.</li>
            <li>Sent for this, not expecting much as nothing was working.</li>
            <li>In fact, it really cleared up my skin.</li>
            <li>This is the only clear Argan oil I&#x27;ve been able to find.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I use it as a treatment for my feet, and they sure were soft the next day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used another Argan Oil, unfortunately not pure and orange in color, that seems to work better on my hair.</li>
            <li>Over the years, I&#x27;ve spent BIG bucks on skin care products due to my search for the perfect moisturizer, serum, anti-aging fix, acne fighter and primer.</li>
            <li>way, if you are interested in trying something new with your skin care regime, i HIGHHHLLLYYYYYYYY recommend this product</li>
            <li>I am very much satisfied with these Argan oil, after wasting my money in trying out many other oil from other brands to resolve my hair conditioning issues.</li>
            <li>With that said, I took the time because I&#x27;m excited to have FINALLY found a skin care product that works.</li>
            <li>I use this pretty frequently and not sparingly.</li>
            <li>Her 2 surfaces scratches were gone with in 6 hours of first applying - all of us were surprised.</li>
            <li>Firstly it is natural and very versatile!</li>
            <li>I have adult acne that is pretty chronic and have tried everything under the sun</li>
            <li>My skin is prone to breakouts (since I&#x27;ve gotten older)</li>
            <li>my skin wasn&#x27;t as vibrant.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this Argan oil.</li>
            <li>The price is high but the benefits are great and honestly, a little goes a long way so you won&#x27;t run out in just a few weeks.it to anyone who wants soft, shiny, smooth hair.</li>
            <li>The oil is very soothing to my mature skin and after 2 months I think it looks fresher.</li>
            <li>This oil make my skin, face, hair whole body keep moisture and soft skin.  </li>
            <li>I have used it for a week now and the smile lines around my mouth are starting to fade.</li>
            <li>My make-up last all day without any greasy build-up and still looks fresh at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>, now I know why I rarely leave product reviews because this took forever since I&#x27;m such a darn perfectionist.</li>
            <li>My family uses almost every possible and useful oils from them.</li>
            <li>As for my hair, its nice, but not amazing.</li>
            <li>I also liked this product because it comes in a thick glass bottle with a spray pump.</li>
            <li>Clears up my skin, keeps it clean and keeps it from being too dull and dry, absorbs oil quickly, feels light but moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Another thing is eldery people and people with dry skin will feel a better result than someone with normal skin in short terms .</li>
            <li>For a person with ridiculously OILY skin, I LOVE this stuff!  </li>
            <li>It does not cause me to break out; it absorbs relatively quickly; it keeps my skin moisturized a LONG time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little oily when I first apply it on my face after a shower, however, by the time I&#x27;m ready to apply some makeup, it has mostly absorbed.  </li>
            <li>While I think I may have squared away some of the new breakout triggers, I have found the Argan oil helps dramatically with clearing up my acne/rash breakout.  </li>
            <li>VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>even after using it for a week i noticed a pretty big difference in my skin tone...</li>
            <li>I also use it to moisturize my lips and around my eyes, which has helped to keep those old crow&#x27;s feet at bay!  </li>
            <li>This brand is also, by far, the cheapest!</li>
            <li>What surprised me were the healing properties!</li>
            <li>I just recently got interested in natural products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a lifelong battle with acne and this is the first product that really works.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not worth for it&#x27;s cost, Shea butter does a better job and last longer.</li>
            <li>It makes such a huge difference on my cuticles since they are always dry.</li>
            <li>The price is high but the benefits are great and honestly, a little goes a long way so you won&#x27;t run out in just a few weeks.</li>
            <li>my complexion is so clear and</li>
            <li>This Argan oil is untoasted is mostly clear.</li>
            <li>I am just starting out with it, but so far it feels like a very healing type of oil for my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is similar to home made food in a ranch vs a fast food in the city</li>
            <li>all till you get old and have a lot of health</li>
            <li>my acne has reduced considerably.</li>
            <li>and since I started adding argan oil to it, my skin has never looked so clear and felt so soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use it as a moisturizer, in the summer months, by applying it directly to damp skin, at the end of my shower.  </li>
            <li>old daughter is now using this too</li>
            <li>Evens out skin tone making it soft and supple.</li>
            <li>Just like my food, I prefer Organic or Natural.</li>
            <li>I use just on face , however it can be a complete all-over moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to start using a completely natural product so after some research I came across this Slice of Nature</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product, after only using this for a short amount of time I have noticed a significant increase in the shine and moisture in my baby’s hair and a glow on her skin.</li>
            <li>, my formerly rough elbows are as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom and argan oil has rejuvenated my dry hair.  </li>
            <li>but personally I do not mind as it sinks in quickly.</li>
            <li>Upon receiving a rush order of argan oil, my skin was back to normal within three days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>THIS IS DEFINITELY 100% PURE ARGAN OIL, which is the only ingredient listed on label...</li>
            <li>This product is every bit as good as its expensive counterparts sold through various cosmetic companies, at a fraction of the price!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Two problems: first, the atomizer isn&#x27;t really an atomizer, i.e. the product comes out in a very narrow squirt; my understanding of an atomizer is a spray.</li>
            <li>My face has cleared up and my scars from past blemishes have significantly lightened.  </li>
            <li>i prefer a ugly bottle with amazing results than a pretty bottle and spend money in something that never works,&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also helps keep my skin luminous and keeps the delicate skin under my eyes hydrated and free of wrinkly look.  </li>
            <li>I am a 25 yr old male.</li>
            <li>I use it every day prior to my old moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I finally found something that works and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This Argan oil addresses my dry patches immediately whereas my normal face cream doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>At first I was put off by the smell of Argan oil, but it took me couple of days to get used to it, as Slice of Nature brand has a milder scent than others I have used previously.  </li>
            <li>; it is kind of hard to get out of the bottle(takes a lot of shaking) but a little goes</li>
            <li>I purchased the other Argan Oil from QVC and paid 3 times as much for it, as this brand.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only do i not break out, if i have the rare little pimple, the argan oil neutralizes and soothes it.....</li>
            <li>I tried adding a few drops of argon oil to a particularly itchy area, but while it soothed it for a few moments, I&#x27;m so much convinced that it was the real remedy to the situation.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and have been using Argan Oil for a few years, but this was my first time to purchase this particular brand.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs fairly quickly and a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>All you need is very little, so the price is worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 100% Pure, Natural, Raw, virgin Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>My 5 yr old had scratches on her face, 2 were minor surfaces</li>
            <li>This product does have a slight scent, but after using it a couple of times, I can&#x27;t detect the scent as much.  </li>
            <li>; the first time I took a whiff it reminded me of the Mexican cheese my mother loves to bring back from Mexico and ever since I was little</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cleaner and less expensive to use a dropper with having more control on how much is dispensed and not having to touch the oil or the rim.</li>
            <li>The Slice of Nature has the freshest odor of the three and smells a little nutty too; skin application feels very soothing and calming in a quenching sensation sort of way.</li>
            <li>In my twenties my skin cleared but I would have occasional periods of break outs combined with really dry flaking skin, also in hindsight due to a very drying glycolic product.  </li>

            <li> I Love it.</li>
            <li> Many Argan oil&#x27;s are amber in color</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need to change your pillow case more often.</li>
            <li> Slice of Nature&#x27;s argan oil is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I never let myself run out of it and considering the amount of money I have blown through the decades on acne, wrinkle, creams, washes, and more</li>
            <li> This product is much better and a lot more healthy.</li>
            <li> After started using this Argan Oil, my face looks much better</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not spending a lot of money on it any more.</li>
            <li> I am much pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I am much very much pleased.</li>
            <li> Slice of Nature service was so helpful and they even provided more insight and instructions on how to use their products and the benefits they bring.</li>
            <li> Her hair has never been better.</li>
            <li> She gets so many more complements on her hair now.</li>
            <li> I use this oil on my face &amp; scalp &amp; love the results.</li>
            <li> I am very much satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I use it morning and night, and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> so I decided to purchase the three organic ones offered on Amazon that interest me the most.</li>
            <li> I am dermographic and have allergies to most OTC acne products (anything with benzoyl peroxide) and fragrance (balsam of peru).</li>
            <li> but i am glad to say that i dont use ANY of the prescriptions anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil has saved my skin.</li>
            <li> cant tell you how much i love this product.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> I also use it on my hair, and it makes my hair softer and more managable.  </li>
            <li> but my face feels more supple and I will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> but I would like to give it more time.  </li>
            <li> Has many uses.  </li>
            <li> Im glad I tried this</li>
            <li> I ordered this oil, and was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Well, we&#x27;re really glad we got it.</li>
            <li> I am much satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have been using Argan Oil for a year now and love the benefits of it.</li>
            <li> Ok I have had acne since I was 14.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for many months now.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> So far so good !</li>
            <li> This is an effective budget friendly serum to brighten my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used many brands and types of Argan Oil but the “Slice of Nature” Argan Oil seems to be showing results very quickly.</li>
            <li> With a recent order you sent along a free sample of argan oil and boy, let me tell you, this oil is the best!  </li>
            <li> mostly use it on my face and sometimes my hair, to smooth static and to prevent split ends.</li>
            <li> I was happy because it is natural but was concerned the oil would cause more breakouts.  </li>
            <li> and I have not seen a single split end which is awesome.</li>
            <li> Loving it so much!!</li>
            <li> I also love how moisturized and smooth my face feels now.</li>
            <li> This is the ideal step to add to your daily routine after blow-drying.</li>
            <li> Great natural product everyone should have in the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> This brand performs equally as good, and very affordable.</li>
            <li> It absorbs very quickly into my skin without making me feel oily.</li>
            <li> The smell is very mild and I dont mind it.</li>
            <li> For some, the cost my seem high, but for the length of time it lasts, it is a good value compared to department store products.  </li>
            <li> This oil is very light and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE REAL STUFF (very many sellers on the market today sell fakes,</li>
            <li> Argan oil is hands down the best oil I have ever used on my hair.</li>
            <li> Its light, absorbs easily into the skin with no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so pure and amazing.</li>
            <li> I think it moisturizes perfectly and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or gross...nice and light.</li>
            <li> I use it to moisturize my lips and around my eyes, which has helped to keep them in sound look.</li>
            <li> also appreciate your fast courteous service.  </li>
            <li> This oil brought back memories lol.</li>
            <li> I think the smell is rather nice, and it doesn&#x27;t really linger afterward.</li>
            <li> The product is light on the skin and non greasy.</li>
            <li> use it on my face and hands daily, then I rub the excess through my hair, stopping fly aways and moisturizing the ends.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth on your skin, and practically heals over night the blemishes and breakouts.  </li>
            <li> This oil is so gentle and repairs skin so nicely.</li>
            <li> I think this Slice of Nature brand is far superior.</li>
            <li> Applied to my hair, it&#x27;s ok, not as good as the ONE N ONLY ARGAN OIL from Sally&#x27;s though.</li>
            <li> so I took it as a good sign that the product was indeed 100% natural.</li>
            <li> I am loving this stuff it really moisturize and absorbs quickly in my skin.</li>
            <li> Nothing to worry about because the natural scent dissipates quickly and the fact that this oil is undeodorized is a good thing.</li>
            <li> It feels, what I guess you would call, rich.</li>
            <li> so I was excited to find this one.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t notice a significant difference with my brown patch on my face.</li>
            <li> I love this oil so much!  </li>
            <li> Out of sheer curiosity with no expectation of anything remarkable, I started to apply this to an area of my tummy where I have stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it does exactly what it says,  </li>
            <li> Two drops at the most for your whole face will suffice!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought many other argan oils and this has been the best quality by far in texture, smell, and result.</li>
            <li> The Slice of Nature company is fabulous for quick efficient service.</li>
            <li> and I put this on at nite on after I clean my face and by AM</li>
            <li> Gentle, healing and soothing; great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product before and will continue to do so since Amazon offers it at such a great price!  </li>
            <li> Organic, cold pressed, fair price, quality is excellent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for dry hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clean and keeps dryness at bay without being &#x27;oily&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I use argan oil on my face and hair and its such a great way to hydrate your skin and keep it looking healthy, bring back that healthy glow we all want.</li>
            <li> The antioxidant properties of Argan oil will certainly make you age more gracefully.</li>
            <li> I love this Slice of Nature Pure Virgin Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li> My skin drinks it right up!</li>
            <li> Great for after being in the sun for too long also!!!</li>
            <li> to prove even MORE how great this oil is, i ran out when i was moving to another state (for about 5 days), and after about 48 hours my allergies returned and i started breaking out in all the usual places.</li>
            <li> thanks me for it every day : )  </li>
            <li> What a nice and unexpected surprise.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true to its description.</li>
            <li> They are both light oils that are well absorbed into the hair.</li>
            <li> Oh...and it&#x27;s also a good facial moisturizer</li>
            <li> You can research it easily to find out what kind of benefits it actually has for your skin and the lengthy processing that has helped women&#x27;s rights in Morocco.</li>
            <li> Very quick to get this at my home, man you are fast!</li>
            <li> It is the ideal hair conditioner and it even helps to treat my split ends and tame frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I am happy with its outcome and I will be trying it on my hair for other results.</li>
            <li> For almost two years I have gone the organic route in terms of my haircare and skincare and I have benefited tremendously for it.</li>
            <li> has no odor, and absorbs quickly into the skin, I like to add it to lotion myself but works well alone.</li>
            <li> Received this item quickly and packaged well.  </li>
            <li> My daughter developed wrinkles and stretch marks and wasn’t feeling great having at this early age.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended it to all my friends, as most of us have scalp issues.</li>
            <li> I really love this company and their high quality products.</li>
            <li> Argan Oil has become my new favorite moisturizer, hair treatment, lip balm, etc...</li>
            <li> I have a new favorite product and thank you so much for sending that free sample</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found another amazing natural all-in-one eye product that works really well.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin very silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> Argan is oil is pricey but it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> so I have to be more conscious of what I use.</li>
            <li> So far I am very much pleased with its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon argan oil and figured it was worth a shot for her problem.</li>
            <li> Well pleased so far and would be ordering again from them.</li>
            <li> It was hard at first getting over the stigma of putting oil on my face but let me tell you this stuff is amazing!!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by a friend several months ago and fell in love with it since..it is easy to apply and spread easily on this old skin:-0</li>
            <li> Fine lines have pretty much disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> and right now i feel the diference is drastic.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t want to get processed Argan Oil just for the scent because you&#x27;ll lose some of the amazing benefits of a pure natural oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Jose Moran&#x27;s oil was much lighter in texture, color, and no unpleasant smell like Slice of Nature.</li>
            <li> i used this alone for some weeks with only smooth skin till i decided to get some tea tree oil to clean my skin 1st then put the argan oil after</li>
            <li> Anyways I have super dry skin when I don&#x27;t moisturize and oily when I do and most every moisturizer breaks me out eventually.</li>
            <li> Remember, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;- Excellent under foundation and make-up.</li>
            <li> my face is perfectly clear now but there is a huge difference in that instead of an all over breakout</li>
            <li> Okay: FINALLY I am going to start</li>
            <li> Virgin coconut oil was better than any lotion I have ever used because it deeply hydrates your skin.</li>
            <li> Unlike most body lotions, which basically sit on top of your skin and get washed off the next time you shower, coconut oil&#x27;s effects would last for days.</li>
            <li> I bought the smaller bottle and that is so much better</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried (or even heard of) argan oil.</li>
            <li> I personally want every magical bit of my Argan oil, smell and all.</li>
            <li> It is soft, moist and smooth.</li>
            <li> I always soak my face cloth in hot water &amp; place over my argon application.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t fall for other cheap imitations!!</li>
            <li> The real deal!  </li>
            <li> Mostly under my chin and here and there on my back.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> After my shower, I sometimes will use it on my whole body and it soaks in really quickly, does NOT feel greasy, and I really don&#x27;t notice the temporary smell that some people have mentioned.  </li>
            <li> I just want to say this oil is amazing for the skin in short and long terms, in short you will have a smooth skin you may not notice more than that until you use it for months thats where you start seeing a lot of changes.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s hair is frizzy, has split ends, tangles ridiculously easy, and is generally unmanageable.</li>
            <li> The uses of this Argan oil are endless and the results are astounding.</li>
            <li> and I will recommend it to anyone who wants soft, shiny, smooth hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I absolutely love argan oil is not only because of my skin however, this oil really does wonders for my hair, something that I have struggled with for years.</li>
            <li> When I am getting ready in the morning, by the time I finish blowdrying my hair, the oil has been absorbed and I&#x27;m ready to put on my makeup.  </li>
            <li> However, when I mix it in with coconut oil, lavender oil, and other essential oils, the smell disappears and the benefits are great-</li>
            <li> started out with cold pressed coconut oil (which is awesome because it is healthy to eat as well as use externally).</li>
            <li> Coconut oil feels oily for a while before it soaks in(though when it soaks in, your skin is healthy and moisturized for a long time), while Argan oil feels rich and makes your whole body feel soft and &#x27;dewy&#x27;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product daily, AM and PM, since early November of 2011 and have experienced the following improvements:&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, out of sheer frustration, I felt that it was more important to find something that actually works.</li>
            <li> Usually whatever is good for you</li>
            <li> This argan oil works really great on itchy dry skin &amp; dry hair/scalp.</li>
            <li> The differences are subtle and most consumers probably would not be able to tell the difference at all.</li>
            <li> The last scratch healed super quick with out the faintest of scars.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and has eased my 61 year old wrinkles</li>
            <li> I wish the large 100 ml bottle came with a dropper.</li>
            <li> it certainly can&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I buy the large bottle and it lasts for about a year</li>
            <li> I try to use it daily and in combination with these other products and the fact that it does not cause additional breakouts (as do many other synthetic moisturizers I have tried), I believe it has greatly helped improve the appearance and feel of my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m elated to find a skin care product that is not only 100% pure and natural, but works better than I ever could have imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amazingly, within few days, she found successive up gradation on everything.</li>
            <li> a real find</li>
            <li> very moisturized.</li>
            <li> This keeps my face very moisturized without the worry.</li>
            <li> I buy this brand because it is the only one that explained the difference in the types of Argan oil available in the market place.  </li>
            <li> The argan oil makes the appearance of my complexion much nicer.</li>
            <li> Their Argan oil absorbs very well into my skin, is not greasy</li>
            <li> I would much rather use this rather than the chemical laden products on the market today.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to keep products I use for health and wellness as simple and free of all petro ingredients and this oil</li>
            <li> You can also use it for acne inflammation, as it really helps that as well.</li>
            <li> This was an intense treatment</li>
            <li> I like it so much.</li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t any smell to it.</li>
            <li> so I may not use it very often.</li>
            <li> Sent for this, not expecting much as nothing was working.</li>
            <li> In fact, it really cleared up my skin.</li>
            <li> This is the only clear Argan oil I&#x27;ve been able to find.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I use it as a treatment for my feet, and they sure were soft the next day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used another Argan Oil, unfortunately not pure and orange in color, that seems to work better on my hair.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve spent BIG bucks on skin care products due to my search for the perfect moisturizer, serum, anti-aging fix, acne fighter and primer.</li>
            <li> way, if you are interested in trying something new with your skin care regime, i HIGHHHLLLYYYYYYYY recommend this product</li>
            <li> I am very much satisfied with these Argan oil, after wasting my money in trying out many other oil from other brands to resolve my hair conditioning issues.</li>
            <li> With that said, I took the time because I&#x27;m excited to have FINALLY found a skin care product that works.</li>
            <li> I use this pretty frequently and not sparingly.</li>
            <li> Her 2 surfaces scratches were gone with in 6 hours of first applying - all of us were surprised.</li>
            <li> Firstly it is natural and very versatile!</li>
            <li> I have adult acne that is pretty chronic and have tried everything under the sun</li>
            <li> My skin is prone to breakouts (since I&#x27;ve gotten older)</li>
            <li> my skin wasn&#x27;t as vibrant.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this Argan oil.</li>
            <li> The price is high but the benefits are great and honestly, a little goes a long way so you won&#x27;t run out in just a few weeks.it to anyone who wants soft, shiny, smooth hair.</li>
            <li> The oil is very soothing to my mature skin and after 2 months I think it looks fresher.</li>
            <li> This oil make my skin, face, hair whole body keep moisture and soft skin.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for a week now and the smile lines around my mouth are starting to fade.</li>
            <li> My make-up last all day without any greasy build-up and still looks fresh at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> , now I know why I rarely leave product reviews because this took forever since I&#x27;m such a darn perfectionist.</li>
            <li> My family uses almost every possible and useful oils from them.</li>
            <li> As for my hair, its nice, but not amazing.</li>
            <li> I also liked this product because it comes in a thick glass bottle with a spray pump.</li>
            <li> Clears up my skin, keeps it clean and keeps it from being too dull and dry, absorbs oil quickly, feels light but moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Another thing is eldery people and people with dry skin will feel a better result than someone with normal skin in short terms .</li>
            <li> For a person with ridiculously OILY skin, I LOVE this stuff!  </li>
            <li> It does not cause me to break out; it absorbs relatively quickly; it keeps my skin moisturized a LONG time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little oily when I first apply it on my face after a shower, however, by the time I&#x27;m ready to apply some makeup, it has mostly absorbed.  </li>
            <li> While I think I may have squared away some of the new breakout triggers, I have found the Argan oil helps dramatically with clearing up my acne/rash breakout.  </li>
            <li> VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> even after using it for a week i noticed a pretty big difference in my skin tone...</li>
            <li> I also use it to moisturize my lips and around my eyes, which has helped to keep those old crow&#x27;s feet at bay!  </li>
            <li> This brand is also, by far, the cheapest!</li>
            <li> What surprised me were the healing properties!</li>
            <li> I just recently got interested in natural products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lifelong battle with acne and this is the first product that really works.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth for it&#x27;s cost, Shea butter does a better job and last longer.</li>
            <li> It makes such a huge difference on my cuticles since they are always dry.</li>
            <li> The price is high but the benefits are great and honestly, a little goes a long way so you won&#x27;t run out in just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> my complexion is so clear and</li>
            <li> This Argan oil is untoasted is mostly clear.</li>
            <li> I am just starting out with it, but so far it feels like a very healing type of oil for my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is similar to home made food in a ranch vs a fast food in the city</li>
            <li> all till you get old and have a lot of health</li>
            <li> my acne has reduced considerably.</li>
            <li> and since I started adding argan oil to it, my skin has never looked so clear and felt so soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use it as a moisturizer, in the summer months, by applying it directly to damp skin, at the end of my shower.  </li>
            <li> old daughter is now using this too</li>
            <li> Evens out skin tone making it soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Just like my food, I prefer Organic or Natural.</li>
            <li> I use just on face , however it can be a complete all-over moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to start using a completely natural product so after some research I came across this Slice of Nature</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product, after only using this for a short amount of time I have noticed a significant increase in the shine and moisture in my baby’s hair and a glow on her skin.</li>
            <li> , my formerly rough elbows are as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom and argan oil has rejuvenated my dry hair.  </li>
            <li> but personally I do not mind as it sinks in quickly.</li>
            <li> Upon receiving a rush order of argan oil, my skin was back to normal within three days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> THIS IS DEFINITELY 100% PURE ARGAN OIL, which is the only ingredient listed on label...</li>
            <li> This product is every bit as good as its expensive counterparts sold through various cosmetic companies, at a fraction of the price!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Two problems: first, the atomizer isn&#x27;t really an atomizer, i.e. the product comes out in a very narrow squirt; my understanding of an atomizer is a spray.</li>
            <li> My face has cleared up and my scars from past blemishes have significantly lightened.  </li>
            <li> i prefer a ugly bottle with amazing results than a pretty bottle and spend money in something that never works,&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also helps keep my skin luminous and keeps the delicate skin under my eyes hydrated and free of wrinkly look.  </li>
            <li> I am a 25 yr old male.</li>
            <li> I use it every day prior to my old moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I finally found something that works and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This Argan oil addresses my dry patches immediately whereas my normal face cream doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> At first I was put off by the smell of Argan oil, but it took me couple of days to get used to it, as Slice of Nature brand has a milder scent than others I have used previously.  </li>
            <li> ; it is kind of hard to get out of the bottle(takes a lot of shaking) but a little goes</li>
            <li> I purchased the other Argan Oil from QVC and paid 3 times as much for it, as this brand.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only do i not break out, if i have the rare little pimple, the argan oil neutralizes and soothes it.....</li>
            <li> I tried adding a few drops of argon oil to a particularly itchy area, but while it soothed it for a few moments, I&#x27;m so much convinced that it was the real remedy to the situation.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and have been using Argan Oil for a few years, but this was my first time to purchase this particular brand.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs fairly quickly and a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> All you need is very little, so the price is worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 100% Pure, Natural, Raw, virgin Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> My 5 yr old had scratches on her face, 2 were minor surfaces</li>
            <li> This product does have a slight scent, but after using it a couple of times, I can&#x27;t detect the scent as much.  </li>
            <li> ; the first time I took a whiff it reminded me of the Mexican cheese my mother loves to bring back from Mexico and ever since I was little</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cleaner and less expensive to use a dropper with having more control on how much is dispensed and not having to touch the oil or the rim.</li>
            <li> The Slice of Nature has the freshest odor of the three and smells a little nutty too; skin application feels very soothing and calming in a quenching sensation sort of way.</li>
            <li> In my twenties my skin cleared but I would have occasional periods of break outs combined with really dry flaking skin, also in hindsight due to a very drying glycolic product.  </li>
            <li> The natural scent of this oil is not pretty because it&#x27;s undeodorized.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really doesn&#x27;t seem worth mentioning but there are a few very minor negative&#x27;s with this product:&lt;br</li>
            <li> You basically only need one dime sized amount for face and hair so this should last quite a long time.</li>
            <li> It has corrected dark marks from old pimples, cleared my skin and brightened my complexion.</li>
            <li> , I like the fact that it serves dual purposes, this product will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> My hair used to be dry and frizzy with undefined curls, and since I started buying organic shampoos and looking up essential oils</li>
            <li> I have made her try so many shampoos and masks that it makes her crazy.</li>
            <li> Not to worry, this \\&quot;oil\\&quot; will not cause any greasy build up as long as you use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> I also add a few drops to my bath water for a soft skin.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I dab few coriander leaves in this argan oil for a lip scrub that leaves a feeling like I have brand new pink lips.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this Argan Oil would help with my thick, dry, frizzy hair but not so much.</li>
            <li> use this product because I use a ton of other facial products as I have combination skin.</li>
            <li> I am a swimmer and use retinoid every night for acne, so dry, flaky patches on my face are the norm.</li>
            <li> pat dry</li>
            <li> It definitely tones down redness and plumps the skin.</li>
            <li> My curls are shiny and FINALLY well defined instead of a dry, tangled mess.</li>
            <li> You can hardly get a single drop out of it, I made the hole bigger but still not enough.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit daily helped me a lot!</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter has a little acne problem that wasn&#x27;t going away.</li>
            <li> I use it for other dry skin as needed.</li>
            <li> I squirt some in my shampoo and conditioner, and I put some on my hair while it is still wet after a shower.</li>
            <li> In my thirties I started breaking out again but in a different way, almost like a rash that I get without warning every few months and takes months to go away all over my neck and cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I greatly appreciated that information as I had been confused in the differences.  </li>
            <li> There is no real smell so for the life of me I can&#x27;t understand why people would buy the deodorized product.  </li>
            <li> I only get a few blemishes here and there on my face.</li>
            <li> Just stared using so not much to tell yet</li>
            <li> However I was curious</li>
            <li> I had acne in my teenage years that I can now say, in hindsight, was due to the amount of harsh drying products I was putting onto my skin.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and smells slightly like olive oil.</li>
            <li> The Watts Beauty has a slight deodorized odor about it and increases my heart rate slightly upon application to my skin and appears to engage my immune system as my neck glands will swell shortly after application.  </li>
            <li> but I can say that my skin is no longer dry and tight and</li>
            <li> I have always used other people&#x27;s reviews to help me decide).</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way too!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Among other things, I use it in combo with acid peels for acne and retin-A cream which can cause severe peeling if I do not balance them correctly with moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The pump is convenient and prevents excessive use compared to the eye dropper in the smaller size.</li>
            <li> Not like the other brands I have use.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin as oily as I thought like other creams do.</li>
            <li> I mix it with other oils sometimes to make a massage oil.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t be caught without it now as it helps cure sunburn, rashes, the acne and a host of other things.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> 100ml - 100% Pure - Raw - Cold Pressed Argan Oil - Certified Organic - Professional Use]]&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> Save money by purchasing the larger 100 ml bottle which should last approximately 6 months.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying this product when the other size I purchased previously proved unavailable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As mentioned in other reviews, it does have a nutty unpleasant smell (it dissipates fairly quickly)</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a lazy reviewer, but</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;d put it in my hair, its a heavy oil similar to olive oil.  </li>
            <li> The only negative thing I can say is that even though it is an oil, I find that it does not moisturize my skin the way I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> Raw, Cold Pressed, 100% Pure 50ml]].&lt;br /&gt;Comparing color and thickness, the oils appear the same.  </li>
            <li> I also put a little on my unruly hair every time I wash it which is every other day.</li>
            <li> Slice of Nature definately has some other ingredent because of it&#x27;s heavy, darker texture.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use any moisturizer previously...</li>
            <li> Second, this Argan oil seemed to be thick and heavy (i.e. greasy) and &#x27;laid&#x27; on my skin and didn&#x27;t absorb well as I read that Argan oil should.</li>
            <li> Argon oil seriously saved my hair after a series of damaging highlights and lack of regular hair cuts.</li>
            <li> I used to have this scaly patch on my eyelid which periodically would itch with a slight burning sensation.  </li>
            <li> After about half an hour I can put make up over it and it stays in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My elbows get very dry and dark but since I have been using this Oil there is no more dryness and black skin!</li>
            <li> The smell of Argon oil is not pleasant, I applied on my face, the very next day my face started to break out.</li>
            <li> I apply a little bit with my conditioner to the ends of my hair which has allowed me to grow my hair longer as it helps to keep the hair supple.</li>
            <li> It has a little bit of a scent, but it is not an offensive scent, and it goes away after a little while.</li>
            <li> A little bit is all that is needed for my face.</li>
            <li> and all it takes is just a little dab</li>
            <li> I disliked the smell.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops a day changed my life.</li>
            <li> Although this oil doesn&#x27;t work so well on my hair, I don&#x27;t like to waste and do rub any excess oil on my hair because</li>
            <li> Just rub a few drops of oil over your palms and then comb your fingers through your hair to apply.</li>
            <li> So, I put a few drops on her scratches twice a day.</li>
            <li> I tried this for a few months and it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks, I noticed that the marks had faded and that the patch of tummy I tested was softer and tighter than the rest.</li>
            <li> When purchasing various health and beauty products, the research that I do makes me tiring and in the end, frustrating.</li>
            <li> After using few of their product, I have no need to research anymore.</li>
            <li> Even when I used to use other essential oils, I would get split ends and have to cut at least an inch every few months, something that was really frustrating because I&#x27;ve been trying to grow my hair out for years.</li>
            <li> This is why I don&#x27;t believe Slice of Nature is 100% pure, raw, and cold pressed as advertised.</li>
            <li> I add a little dab of this to my hair &amp; it feels sooooo silky &amp; looks so shiny !</li>
            <li> The smell was a little hard to get used to</li>
            <li> My nails are really improving as is my skin, which doesn&#x27;t end up feeling overly greasy, and doesn&#x27;t have any bad reactions or breakouts from use.</li>
            <li> So I will be refilling the small bottle with my 100ml.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a rash around my jaw area for the longest time and now, no more rash.</li>
            <li> Initially I was skeptical that this could help me since it is an oil</li>
            <li> usually disappears within 24hours.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for the past 4 days on my hands and neck, which were looking very dry and creepy.</li>
            <li> No more acne!</li>
            <li> It adds unbelievable shine to my skin!</li>
            <li> After just a few days use, my daughter saw a dramatic improvement, pimples were disappearing.</li>
            <li> Though not near as bad.</li>
            <li> ** used to have my skin addicted to it&#x27;s cleansers</li>
            <li> Ordered some other stuff which smelt so bad.  </li>
            <li> Seriously!</li>
            <li> I thought I would just have to deal with the uncomfortable dryness, but this is my HG product.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I will not be purchasing Slice of Nature again.</li>
            <li> I have tried 3 version of argan oil: 2 have been with Slice of Nature and one was another random brand; I apologize for forgetting the name.</li>
            <li> scratches that I didn&#x27;t sorry about scarring</li>
            <li> Horrible acne on my face, my neck and my back.</li>
            <li> No one told me that sleeping in makeup made it worse too!</li>
            <li> The dispensing is also annoying as you have to jam the bottle on your hand a number of times to get even a small trickle.</li>

            <li> I burned my arm badly with an iron about a month ago and now that it has healed, the argan oil has smoothed out the scar.</li>
            <li> has a bad smell or taste</li>
            <li> I guess I may have to go with the pricier one after all :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use it to moisturize my lips and around my eyes, which has helped to keep them in sound look. I am happy with its outcome and I will be trying it on my hair for other results.</li>
            <li> I wanted to thank you for the Rhassoul Clay, I love it. Very quick to get this at my home, man you are fast! I will be more than happy to order from you again!</li>
            <li> I do so love Slice of Nature products!  I have been using your regular and whipped shea butter and my skin thanks me for it every day : )  With a recent order you sent along a free sample of argan oil and boy, let me tell you, this oil is the best!  It absorbs quickly and has eased my 61 year old wrinkles, my formerly rough elbows are as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom and argan oil has rejuvenated my dry hair.  I have a new favorite product and thank you so much for sending that free sample--I wouldn&#x27;t have known about argan oil otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciate your fast courteous service.  You&#x27;re the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kathy V</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and have been using Argan Oil for a few years, but this was my first time to purchase this particular brand.  I have been using this brand for a couple of weeks now, and the results are amazing.  I purchased the other Argan Oil from QVC and paid 3 times as much for it, as this brand.  This brand performs equally as good, and very affordable. I use it on my face, neck, hands, arms, and legs.  This product does have a slight scent, but after using it a couple of times, I can&#x27;t detect the scent as much.  I will definitely purchase this product again, because it definitely performs.</li>
            <li> I just want to say this oil is amazing for the skin in short and long terms, in short you will have a smooth skin you may not notice more than that until you use it for months thats where you start seeing a lot of changes. Another thing is eldery people and people with dry skin will feel a better result than someone with normal skin in short terms . Also take this in consideration if you buy this product to have a flawless skin or get rid of lines or skin blemishes a good cleaning and exfoliation is also needed i used this alone for some weeks with only smooth skin till i decided to get some tea tree oil to clean my skin 1st then put the argan oil after and right now i feel the diference is drastic.&lt;br /&gt;And another thing i see in these reviews is the so called &#x27;&#x27;this look home made&#x27;&#x27; i prefer a ugly bottle with amazing results than a pretty bottle and spend money in something that never works,&lt;br /&gt;this is similar to home made food in a ranch vs a fast food in the city you know it looks nice and all till you get old and have a lot of health problems.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for this amazing product it would be nice to have a dropper cap.</li>
            <li> Its light, absorbs easily into the skin with no greasy feeling. my acne has reduced considerably. All you need is very little, so the price is worth it.</li>
            <li> Argan is oil is pricey but it is so worth it. For almost two years I have gone the organic route in terms of my haircare and skincare and I have benefited tremendously for it. I make my own lotion using a combination of oils but I always felt my lotion could be improved and since I started adding argan oil to it, my skin has never looked so clear and felt so soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not like the smell of argan oil; the first time I took a whiff it reminded me of the Mexican cheese my mother loves to bring back from Mexico and ever since I was little I disliked the smell. This oil brought back memories lol. However, when I mix it in with coconut oil, lavender oil, and other essential oils, the smell disappears and the benefits are great- my complexion is so clear and healthy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I absolutely love argan oil is not only because of my skin however, this oil really does wonders for my hair, something that I have struggled with for years. My hair used to be dry and frizzy with undefined curls, and since I started buying organic shampoos and looking up essential oils it&#x27;s improved, but still every time I showered and my hair was drying, I knew it could be shinier, softer, and smoother so I kept experimenting. Argan oil is hands down the best oil I have ever used on my hair. I squirt some in my shampoo and conditioner, and I put some on my hair while it is still wet after a shower. I used to put only 3 squirts in my hair, but I recently started 5 squirts and oh my god what an incredible difference that makes! My curls are shiny and FINALLY well defined instead of a dry, tangled mess. Even when I used to use other essential oils, I would get split ends and have to cut at least an inch every few months, something that was really frustrating because I&#x27;ve been trying to grow my hair out for years. The last time I cut my hair was about 4 months ago and I have not seen a single split end which is awesome. I love, love, love this oil and I will recommend it to anyone who wants soft, shiny, smooth hair. The price is high but the benefits are great and honestly, a little goes a long way so you won&#x27;t run out in just a few weeks.it to anyone who wants soft, shiny, smooth hair. The price is high but the benefits are great and honestly, a little goes a long way so you won&#x27;t run out in just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product. The smell was a little hard to get used to but now I don&#x27;t mind it at all and actually like it. The oil is very soothing to my mature skin and after 2 months I think it looks fresher. The Slice of Nature company is fabulous for quick efficient service. I love the product packaging-please don&#x27;t change a thing. I don&#x27;t know, but it just feels  organic and honest. I definitely will be ordering again soon, Thankyou</li>
            <li> I love the way Argan oil feels on my face. I have Rosacea, and have been looking for a product for years to help soothe my skin. Great for after being in the sun for too long also!!!</li>
            <li> I worry nothing as, I don’t use anything else at night but this one from Slice of Nature. It cleanses my face to a great extent and leaves a smooth surface. I&#x27;m so happy that this brand works fine for my usage.</li>
            <li> never would i have thought i wuld find a good product for my face but this is it...very good and even after using it for a week i noticed a pretty big difference in my skin tone...a real find</li>
            <li> I am very much satisfied with these Argan oil, after wasting my money in trying out many other oil from other brands to resolve my hair conditioning issues. Very much happy again.</li>
            <li> Okay: FINALLY I am going to start reviewing(because I have always used other people&#x27;s reviews to help me decide). This is for S.o.n. virgin Argan oil. This stuff is AWESOME. I just recently got interested in natural products. As in products without 50 different chemicals and preservatives where the actual ingredient they are promoting isn&#x27;t the 13th thing on the list.&lt;br /&gt;I started out with cold pressed coconut oil (which is awesome because it is healthy to eat as well as use externally). Virgin coconut oil was better than any lotion I have ever used because it deeply hydrates your skin. Unlike most body lotions, which basically sit on top of your skin and get washed off the next time you shower, coconut oil&#x27;s effects would last for days. I thought I had found the end-all product. yada yada- did more research- yada yada- was looking into hair products and Moroccan oil.&lt;br /&gt;Long story short; I decided to try this and was truly impressed. It smells rather nutty/fruity. I think the smell is rather nice, and it doesn&#x27;t really linger afterward. It feels, what I guess you would call, rich. Coconut oil feels oily for a while before it soaks in(though when it soaks in, your skin is healthy and moisturized for a long time), while Argan oil feels rich and makes your whole body feel soft and &#x27;dewy&#x27;. You can research it easily to find out what kind of benefits it actually has for your skin and the lengthy processing that has helped women&#x27;s rights in Morocco. I would recommend this stuff to anyone and just ordered more :)&lt;br /&gt;I will warn though; it is kind of hard to get out of the bottle(takes a lot of shaking) but a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a lazy reviewer, but I hope this helps someone anyway &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I tried a more high-end Argan Oil and thought it was expensive so I was excited to find this one. I was disappointed shortly after because I am pretty sure it breaks my face out. The more expensive one did not do that. I guess I may have to go with the pricier one after all :(</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 6 years now.  I apply a little bit with my conditioner to the ends of my hair which has allowed me to grow my hair longer as it helps to keep the hair supple. I use it as a moisturizer, in the summer months, by applying it directly to damp skin, at the end of my shower.  I also use it to moisturize my lips and around my eyes, which has helped to keep those old crow&#x27;s feet at bay!  The product is AMAZING and customer service is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I am a swimmer and use retinoid every night for acne, so dry, flaky patches on my face are the norm. I thought I would just have to deal with the uncomfortable dryness, but this is my HG product. Just a few drops a day changed my life. It is so moisturizing, but still lightweight. It absorbs in seconds and leaves you glowing. I only need two drops for my face. Overall, this is the one product I always come back to. I recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for the past 4 days on my hands and neck, which were looking very dry and creepy. I&#x27;ve noticed a definite improvement in my skin; it&#x27;s moisturized without being greasy. Really it makes me happy.</li>
            <li> has no odor, and absorbs quickly into the skin, I like to add it to lotion myself but works well alone.</li>
            <li> I am loving this stuff it really moisturize and absorbs quickly in my skin. I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and I have occasional break outs and I put this on at nite on after I clean my face and by AM it is almost gone. I haven&#x27;t notice a significant difference with my brown patch on my face. But I hope the longer I use this it will eventually fade. My 14 yr. old daughter is now using this too and she&#x27;s loving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe with the 100ml. bottle is how it is dispensed from the bottle. You can hardly get a single drop out of it, I made the hole bigger but still not enough. I bought the smaller bottle and that is so much better it actually has a pump. So I will be refilling the small bottle with my 100ml.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  I use it for my Hair and my Face.  My Hair has never looked so healthy and shiny (shiny not greasy).  My face has cleared up and my scars from past blemishes have significantly lightened.  I use this after I cleanse morning and night as a moisturizer.  I Love it.</li>
            <li> The product is light on the skin and non greasy. I have used it for a week now and the smile lines around my mouth are starting to fade.</li>
            <li> Slice of Nature Virgin Argan Oil is truly a miracle and the BEST all-in-one skincare product you&#x27;ll ever need. Over the years, I&#x27;ve spent BIG bucks on skin care products due to my search for the perfect moisturizer, serum, anti-aging fix, acne fighter and primer. I&#x27;m ECSTATIC to say that my search is finally over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product daily, AM and PM, since early November of 2011 and have experienced the following improvements:&lt;br /&gt;- Fine lines have pretty much disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;- No more acne! I&#x27;ve had a lifelong battle with acne and this is the first product that really works. Seriously! Not one break out and acne scars have faded as well.&lt;br /&gt;- Evens out skin tone making it soft and supple. It also evens out blotchiness and imperfections. Like magic!&lt;br /&gt;- Skin appears to have a youthful, dewy glow. Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;- Great light-weight hydrating moisturizer. This oil is very light and absorbs quickly. Remember, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;- Excellent under foundation and make-up. Not to worry, this \\&quot;oil\\&quot; will not cause any greasy build up as long as you use it sparingly. I use a good quality liquid foundation and powder blush. My make-up last all day without any greasy build-up and still looks fresh at the end of the day. Great primer!&lt;br /&gt;- Gentle, healing and soothing; great for sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve had a rash around my jaw area for the longest time and now, no more rash. What a nice and unexpected surprise.&lt;br /&gt;- This Argan oil is untoasted is mostly clear. Many Argan oil&#x27;s are amber in color and they can actually stain and/or darken highlights if you&#x27;re using it in your hair. This is the only clear Argan oil I&#x27;ve been able to find.&lt;br /&gt;- You will save lots of money and time. This Argan Oil truly does it all and you&#x27;ll have no need for additional moisturizers, primers, serums, acne fixes, and anti-aging products. Just wash your face and apply the oil. Done! Save money by purchasing the larger 100 ml bottle which should last approximately 6 months. Note: If you use mascara or liner, I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using this oil around the eyes if you want to avoid raccoon eyes. I&#x27;ve found another amazing natural all-in-one eye product that works really well. Yay!&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s 100% Pure, Natural, Raw, virgin Argan Oil. Just like my food, I prefer Organic or Natural. However, out of sheer frustration, I felt that it was more important to find something that actually works. I&#x27;m elated to find a skin care product that is not only 100% pure and natural, but works better than I ever could have imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really doesn&#x27;t seem worth mentioning but there are a few very minor negative&#x27;s with this product:&lt;br /&gt;- I wish the large 100 ml bottle came with a dropper. It&#x27;s cleaner and less expensive to use a dropper with having more control on how much is dispensed and not having to touch the oil or the rim. I solved this problem by separately purchasing a dropper.&lt;br /&gt;- The natural scent of this oil is not pretty because it&#x27;s undeodorized. Nothing to worry about because the natural scent dissipates quickly and the fact that this oil is undeodorized is a good thing. You really don&#x27;t want to get processed Argan Oil just for the scent because you&#x27;ll lose some of the amazing benefits of a pure natural oil.&lt;br /&gt;- You&#x27;ll need to change your pillow case more often. This is an oil and will rub off on your sheets. Really, not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;- I was hoping that this Argan Oil would help with my thick, dry, frizzy hair but not so much. I&#x27;ve used another Argan Oil, unfortunately not pure and orange in color, that seems to work better on my hair. Although this oil doesn&#x27;t work so well on my hair, I don&#x27;t like to waste and do rub any excess oil on my hair because it certainly can&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, now I know why I rarely leave product reviews because this took forever since I&#x27;m such a darn perfectionist. With that said, I took the time because I&#x27;m excited to have FINALLY found a skin care product that works. Hopethis review helps.this review helps.</li>
            <li> Slice of Nature&#x27;s argan oil is fantastic!  I have ordered this product before and will continue to do so since Amazon offers it at such a great price!  Excellent quality for sure.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried (or even heard of) argan oil. It makes my skin very silky and smooth. It has a little bit of a scent, but it is not an offensive scent, and it goes away after a little while. I am just starting out with it, but so far it feels like a very healing type of oil for my skin. It works especially well on my face and the backs of my hands.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit daily helped me a lot! I have acne prone skin and this oil seems to good on me. I couldn&#x27;t use any moisturizer previously... Thanks Slice of Nature for this awesome product!</li>
            <li> This product keeps my skin (I only use it on my face) very moisturized. My skin is prone to breakouts (since I&#x27;ve gotten older) so I have to be more conscious of what I use. I was using Burt&#x27;s Bees oil before which was nice, but my skin was still breaking out. This keeps my face very moisturized without the worry. Feels nice, smells nice</li>
            <li> I have been using Argan oil for two years now and cannot imagine what I did without it.  I wish that I had found this product while in my teens.  I had acne in my teenage years that I can now say, in hindsight, was due to the amount of harsh drying products I was putting onto my skin.  In my twenties my skin cleared but I would have occasional periods of break outs combined with really dry flaking skin, also in hindsight due to a very drying glycolic product.  In my thirties I started breaking out again but in a different way, almost like a rash that I get without warning every few months and takes months to go away all over my neck and cheeks.  While I think I may have squared away some of the new breakout triggers, I have found the Argan oil helps dramatically with clearing up my acne/rash breakout.  It also helps keep my skin luminous and keeps the delicate skin under my eyes hydrated and free of wrinkly look.  I buy this brand because it is the only one that explained the difference in the types of Argan oil available in the market place.  I greatly appreciated that information as I had been confused in the differences.  This brand is also, by far, the cheapest! I buy the large bottle and it lasts for about a year and I used it daily from chest to hairline.  I never let myself run out of it and considering the amount of money I have blown through the decades on acne, wrinkle, creams, washes, and more, I am ecstatic to have found something that works. There is no real smell so for the life of me I can&#x27;t understand why people would buy the deodorized product.  I personally want every magical bit of my Argan oil, smell and all.</li>
            <li> This product is every bit as good as its expensive counterparts sold through various cosmetic companies, at a fraction of the price!&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my face and hands daily, then I rub the excess through my hair, stopping fly aways and moisturizing the ends. This is my second order from this company, and I will be ordering again in the future.</li>
            <li> This argan oil works really great on itchy dry skin &amp; dry hair/scalp. Highly recommended it to all my friends, as most of us have scalp issues. Great product at a good price.</li>
            <li> The argan oil makes the appearance of my complexion much nicer. It is soft, moist and smooth. A little bit is all that is needed for my face. Happy with this Argan.</li>
            <li> Two problems: first, the atomizer isn&#x27;t really an atomizer, i.e. the product comes out in a very narrow squirt; my understanding of an atomizer is a spray. Second, this Argan oil seemed to be thick and heavy (i.e. greasy) and &#x27;laid&#x27; on my skin and didn&#x27;t absorb well as I read that Argan oil should. I couldn&#x27;t wait until I used up the entire 3.5oz and went ahead and tried another brand (Watts) and it&#x27;s a world of difference. Their Argan oil absorbs very well into my skin, is not greasy and I can see and feel the difference in my skin immediately. Needless to say, I will not be purchasing Slice of Nature again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year.  It&#x27;s a little oily when I first apply it on my face after a shower, however, by the time I&#x27;m ready to apply some makeup, it has mostly absorbed.  I would much rather use this rather than the chemical laden products on the market today.  Why put chemicals and dyes on your skin day after day?  This product is much better and a lot more healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using argon oil for about 4 years now and this brand is best in my opinion.  Organic, cold pressed, fair price, quality is excellent.  I wanted to keep products I use for health and wellness as simple and free of all petro ingredients and this oil is just ONE ingredient....and it works beautifully,  absorbs very quickly and moisturizes....I use just on face , however it can be a complete all-over moisturizer.  give it a go!</li>
            <li> After started using this Argan Oil, my face looks much better and I&#x27;m not spending a lot of money on it any more. I also put a little on my unruly hair every time I wash it which is every other day. Now I don&#x27;t have the fly always. It&#x27;s great for dry hair. It makes my face feel very smooth. I am much pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I have always had issues with acne and with just one pump of this twice a day my skin has cleared up immensely. I also love how moisturized and smooth my face feels now. Initially I was skeptical that this could help me since it is an oil but it truly has. Now I am not saying it is a miracle worker and my face is perfectly clear now but there is a huge difference in that instead of an all over breakout I only get a few blemishes here and there on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought many other argan oils and this has been the best quality by far in texture, smell, and result. My nails are really improving as is my skin, which doesn&#x27;t end up feeling overly greasy, and doesn&#x27;t have any bad reactions or breakouts from use. So far I am very much pleased with its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> It has made my hair and my face softer and healthier.  It absorbs very quickly into my skin without making me feel oily. I am much very much pleased.</li>
            <li> I use argan oil on my face and hair and its such a great way to hydrate your skin and keep it looking healthy, bring back that healthy glow we all want. Slice of Nature service was so helpful and they even provided more insight and instructions on how to use their products and the benefits they bring. I really love this company and their high quality products.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s hair is frizzy, has split ends, tangles ridiculously easy, and is generally unmanageable. I have made her try so many shampoos and masks that it makes her crazy. I have heard that coconut oil works wonders in hair. The only problem is she is allergic to it. I stumbled upon argan oil and figured it was worth a shot for her problem. Her hair has never been better. It is shiny with full life and best of all it is so much easier for her to brush. She gets so many more complements on her hair now.</li>
            <li> I use this not only on my hair, but my face as well.  It&#x27;s clean and keeps dryness at bay without being &#x27;oily&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I dab few coriander leaves in this argan oil for a lip scrub that leaves a feeling like I have brand new pink lips. It moisturizes my lips so well that they don’t crack like before. I also add a few drops to my bath water for a soft skin. It adds unbelievable shine to my skin! Loving it so much!!</li>
            <li> It makes such a huge difference on my cuticles since they are always dry. You can also use it for acne inflammation, as it really helps that as well. The price is good for all.</li>
            <li> I use this oil on my face &amp; scalp &amp; love the results. It nourishes my face &amp; never feels oily. I always soak my face cloth in hot water &amp; place over my argon application. The steam helps pores absorb all the oil- like a mini facial each morning. If you&#x27;ve used Argon oil, you know what to expect at a good price. I am very much satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This Argan oil addresses my dry patches immediately whereas my normal face cream doesn&#x27;t. I think I might be a facial oil user now. A little goes a long way too! 3 drops rubbed in your hands and patted on the skin is all that&#x27;s needed. I also use this on my hair and cuticles. Well pleased so far and would be ordering again from them.</li>
            <li> Argon oil seriously saved my hair after a series of damaging highlights and lack of regular hair cuts. I use this on my skin too. I use this pretty frequently and not sparingly. It lasts me 3-5 weeks depending on my usage. I have also used it in conjunction with a Vitamin E oil for my arms and legs. This was an intense treatment and I loved it. I would recommend everyone to try it.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff for diminishing the appearance of scars. I burned my arm badly with an iron about a month ago and now that it has healed, the argan oil has smoothed out the scar. Its is for sure that for anyone with intense scars, this product can make the journey a great deal smoother!</li>
            <li> I apply it to my baby&#x27;s skin. There were no side effects such as redness, itchiness with application. I like it so much. It&#x27;s true to its description. I would definitely recommend this product, after only using this for a short amount of time I have noticed a significant increase in the shine and moisture in my baby’s hair and a glow on her skin.</li>
            <li> Ordered some other stuff which smelt so bad.  This is excellent. I use it in my hair, sometimes on my face, etc.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair softer, silkier and shinier! It is the ideal hair conditioner and it even helps to treat my split ends and tame frizzy hair. It makes my hair more manageable and adds a healthy, attractive shine to any hair style. This is the ideal step to add to your daily routine after blow-drying. Just rub a few drops of oil over your palms and then comb your fingers through your hair to apply.</li>
            <li> It has one ingredient - argon oil. I use it as a treatment for my feet, and they sure were soft the next day. There really isn&#x27;t any smell to it. Over all I like for the price and quality.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t fall for other cheap imitations!! This stuff is so pure and amazing. I use it morning and night, and my skin has never looked better. If you are acne prone, do not be afraid of this oil! This is the ideal moisturizer for skin on the meaning. The antioxidant properties of Argan oil will certainly make you age more gracefully. I would highly recommend this Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I love Argan oil and am interested in purchasing the best at the best price so I decided to purchase the three organic ones offered on Amazon that interest me the most. This video review is comparing&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000GS8T0Y 100% Cold Pressed Organic Argan Oil 100 ml BY AAA Shea Butter]]&lt;br /&gt;with [[ASIN:B004HCE2E2 Watts Moroccan Beauty Oil 100ml - 100% Pure - Raw - Cold Pressed Argan Oil - Certified Organic - Professional Use]]&lt;br /&gt;and [[ASIN:B00245MXX6 Slice of Nature© Virgin Argan Oil. Raw, Cold Pressed, 100% Pure 50ml]].&lt;br /&gt;Comparing color and thickness, the oils appear the same.  The only differences I noticed are slightly different odors and skin sensations with these three oils I purchased at the same time from Amazon. The AAA SHEA butter has a slighty musky / musty odor. The Watts Beauty has a slight deodorized odor about it and increases my heart rate slightly upon application to my skin and appears to engage my immune system as my neck glands will swell shortly after application.  The Slice of Nature has the freshest odor of the three and smells a little nutty too; skin application feels very soothing and calming in a quenching sensation sort of way. The differences are subtle and most consumers probably would not be able to tell the difference at all. I considered not posting the review since any difference was negligible, but decided there might be others out there wondering the same thing. If so, please click helpful below.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 5 months now, only on my face.  I don&#x27;t know if I look any younger!!!...but I can say that my skin is no longer dry and tight and I think my overall complextion has evened out.  I use it morning and night by simply wetting my face and then dobbing on my forehead, cheeks, and neck and massaging it in. When I am getting ready in the morning, by the time I finish blowdrying my hair, the oil has been absorbed and I&#x27;m ready to put on my makeup.  It actually helps your concealer/foundation go on smoother. For some, the cost my seem high, but for the length of time it lasts, it is a good value compared to department store products.  And for me, I like the fact that there is only ONE ingredient, think about that.</li>
            <li> Just stared using so not much to tell yet</li>
            <li> I am a 25 yr old male. VERY sensitive skin. I am dermographic and have allergies to most OTC acne products (anything with benzoyl peroxide) and fragrance (balsam of peru). I have been my dermatologists best client, being that i have kept her in business with all of my skin problems and no doubt she has maintained pharmaceutical companies considering all the creams and washes she has prescribed me over the years (up to 5 in my regime at one time). but i am glad to say that i dont use ANY of the prescriptions anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil has saved my skin. I am now only using a 3% salicylic acid face wash, followed by argan oil. People complement me on how my skin \\&quot;glows\\&quot;. Since using the oil, i havent had any environmental-exposure-related allergic reactions (ie: i can walk through the perfume department in the mall without getting itchy) and i dont break out... AT ALL!&lt;br /&gt;Not only do i not break out, if i have the rare little pimple, the argan oil neutralizes and soothes it.....usually disappears within 24hours.&lt;br /&gt;I cant tell you how much i love this product.&lt;br /&gt;And to prove even MORE how great this oil is, i ran out when i was moving to another state (for about 5 days), and after about 48 hours my allergies returned and i started breaking out in all the usual places. Upon receiving a rush order of argan oil, my skin was back to normal within three days.&lt;br /&gt;If i wasnt a molecular biologist, i would say this is magic!&lt;br /&gt;Either way, if you are interested in trying something new with your skin care regime, i HIGHHHLLLYYYYYYYY recommend this product</li>
            <li> At first I was put off by the smell of Argan oil, but it took me couple of days to get used to it, as Slice of Nature brand has a milder scent than others I have used previously.  It goes on smooth on your skin, and practically heals over night the blemishes and breakouts.  I used to have this scaly patch on my eyelid which periodically would itch with a slight burning sensation.  Since I started using Argan oil, it literally disappeared.  I also use it on my hair, and it makes my hair softer and more managable.  Love the product!!!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product, great price for the amount you get.  It&#x27;s just as advertised.  I used it for my skin, especially my face and neck.  It absorbs fairly quickly and a little bit goes a long way.  Not sure if I&#x27;d put it in my hair, its a heavy oil similar to olive oil.  If I used it for my hair, probably as a oil treatment that I&#x27;d have to wash out afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have tried 3 version of argan oil: 2 have been with Slice of Nature and one was another random brand; I apologize for forgetting the name. I think this Slice of Nature brand is far superior. I ended up buying this product when the other size I purchased previously proved unavailable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mostly use it on my face and sometimes my hair, to smooth static and to prevent split ends. My sister who lives with me just finished beauty school and was very impressed that I used this product and with its quality; she studied it for its skin and hair benefits, apparently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product because I use a ton of other facial products as I have combination skin. This product is the BEST moisturizer I have found. It does not cause me to break out; it absorbs relatively quickly; it keeps my skin moisturized a LONG time. After about half an hour I can put make up over it and it stays in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among other things, I use it in combo with acid peels for acne and retin-A cream which can cause severe peeling if I do not balance them correctly with moisturizer. I am trying to get rid of acne scarring. This product, when used after a peel, keeps my skin from flaking and irritation and thus prevents further issues. I try to use it daily and in combination with these other products and the fact that it does not cause additional breakouts (as do many other synthetic moisturizers I have tried), I believe it has greatly helped improve the appearance and feel of my skin. I use it for other dry skin as needed. The pump is convenient and prevents excessive use compared to the eye dropper in the smaller size. It lasts a long time and smells slightly like olive oil. I don&#x27;t know if that would bother anyone but personally I do not mind as it sinks in quickly.</li>
            <li> I feel the oil is too sticky.Not like the other brands I have use.NO smell.I have very sensitive skin so I may not use it very often.</li>
            <li> I have been using the virgin argan oil from slice of natire for over a week now and am very happy with the product. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin as oily as I thought like other creams do. I also use this on my neck, chest, nails and a couple of drops in my hair. Definitely it is a great product!</li>
            <li> I use it every day prior to my old moisturizer. It has corrected dark marks from old pimples, cleared my skin and brightened my complexion. No oily or greasy residue! My skin drinks it right up! I finally found something that works and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> For a person with ridiculously OILY skin, I LOVE this stuff!  It&#x27;s perfect for winter. I use it twice a day and it is a life saver for me. Ever since I&#x27;ve been on my tea-tree oil then argan oil treatments my breakouts have subsided. I remember back in the day when Proac*** used to have my skin addicted to it&#x27;s cleansers my skin wasn&#x27;t as vibrant. This stuff works and will not make your skin oil.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by a friend several months ago and fell in love with it since..it is easy to apply and spread easily on this old skin:-0</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about 3 weeks ago.  I don&#x27;t know if it reduced any wrinkles as of yet but my face feels more supple and I will continue to use it.  I think it has reduced some spots but I would like to give it more time.  I had read comments about the smell but it is not offensive and only lasts for seconds.  I would suggest it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Loved the quality and how is dispensed.  Lasts a long time.  Has many uses.  Don&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
            <li> My 5 yr old had scratches on her face, 2 were minor surfaces scratches that I didn&#x27;t sorry about scarring, the 3rd scratch was deeper and I was concerned. So, I put a few drops on her scratches twice a day. Her 2 surfaces scratches were gone with in 6 hours of first applying - all of us were surprised. The last scratch healed super quick with out the faintest of scars. I was impressed with the healing ability of this oil- we all were.</li>
            <li> I love this oil so much!  I use it on my face every night before bed and then in the morning after my shower and before my make up.  After my shower, I sometimes will use it on my whole body and it soaks in really quickly, does NOT feel greasy, and I really don&#x27;t notice the temporary smell that some people have mentioned.  I think it moisturizes perfectly and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or gross...nice and light.</li>
            <li> I like this product because of it&#x27;s purity. Doesn&#x27;t hurt scratches or scrapes. Only soothes and it will not make my face break out! Don&#x27;t know why, but it is amazing. I have very sensitive skin. This oil is so gentle and repairs skin so nicely. It&#x27;s very KIND.</li>
            <li> I got this at the same time I bought the Kerastase Elixir Ultime. They have similar consistence. They are both light oils that are well absorbed into the hair. The smell is very mild and I dont mind it. As for my hair, its nice, but not amazing. I used to use Biosilk and so far I feel thats the best for the price. I&#x27;ve used this on my skin too and its nice. I mix it with other oils sometimes to make a massage oil. Im glad I tried this but its definitely not a &#x27;must have&#x27; in my book.</li>
            <li> I tried this for a few months and it doesn&#x27;t work.  There is no difference in my face.  The dispensing is also annoying as you have to jam the bottle on your hand a number of times to get even a small trickle.</li>
            <li> The smell of Argon oil is not pleasant, I applied on my face, the very next day my face started to break out. So I stopped it, after clearing up, I tried it again, my face started to break out the very next day. Applied to my hair, it&#x27;s ok, not as good as the ONE N ONLY ARGAN OIL from Sally&#x27;s though. it&#x27;s not worth for it&#x27;s cost, Shea butter does a better job and last longer.</li>
            <li> I ordered this oil, and was pleased with the results. My skin was softer and seemed to glow. However I was curious, what&#x27;s the difference in this argan oil, and the more expensive Jose Moran&#x27;s? My curiosity got the best of me, and I purchased Jose Moran argan oil. I now know the difference! Jose Moran&#x27;s oil was much lighter in texture, color, and no unpleasant smell like Slice of Nature. This is why I don&#x27;t believe Slice of Nature is 100% pure, raw, and cold pressed as advertised. Slice of Nature definately has some other ingredent because of it&#x27;s heavy, darker texture. Hope this helps anyone elses argan oil curiosity.</li>
            <li> Received this item quickly and packaged well.  THIS IS DEFINITELY 100% PURE ARGAN OIL, which is the only ingredient listed on label...THIS IS THE REAL STUFF (very many sellers on the market today sell fakes, so beware).  Would most assuredly purchase from this seller again!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for cracked, bleeding over washed hands and my wife loves it for her hair and skin. Another great Dr. Oz suggestion.</li>
            <li> On my face, this oil works great! It definitely tones down redness and plumps the skin. What surprised me were the healing properties! Out of sheer curiosity with no expectation of anything remarkable, I started to apply this to an area of my tummy where I have stretch marks. After a few weeks, I noticed that the marks had faded and that the patch of tummy I tested was softer and tighter than the rest. I am about to order another bottle.</li>
            <li> Slice of Nature has a great product line made from quality ingredients. When purchasing various health and beauty products, the research that I do makes me tiring and in the end, frustrating. After using few of their product, I have no need to research anymore. The uses of this Argan oil are endless and the results are astounding. My family uses almost every possible and useful oils from them.</li>
            <li> I add a little dab of this to my hair &amp; it feels sooooo silky &amp; looks so shiny ! and all it takes is just a little dab otherwise you&#x27;d have the reverse, greasy &amp; oily looking !  Oh...and it&#x27;s also a good facial moisturizer, I like the fact that it serves dual purposes, this product will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> My scalp is prone to some irritation and was suggested to use Argan. I tried adding a few drops of argon oil to a particularly itchy area, but while it soothed it for a few moments, I&#x27;m so much convinced that it was the real remedy to the situation. I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> Great Stuff ! My teenage daughter has a little acne problem that wasn&#x27;t going away. We tried a several products and nothing worked. Sent for this, not expecting much as nothing was working. Well, we&#x27;re really glad we got it. After just a few days use, my daughter saw a dramatic improvement, pimples were disappearing. Her acne was clearing up. My girl was so happy. This stuff is awesome. Wouldn&#x27;t be caught without it now as it helps cure sunburn, rashes, the acne and a host of other things. Great natural product everyone should have in the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> I started two days ago and followed the instructions to apply on my face. So far so good !</li>
            <li> This gets the job done when you need it to. Feet, hands, hair, face, body...it can be used wherever needed. Even on the lips. Some of the benefits you can use Argan Oil for is for skin moisturizing, hair conditioning, leave in conditioner for sleek and shine, anti-aging benefits, acne, stretch marks. I am much satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have used many brands and types of Argan Oil but the “Slice of Nature” Argan Oil seems to be showing results very quickly. I have been using it on my toes because I read Argan Oil would help and yes it helped me! My elbows get very dry and dark but since I have been using this Oil there is no more dryness and black skin!</li>
            <li> The real deal!  My scars and skin look great! I&#x27;ve gotten complemented on my hair and skin since using!  A must have on my counter!</li>
            <li> I have been using Argan Oil for a year now and love the benefits of it. I love this product, it does exactly what it says,  my skin and hair thank this product for a healthy glow I have!</li>
            <li> I use this as a night time face moisturizer, a lip balm, a leave in hair oil, an all over body moisturizer and I could go on and on! Firstly it is natural and very versatile! Clears up my skin, keeps it clean and keeps it from being too dull and dry, absorbs oil quickly, feels light but moisturizing. It is really good for all skin types and great for healthy hair and skin. Good for your lips. A little goes a long way! Two drops at the most for your whole face will suffice!</li>
            <li> Ok I have had acne since I was 14. Horrible! Horrible acne on my face, my neck and my back. And I lived in a tiny town in the middle of nowhere so I didn&#x27;t have a lot of resources! No one told me that sleeping in makeup made it worse too! Anyways I&#x27;m 31 now and you guessed it, still have it! Though not near as bad. Mostly under my chin and here and there on my back. I am on an antibiotic but it still isn&#x27;t keeping it at bay :( Anyways I have super dry skin when I don&#x27;t moisturize and oily when I do and most every moisturizer breaks me out eventually. It was hard at first getting over the stigma of putting oil on my face but let me tell you this stuff is amazing!! Truly!! I never break out from it. I wash my face with face wash then pat dry then get my hands damp and put 3 drops of the argan oil in my palm and rub my hands together. Then I spread it evenly over my face and neck! It&#x27;s wonderful!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for many months now.  I have adult acne that is pretty chronic and have tried everything under the sun and this was recommended by a friend. I was happy because it is natural but was concerned the oil would cause more breakouts.  That was not the case at all! In fact, it really cleared up my skin. The only negative thing I can say is that even though it is an oil, I find that it does not moisturize my skin the way I had hoped.  It can leave my skin feeling dehyrated so I apply a good moisturizer on top of it before bed.</li>
            <li> My daughter developed wrinkles and stretch marks and wasn’t feeling great having at this early age. I decided to find a solution and got this for her use. Amazingly, within few days, she found successive up gradation on everything. Once again a great deal from slice of nature.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully and really hydrates the skin. This is an effective budget friendly serum to brighten my skin. I am extremely pleased with the results. I have already told my sister to purchase this product and plan on buying oil again soon.</li>
            <li> Argan Oil has become my new favorite moisturizer, hair treatment, lip balm, etc... It is great for everything! I wanted to start using a completely natural product so after some research I came across this Slice of Nature© Virgin Argan oil and after reading some good reviews about it, I decided to give it a shot. As mentioned in other reviews, it does have a nutty unpleasant smell (it dissipates fairly quickly) but you get used to it. Usually whatever is good for you has a bad smell or taste so I took it as a good sign that the product was indeed 100% natural. I also liked this product because it comes in a thick glass bottle with a spray pump. You basically only need one dime sized amount for face and hair so this should last quite a long time. It has so many uses that it replaces a lot of my expensive creams and lotions.</li>
            <li> Argan Oil is supposed to be all the rage for skin and hair.  This product made me break out and the smell is awful.  I don&#x27;t recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> I love this Slice of Nature Pure Virgin Argan Oil.  This oil make my skin, face, hair whole body keep moisture and soft skin.  Thanks! This is good products, Everyone should have one.&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCTS AT DISCOUNT PRICE IN EXCHANGE MY REVIEW.</li>
