            <li> This item was better than expected. I will purchase other cases for all of my straight razors. I recommend this item to anyone looking to protect that straight razor investment.</li>
            <li> Great travel case. For the price i couldn&#x27;t beat it so i got 2. Holds razor perfect. Very satisfied with the cases.</li>
            <li> Leather bound zippered straight razor case. The leather is soft and black, the zipper works and the inside is lined with a soft black material, with a elastic holder to keep the straight razor closed.&lt;br /&gt;The razor stays closed and keeps safe inside the case when placed inside a dopp bag during travel.</li>
            <li> Excellent value and lots of room.</li>
            <li> I use this when traveling for my Feather Artists Club razor. Seems nicely made and keeps the razor snugly in place. Good value for the money.</li>
            <li> Lots of room inside to put a razor. There would actually be enough room for 2, So another slots would be helpful.</li>
            <li> I wanted a travel case for my Gillette razor; this fits the bill.  The razor fits easily &amp; is protected in my travel kit.</li>
            <li> The only thing that keeps me from giving this case 5-stars is that the zipper leaves an opening at both ends. The extra blades I take with me tend to fall through the openings.</li>
            <li> Great, efficient, quality item. Really well made. Fast shipping, and low prices. Wonderful experience from start to finish. Really happy that I eventually puechased this item. After recieving item I purchased 4 more. Thanks for the cost effective maintence piece for my razors.</li>
            <li> Perfect when you need to store one straight razor, I put a small cloth bag of camphor in the case to keep the blade from rusting.  This is an old machinist -wood worker trick to keep tools from rusting.  You can buy camphor crystals in bulk via the internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong on this for simple storage case.</li>
            <li> I bought this to store my straight razor in, as the razors aren&#x27;t cheap and I&#x27;d like to protect it. It has an elastic loop to keep the razor from flopping around or opening during travel. Nice zipper, and nice quality leather. Overall an excellent value.</li>
            <li> Holds my razor and blades perfectly!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband along with several other shaving items, we were going to be heading out of town and he&#x27;d need to take his razor with him, this case worked perfectly with the razor.</li>

            <li> Im very happy with my case. Even better my wife likes it so she doesnt have to look at my straight Razer</li>
            <li> I love this case because it protects the razor nicely. It also can fit two straight razor in it. I haven&#x27;t use it on travel yet, but i have 3 pets and the case keeps them from but cut..anyway i highly recommend</li>
            <li> Really nice quality case for the money</li>
            <li> Perfect for my razor blade</li>
