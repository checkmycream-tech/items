            <li> excellent product that I have been using for many years Now my barber hooked me on to the grease I been stuck on it ever sense</li>
            <li> Good product.  Works well.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best for hair bumps/ razor bumps!</li>
            <li> Can anyone tell me does this product work for razor bumps?</li>
            <li> Keeps my daughters natural hair soft and moisturized.  Especially during these cold months.</li>
            <li> Product caused my scalp to break out in tiny bumps all over. I&#x27;ll never use this product again</li>
            <li> I originally saw an advertising poster at my local barber shop and decided to try it out. Works very well to reduce and eliminate hair bumps</li>
            <li> There was a noticeable improvement in skin bumps the morning after applying the balm to the affected area.  It did not leave residue on clothing.  It did leave a waxy film over the skin but was barely noticeable and washed off easily. There was no offensive odor. I was impressed that it worked so quickly and performed exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> this product is good for any individual that experience scalp itching or irritation to the scalp and would like to use a product that is over the counter and seems to have some effect over that problem.And this product would be commendable for&lt;br /&gt;recommendation to others as a good product.</li>
            <li> Enjoyed my purchased. This product was recommended to me by a Beautician and I&#x27;ve been using it every since. Not greasy. Smell isn&#x27;t bad but it is loud but still tolerable. Really cures and grows your hair.But I didn&#x27;t get the free Hollywood bar soap that they advertised with the hair grease.</li>
            <li> My brother swears by this product, however I used it for several weeks and it did not do much at all for me.</li>
            <li> It is very good for the value</li>
            <li> I would say this stuff definitely works to relieve flaky dandruff and sores from my scalp condition (I think psoriasis) I&#x27;ve had for years.  Product is delivered in a timely fashion.</li>
