            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite colognes.</li>
            <li>have had soooo many compliments on it over the years by both men and women.</li>
            <li>This is my wife&#x27;s favorite cologne, it comes in a well designed spray bottle and it is 3.25 ounces and for a bottle</li>
            <li>Love Jovan Musk</li>
            <li>This has been her favorite since I was a child, and this was a convenient last-minute gift.</li>
            <li>I have worn this cologne for years, I get so many compliments on it.  </li>
            <li>This is my wife&#x27;s favorite for 8 years running.</li>
            <li>Have received many compliments on this fragrance, mostly from men.  </li>
            <li>i love this stuff.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>It must work well with my body chemisty since I get the most compliments when wearing it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s magical.</li>
            <li>Great classic all around women smell.</li>
            <li>lol) Highly recommend</li>
            <li>The aroma is light, fresh, &amp; pleasant.</li>
            <li>Very clean smelling</li>
            <li>This light and lovely Jovan White Musk Cologne spray is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Nice sweet smell  </li>
            <li>but,  still won&#x27;t be so strong or overwhelming.</li>
            <li>This is a great soft scent that I get complimented on often.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic (it&#x27;s floral, but not headache inducing) and it lasts many hours on my skin.</li>
            <li>I shouldn&#x27;t actually say too much good about this, because it may be sold out when I want to order it again!  </li>
            <li>When I accidentally came across the Jovan White Musk in the store today I remembered the many great reviews it received on Amazon and thought I could use it until the TBS parfum oil arrived.</li>
            <li>NOT TO STRONG YET THERE.  </li>
            <li>I think its a scent for all ages, anyone who wants to feel beautiful and very feminine.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and damage-free!</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic price for this spray cologne.</li>
            <li>get it here on Amazon for $10 and my free Prime shipping.</li>
            <li>musky, floral and light (but not TOO light)</li>
            <li>It is cheap.  </li>
            <li>It has a light scent and stays with me all day.</li>
            <li>I was happy to recieve this product, especially for the price I paid!</li>
            <li>Its such a very feminine scent, it makes you feel beautiful!  </li>
            <li>Thanks for a great deal and fast shipping</li>
            <li>Love White Musk by Jovan and loved the price of this one.</li>
            <li>Of all the perfumes I&#x27;ve worn over the years, this is the ONLY one that got so many compliments!!  </li>
            <li>It was love at first whiff.</li>
            <li>and it has been my favorite scent since it was first launched in 1992.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed-</li>
            <li>Love it old time favorite.</li>
            <li>Smells really clean and feminine.  </li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t like to smell clean.</li>
            <li>This gentle scent is lovely.</li>
            <li>But it is my absolute favorite scent</li>
            <li>much cheaper here than in the drugstore. :)</li>
            <li>I wore TBS White Musk years ago and loved it.</li>
            <li>This is a light fragrance, great for everyday.</li>
            <li>It has a clean fresh smell, not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>but i cant complain better then buying really high end ones</li>
            <li>Fresh smelling slightly sweet, without being overbearing.  </li>
            <li>Have always loved this scent-and decided to &amp;#34;add&amp;#34; to my perfume collection making old memories new again!</li>
            <li>A wonderful soft fresh white floral scent I love to wear year-round (and in winter &amp; spring especially).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what I would do if they ever discontinued this smell, but man am I going to keep smelling delicious for as long as possible.</li>
            <li>Its clean, warm, floral but not flowery, intoxicating and it lasts a long time</li>
            <li>Great everyday scent.</li>
            <li>This is a old family favorite.  </li>
            <li>far the most \\&quot;approach me\\&quot;  scent out there..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of overpowering or spicy scents, so this is perfect, It&#x27;s soft, delicate, fresh, and clean.</li>
            <li>fresh smelling and clean-price was right</li>
            <li>Arrived quick and exactly as descrbed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn this scent since high school and get compliment daily on how good I smell.</li>
            <li>The first time I wore it to work, all the college aged guys were commenting on how great it smelled...and I&#x27;m 54 years old!!  </li>
            <li>Was shipped super fast</li>
            <li>The only other scent that comes close to the warm,  soft,  sweet smell that embodies feminine that this does is \\&quot;warm vanilla sugar\\&quot;  from bath and body works.  </li>
            <li>I love Jovan White Musk &amp; Musk Oil.</li>
            <li>Love it, was complimented countless times since I started wearing it about 3 months ago.</li>
            <li>Reminds me of when I first met my wife.</li>
            <li>The price I paid on Amazon was a real bargain!</li>
            <li>This is a better deal than I can get in any local store and it arrived within 48 hours of ordering it!</li>
            <li>Absolutely!</li>
            <li>I love my Jovan White Musk and wear it all the time.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It is the only fragrance I am able to wear.</li>
            <li>My wife love the scent and would recommend this cologne for any female.</li>
            <li>This is my signature scent; fresh and clean but pretty and a little sexy.  </li>
            <li>This fresh, just out the shower scent continues to be a main staple in my collection..</li>
            <li>After about two our three minutes the alcohol smell had dissipated and the White Musk finally came through - the beloved scent I remembered.</li>
            <li>Jovan White Musk a True Classic Cologne that gets lots of Compliments ALL the Time !!!</li>
            <li>Both my daughter and myself are super sensitive to fragrances.  </li>
            <li>They are very similar,  but the White musk pulls ahead with a more lasting,  and more intriguing scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the size of the bottle is pretty large for such a cheap price.  </li>
            <li>I have 3 large bottles of this (home &amp; work)</li>
            <li>but I believe it must have a very high alcohol content as it dries out my skin and makes me itch.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a so light, fresh and clean smelling how can you not love it</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>young &amp; fresh</li>
            <li>Now,I for one, could not go through this much of this perfume in a month..</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>Everyone compliments me on it; I guess it really mixes well with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li>Really nice, soft, sweet and long lasting colgne...</li>
            <li>It is great can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s the same as I buy in the store but for much less!</li>
            <li>It smells nice when I first put it on me, but the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is made by Coty in New York, New York, USA and is a wonderfully warm and entirely feminine fragrance that Coty describes as a blend of \\&quot;alluring Jasmine, ylang-ylang, honeysuckle, sensual musk, soft woods, and amber.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it is not very expensive</li>
            <li>Not overwhelming and chemical,  but light, warm, floral  and overall very feminine.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered this product many times from Amazon and other offsite vendors, and it always arrives neatly packaged and new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>does not smell like the original white musk.  </li>
            <li>Great price since this big size is usually $25 in the stores.</li>
            <li>This is a scent I wore long ago in my early 20&#x27;s &amp; am now rediscovering it again in my late 30&#x27;s, loving it all the more.     </li>
            <li>I love perfume, but I have a difficult time wearing most of them.  </li>
            <li>I mainly use it in the winter because it has a heavier scent that I like to have in the colder months.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing this Drugstore Cologne since Jr. High School.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this fragrance.</li>
            <li>This was my signature scent when i was in junior high.</li>
            <li>I even use a little in my hair and get many inquiries and compliments.</li>
            <li>White Musk for Women is a soft, clean fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sweet and clean and lasts as long as more expensive colognes.</li>
            <li>I live for the smell of this.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I purchased it online instead of in a store and it will be the last.  </li>
            <li>(I buy this exact same perfume all the time).</li>
            <li>The back is a large warm body area, usually covered by clothes, that helps your fragrance to last all day.</li>
            <li>It is soft and not overpowering like perfumes.  </li>
            <li>But unfortunately it really doesn&#x27;t last at all -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a soft musk scent with some florals.</li>
            <li>Its not too strong.it has a soft smell.</li>
            <li>The price was much cheaper here than I&#x27;ve seen it in stores for the same size</li>
            <li>remember from my early years.  </li>
            <li>from the soft fragrence.</li>
            <li>Not a very pretty floral combination, and I&#x27;m not sure why it gets so many raves!  </li>
            <li>I purchased several fragrances from several different vendors on the exact day.</li>
            <li>I have worn many different perfumes in the past, but I always come back to the Jovan White Musk.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s what I ordered but it doesn&#x27;t smell like it normally does for some unknown reason</li>
            <li>Never over powering, always subtle, clean smelling.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments and have been using this for at least 20 yrs (and I am still in my 20s!!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite colognes.</li>
            <li> have had soooo many compliments on it over the years by both men and women.</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite cologne, it comes in a well designed spray bottle and it is 3.25 ounces and for a bottle</li>
            <li> Love Jovan Musk</li>
            <li> This has been her favorite since I was a child, and this was a convenient last-minute gift.</li>
            <li> I have worn this cologne for years, I get so many compliments on it.  </li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite for 8 years running.</li>
            <li> Have received many compliments on this fragrance, mostly from men.  </li>
            <li> i love this stuff.</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> It must work well with my body chemisty since I get the most compliments when wearing it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s magical.</li>
            <li> Great classic all around women smell.</li>
            <li> lol) Highly recommend</li>
            <li> The aroma is light, fresh, &amp; pleasant.</li>
            <li> Very clean smelling</li>
            <li> This light and lovely Jovan White Musk Cologne spray is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Nice sweet smell  </li>
            <li> but,  still won&#x27;t be so strong or overwhelming.</li>
            <li> This is a great soft scent that I get complimented on often.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic (it&#x27;s floral, but not headache inducing) and it lasts many hours on my skin.</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t actually say too much good about this, because it may be sold out when I want to order it again!  </li>
            <li> When I accidentally came across the Jovan White Musk in the store today I remembered the many great reviews it received on Amazon and thought I could use it until the TBS parfum oil arrived.</li>
            <li> NOT TO STRONG YET THERE.  </li>
            <li> I think its a scent for all ages, anyone who wants to feel beautiful and very feminine.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and damage-free!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic price for this spray cologne.</li>
            <li> get it here on Amazon for $10 and my free Prime shipping.</li>
            <li> musky, floral and light (but not TOO light)</li>
            <li> It is cheap.  </li>
            <li> It has a light scent and stays with me all day.</li>
            <li> I was happy to recieve this product, especially for the price I paid!</li>
            <li> Its such a very feminine scent, it makes you feel beautiful!  </li>
            <li> Thanks for a great deal and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Love White Musk by Jovan and loved the price of this one.</li>
            <li> Of all the perfumes I&#x27;ve worn over the years, this is the ONLY one that got so many compliments!!  </li>
            <li> It was love at first whiff.</li>
            <li> and it has been my favorite scent since it was first launched in 1992.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed-</li>
            <li> Love it old time favorite.</li>
            <li> Smells really clean and feminine.  </li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t like to smell clean.</li>
            <li> This gentle scent is lovely.</li>
            <li> But it is my absolute favorite scent</li>
            <li> much cheaper here than in the drugstore. :)</li>
            <li> I wore TBS White Musk years ago and loved it.</li>
            <li> This is a light fragrance, great for everyday.</li>
            <li> It has a clean fresh smell, not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> but i cant complain better then buying really high end ones</li>
            <li> Fresh smelling slightly sweet, without being overbearing.  </li>
            <li> Have always loved this scent-and decided to &amp;#34;add&amp;#34; to my perfume collection making old memories new again!</li>
            <li> A wonderful soft fresh white floral scent I love to wear year-round (and in winter &amp; spring especially).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I would do if they ever discontinued this smell, but man am I going to keep smelling delicious for as long as possible.</li>
            <li> Its clean, warm, floral but not flowery, intoxicating and it lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Great everyday scent.</li>
            <li> This is a old family favorite.  </li>
            <li> far the most \\&quot;approach me\\&quot;  scent out there..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of overpowering or spicy scents, so this is perfect, It&#x27;s soft, delicate, fresh, and clean.</li>
            <li> fresh smelling and clean-price was right</li>
            <li> Arrived quick and exactly as descrbed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this scent since high school and get compliment daily on how good I smell.</li>
            <li> The first time I wore it to work, all the college aged guys were commenting on how great it smelled...and I&#x27;m 54 years old!!  </li>
            <li> Was shipped super fast</li>
            <li> The only other scent that comes close to the warm,  soft,  sweet smell that embodies feminine that this does is \\&quot;warm vanilla sugar\\&quot;  from bath and body works.  </li>
            <li> I love Jovan White Musk &amp; Musk Oil.</li>
            <li> Love it, was complimented countless times since I started wearing it about 3 months ago.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of when I first met my wife.</li>
            <li> The price I paid on Amazon was a real bargain!</li>
            <li> This is a better deal than I can get in any local store and it arrived within 48 hours of ordering it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely!</li>
            <li> I love my Jovan White Musk and wear it all the time.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It is the only fragrance I am able to wear.</li>
            <li> My wife love the scent and would recommend this cologne for any female.</li>
            <li> This is my signature scent; fresh and clean but pretty and a little sexy.  </li>
            <li> This fresh, just out the shower scent continues to be a main staple in my collection..</li>
            <li> After about two our three minutes the alcohol smell had dissipated and the White Musk finally came through - the beloved scent I remembered.</li>
            <li> Jovan White Musk a True Classic Cologne that gets lots of Compliments ALL the Time !!!</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and myself are super sensitive to fragrances.  </li>
            <li> They are very similar,  but the White musk pulls ahead with a more lasting,  and more intriguing scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the size of the bottle is pretty large for such a cheap price.  </li>
            <li> I have 3 large bottles of this (home &amp; work)</li>
            <li> but I believe it must have a very high alcohol content as it dries out my skin and makes me itch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a so light, fresh and clean smelling how can you not love it</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> young &amp; fresh</li>
            <li> Now,I for one, could not go through this much of this perfume in a month..</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> Everyone compliments me on it; I guess it really mixes well with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> Really nice, soft, sweet and long lasting colgne...</li>
            <li> It is great can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s the same as I buy in the store but for much less!</li>
            <li> It smells nice when I first put it on me, but the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is made by Coty in New York, New York, USA and is a wonderfully warm and entirely feminine fragrance that Coty describes as a blend of \\&quot;alluring Jasmine, ylang-ylang, honeysuckle, sensual musk, soft woods, and amber.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it is not very expensive</li>
            <li> Not overwhelming and chemical,  but light, warm, floral  and overall very feminine.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered this product many times from Amazon and other offsite vendors, and it always arrives neatly packaged and new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> does not smell like the original white musk.  </li>
            <li> Great price since this big size is usually $25 in the stores.</li>
            <li> This is a scent I wore long ago in my early 20&#x27;s &amp; am now rediscovering it again in my late 30&#x27;s, loving it all the more.     </li>
            <li> I love perfume, but I have a difficult time wearing most of them.  </li>
            <li> I mainly use it in the winter because it has a heavier scent that I like to have in the colder months.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this Drugstore Cologne since Jr. High School.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this fragrance.</li>
            <li> This was my signature scent when i was in junior high.</li>
            <li> I even use a little in my hair and get many inquiries and compliments.</li>
            <li> White Musk for Women is a soft, clean fragrance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sweet and clean and lasts as long as more expensive colognes.</li>
            <li> I live for the smell of this.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I purchased it online instead of in a store and it will be the last.  </li>
            <li> (I buy this exact same perfume all the time).</li>
            <li> The back is a large warm body area, usually covered by clothes, that helps your fragrance to last all day.</li>
            <li> It is soft and not overpowering like perfumes.  </li>
            <li> But unfortunately it really doesn&#x27;t last at all -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a soft musk scent with some florals.</li>
            <li> Its not too strong.it has a soft smell.</li>
            <li> The price was much cheaper here than I&#x27;ve seen it in stores for the same size</li>
            <li> remember from my early years.  </li>
            <li> from the soft fragrence.</li>
            <li> Not a very pretty floral combination, and I&#x27;m not sure why it gets so many raves!  </li>
            <li> I purchased several fragrances from several different vendors on the exact day.</li>
            <li> I have worn many different perfumes in the past, but I always come back to the Jovan White Musk.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I ordered but it doesn&#x27;t smell like it normally does for some unknown reason</li>
            <li> Never over powering, always subtle, clean smelling.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments and have been using this for at least 20 yrs (and I am still in my 20s!!</li>
            <li> Well, before I was able to smell anything good I was hit hard in the face with a very heavy alcohol scent that was highly unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Would recommend it to people who are sensitive to other alcohol containing perfumes.</li>
            <li> The price,even with shipping costs was far less than when I get it from Dept. stores.</li>
            <li> I have been using Jovan for so long, I probably don&#x27;t even need to use the spray cologne</li>
            <li> wife still loves it, will continue to buy this product as long as they produce it.</li>
            <li> The bottle is bigger than I expected.  </li>
            <li> It lasts  a long time- almost all day.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem the same as the previous products I&#x27;ve used - it smells like chemicals when sprayed, and then there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any scent left at all.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t stay with you very long   is</li>
            <li> I have tried other fragrances over the years, some of which were very expensive, but they just weren&#x27;t as appealing as this scent and didn&#x27;t have the lasting power throughout the day that this has either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Soft, not overwhelming like some.  </li>
            <li> SELLER was amazon.com, LLC - this was not the Jovan White Musk I have used for years - It is a watered down version that the smell is gone with in 5 minutes.   </li>
            <li> I purchased this because I have always been a fan of white musk base notes, and I thought this might be clean enough that it won&#x27;t cause headaches and a bothered stomach.  </li>
            <li> The other sellers&#x27; goods arrived way faster than this one</li>
            <li> I will not wear any other scent but the Musk&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> A visit through a department store, even remotely close to the fragrance counter, morphs me into a head bobbing sneezing fiend with watering eyes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to order the other versions and compare to find one that works for me.</li>
            <li> About 1/5 of the bottle is empty!</li>
            <li> Other women always want to know what it is and where they can get it.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t bother people with sensitivities or allergies to other fragrances.</li>
            <li> I THINK IT MIXES WELL WITH OTHER SMELLS</li>
            <li> It actually lingers for quite a while on my skin, but in this case that&#x27;s not a very good thing.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they should revamp the packaging.  </li>
            <li> It almost seems watered down which would make sense considering</li>
            <li> I wasted my money and nothing makes me more angry than wasting my time or my money!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little heavier on the powdery notes.</li>
            <li> it disappears after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Not to heavy and lasted for a while.</li>
            <li> doesnt have the smell i am use to as if some ingredients are missing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s feminine, delicate, creamy, beautifully subtle - this is the only scent I can virtually bathe in</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it seems to be antiquated and no longer at local stores.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;what was once one of my very favorites.....is NO LONGER  :  (&lt;br /&gt;sad about that.......</li>
            <li> I started wearing JWM at least 10 years ago when I recieved a gift set for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I mean I sprits everything attached to me.</li>
            <li> i am serious.</li>
            <li> the 5th bad batch of jovan white musk i&#x27;ve purchased....retail and online here.....</li>
            <li> I along with everyone else work hard for my money,and for you to sell me something used is ridiculous!</li>
            <li> Even scents that appeal to me in the beginning will make me feel nauseated after awhile.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t go wrong for the sweetie in your life.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make me feel ill.  </li>
            <li> It smells like a faint bathroom spray.  </li>
            <li> I wear this scent when I want to drive a guy crazy.</li>
            <li> Never have a bad experience with this fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely frustrated and disappointed as I have had no time to get to a store and buy this so decided to order it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> This was a fake!!  </li>
            <li> I hate perfume.</li>
            <li> Either way I am VERY DISAPPOINTED!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s disgusting.</li>

            <li> Jovan White Musk a True Classic Cologne that gets lots of Compliments ALL the Time !!!</li>
            <li> This is my signature scent; fresh and clean but pretty and a little sexy.  Great everyday scent.</li>
            <li> I like the product and would probably purchase it again when needed.</li>
            <li> I purchased several fragrances from several different vendors on the exact day. The other sellers&#x27; goods arrived way faster than this one</li>
            <li> Price was great and is my favorite perfume my husband loves it.</li>
            <li> I love Jovan White Musk &amp; Musk Oil. The aroma is light, fresh, &amp; pleasant. I purchased 3 bottles of this.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in a timely manner and it was packaged well and it was just what I ordered. A great job. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Good product. GREAT price!</li>
            <li> This perfume, together with my pheromones, produces an incredible smell, my smell.  Love it, was complimented countless times since I started wearing it about 3 months ago.</li>
            <li> I wear this fragrance often and always get compliments.The price,even with shipping costs was far less than when I get it from Dept. stores. Same product, but you simply cannot beat the price! It arrived within the time frame quoted. LOVE itt! All good!!</li>
            <li> This is a great soft scent that I get complimented on often. I have used this and the regular Musk for years. I know musk is not for everyone but for me it is perfect. It is soft and not overpowering like perfumes.  I will not wear any other scent but the Musk&#x27;s. The price was good too.</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and myself are super sensitive to fragrances.  A visit through a department store, even remotely close to the fragrance counter, morphs me into a head bobbing sneezing fiend with watering eyes! This light and lovely Jovan White Musk Cologne spray is wonderful. No sneezing, no teary eyes and ALWAYS compliments on how great the fragrance is.  Hint - spray it on your back. The back is a large warm body area, usually covered by clothes, that helps your fragrance to last all day.</li>
            <li> A wonderful soft fresh white floral scent I love to wear year-round (and in winter &amp; spring especially). This is a scent I wore long ago in my early 20&#x27;s &amp; am now rediscovering it again in my late 30&#x27;s, loving it all the more.     It&#x27;s feminine, delicate, creamy, beautifully subtle - this is the only scent I can virtually bathe in &amp; it&#x27;s never overpowering or overwhelming. It lingers for a day or so when I spray it on my clothes. But unfortunately it really doesn&#x27;t last at all - I get no sillage with this fragrance &amp; on my skin it disappears after a few minutes. I wish it would wear longer. Thankfully it&#x27;s low-priced enough for its short lifespan to not to be a problem. I have 3 large bottles of this (home &amp; work) &amp; I spray them all liberally.    YUM!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic price for this spray cologne. I get many compliments on the scent when wearing this cologne.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume of all times. It is very light and the scent stays on me ALL DAY! I get so many compliments and have been using this for at least 20 yrs (and I am still in my 20s!! lol) Highly recommend</li>
            <li> very pleased with prompt service and cologne was received as listed and with no problems. excellent price, prompt service all positives.</li>
            <li> Hi.  I have been using Jovan for so long, I probably don&#x27;t even need to use the spray cologne haha.</li>
            <li> So nice. A lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> I was wearing this scent yesterday and my boyfriend started sniffing my neck while we were cuddling on the couch. Then he continued smelling me, ad told me I smelled awesome and that the scent was actually turned him on! I&#x27;ve never had a guy notice anything I&#x27;ve been wearing like that. :)</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes, and for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it. It smells fantastic (it&#x27;s floral, but not headache inducing) and it lasts many hours on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this for decades. Budget perfume with a wonderful, soft musky smell. Its my signature smell; my friends say when they smell it on someone it reminds them of me. I pay $25-$30 for this at Walgreens.but get it here on Amazon for $10 and my free Prime shipping.</li>
            <li> wife still loves it, will continue to buy this product as long as they produce it. highly recommend it. can&#x27;t go wrong for the sweetie in your life.</li>
            <li> This is a old family favorite.  My Mom, my Sister &amp; I have been wearing this scent for YEARS.  So I am reordering it every couple months.  Great price since this big size is usually $25 in the stores.</li>
            <li> Most perfumes are quite potent in scent. This gentle scent is lovely. Makes a great gift for someone who likes light scented perfumes.</li>
            <li> Love it old time favorite.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem the same as the previous products I&#x27;ve used - it smells like chemicals when sprayed, and then there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any scent left at all.  Guess I&#x27;ll have to order the other versions and compare to find one that works for me.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of when I first met my wife. Great classic all around women smell.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this Drugstore Cologne since Jr. High School. It&#x27;s just a soft musk scent with some florals. Smells really clean and feminine.  I sometimes drench myself,  but,  still won&#x27;t be so strong or overwhelming. It last longer when drenched. It&#x27;s considered a day time scent. I actually think it&#x27;s anytime because it&#x27;s a clean-crisp scent. Who doesn&#x27;t like to smell clean.</li>
            <li> I abosolutly love it. It smells Good.. I would recommend anyone to purchase it.  Its not too strong.it has a soft smell.</li>
            <li> Better than most scents I&#x27;ve tried.  Light and pleasant.  The price I paid on Amazon was a real bargain!</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t actually say too much good about this, because it may be sold out when I want to order it again!  But it is my absolute favorite scent and I get many compliments on it.  I have ordered this product many times from Amazon and other offsite vendors, and it always arrives neatly packaged and new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for years! I love it and always get compliments whenever I wear it. It&#x27;s a so light, fresh and clean smelling how can you not love it</li>
            <li> the 5th bad batch of jovan white musk i&#x27;ve purchased....retail and online here.....&lt;br /&gt;what was once one of my very favorites.....is NO LONGER  :  (&lt;br /&gt;sad about that.......sigh........&lt;br /&gt;smells like a urine-like dissipation......ugh...and YUCK!!!</li>
            <li> Really nice, soft, sweet and long lasting colgne...My mom loves it!!.. totally recommended! really good cologne for a good price.</li>
            <li> I love this scent! musky, floral and light (but not TOO light) and it lingers. This was my signature scent when i was in junior high. its a very nice scent!!! much cheaper here than in the drugstore. :)</li>
            <li> Christmas present for wife.  She loves the Jovan Musk series, and I like the line of perfumes too.  Make her happy makes me happy.  Arrived quick and exactly as descrbed.</li>
            <li> 5 stars because it smells awesome!! I&#x27;ve always loved this scent but my sister-in-law decided she loved it also and started wearing it, so I stopped. Now she wears something else so I have come back to my favorite scent and am so very happy. The first time I wore it to work, all the college aged guys were commenting on how great it smelled...and I&#x27;m 54 years old!!  Its such a very feminine scent, it makes you feel beautiful!  Of all the perfumes I&#x27;ve worn over the years, this is the ONLY one that got so many compliments!!  Never again will I stop wearing this. I think its a scent for all ages, anyone who wants to feel beautiful and very feminine.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume.  This is a better deal than I can get in any local store and it arrived within 48 hours of ordering it!</li>
            <li> I wear it every day. The only scent that I can&#x27;t smell but everyone else does !  I absolutely LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Jovan White Musk By Jovan For Women, Cologne Spray, 3.25-Ounce Bottle&lt;br /&gt;My signature perfume.. I constantly get compliments &amp; have been wearing it for years.. young &amp; fresh</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cologne but I believe it must have a very high alcohol content as it dries out my skin and makes me itch.</li>
            <li> Really good purchase. I bought as a gift to my spouse and she liked it a lot. It smells smooth and is good for the day to day use.</li>
            <li> Good product.  My wife likes the scent.  The bottle is bigger than I expected.  Good value.  I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> SELLER was amazon.com, LLC - this was not the Jovan White Musk I have used for years - It is a watered down version that the smell is gone with in 5 minutes.   CHEAP JUNK!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this item on Sept. 21st. Got it Yesterday (9/29/10).I was so happy it came! Then I opened the box...It has been used!! About 1/5 of the bottle is empty! Now,I for one, could not go through this much of this perfume in a month..So..either someone was playing with this bottle or someone was using it for quite some time then decided to sell it.Either way I am VERY DISAPPOINTED!! Do I love this perfume? Absolutely! Do I want to keep this bottle and ever buy from AMAZON.COM,LLC again? Not a chance!! Believe I will keep a closer eye on who I am purchasing from! I along with everyone else work hard for my money,and for you to sell me something used is ridiculous!</li>
            <li> In the store this perfume can be close to 30.00. Will be ordering again. Smells wonderful. And it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> What was delivered to me was not Jovan White Musk. This was a fake!!  I have been using this perfume for years and the one I got is colored water with no scent. I am extremely frustrated and disappointed as I have had no time to get to a store and buy this so decided to order it. I wasted my money and nothing makes me more angry than wasting my time or my money!!</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because was a good price for the size of the bottle. I would probably share this or recommend this fragrance. That is all I have to write about this product.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant smell.  It lasts  a long time- almost all day.  Not overwhelming and chemical,  but light, warm, floral  and overall very feminine.  Would recommend it to people who are sensitive to other alcohol containing perfumes.</li>
            <li> I have worn Jovan White Musk for over 20 years. Everyone compliments me on it; I guess it really mixes well with my body chemistry. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do if they ever discontinue it!</li>
            <li> Great quality and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> Great perfume.....have never worn anything else.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I am a cosmetics snob.  I love perfume, but I have a difficult time wearing most of them.  Even scents that appeal to me in the beginning will make me feel nauseated after awhile.  I purchased this because I have always been a fan of white musk base notes, and I thought this might be clean enough that it won&#x27;t cause headaches and a bothered stomach.  I love it.  It is cheap.  It smells great on me.  I get compliments every time I wear it.  It doesn&#x27;t make me feel ill.  My only complaint is that they should revamp the packaging.  The bottle looks so retro, like something my Granny would have on her dresser.  Smells great though!</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and damage-free! My mother has been in love with this scent for years!</li>
            <li> This was requested by my daughter for her Christmas gift. She has used this product before and was glad to receive it.</li>
            <li> I live for the smell of this. I bought 3 in one sitting. I mean I sprits everything attached to me. I don&#x27;t know what I would do if they ever discontinued this smell, but man am I going to keep smelling delicious for as long as possible. You heard me... DELICIOUS!!</li>
            <li> I love my Jovan White Musk and wear it all the time.  Good price too.</li>
            <li> Love the light scent, great as an all over body spray after lotioning and before dressing. The price was much cheaper here than I&#x27;ve seen it in stores for the same size</li>
            <li> Love the smell Everyone ask what I&#x27;m wearing. Very happy with this cologne.</li>
            <li> This perfume is the best just wished they would offer lotion because I would buy them out. And more perfume also</li>
            <li> So reminded of of my high school days, I love it !!! Will order it again for sure !! Happy here :)</li>
            <li> Like the scent of this cologne and have used it for years.  This was a vey good price.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance.  I haven&#x27;t worn cologne in a while so this was a perfect place to start.  Not to heavy and lasted for a while.</li>
            <li> scent smells good -but doesn&#x27;t stay with you very long   is fresh smelling and clean-price was right so thought i would try it</li>
            <li> I started wearing JWM at least 10 years ago when I recieved a gift set for Christmas. It was love at first whiff. I&#x27;m not a fan of overpowering or spicy scents, so this is perfect, It&#x27;s soft, delicate, fresh, and clean. Even my aunt, who gets headaches and allergies from most perfumes, loves this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Jovan White Musk for almost 15 years.  This is the first time I purchased it online instead of in a store and it will be the last.  It almost seems watered down which would make sense considering the size of the bottle is pretty large for such a cheap price.  Scent doesn&#x27;t even last for an hour after putting it on.  Very disappointing.  I&#x27;ll be going back to the store to buy from now on.</li>
            <li> Arrived intact. Smells good.</li>
            <li> I bought this today out of desperation while waiting for the Body Shop version to arrive. I wore TBS White Musk years ago and loved it. When I accidentally came across the Jovan White Musk in the store today I remembered the many great reviews it received on Amazon and thought I could use it until the TBS parfum oil arrived. I sprayed it on immediately after leaving the store And??? Well, before I was able to smell anything good I was hit hard in the face with a very heavy alcohol scent that was highly unpleasant. This does not happen with the parfum oil as it it&#x27;s not diluted with alcohol. Still,  since it was only meant to satisfy the craving this was not the deal breaker. After about two our three minutes the alcohol smell had dissipated and the White Musk finally came through - the beloved scent I remembered. The notes are slightly different than the White Musk from TBS. It&#x27;s a little heavier on the powdery notes. The reason why it will REMAIN a desperation purchase and not a permanent addition to my perfume stash: IT DOES NOT LAST! AT ALL! It was gone within an hour and THAT&#x27;S a deal breaker!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Have worn it for years. Never over powering, always subtle, clean smelling.</li>
            <li> I realize this is an &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; scent but it is mine &amp; I like it a lot. This was a very good buy &amp; bundles for free shipping worked very well.</li>
            <li> This fresh, just out the shower scent continues to be a main staple in my collection..#LUVIT</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume great price. Tks,&lt;br /&gt;Shir Bloom</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite colognes. White Musk for Women is a soft, clean fragrance. I even use a little in my hair and get many inquiries and compliments. A great fragrance at a great price.</li>
            <li> Jovan White Musk for women was inspired by the White Mallow blossom (botanical name Malva moschata alba - moschata means &#x27;musk-scented&#x27;) and it has been my favorite scent since it was first launched in 1992. I have tried other fragrances over the years, some of which were very expensive, but they just weren&#x27;t as appealing as this scent and didn&#x27;t have the lasting power throughout the day that this has either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is made by Coty in New York, New York, USA and is a wonderfully warm and entirely feminine fragrance that Coty describes as a blend of \\&quot;alluring Jasmine, ylang-ylang, honeysuckle, sensual musk, soft woods, and amber.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had soooo many compliments on it over the years by both men and women. Other women always want to know what it is and where they can get it. And it doesn&#x27;t bother people with sensitivities or allergies to other fragrances. That to me says that Coty hit the bull&#x27;s-eye with this fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS: SD Alcohol-C, Fragrance, Water, Benzophenone, FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5, D&amp;C Red No.3.</li>
            <li> Only gets 2 stars from me because it&#x27;s not overpowering.  It smells like a faint bathroom spray.  Not a very pretty floral combination, and I&#x27;m not sure why it gets so many raves!  It actually lingers for quite a while on my skin, but in this case that&#x27;s not a very good thing.</li>
            <li> Love the scent!  Very clean smelling</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite cologne, it comes in a well designed spray bottle and it is 3.25 ounces and for a bottle this size it had the best price.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;The price was excellent so I couldn&#x27;t pass&lt;br /&gt;up the offer. Love Jovan Musk</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of this scent since I can remember,  I literally will approach woman to tell them how great they smell when they are wearing this.  The only other scent that comes close to the warm,  soft,  sweet smell that embodies feminine that this does is \\&quot;warm vanilla sugar\\&quot;  from bath and body works.  They are very similar,  but the White musk pulls ahead with a more lasting,  and more intriguing scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By far the most \\&quot;approach me\\&quot;  scent out there..</li>
            <li> It is great can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s the same as I buy in the store but for much less! Thank you</li>
            <li> This is a light fragrance, great for everyday. I am always complemented whenever I wear it. It&#x27;s inexpensive and smells good.</li>
            <li> Have always loved this scent-and decided to &amp;#34;add&amp;#34; to my perfume collection making old memories new again! I was not disappointed- it&#x27;s still a &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; inviting a kiss on the neck, scent!  After I received White Musk-was in big box store, and it caught my eye- this size was $20.00 - great savings from Amazon!  Thank you for this gift!</li>
            <li> Very nice!  I will buy more!  Great deal too!</li>
            <li> Nice sweet smell  Very easy on the skin after showering and also on the linen.  Keeps my room smelling delicious.</li>
            <li> Better than any box store competitor! Thank You!</li>
            <li> My mom loved this gift. This has been her favorite since I was a child, and this was a convenient last-minute gift.</li>
            <li> My mother has been wearing this stuff for years.  Unfortunately, it seems to be antiquated and no longer at local stores.  I found it online and she was very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great deal.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great deal and fast shipping</li>
            <li> This Jovan White Musk is just like the musk&lt;br /&gt;I remember from my early years.  I would&lt;br /&gt;recommend it to anyone who likes the musk scent&lt;br /&gt;it is light and pleasant.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorites.  It arrived on time as promised.  I will definately order this again.</li>
            <li> I have worn this cologne for years, I get so many compliments on it.  It has a clean fresh smell, not overpowering.  This and Chanel Chance are the only two perfumes that I wear.</li>
            <li> it has no smell and i have just been ripped off. Will not recommend this for nobody....not good. please don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this scent since high school and get compliment daily on how good I smell. Was shipped super fast</li>
            <li> Product came in a timely manner. No complaints</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my Mom...she loves White Musk. Some of the stores around my area carry this size but more expensive so I always buy from Amazon. Great size at a great price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I ordered but it doesn&#x27;t smell like it normally does for some unknown reason (I buy this exact same perfume all the time).</li>
            <li> Wonderful product ..love it!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff.  She gets happy every time she gets a package in the mail.  I order these 3 bottles at a time.  Fresh smelling slightly sweet, without being overbearing.  This is a feminine smell that&#x27;s pleasant, but works for the office environment too.  This is my wife&#x27;s favorite for 8 years running.</li>
            <li> Not a scent I would wear my I bought this for my grandmother for xmas and she loves it! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Never have a bad experience with this fragrance.  Compliments all the time.  Hope it never gets discontinued!! Maybe I should stock up on more just in case!</li>
            <li> THIS WAS JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.  NOT TO STRONG YET THERE.  I THINK IT MIXES WELL WITH OTHER SMELLS I MAY HAVE ON.</li>
            <li> I have worn many different perfumes in the past, but I always come back to the Jovan White Musk.  It has a light scent and stays with me all day.</li>
            <li> this is all I ever wear and this is the only place I will buy from.</li>
            <li> does not smell like the original white musk.  and of course i can return it cause its considered hazardous material</li>
            <li> It smells nice when I first put it on me, but the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I am ordering this for a friend because she and her daughter&lt;br /&gt;have always, only used this product and have gotten so many&lt;br /&gt;compliments from the soft fragrence.</li>
            <li> It is the only fragrance I am able to wear.</li>
            <li> My girlfrind loves this stuff honestly idl why but i cant complain better then buying really high end ones</li>
            <li> This cologne is reminiscent of scents I grew up around. It&#x27;s very sweet and clean and lasts as long as more expensive colognes. It is good anytime or any day. I have been looking for an every day cologne for a while and this one is the best.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Love White Musk by Jovan and loved the price of this one.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice fragrance.  Have worn it along with another musk fragrance for years. Soft, not overwhelming like some.  Have received many compliments on this fragrance, mostly from men.  Shipped quick and very good price.</li>
            <li> I wear this scent when I want to drive a guy crazy. Its clean, warm, floral but not flowery, intoxicating and it lasts a long time</li>
            <li> i love this stuff. it is not very expensive and i get compliments on it ALL.THE.TIME. i am serious. all the time. i love it. i&#x27;ll never use anything else!</li>
            <li> loved this stuff since 1993 when received as a gift.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I was happy to recieve this product, especially for the price I paid! It smells amazing! I have been wearing it for decades!</li>
            <li> doesnt have the smell i am use to as if some ingredients are missing</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite perfume! It must work well with my body chemisty since I get the most compliments when wearing it. Even after all day, I&#x27;ve still had people say &amp;#34;you smell so good.&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s an oldie but goodie!</li>
            <li> I hate perfume. I LOVE THIS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a guy who basically hates all perfume. It&#x27;s disgusting. It funks up the environment. But I LOVE this scent! It is amazing! It makes me happy. I can&#x27;t explain it. It&#x27;s magical.</li>
            <li> Excellent price and delivered on time!</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for me one year for Christmas as a gift. It came with the shower gel and body lotion in a gift pack. I have been buying it ever since. I mainly use it in the winter because it has a heavier scent that I like to have in the colder months. I recomend this to anyone who likes a musk verses a flowery scent.</li>
            <li> My wife love the scent and would recommend this cologne for any female.</li>
