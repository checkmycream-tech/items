I love this gentle wash and the Mosture Lotion.  The Wash is veHry concentrated so a little goes a long way.  I have recently had a problem finding it.  I tried several other exzema products.  They all made my skin itch.  I&#x27;m sticking with Neosporin Body Wash.  I just hope the manufactures get their supply problems worked out.</li>
