            <li>Have to say I am very happy with this new brand</li>
            <li>By far, the best blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>Cord is nice doesn&#x27;t twist like so many,</li>
            <li>I researched the most popular dryers and decided on the Peony Turbo Johnson.  </li>
            <li>fast and smooth very, very happy!!!!!</li>
            <li>But I was very impressed with the detailed suggestions given by Xtava to use this product while not damaging your hair with too much heat,etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought it though.</li>
            <li>Dries just as well or better than anything that I have purchased.  </li>
            <li>I love this blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I love that it has 3 heat settings and 3 speeds.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to have to return a dryer which is absolutely excellent if only I could keep it running!</li>
            <li>You get a better &amp;#34;cold&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s pink-can&#x27;t get much better than that:)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Granddaughter love&#x27;s this blow dryer.</li>
            <li>So in love.</li>
            <li>Love this dryer.  </li>
            <li>I love it .its</li>
            <li>Love the dryer, attachments won&#x27;t stay on</li>
            <li>I wanted to love it</li>
            <li>I have been using my xtava peony 1875W hair dryer for 2 weeks now, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>It looks cute but</li>
            <li>We were happy with the no-frizz results and for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>i love the weight of it...</li>
            <li>heating was good but inconsistent not staying hot.</li>
            <li>heating was good but inconsistent not staying hot.</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t hurt that it is very attractive and has a long cord.</li>
            <li>Light and easy to use!</li>
            <li>it is absolutely awesome used to dry my hair for 20 minutes now its 5</li>
            <li>This dryer will be perfect for travel as it is light weight and has the power to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li>Overall a good buy!</li>
            <li>I had always gotten my hair dryers at beauty supply shops before, so I was a little nervous about this purchase, but the reviews sold me, and I am so glad I got it, and what a great price too!</li>
            <li>It is easy to hold, and adjust settings.  </li>
            <li>Love this hair dryer, it&#x27;s quiet and does a great job.  </li>
            <li>All the control buttons and switches are easy to find and use.  </li>
            <li>easy to handle with a lot of air power.</li>
            <li>I loved this blow dryer until it stopped working on power level high after one week of purchase.</li>
            <li>The color is a beautiful deep magenta.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length, fine hair, but a lot of it.</li>
            <li>The medium fan, medium heat setting is just fine.</li>
            <li>This is awesome, drys in half the time and doesn&#x27;t suck up my hair.</li>
            <li>Dryer is lightweight, operates well,  and dries hair safely and quickly, BUT...... the heat and speed tabs are located so that no matter how I hold the dryer, I keep accidentally changing the speed or heat, or I turn off the dryer altogether while I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li>cute and  dries your hair quickly,</li>
            <li>Such a good blow dryer, it dries my hair so quick, I love it !</li>
            <li>Light &amp; dries quickly without creating frizz!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had Revlon and Conair dryers, at the highest watts available.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my fiance as she wanted a more powerful hair dryer.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair look fabulous.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and ergonomic.</li>
            <li>The Peony is compact and will fit in a suitcase with ease for traveling.</li>
            <li>Fast and effective.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my fiance as she wanted a more powerful hair dryer.</li>
            <li>This worked great, then after owning it for only three months, it just quit.</li>
            <li>Guess I am out of luck since it is not longer available.</li>
            <li>the cool is usually more room temp than actually cool.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and very powerful.  </li>
            <li>Very powerful.....</li>
            <li>This is a very powerful hair dryer-</li>
            <li>Very powerful.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>pretty sure I just got a defective one, but probably wouldn&#x27;t get another one.</li>
            <li>pretty sure I just got a defective one, but probably wouldn&#x27;t get another one.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight and easy to use!</li>
            <li>However when I opened the package I just fell in love with the bright pink dryer!  </li>
            <li>The cool shot is actually cool; I find that in a lot of the cheaper hair dryers</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good dryer and works for me.</li>
            <li>Good blow dryer but WAY heavier than my last one.  </li>
            <li>has the options I use: two speeds, three temperature ranges, cool air shot, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also dries my hair so fast that my time in the mornings before work have gotten much more efficient.</li>
            <li>Dries my hair quickly without it frying my hair.</li>
            <li>Never had a dryer die that quickly.  </li>
            <li>If you prefer a long cord, this may be a good option for</li>
            <li>I love my new hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Loved it at first and wrote as such.</li>
            <li>It has a strong blow and the heat is intense.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also really pretty!</li>
            <li>the On/Off switch is located exactly where my thumb wraps around to hold the dryer... kept shutting it off!</li>
            <li>This dryer has the power and is a little more compact and more attractive than my other name brand full sized hair</li>
            <li>so I needed a hair dryer that was fast and somewhat light</li>
            <li>Great size, not too heavy or bulky.</li>
            <li>So far, I love it.  </li>
            <li>If it would&#x27;ve lasted a year I might have thought it would have been worth the money as these days</li>
            <li>If it would&#x27;ve lasted a year I might have thought it would have been worth the money as these days</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It dries  hair quickly without getting too hot.</li>
            <li>There are controls for speed and heat levels to deliver the right amount of drying for all hair types.</li>
            <li>Again, the high ratings on this product were justified.</li>
            <li>I love the 2 speeds and 3 temps available and use a combo of them whenever I dry my hair.  </li>
            <li>It is lighter weight and has a nice long cord.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly, but not perhaps as fast as some others I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>Her old hair dryer of another make stopped working and this dryer sounded like a good solid dryer.</li>
            <li>Pink is after all my favorite color!  </li>
            <li>great hair dryer and nice long thick cord that doesn&#x27;t get tangles.</li>
            <li>Blow dryer is great, it&#x27;s not as loud as other blow dryers, I love the color of it (pink) and it&#x27;s light to hold while blow drying.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.  </li>
            <li>This blow dryer works very fast.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is super cute, the color is a rich hot fink with black trim.</li>
            <li>This dryer is so powerful too, I have a fairly large bathroom while standing at the door</li>
            <li>Sound is not too loud like some dryers can be.  </li>
            <li>It has way more power than my last hair dryer, and it&#x27;s quieter.</li>
            <li>how powerful it was and how much power</li>
            <li>I just used it for the first time</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I want it to.  </li>
            <li>how powerful it was and how much power</li>
            <li>Love the cool shot and other settings.</li>
            <li>When you have the heat on high and push the &amp;#34;cold blast&amp;#34; button, it doesn&#x27;t really blow cool air but just cuts the heat to a lower degree.  </li>
            <li>Great for the money used it for the first time and has lots of different uses than other blow dryers</li>
            <li>I love the dryer and expect to have years of use from it as long as my nieces don&#x27;t steal it just because of the girly color.</li>
            <li>Love the hot pink color</li>
            <li>However, it is so strong at the strongest setting, I use the lower one when doing the actually styling.</li>
            <li>The dryer works wonderfully but was missing the round attatchment.</li>
            <li>: 1) it is loud - in fact it is louder than my old cheap revlon 2)</li>
            <li>Really lightweight and heats well</li>
            <li>Picked your product out and my wife absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>and it is definitely MUCH stronger than the drugstore brands.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this hair dryer and would buy again!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think they really belong to this dryer.</li>
            <li>My hair really shines.</li>
            <li>This blowdryer dries my hair SO SO fast.</li>
            <li>Really dries fast without frizzing.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>My old one finally died so I decided to see what the Ceramic Ionic was all about and can truthfully say, I saw a difference after drying my hair.</li>
            <li>love this dryer use heavily in salon weightless And powerful</li>
            <li>Wow!!!</li>
            <li>It is so light weight and easy to maneuver for my small hands.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this, seriously if it broke tomorrow, I&#x27;d buy it again!</li>
            <li>so my long fine hair gets so tangled up by the focused stream of air.  </li>
            <li>I liked the power level and heat levels but the controls are confusing as they are exactly alike.</li>
            <li>The pink is such a nice color.</li>
            <li>I love the multiple speeds and the different heat settings.</li>
            <li>Really powerful - I can dry my fine frizzy hair straight on the medium heat setting and don&#x27;t need to flat iron afterward...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be interested to see their new products when they complete their relaunch.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t joking about it being a high velocity dryer either.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I recommend the Peony by Xtava for those who want a hair dryer that lasts for more than a few months.</li>
            <li>The dryer has a quiet, but powerful motor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful and quiet.</li>
            <li>I love these because I use a round brush</li>
            <li>The back has a double screen, the outer one of which can be easily removed to release hair that may have been accidentally sucked into the dryer.  </li>
            <li>I love the extra long cord!!  </li>
            <li>I already had a decent hair dryer, but was interested in getting a second non-travel sized dryer.</li>
            <li>I use the small as I have short hair, but the larger one will be great for sharing with my granddaughters when they are here with me.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is ok, but not sure it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Wife needed a new hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Not only is Pink my favorite color...</li>
            <li>As for the overheating, I have not had that, but I will say that I discovered pretty quickly that you don&#x27;t actually need the highest fan/heat setting to dry your hair.  </li>
            <li>Pretty pink, durable long cord and light weight.  </li>
            <li>If you have short hair, it may dry too quickly with this dryer and you may not feel much advantage to this because you&#x27;ll need to limit yourself to the lower setting anyway.</li>
            <li>I have really long thick wavy hair and drying has always taken a good 15-20 min.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quieter than my old one and has adjustments for both the heat and speed.</li>
            <li>The cord is very think and not as flexible as my last</li>
            <li>Based on what experience I have so far, I like it.&lt;br /&gt;Alberta</li>
            <li>not heavy.</li>
            <li>and this allows me to direct heat to the area I&#x27;m working on and</li>
            <li>it is on the heavier side, again heavier than my old blow dryer.</li>
            <li>We both have naturally curly and frizz prone hair.</li>
            <li>dry hair very fast.</li>
            <li>Drys my hair better than my previous much more expensive dryer.</li>
            <li>The hot pink color is epic and is lightweight.</li>
            <li>exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>I used to dry my shirt, very high heat.</li>
            <li>- Dropping to 3 stars, two years later, my poor hair dryer broke; I thought nothing of it, seeing as though it got significant use and hopped right on Amazon and ordered the identical one.</li>
            <li>It worked pretty well for 2 months until it died yesterday by overheating, maybe due to</li>
            <li>It worked pretty well for 2 months until it died yesterday by overheating, maybe due to</li>
            <li>Powerful motor dries my thick hair quickly compared to other hair dryers.</li>
            <li>Should last longer, feels professional quality.</li>
            <li>Love this dryer but the switches are poorly located on the handle.  </li>
            <li>Paired with the black orchid diffuser also from xtava, my dry time has been significantly reduced by this baby.</li>
            <li>My old hair dryer practically sounded like a vacuum cleaner.  </li>
            <li>Decided to try this new brand based on reviews and the fact that my last two dryers only lasted 2 years each.</li>
            <li>I am able to dry late at night without worrying about waking anyone up now.  </li>
            <li>It has a lot of power needed for those quick hair dry jobs and is not overly bulky or heavy.  </li>

            <li> If it came with something to diffuse the air or widen the opening it would be great.  </li>

            <li> Nice Dryer  </li>
            <li> I received it to review and all opinions expressed are my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> find this hair dryer effective for drying and styling my hair.</li>
            <li> Cool shot works great.</li>
            <li> Have to say I am very happy with this new brand</li>
            <li> By far, the best blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Cord is nice doesn&#x27;t twist like so many,</li>
            <li> I researched the most popular dryers and decided on the Peony Turbo Johnson.  </li>
            <li> fast and smooth very, very happy!!!!!</li>
            <li> But I was very impressed with the detailed suggestions given by Xtava to use this product while not damaging your hair with too much heat,etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought it though.</li>
            <li> Dries just as well or better than anything that I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I love that it has 3 heat settings and 3 speeds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to return a dryer which is absolutely excellent if only I could keep it running!</li>
            <li> You get a better &amp;#34;cold&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s pink-can&#x27;t get much better than that:)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Granddaughter love&#x27;s this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> So in love.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer.  </li>
            <li> I love it .its</li>
            <li> Love the dryer, attachments won&#x27;t stay on</li>
            <li> I wanted to love it</li>
            <li> I have been using my xtava peony 1875W hair dryer for 2 weeks now, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> It looks cute but</li>
            <li> We were happy with the no-frizz results and for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> i love the weight of it...</li>
            <li> heating was good but inconsistent not staying hot.</li>
            <li> heating was good but inconsistent not staying hot.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t hurt that it is very attractive and has a long cord.</li>
            <li> Light and easy to use!</li>
            <li> it is absolutely awesome used to dry my hair for 20 minutes now its 5</li>
            <li> This dryer will be perfect for travel as it is light weight and has the power to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> Overall a good buy!</li>
            <li> I had always gotten my hair dryers at beauty supply shops before, so I was a little nervous about this purchase, but the reviews sold me, and I am so glad I got it, and what a great price too!</li>
            <li> It is easy to hold, and adjust settings.  </li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer, it&#x27;s quiet and does a great job.  </li>
            <li> All the control buttons and switches are easy to find and use.  </li>
            <li> easy to handle with a lot of air power.</li>
            <li> I loved this blow dryer until it stopped working on power level high after one week of purchase.</li>
            <li> The color is a beautiful deep magenta.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, fine hair, but a lot of it.</li>
            <li> The medium fan, medium heat setting is just fine.</li>
            <li> This is awesome, drys in half the time and doesn&#x27;t suck up my hair.</li>
            <li> Dryer is lightweight, operates well,  and dries hair safely and quickly, BUT...... the heat and speed tabs are located so that no matter how I hold the dryer, I keep accidentally changing the speed or heat, or I turn off the dryer altogether while I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li> cute and  dries your hair quickly,</li>
            <li> Such a good blow dryer, it dries my hair so quick, I love it !</li>
            <li> Light &amp; dries quickly without creating frizz!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had Revlon and Conair dryers, at the highest watts available.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiance as she wanted a more powerful hair dryer.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair look fabulous.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and ergonomic.</li>
            <li> The Peony is compact and will fit in a suitcase with ease for traveling.</li>
            <li> Fast and effective.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiance as she wanted a more powerful hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This worked great, then after owning it for only three months, it just quit.</li>
            <li> Guess I am out of luck since it is not longer available.</li>
            <li> the cool is usually more room temp than actually cool.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and very powerful.  </li>
            <li> Very powerful.....</li>
            <li> This is a very powerful hair dryer-</li>
            <li> Very powerful.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> pretty sure I just got a defective one, but probably wouldn&#x27;t get another one.</li>
            <li> pretty sure I just got a defective one, but probably wouldn&#x27;t get another one.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight and easy to use!</li>
            <li> However when I opened the package I just fell in love with the bright pink dryer!  </li>
            <li> The cool shot is actually cool; I find that in a lot of the cheaper hair dryers</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a good dryer and works for me.</li>
            <li> Good blow dryer but WAY heavier than my last one.  </li>
            <li> has the options I use: two speeds, three temperature ranges, cool air shot, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also dries my hair so fast that my time in the mornings before work have gotten much more efficient.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair quickly without it frying my hair.</li>
            <li> Never had a dryer die that quickly.  </li>
            <li> If you prefer a long cord, this may be a good option for</li>
            <li> I love my new hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Loved it at first and wrote as such.</li>
            <li> It has a strong blow and the heat is intense.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also really pretty!</li>
            <li> the On/Off switch is located exactly where my thumb wraps around to hold the dryer... kept shutting it off!</li>
            <li> This dryer has the power and is a little more compact and more attractive than my other name brand full sized hair</li>
            <li> so I needed a hair dryer that was fast and somewhat light</li>
            <li> Great size, not too heavy or bulky.</li>
            <li> So far, I love it.  </li>
            <li> If it would&#x27;ve lasted a year I might have thought it would have been worth the money as these days</li>
            <li> If it would&#x27;ve lasted a year I might have thought it would have been worth the money as these days</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It dries  hair quickly without getting too hot.</li>
            <li> There are controls for speed and heat levels to deliver the right amount of drying for all hair types.</li>
            <li> Again, the high ratings on this product were justified.</li>
            <li> I love the 2 speeds and 3 temps available and use a combo of them whenever I dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> It is lighter weight and has a nice long cord.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly, but not perhaps as fast as some others I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> Her old hair dryer of another make stopped working and this dryer sounded like a good solid dryer.</li>
            <li> Pink is after all my favorite color!  </li>
            <li> great hair dryer and nice long thick cord that doesn&#x27;t get tangles.</li>
            <li> Blow dryer is great, it&#x27;s not as loud as other blow dryers, I love the color of it (pink) and it&#x27;s light to hold while blow drying.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.  </li>
            <li> This blow dryer works very fast.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is super cute, the color is a rich hot fink with black trim.</li>
            <li> This dryer is so powerful too, I have a fairly large bathroom while standing at the door</li>
            <li> Sound is not too loud like some dryers can be.  </li>
            <li> It has way more power than my last hair dryer, and it&#x27;s quieter.</li>
            <li> how powerful it was and how much power</li>
            <li> I just used it for the first time</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I want it to.  </li>
            <li> how powerful it was and how much power</li>
            <li> Love the cool shot and other settings.</li>
            <li> When you have the heat on high and push the &amp;#34;cold blast&amp;#34; button, it doesn&#x27;t really blow cool air but just cuts the heat to a lower degree.  </li>
            <li> Great for the money used it for the first time and has lots of different uses than other blow dryers</li>
            <li> I love the dryer and expect to have years of use from it as long as my nieces don&#x27;t steal it just because of the girly color.</li>
            <li> Love the hot pink color</li>
            <li> However, it is so strong at the strongest setting, I use the lower one when doing the actually styling.</li>
            <li> The dryer works wonderfully but was missing the round attatchment.</li>
            <li> : 1) it is loud - in fact it is louder than my old cheap revlon 2)</li>
            <li> Really lightweight and heats well</li>
            <li> Picked your product out and my wife absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> and it is definitely MUCH stronger than the drugstore brands.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this hair dryer and would buy again!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they really belong to this dryer.</li>
            <li> My hair really shines.</li>
            <li> This blowdryer dries my hair SO SO fast.</li>
            <li> Really dries fast without frizzing.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> My old one finally died so I decided to see what the Ceramic Ionic was all about and can truthfully say, I saw a difference after drying my hair.</li>
            <li> love this dryer use heavily in salon weightless And powerful</li>
            <li> Wow!!!</li>
            <li> It is so light weight and easy to maneuver for my small hands.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this, seriously if it broke tomorrow, I&#x27;d buy it again!</li>
            <li> so my long fine hair gets so tangled up by the focused stream of air.  </li>
            <li> I liked the power level and heat levels but the controls are confusing as they are exactly alike.</li>
            <li> The pink is such a nice color.</li>
            <li> I love the multiple speeds and the different heat settings.</li>
            <li> Really powerful - I can dry my fine frizzy hair straight on the medium heat setting and don&#x27;t need to flat iron afterward...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be interested to see their new products when they complete their relaunch.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t joking about it being a high velocity dryer either.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I recommend the Peony by Xtava for those who want a hair dryer that lasts for more than a few months.</li>
            <li> The dryer has a quiet, but powerful motor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful and quiet.</li>
            <li> I love these because I use a round brush</li>
            <li> The back has a double screen, the outer one of which can be easily removed to release hair that may have been accidentally sucked into the dryer.  </li>
            <li> I love the extra long cord!!  </li>
            <li> I already had a decent hair dryer, but was interested in getting a second non-travel sized dryer.</li>
            <li> I use the small as I have short hair, but the larger one will be great for sharing with my granddaughters when they are here with me.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is ok, but not sure it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Wife needed a new hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Not only is Pink my favorite color...</li>
            <li> As for the overheating, I have not had that, but I will say that I discovered pretty quickly that you don&#x27;t actually need the highest fan/heat setting to dry your hair.  </li>
            <li> Pretty pink, durable long cord and light weight.  </li>
            <li> If you have short hair, it may dry too quickly with this dryer and you may not feel much advantage to this because you&#x27;ll need to limit yourself to the lower setting anyway.</li>
            <li> I have really long thick wavy hair and drying has always taken a good 15-20 min.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quieter than my old one and has adjustments for both the heat and speed.</li>
            <li> The cord is very think and not as flexible as my last</li>
            <li> Based on what experience I have so far, I like it.&lt;br /&gt;Alberta</li>
            <li> not heavy.</li>
            <li> and this allows me to direct heat to the area I&#x27;m working on and</li>
            <li> it is on the heavier side, again heavier than my old blow dryer.</li>
            <li> We both have naturally curly and frizz prone hair.</li>
            <li> dry hair very fast.</li>
            <li> Drys my hair better than my previous much more expensive dryer.</li>
            <li> The hot pink color is epic and is lightweight.</li>
            <li> exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> I used to dry my shirt, very high heat.</li>
            <li> - Dropping to 3 stars, two years later, my poor hair dryer broke; I thought nothing of it, seeing as though it got significant use and hopped right on Amazon and ordered the identical one.</li>
            <li> It worked pretty well for 2 months until it died yesterday by overheating, maybe due to</li>
            <li> It worked pretty well for 2 months until it died yesterday by overheating, maybe due to</li>
            <li> Powerful motor dries my thick hair quickly compared to other hair dryers.</li>
            <li> Should last longer, feels professional quality.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer but the switches are poorly located on the handle.  </li>
            <li> Paired with the black orchid diffuser also from xtava, my dry time has been significantly reduced by this baby.</li>
            <li> My old hair dryer practically sounded like a vacuum cleaner.  </li>
            <li> Decided to try this new brand based on reviews and the fact that my last two dryers only lasted 2 years each.</li>
            <li> I am able to dry late at night without worrying about waking anyone up now.  </li>
            <li> It has a lot of power needed for those quick hair dry jobs and is not overly bulky or heavy.  </li>
            <li> I used it once every other day for approximately 5 minutes, because it dried my hair super fast, on medium heat, high air.</li>
            <li> The dry is smaller than my previous ones, which I like too and is also definitely much quieter.</li>
            <li> It is a bit loud but that doesn&#x27;t bother me and I don&#x27;t find any any heavier than other dryers I&#x27;ve had that are made by XTAVA.</li>
            <li> It is considerably longer than my other dryer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dry mid April it broke by mid May of 2015</li>
            <li> Is also much quieter than blow dryers I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> It does come with two concentrator nozzles one for long hair and one for short.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, and it just takes me about 10 minutes to dry my hair entirely!</li>
            <li> --it just doesn&#x27;t have enough power to quickly dry my long hair.</li>
            <li> It is not loud.  </li>
            <li> (so I cannot say how long it lasts).  </li>
            <li> My wife loves the pink color and how quiet it is.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comment on long term reliability.  </li>
            <li> the cord is long.</li>
            <li> like the long cord.</li>
            <li> long.</li>
            <li> But that is a minor preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not have to dry it as long now</li>
            <li> It only lasted three  months had to buy other blow dryer.</li>
            <li> so I could dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I use this dryer with a diffuser when I dry my hair curly</li>
            <li> I have used it only a few times since my recent purchase</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s feels solid, but is not that heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve pushed in on harder</li>
            <li> I have a short bob and it took me 2 or 3 minutes after I had towel dried my hair.</li>
            <li> I have fairly short hair and this dried my hair in a matter of minutes on medium speed.</li>
            <li> My long, thick hair was dry in about 7 minutes flat.  </li>
            <li> I accidentally push the switches when I don&#x27;t mean to because of the placement on the handle when I am drying, but its a small price to pay for a decent dryer!</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve never used anything but the strongest with any other dryer)  </li>
            <li> it was blowing my shower curtain and towels on the other side of the room.  </li>
            <li> and I like how it has buttons to push rather than slide like other ones I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> My daughter used mine the other day and went home and ordered one for herself.</li>
            <li> I can blow dry my hair in a just a few minutes now; it took f o r e v e r before.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thick, not flat.</li>
            <li> It dried my hair in half the time and didn&#x27;t look as dry.</li>
            <li> *Dropping to one star since their customer service still hasn&#x27;t replied to me regarding my warranty replacement or refund on my 2 month old broken hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It will defiantly cut down your drying time.</li>
            <li> results in less damage to my hair.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a dryer that was less noisy than the one I was using.  </li>
            <li> Of course, like all dryers, this one make noise but it is less than the one it replaces.  </li>
            <li> It would have taken less time if I didn&#x27;t have to use brushes to style with.  </li>
            <li> I like this since I move around a bit while drying and have accidentally unplugged my previous hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, to my dismay, my brand new replacement broke less than 2 months after purchase - and failed in the same way my last one did.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to exchange it but not its no longer available through Amazon :(</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t lie, the reviews made me a little hesitant to buy this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little heavier than I wanted</li>
            <li> Dead.  </li>
            <li> Have used it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Blow dryer stopped working after a few months.</li>
            <li> I know there are less expensive hair dryers out there, but I want a dryer that will last.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately the attachments included only narrow the air flow</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been frustrated by how long it takes it to dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to use the dryer without accidentally pressing one or both of the buttons.  </li>
            <li> I had to replace my T3 and was looking for something less expensive.  </li>
            <li> , it got really hot and smelled horrible.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a happy customer</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> Not happy, would not buy again.</li>
            <li> hair isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;over-dried&amp;#34;, noise isn&#x27;t too bad, like other dryers.  </li>
            <li> Not perfect, but close.</li>
            <li> Had been contemplating paying another expensive dryer until I read the reviews on this one.</li>
            <li> I still find the location of the buttons awkward and would invariably hit the wrong one or turn it off by mistake.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s crazy and I did nothing to cause it to start smoking and smelling like it was going to catch fire, no air coming out, can&#x27;t use it, can&#x27;t return it now...</li>
            <li> Not impressed and extremely disappointed in their lack of customer service.</li>
            <li> I always purchased very expensive blow dryers.  </li>
            <li> Too bad, maybe just a lemon.  </li>
            <li> I have had 10 dollar blow dryers that I got sick of well before they died.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I always consider the evidence as I am rarely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Kinda&#x27; annoying but the dryer blows like a hurricane.  </li>
            <li> and she absolutely hated it.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the extra long cord!!  Sound is not too loud like some dryers can be.  Very satisfied with this choice!</li>
            <li> Works great on my curly hair. I do not have to dry it as long now and I love the color!</li>
            <li> Excellent. great seller. great product. very happy.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t lie, the reviews made me a little hesitant to buy this hair dryer. Almost all the reviews are good, but a lot of them were in exchange for this hair dryer. I&#x27;m so glad I bought it though. This thing is amazing. It has way more power than my last hair dryer, and it&#x27;s quieter. If my daughter says something to me while I&#x27;m using it, I can actually hear her.&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s feels solid, but is not that heavy. I can blow dry my hair in a just a few minutes now; it took f o r e v e r before. The pink is such a nice color. The cool shot is actually cool; I find that in a lot of the cheaper hair dryers the cool is usually more room temp than actually cool. I am so happy with this, seriously if it broke tomorrow, I&#x27;d buy it again!</li>
            <li> I always purchased very expensive blow dryers.  Thought I would try this one because of the reviews.  So far, I love it.  Dries just as well or better than anything that I have purchased.  It is not loud.  Heat and power are excellent.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair dryer! I&#x27;ve been using Chi pro for atleast 10 years, not wanting to knock chi but this is the best dryer I&#x27;ve ever used. It dried my hair in half the time and didn&#x27;t look as dry. I was able make my hair smoother , the way I like it! The price is great and the color is beautiful. I will never purchase a more expensive one again......I found the perfect hair dryer that fit&#x27;s all my needs ....fast and smooth very, very happy!!!!!</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is ah-mazing!  It dries my medium length hair in 10 minutes even though I section each piece and use a brush!  Its a must-have for everyone.</li>
            <li> Really lightweight and heats well</li>
            <li> Well my wife&#x27;s hair dryer finally gave out. So we went and bought a revlon at the store and she absolutely hated it.  So I looked on amazon to see what they had to offer.  Picked your product out and my wife absolutely loves it.  Such a difference.  Excellent Product!</li>
            <li> This hair dryers is amazing! Dried my long hair fast and without making it frizz!</li>
            <li> This dryer will be perfect for travel as it is light weight and has the power to dry my hair.  Love the color!  I will definitely purchase from this company again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best dryer I have ever used. Dries my hair quickly without it frying my hair. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this hairdryer. It&#x27;s quieter than my old one and has adjustments for both the heat and speed. My hair looked sleeker after one use</li>
            <li> Very lightweight and easy to use! Is also much quieter than blow dryers I&#x27;ve had in the past. Dries quickly, but not perhaps as fast as some others I&#x27;ve used before. Overall a good buy!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this hair dryer.  She is off to college this fall.  She says it is the best dryer she has ever had.</li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer. I love that it has 3 heat settings and 3 speeds. It is so easy to use and a beautiful color. By far, the best blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever had. Well worth the money! Thank you for this product. A job well done!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had Revlon and Conair dryers, at the highest watts available. Decided to try this new brand based on reviews and the fact that my last two dryers only lasted 2 years each. Have to say I am very happy with this new brand and it is definitely MUCH stronger than the drugstore brands. I have shoulder length, fine hair, but a lot of it. I&#x27;ve been frustrated by how long it takes it to dry. This dryer definitely gets the job done quicker . However, it is so strong at the strongest setting, I use the lower one when doing the actually styling. (I&#x27;ve never used anything but the strongest with any other dryer)  If you have short hair, it may dry too quickly with this dryer and you may not feel much advantage to this because you&#x27;ll need to limit yourself to the lower setting anyway. The dry is smaller than my previous ones, which I like too and is also definitely much quieter. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Paired with the black orchid diffuser also from xtava, my dry time has been significantly reduced by this baby. Great settings, compact, easy to hold. Would definitely recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit - Dropping to 3 stars, two years later, my poor hair dryer broke; I thought nothing of it, seeing as though it got significant use and hopped right on Amazon and ordered the identical one. Unfortunately, to my dismay, my brand new replacement broke less than 2 months after purchase - and failed in the same way my last one did.  I will not be purchasing another, and have contacted Xtava requesting my money back. **Dropping to one star since their customer service still hasn&#x27;t replied to me regarding my warranty replacement or refund on my 2 month old broken hair dryer. Not impressed and extremely disappointed in their lack of customer service.</li>
            <li> great hair dryer and nice long thick cord that doesn&#x27;t get tangles.</li>
            <li> This is a great hairdryer. My old one finally died so I decided to see what the Ceramic Ionic was all about and can truthfully say, I saw a difference after drying my hair. It was smoother and very healthy looking and I am very pleased with my purchase. I also like that it comes with 2 sizes of concentrator nozzles. I use the small as I have short hair, but the larger one will be great for sharing with my granddaughters when they are here with me. I highly recommend this hair dryer and would buy again!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiance as she wanted a more powerful hair dryer. It worked pretty well for 2 months until it died yesterday by overheating, maybe due to how powerful it was and how much power it drew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heating was good but inconsistent not staying hot. If it would&#x27;ve lasted a year I might have thought it would have been worth the money as these days I don&#x27;t expect any electronic device under $50 to last longer than a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure I just got a defective one, but probably wouldn&#x27;t get another one.</li>
            <li> Wow!!! I have really long thick wavy hair and drying has always taken a good 15-20 min. This gets it done in 10! Love the cool shot and other settings. I accidentally push the switches when I don&#x27;t mean to because of the placement on the handle when I am drying, but its a small price to pay for a decent dryer! That would be the only possible improvement I could suggest. All around 5 stars! YAY finally!</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer!  I just used it for the first time (so I cannot say how long it lasts).  My long, thick hair was dry in about 7 minutes flat.  My hair feels so silky smooth.  It is easy to hold, and adjust settings.  The cool setting was perfect to set my style.  It is so quiet, too!  I am able to dry late at night without worrying about waking anyone up now.  My old hair dryer practically sounded like a vacuum cleaner.  This dryer is so powerful too, I have a fairly large bathroom while standing at the door it was blowing my shower curtain and towels on the other side of the room.  I would buy this again, and again!  So happy to have found this!</li>
            <li> Wife loves this hair dryer.  It looks good to!</li>
            <li> Dryer is lightweight, operates well,  and dries hair safely and quickly, BUT...... the heat and speed tabs are located so that no matter how I hold the dryer, I keep accidentally changing the speed or heat, or I turn off the dryer altogether while I&#x27;m using it. I&#x27;m really disappointed. I&#x27;m going to have to return a dryer which is absolutely excellent if only I could keep it running!</li>
            <li> Excellent dryer. Very quiet. Cool shot works great. Just what you need in watts. Cord is nice doesn&#x27;t twist like so many, it&#x27;s thick, not flat. Should last longer, feels professional quality.</li>
            <li> it is absolutely awesome used to dry my hair for 20 minutes now its 5 I recommend it to everybody</li>
            <li> I recently had shoulder surgery so I needed a hair dryer that was fast and somewhat light so I could dry my hair. This worked. I still find the location of the buttons awkward and would invariably hit the wrong one or turn it off by mistake. Not perfect, but close.</li>
            <li> Loved it at first and wrote as such. Then today, after only about 6 months of use, it burned up inside. Dead.  Very disappointing. I have had 10 dollar blow dryers that I got sick of well before they died.</li>
            <li> Not only is Pink my favorite color... it&#x27;s powerfully awesome. It has a strong blow and the heat is intense.</li>
            <li> This product stopped working in 3 months............dont buy this one.........</li>
            <li> Awesome! Light &amp; dries quickly without creating frizz!</li>
            <li> I like the hairdryer. It&#x27;s a little heavier than I wanted but I like the smaller size and the options for drying. The only thing I have a problem with is the attachments for flow of heat.  They don&#x27;t work well. Both of them just slip on end of dryer but they pop off while your using it. I&#x27;ve pushed in on harder but that doesn&#x27;t matter. I don&#x27;t think they really belong to this dryer. Overall, it&#x27;s a good dryer and works for me. I may try to buy a different attachment</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is a must have if you have biracial hair. I feel I get salon results with this blowdryer at home- it makes straightening a cinch and also works well with the diffuser when I rock my curls. The hot pink color is epic and is lightweight.</li>
            <li> Good blow dryer but WAY heavier than my last one.  When you have the heat on high and push the &amp;#34;cold blast&amp;#34; button, it doesn&#x27;t really blow cool air but just cuts the heat to a lower degree.  You get a better &amp;#34;cold&amp;#34; blast by starting at the lower heat setting and pressing the &amp;#34;cold blast&amp;#34; button.  The cord is very think and not as flexible as my last but maybe that&#x27;s a good thing.  IDK.  Love the color!</li>
            <li> My girl friend loves it. I used to dry my shirt, very high heat.</li>
            <li> As you can tell from the headline, I love this hair dryer!  It&#x27;s lightweight and very powerful.  It does exactly what I want it to.  My hair is short and it has halfed my drying time.  It makes my hair look fabulous.  And it&#x27;s pink-can&#x27;t get much better than that:)</li>
            <li> Great for the money used it for the first time and has lots of different uses than other blow dryers</li>
            <li> Wife needed a new hair dryer.  I researched the most popular dryers and decided on the Peony Turbo Johnson.  My wife loves the pink color and how quiet it is.</li>
            <li> Powerful motor dries my thick hair quickly compared to other hair dryers. Great size, not too heavy or bulky. Best dryer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I know there are less expensive hair dryers out there, but I want a dryer that will last.  The Peony has it all. There are controls for speed and heat levels to deliver the right amount of drying for all hair types. But I was very impressed with the detailed suggestions given by Xtava to use this product while not damaging your hair with too much heat,etc. I recommend the Peony by Xtava for those who want a hair dryer that lasts for more than a few months.</li>
            <li> Love this compact hairdryer!!</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer.  Good sender.</li>
            <li> Really powerful - I can dry my fine frizzy hair straight on the medium heat setting and don&#x27;t need to flat iron afterward...results in less damage to my hair.  I&#x27;m very happy with this dryer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dry mid April it broke by mid May of 2015 that&#x27;s crazy and I did nothing to cause it to start smoking and smelling like it was going to catch fire, no air coming out, can&#x27;t use it, can&#x27;t return it now... I&#x27;m not a happy customer I would not recommend the product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. I like my Elchim better, but this is good for now.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer, it&#x27;s quiet and does a great job.  My hair really shines.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this dryer.  I was looking for a dryer that was less noisy than the one I was using.  Of course, like all dryers, this one make noise but it is less than the one it replaces.  All the control buttons and switches are easy to find and use.  It has a lot of power needed for those quick hair dry jobs and is not overly bulky or heavy.  The back has a double screen, the outer one of which can be easily removed to release hair that may have been accidentally sucked into the dryer.  I have used it only a few times since my recent purchase so I can&#x27;t comment on long term reliability.  Based on what experience I have so far, I like it.&lt;br /&gt;Alberta</li>
            <li> Powerful and excellent performance!</li>
            <li> The dryer has a quiet, but powerful motor. It dries  hair quickly without getting too hot.</li>
            <li> It only lasted three  months had to buy other blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Arrived as promised.  Works as described, hair isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;over-dried&amp;#34;, noise isn&#x27;t too bad, like other dryers.  I like it very much.  Have used it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> cute and  dries your hair quickly, easy to handle with a lot of air power. will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer but the switches are poorly located on the handle.  It&#x27;s hard to use the dryer without accidentally pressing one or both of the buttons.  Kinda&#x27; annoying but the dryer blows like a hurricane.  UPDATE:  The fan died on this dryer after seven months.  Never had a dryer die that quickly.  Not happy.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer works very fast. I have a lot of hair, and it just takes me about 10 minutes to dry my hair entirely! It&#x27;s light and ergonomic. It&#x27;s also really pretty! I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great hairdryer! Very powerful..... It will defiantly cut down your drying time. Light and easy to use! Great price!</li>
            <li> Granddaughter love&#x27;s this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I had to replace my T3 and was looking for something less expensive.  I love the 2 speeds and 3 temps available and use a combo of them whenever I dry my hair.  It is lighter weight and has a nice long cord.</li>
            <li> Such a good blow dryer, it dries my hair so quick, I love it !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hairdryer for several months now and have had no issues.  As for the overheating, I have not had that, but I will say that I discovered pretty quickly that you don&#x27;t actually need the highest fan/heat setting to dry your hair.  It may be that it wasn&#x27;t designed for repeated use at that setting?  I had this same thing happen with a hairdryer made by a completely different manufacturer.  The medium fan, medium heat setting is just fine.</li>
            <li> This blowdryer dries my hair SO SO fast. I have a short bob and it took me 2 or 3 minutes after I had towel dried my hair. So in love. They aren&#x27;t joking about it being a high velocity dryer either. Takes care of business!</li>
            <li> very good product. not heavy. the cord is long. dry hair very fast.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer.  Really dries fast without frizzing.</li>
            <li> love this dryer use heavily in salon weightless And powerful</li>
            <li> I love my new hair dryer. It&#x27;s powerful and quiet. The color is a beautiful deep magenta. 5 stars for sure! I highly recommend this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Blow dryer is great, it&#x27;s not as loud as other blow dryers, I love the color of it (pink) and it&#x27;s light to hold while blow drying. It makes your hair come out as nice as it would at the salon.   Update:  Blow dryer stopped working after a few months. Not happy, would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased the Aneomne Wind Flower Hair Dryer by XTAVA but was sent the Peony by mistake. However when I opened the package I just fell in love with the bright pink dryer!  Pink is after all my favorite color!  The Peony is compact and will fit in a suitcase with ease for traveling. I love the multiple speeds and the different heat settings. I have fairly short hair and this dried my hair in a matter of minutes on medium speed. It would have taken less time if I didn&#x27;t have to use brushes to style with.  It does come with two concentrator nozzles one for long hair and one for short.  I love these because I use a round brush and this allows me to direct heat to the area I&#x27;m working on and the rest of my hair isn&#x27;t blowing around all over the place. It is a bit loud but that doesn&#x27;t bother me and I don&#x27;t find any any heavier than other dryers I&#x27;ve had that are made by XTAVA. All in all I love the dryer and expect to have years of use from it as long as my nieces don&#x27;t steal it just because of the girly color. I was offered the Aneomme Wind Flower Dryer at a substantial discount for testing and providing feedback. Please know that Amazon offered me a mailing label to return the dryer so I wouldn&#x27;t be out any money for returning. I&#x27;m happy that I kept it!</li>
            <li> I love it .its exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> The dryer works wonderfully but was missing the round attatchment.</li>
            <li> This is a very powerful hair dryer- unfortunately the attachments included only narrow the air flow so my long fine hair gets so tangled up by the focused stream of air.  If it came with something to diffuse the air or widen the opening it would be great.  I liked the power level and heat levels but the controls are confusing as they are exactly alike.</li>
            <li> Exceeded expectations... Fast and effective. Drys my hair better than my previous much more expensive dryer. Had been contemplating paying another expensive dryer until I read the reviews on this one. I always consider the evidence as I am rarely disappointed. Again, the high ratings on this product were justified. In addition, the color brightens up my morning.</li>
            <li> I use this dryer with a diffuser when I dry my hair curly and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t replaced my blow dryer in over 10years. This is awesome, drys in half the time and doesn&#x27;t suck up my hair.</li>
            <li> Love the dryer, attachments won&#x27;t stay on</li>
            <li> I wanted to love it and I did when it worked.  Pretty pink, durable long cord and light weight.  After only one month this one died on me.  I plugged it in, it got really hot and smelled horrible.  My husband said it was the circuit board that fried.  Too bad, maybe just a lemon.  Amazon is taking it back.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiance as she wanted a more powerful hair dryer. It worked pretty well for 2 months until it died yesterday by overheating, maybe due to how powerful it was and how much power it drew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heating was good but inconsistent not staying hot. If it would&#x27;ve lasted a year I might have thought it would have been worth the money as these days I don&#x27;t expect any electronic device under $50 to last longer than a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure I just got a defective one, but probably wouldn&#x27;t get another one.</li>
            <li> Nice Dryer  Took some getting used to.... the On/Off switch is located exactly where my thumb wraps around to hold the dryer... kept shutting it off!</li>
            <li> I loved this blow dryer until it stopped working on power level high after one week of purchase. I&#x27;d like to exchange it but not its no longer available through Amazon :(</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is super cute, the color is a rich hot fink with black trim. I received it to review and all opinions expressed are my honest opinion. I already had a decent hair dryer, but was interested in getting a second non-travel sized dryer. I think this may replace my existing hairdryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like:&lt;br /&gt;*It has the options I use: two speeds, three temperature ranges, cool air shot, etc.&lt;br /&gt;*The attractive appearance is a plus as I am planning to use it in my swimming/gym bag. Yes it is bigger than a travel dryer, but I have found that my travel sized dryer has been inadequate--it just doesn&#x27;t have enough power to quickly dry my long hair. This dryer has the power and is a little more compact and more attractive than my other name brand full sized hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;*I like the long cord. It is considerably longer than my other dryer. It is about 89&amp;#34; long. I like this since I move around a bit while drying and have accidentally unplugged my previous hair dryer. If you prefer a long cord, this may be a good option for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came with two concentrator nozzles, I personally would have preferred a diffuser and one concentrator nozzle. But that is a minor preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this hair dryer effective for drying and styling my hair. And it doesn&#x27;t hurt that it is very attractive and has a long cord.</li>
            <li> I actually loved this hairdryer! But to my dismay, 2 months after I bought it (just a couple of days ago) the blower stopped working. It will heat up but will not blow any air. I used it once every other day for approximately 5 minutes, because it dried my hair super fast, on medium heat, high air. My husband used it on his beard a couple of times a week or so. This should not have happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Xtava since the unit is under warranty but they are undergoing a brand relaunch and have no inventory. They offered me a refund and processed it yesterday. Great customer service! I&#x27;ll be interested to see their new products when they complete their relaunch.</li>
            <li> I have been using my xtava peony 1875W hair dryer for 2 weeks now, and I absolutely love it. It is so light weight and easy to maneuver for my small hands. It also dries my hair so fast that my time in the mornings before work have gotten much more efficient. I had always gotten my hair dryers at beauty supply shops before, so I was a little nervous about this purchase, but the reviews sold me, and I am so glad I got it, and what a great price too!</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife for Valentines day. Her old hair dryer of another make stopped working and this dryer sounded like a good solid dryer. She likes the dryer says it works well.</li>
            <li> It looks cute but: 1) it is loud - in fact it is louder than my old cheap revlon 2) it is on the heavier side, again heavier than my old blow dryer. Overall, it is ok, but not sure it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer, works great and I like how it has buttons to push rather than slide like other ones I&#x27;ve had. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great hairdryer! Love the hot pink color</li>
            <li> I loved it,then it died! This worked great, then after owning it for only three months, it just quit. Guess I am out of luck since it is not longer available.</li>
            <li> Product is great.  Am quite happy with it.  One comment, - I wish the director attachment screwed on instead of snapped over the nozzle.  It has a tendency to snap off and I think this would be corrected if it screwed on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many thanks</li>
            <li> Very powerful.Can&#x27;t beat this dryer for the money</li>
            <li> I like it except where the heat and speed setting buttons are....That&#x27;s where I hold the dryer and sometimes the buttons change to a different speed or heat setting without me meaning to do that.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is everything they claimed it to be. My daughter used mine the other day and went home and ordered one for herself. We both have naturally curly and frizz prone hair. We were happy with the no-frizz results and for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> i love the weight of it...like the two different concentrator nozzles</li>
            <li> Love this dryer! My hair no longer looks frizzy when using this product.</li>
