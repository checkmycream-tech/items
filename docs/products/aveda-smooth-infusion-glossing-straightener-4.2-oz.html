            <li>It works better than the serum given at salon bc</li>
            <li>And what is the lovely smell everybody is talking about?</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>Frizz Ease better.</li>
            <li>It helps fight humidity &amp; gives my hair more manageablilty.</li>
            <li>and I love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>I really cannot tell you how great this product is.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many products on the market to remedy this problem..</li>
            <li>Can not wait for it to arrive :)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>but expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t  spend a dime more for this Aveda Product.</li>
            <li>but my hair had a glossy look that made it look more like...GREASY.</li>
            <li>Has a lovely fragrance</li>
            <li>This does a great job of helping make it smooth and glossy, just be sure not to use too much.</li>
            <li>and then I blow dry and straighten and it looks great!</li>
            <li>Great for curly or straight hair to smooth follicles.</li>
            <li>Wish it was larger but for the price great for traveling or experimenting to see if I liked it, and I do....</li>
            <li>smells good, makes hair glossy but doesn&#x27;t really help to get my hair any straighter.</li>
            <li>I use it with other products but have used it by it self, and it is wonderful!</li>
            <li>She on the other hand will tell you how wonderful Aveda products are.  </li>
            <li>I do use rollers often, and Smooth Infusion does a great job at making my hair look alive again.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy hair that gets frizzy in humidity, so maybe this product just doesn&#x27;t work for my hair type.</li>
            <li>yes the texture manageability system and aveda smooth infusion glossing straightener is my holy grail....</li>
            <li>I have tried lots of things and nothing works as well as Aveda Smooth Infusion for making my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>It is a great product that protects the hair and makes it feel like you just left the salon .  </li>
            <li>Are we talking about Aveda Smooth Infusion Glossing Straightener?</li>
            <li>My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this smooth and silky in years.</li>
            <li>plus I got two free samples.  </li>
            <li>This smooth infusion gel works fantastic.</li>
            <li>This product has a nice, light texture and you don&#x27;t need much of it.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>It helps my hair to get straigh easy and keep it on the right place.</li>
            <li>combined with the texture manageability system, my hair is so shiny bouncy and full of life...</li>
            <li>No straightening effect whatsoever and the gloss is same as you would get from a good drugstore conidtioner.</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>Too much of this will leave your hair looking greasy, so less is best!</li>
            <li>The tiniest dab leaves hair smooth, shiny and clean...stays gleaming and silky, with a very natural healthy finish for days.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this product by my hairstylist and really liked how it left my hair smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>product will leave your hair smooth if the weather helps , dry  and nice.</li>
            <li>a bit pricey but so freaking worth it</li>
            <li>My hair was straighter however at the cost of not being able to wear it naturally curly anymore.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It may be worth a try for you if you buy from Aveda since you can return it if you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>This does not dry it out yet makes it straighter than most products.</li>
            <li>A bit pricey, but a little goes a LONG way and it works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>Very satified!</li>
            <li>First of all, do NOT buy this product here.  </li>
            <li>It dries straighter but more coarse.  </li>
            <li>I use it when styling my hair and it makes my hair smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>Seriously??!!&lt;br /&gt;Since it was pretty costly as it is</li>
            <li>likes it too, and I am hot</li>
            <li>I just hope they are as wonderful as the price tag because this stuff is really expensive</li>
            <li>Many products for all different hair types, with an added plus of a company who cares about people, animals and the environment.</li>
            <li>Love this product after using it on my naturally curly/frizzy hair it blowdries so straight without even using a flat iron and stays silky smooth for days</li>
            <li>Love to use this before I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li>It works awesome, you do have to blow dry your hair, which normally I don&#x27;t like doing, but my hair is extremely straight afterwards, and it only takes a minute or two to flat iron after that.</li>
            <li>my estimation, the Aveda Progressive Straightener, does seem to work to de frizz and relax curl, but this product is lighter weight and my preference for regular use on fine</li>
            <li>I do like this product and was thrilled to find it online, buy when it arrived the tube was less than half full with tape covering the cap!!??  </li>
            <li>leaves hair greasy if too much product is used.</li>
            <li>This really does make my hair glossy and shinier.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this Aveda product!</li>
            <li>If you want your hair really straight.</li>
            <li>Highly reccommend it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it in the beach, and it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair straight</li>
            <li>, it makes your hair very greasy and it gets frizzy like always in a humid day,  at the beach in Cape Cod.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I paid $23 with free shipping for the same size</li>
            <li>works better for me than naturally straight which dried my hair out.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I allotted enough time because I had to re-wash my hair.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair ever other day and sometimes every third day (may sound gross but it is better for your hair).</li>
            <li>makes hair straight and soft.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair, and of course, I want it straight.</li>
            <li>Most products leave your hair feeling heavy and slighly oily as they have a silicone in them.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth to try if you constantly have frizzy hair like mine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so rare to find a product that actually does do what it claims to!</li>
            <li>This is the product I use right before blowing it dry.</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t naturally straight, so I have the appearance of &#x27;big hair&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>Recently my hair has gone from pin straight to &amp;#34;textured&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I needed something to bring me back to my straight, silky, non-flyaway hair.</li>
            <li>This is my fave Aveda product by far.</li>
            <li>It really helps with dry ends</li>
            <li>I have very thick hair and this product made my hair a lot more manageable and easier to style.</li>
            <li>This product has made a huge difference in my naturally thick wavy/curly hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth trying if you straighten your hair everyday like I do.</li>
            <li>The smell is very good and don&#x27;t dry my hair or contains bad chemical.</li>
            <li>Does not dry out , flake or cause itching.  </li>
            <li>put some on just before you dry your hair and it will come out very glossy, just use a size of a quater in your hands and rub together and comb hair and blow dry,</li>
            <li>I had high expectations from this product after reading the reviews and especially after the money I spent on it.</li>
            <li>They actually warned me when I bought it that it could make my hair too straight, but after half a bottle I didn&#x27;t experience anything like that.</li>

            <li> I have very thick hair and this product made my hair a lot more manageable and easier to style.</li>
            <li> This product has made a huge difference in my naturally thick wavy/curly hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth trying if you straighten your hair everyday like I do.</li>
            <li> The smell is very good and don&#x27;t dry my hair or contains bad chemical.</li>
            <li> Does not dry out , flake or cause itching.  </li>
            <li> put some on just before you dry your hair and it will come out very glossy, just use a size of a quater in your hands and rub together and comb hair and blow dry,</li>
            <li> I had high expectations from this product after reading the reviews and especially after the money I spent on it.</li>
            <li> They actually warned me when I bought it that it could make my hair too straight, but after half a bottle I didn&#x27;t experience anything like that.</li>
            <li> My hair will still go a little wavy and frizzy on rainy or days with high humidity, but I haven&#x27;t used a product that this didn&#x27;t happen with.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have frizzy or unruly hair; however, Aveda&#x27;s Smooth Infusion has made a dramatic improvement by doing what its name suggests...smoothing my hair.  </li>
            <li> I discontinued use and my hair eventually returned to normal after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Not A Fan,  Do not like this as far as my experience this product does nothing but make hair weighted down and look greasy.  </li>
            <li> Before it would still take me 20-30 minutes to flat iron it!</li>
            <li> You will pay far less if you buy it on the Aveda web-site.  </li>
            <li> I have medium to long hair</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy if you use an appropriately small amount , which also makes it last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have tried nearly everything to try and tame my frizzy, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> and when I blow dry my hair I can tell the difference between when I use it and when I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It was like trying to blow dry my hair with olive oil on it.</li>
            <li> I tried and tried and tried and my hair just wouldn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to use a flat iron too often due to burning of the hair.</li>
            <li> I am a black female and no longer have to use relaxers going on 2 years now.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little bit too.</li>
            <li> Personally, I like to use it once my hair has air dryed a little after showering.</li>
            <li> only need to use a little at a time</li>
            <li> A little goes a long, long way</li>
            <li> Itdid make my hair glossy but it became frizzy hard, to manage and way way to soft.</li>
            <li> And I spent $25 on this?</li>
            <li> My hair is half way down my back</li>
            <li> will only weigh it down, just apply a dime amount in your entire head no matter how thick your hair is, i repeat a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> o and a little goooooooooooooes a long way, trust me.  </li>
            <li> A little of this product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is nothing other than a over-priced leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is just like any other leave in conditioner</li>
            <li> I applied just a little bit to damp hair and let it dry and then straightened my hair.</li>
            <li> As usual for the gougers at Aveda, pricey for a tiny little tube.</li>
            <li> We have very hard water in our city which can make my hair extra dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy, coarse, thick, and unruly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have slightly wavy, thick hair that straightens out when I use an extra amount of conditioner.</li>
            <li> this doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy or weighted down.</li>
            <li> I mean TINY.</li>
            <li> and you only need a very small amount.  </li>
            <li> I went through half a bottle of this before returning it</li>
            <li> I have crazy curly hair naturally, and I get regular Brazilian blowouts, but didn&#x27;t I haven&#x27;t had time to get one in a few months</li>
            <li> I have long, fairly thick hair that tends to frizz a lot with the humidity here in Florida.  </li>
            <li> It stiffens the hair, makes it impossible to dry, and I, personally, ended up washing my hair a second time to get it out of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday after washing my hair</li>
            <li> Makes my hair stiff and sticky.</li>
            <li> I was desperate enough that it took a Google search for me to stumble upon Aveda.</li>
            <li> I thought this price was crazy high</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s on the expensive side, but a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars , but I do feel the price is excessive.</li>
            <li> I might be doing something wrong but my hair wouldn&#x27;t dry with this product on it.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy/curly hair.  </li>
            <li> This stuff worked except it completely changed my hair texture :(  </li>
            <li> Not a good product, it didn&#x27;t work out on straightening and is sticky, even reduced the amount applied on hair.</li>
            <li> since I&#x27;ve fried mine enough times :(  </li>
            <li> But because the straightening effect is not perfect, I decided to get this product.</li>
            <li> Hated this product.</li>
            <li> It is nasty.  </li>
            <li> The minute I go outdoors, it looks horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> best product i&#x27;ve used for my curly frizzy hair since textureline discontinued their smoothing serum!</li>
            <li> Terrific!!! The tiniest dab leaves hair smooth, shiny and clean...stays gleaming and silky, with a very natural healthy finish for days.&lt;br /&gt;In my estimation, the Aveda Progressive Straightener, does seem to work to de frizz and relax curl, but this product is lighter weight and my preference for regular use on fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;This line really does a great job.</li>
            <li> leaves hair greasy if too much product is used. smells good, makes hair glossy but doesn&#x27;t really help to get my hair any straighter.</li>
            <li> Hated this product. Itdid make my hair glossy but it became frizzy hard, to manage and way way to soft. I returned it the next day.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for almost 2 years now. It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy if you use an appropriately small amount , which also makes it last a very long time.</li>
            <li> i lovvvvvvvvvvvve this stufff. a bit pricey but so freaking worth it...i know when i go to the salon they straighten my and it last for about 2-3 days, but now i am my own stylist. combined with the texture manageability system, my hair is so shiny bouncy and full of life...o and did i mention i have 4 c hair.... yes the texture manageability system and aveda smooth infusion glossing straightener is my holy grail.... thank you.. o and a little goooooooooooooes a long way, trust me.  over saturating your hair with it will only weigh it down, just apply a dime amount in your entire head no matter how thick your hair is, i repeat a little goes a long way and that is all you need.</li>
            <li> It is a great product for my hair. It helps my hair to get straigh easy and keep it on the right place. The smell is very good and don&#x27;t dry my hair or contains bad chemical. I recommend it to buy and to use it!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of things and nothing works as well as Aveda Smooth Infusion for making my hair smooth and shiny. It only takes a little bit too.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy, coarse, thick, and unruly hair.  This is the best straightening product I&#x27;ve ever used.  A bit pricey, but a little goes a LONG way and it works wonderfully.  It weightlessly smooths, straightens, and holds.  Plus, it smells amazing!  Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Life changing. I am a black female and no longer have to use relaxers going on 2 years now.</li>
            <li> And this really is the best smoothing/straitening cream out there. I have tried nearly everything to try and tame my frizzy, wavy hair. Most products leave your hair feeling heavy and slighly oily as they have a silicone in them. This product has a nice, light texture and you don&#x27;t need much of it. I have medium to long hair and I use about the size of a dime. My hair will still go a little wavy and frizzy on rainy or days with high humidity, but I haven&#x27;t used a product that this didn&#x27;t happen with.</li>
            <li> Works well on my hair.  Very satified!</li>
            <li> I order the product thinking i was going to get a larger size 6.2oz the discription clamed, It now shows the correct size</li>
            <li> Love to use this before I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> First of all, do NOT buy this product here.  You will pay far less if you buy it on the Aveda web-site.  Whoever is selling it here is &amp;#34;on the take.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, don&#x27;t buy it at all.  It is nasty.  It stiffens the hair, makes it impossible to dry, and I, personally, ended up washing my hair a second time to get it out of my hair.  Yuck.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked except it completely changed my hair texture :(  My hair was straighter however at the cost of not being able to wear it naturally curly anymore.  It dries straighter but more coarse.  I discontinued use and my hair eventually returned to normal after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair stiff and sticky.</li>
            <li> I have medium length blond hair that recently had the keratin straightening treatment. This is the product I use right before blowing it dry. It works better than the serum given at salon bc this doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy or weighted down. Great for curly or straight hair to smooth follicles.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  I use it when styling my hair and it makes my hair smooth and soft.  I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> works better for me than naturally straight which dried my hair out.  This does not dry it out yet makes it straighter than most products. Wish it was larger but for the price great for traveling or experimenting to see if I liked it, and I do....</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have been using it for 3 years now and it leaves my hair smooth and smelling great!  I use it everyday after washing my hair and then I blow dry and straighten and it looks great!</li>
            <li> This really does make my hair glossy and shinier. It really helps with dry ends and when I blow dry my hair I can tell the difference between when I use it and when I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have frizzy or unruly hair; however, Aveda&#x27;s Smooth Infusion has made a dramatic improvement by doing what its name suggests...smoothing my hair.  My hair isn&#x27;t naturally straight, so I have the appearance of &#x27;big hair&#x27;.  I find that it gives my hair the bounce it once had.  I do use rollers often, and Smooth Infusion does a great job at making my hair look alive again.  Highly recommend this Aveda product!</li>
            <li> It is a great product that protects the hair and makes it feel like you just left the salon .  This product should be  a staple in every ones hair supply kit</li>
            <li> I had high expectations from this product after reading the reviews and especially after the money I spent on it. I have slightly wavy, thick hair that straightens out when I use an extra amount of conditioner. But because the straightening effect is not perfect, I decided to get this product. No straightening effect whatsoever and the gloss is same as you would get from a good drugstore conidtioner. And I spent $25 on this? This is nothing other than a over-priced leave-in conditioner. And what is the lovely smell everybody is talking about? Are we talking about Aveda Smooth Infusion Glossing Straightener? Mine is without any smell! I wish I had bought the tube from a local store so I could return it.</li>
            <li> I bought the shampoo, conditioner, straightener, and smoother, and I am very pleased. Well worth the price. My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this smooth and silky in years. The scent is nice and the results are great. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and this product made my hair a lot more manageable and easier to style.</li>
            <li> as always, aveda has delivered one of the best hair products at an affordable price.  Definitely worth to try if you constantly have frizzy hair like mine</li>
            <li> put some on just before you dry your hair and it will come out very glossy, just use a size of a quater in your hands and rub together and comb hair and blow dry,</li>
            <li> This is the only straightener that works on my hair. I have naturally curly hair and it&#x27;s not always cooperative.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  We have very hard water in our city which can make my hair extra dry and frizzy. This does a great job of helping make it smooth and glossy, just be sure not to use too much. I would give it 5 stars , but I do feel the price is excessive.</li>
            <li> If you want your hair really straight.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! I have crazy curly hair naturally, and I get regular Brazilian blowouts, but didn&#x27;t I haven&#x27;t had time to get one in a few months, I saw this product and tried it. It works awesome, you do have to blow dry your hair, which normally I don&#x27;t like doing, but my hair is extremely straight afterwards, and it only takes a minute or two to flat iron after that. Before it would still take me 20-30 minutes to flat iron it!</li>
            <li> I might be doing something wrong but my hair wouldn&#x27;t dry with this product on it. I have coarse, wavy hair that frizzes up with the weather. The woman at Aveda said how great this product is. I tried it for an evening event that I had planned. Luckily I allotted enough time because I had to re-wash my hair. It was like trying to blow dry my hair with olive oil on it. I tried and tried and tried and my hair just wouldn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> Works great! I was first introduced to this product by my hairstylist and really liked how it left my hair smooth and silky. Highly reccommend it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK. But I like John Frieda&#x27;s Frizz Ease better.</li>
            <li> all i need for beautiful straight hair ,overpriced</li>
            <li> I do like this product and was thrilled to find it online, buy when it arrived the tube was less than half full with tape covering the cap!!??  Seriously??!!&lt;br /&gt;Since it was pretty costly as it is, I don&#x27;t know that I will spend the money to return it, but will never purchase from this product from seller again.</li>
            <li> Tbis stuff is Great! My clients love it and so do I!!!</li>
            <li> This product has made a huge difference in my naturally thick wavy/curly hair. It helps fight humidity &amp; gives my hair more manageablilty. It&#x27;s on the expensive side, but a little goes a long way so it lasts a long time. My hair is half way down my back &amp; I only need about a dime sized amount. Too much of this will leave your hair looking greasy, so less is best! Personally, I like to use it once my hair has air dryed a little after showering. It&#x27;s so rare to find a product that actually does do what it claims to! It&#x27;s definitely worth trying if you straighten your hair everyday like I do.</li>
            <li> great stuff will buy again, I look like a movie star and my dog likes it too, and I am hot</li>
            <li> A little goes a long, long way and I love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
            <li> So far this product has been absolutely amazing!!!  I use it with other products but have used it by it self, and it is wonderful!</li>
            <li> loved it.  makes hair straight and soft.  only need to use a little at a time</li>
            <li> Love this product after using it on my naturally curly/frizzy hair it blowdries so straight without even using a flat iron and stays silky smooth for days</li>
            <li> I really cannot tell you how great this product is.  I bought it for my wife for Christmas.  She on the other hand will tell you how wonderful Aveda products are.  I just hope they are as wonderful as the price tag because this stuff is really expensive</li>
            <li> Not a good product, it didn&#x27;t work out on straightening and is sticky, even reduced the amount applied on hair.</li>
            <li> Not A Fan,  Do not like this as far as my experience this product does nothing but make hair weighted down and look greasy.  I have color treated blonde highlighted hair.  Will not buy again, this arrived quickly and in good shape.</li>
            <li> Works.  As usual for the gougers at Aveda, pricey for a tiny little tube.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING! Recently my hair has gone from pin straight to &amp;#34;textured&amp;#34;. The minute I go outdoors, it looks horrible. I have tried so many products on the market to remedy this problem.. I was desperate enough that it took a Google search for me to stumble upon Aveda. I needed something to bring me back to my straight, silky, non-flyaway hair. This did the trick!  I love it so much, I purchased the conditioner as well.  Can not wait for it to arrive :)</li>
            <li> prevents the frizzies!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for well over a year.  I absolutely love it.  I have long, fairly thick hair that tends to frizz a lot with the humidity here in Florida.  Well, my stylist suggested this product and I won&#x27;t use anything else now.  I have tried a the CHI version, Loreal, and John Frieda.  From my experience this is the best one.  One of the complaints that I saw was someone said it left their her greasy the next day, well you have to use a tiny amount I mean TINY. A little of this product goes a long way. I wash my hair ever other day and sometimes every third day (may sound gross but it is better for your hair). I also use the style prep as well. I would recommend this to anyone that straightens their hair on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> THIS IS NO STRAIGHTENER!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This product will leave your hair smooth if the weather helps , dry  and nice. I&#x27;ve been using it in the beach, and it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair straight, it makes your hair very greasy and it gets frizzy like always in a humid day,  at the beach in Cape Cod.&lt;br /&gt;It is just like any other leave in conditioner but expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t  spend a dime more for this Aveda Product.</li>
            <li> I applied just a little bit to damp hair and let it dry and then straightened my hair. Worked well but my hair had a glossy look that made it look more like...GREASY. I also began to notice breakouts on my shoulders and face. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!  I have thick wavy/curly hair.  This product is great alone or in combination with heat appliances.  Protects hair from thermal straighteners.  I know since I&#x27;ve fried mine enough times :(  Has a lovely fragrance and you only need a very small amount.  Does not dry out , flake or cause itching.  This is my fave Aveda product by far.</li>
            <li> Perfect product for the fuzzies and frizzies.  Only use Aveda products, and would recommend to everyone.  Many products for all different hair types, with an added plus of a company who cares about people, animals and the environment.</li>
            <li> I went through half a bottle of this before returning it (Aveda has a great return policy). I kept thinking eventually I would see a difference because everyone just raves about this product, but I never noticed any change in my hair. They actually warned me when I bought it that it could make my hair too straight, but after half a bottle I didn&#x27;t experience anything like that. I have fine, wavy hair that gets frizzy in humidity, so maybe this product just doesn&#x27;t work for my hair type. It does have heat protectant in it though, so I liked that part. It may be worth a try for you if you buy from Aveda since you can return it if you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I thought this price was crazy high so I went over to Aveda&#x27;s website.  And guess what?  I paid $23 with free shipping for the same size plus I got two free samples.  This is a scam.  Don&#x27;t buy for this price!</li>
            <li> This smooth infusion gel works fantastic. I have naturally wavy hair, and of course, I want it straight. I don&#x27;t like to use a flat iron too often due to burning of the hair. This is a great alternative, makes my hair straight by blow drying, and it stays that way!</li>
