    <ol>
            <li>Perfect colors, great price, and as always with Clinique the product was wonderful!</li>
            <li>MUY BONITO EL ESTUCHE,MUY COMPLETO IDEAL PARA UN VIAJE O PARA LLEVARLO EN LA CARTERA CONTINUAMENTE,PUNTUALIDAD EN LA ENTREGA,</li>
            <li>Oh well, one of my daughters will be happy to get it, I guess.</li>
            <li>This Clinique product is great.  </li>
            <li>Great products..traveling campions</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t even tried the makeup because the colors are too bright.</li>
            <li>I loved every product in the bag  </li>
            <li>The two cosmetic bags have a cheery citrus/flower print.  </li>
            <li>The cosmetic bags are always bright and nicely made.</li>
            <li>Otherwise love the mascara and the blush, and the lip stick !</li>
            <li>Got this as a gift for my fiancee and she love it!  </li>
            <li>Happy (smart) shopping!</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;m stuck paying more money and more time to get something suitable for my trip.</li>
            <li>My favorite was, of course, the chubby stick.  </li>
            <li>The skincare products are awesome for travel (Dramatically Different Moisture is great as always, didn&#x27;t much care for the 7 Day Scrub) or to just \\&quot;try</li>
            <li>love mine</li>
            <li>I missed the Clinique w/ purchase at the store so the next best place to check was Amazon!  </li>
            <li>Most of my cosmetics are now Clinique products.  </li>
            <li>This gift set is an example of how I fell in love with this product line.  </li>
            <li>and we both are satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>This is a perfect set for on the go travel (minus the moisturizer and remover).  </li>
            <li>The product was as described and the seller shipped very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It came together with several pieces and two beautiful bags.  </li>
            <li>I personally like bold and bright eye colors, but this is a great palette for a more natural look.  </li>
            <li>I actually use mine as a case for my smartphone (great protection against scratches)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, while this set was free with purchase, the items included probably aren&#x27;t worth more than twenty or thirty bucks (the balm alone retails for around sixteen).  </li>
            <li>Clinique offers quality products and is good for my skin; my skin loves the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>She said she normally wouldn&#x27;t get a product this high end and loved it!</li>
            <li>I purchased this Clinique package for my 14 year old niece, she love&#x27;s the product and so do I.It helps her to take better care of her skin.</li>
            <li>The container is full size, but it is .04 oz instead of .1 oz.</li>
            <li>would love to order more from you later on</li>
            <li>The larger cosmetic bag holds LOTS more stuff than the items included, great for a wide array of uses.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The Chubby Stick is a full size (in store you had the option of either Strawberry or Melon, but both leave a nice sheer pink tint)!  </li>
            <li>thanks a lot.</li>
            <li>..keep it in one bag and you are ready to go</li>
            <li>Their moisturizers are light enough for my taste and not heavy with oils and perfumes.  </li>
            <li>I received this free promo gift with purchase last fall, after buying a Clinique item at a major dept store.  </li>
            <li>I first began using it because my teenaged daughter had moderate acne.  </li>
            <li>I had ordered this for a job interview, so I ended up having to use old makeup that I already had.  </li>
            <li>The mascara is a basic deep black, with a full sized applicator brush.  </li>
            <li>but it really wasn&#x27;t the advertised kit--it is pinks and purples which aren&#x27;t really flattering for anybody I know-Too late to return</li>
            <li>gift were a success, the bag brings a few basic cosmetic thigs you need</li>
            <li>Apparently I missed the part where it said there were multiple color options, and I would get whichever one was shipped.  </li>

            <li> However, the chubby stick it comes with is Not full size like another reviewer said.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, despite its name, it&#x27;s neither dark nor honey, but a pink which I can&#x27;t wear.  </li>
            <li> disappointed with the lipstick.  </li>

            <li> disappointed with the lipstick.  When looking through the various bonus bag options, I chose this one because of the lipstick labelled dark honey.  Unfortunately, despite its name, it&#x27;s neither dark nor honey, but a pink which I can&#x27;t wear.  Oh well, one of my daughters will be happy to get it, I guess.</li>
            <li> Perfect colors, great price, and as always with Clinique the product was wonderful!</li>
            <li> Apparently I missed the part where it said there were multiple color options, and I would get whichever one was shipped.  I thought I was going to get the darker colors, but instead got the pastels.  I had ordered this for a job interview, so I ended up having to use old makeup that I already had.  The only thing I&#x27;ve used out of this is the lotion and makeup remover.  I do like both of them, but I&#x27;ve used them before, so I was expecting that.  I haven&#x27;t even tried the makeup because the colors are too bright.</li>
            <li> I have never used Clinique products before, and I didn&#x27;t really realize what I was missing!  I loved every product in the bag  My favorite was, of course, the chubby stick.  However, the chubby stick it comes with is Not full size like another reviewer said.  The container is full size, but it is .04 oz instead of .1 oz.</li>
            <li> Love all of the items in this bag but the eyeshadow piece fell out so unable to use that. Otherwise love the mascara and the blush, and the lip stick !</li>
            <li> I received this free promo gift with purchase last fall, after buying a Clinique item at a major dept store.  The two cosmetic bags have a cheery citrus/flower print.  The skincare products are awesome for travel (Dramatically Different Moisture is great as always, didn&#x27;t much care for the 7 Day Scrub) or to just \\&quot;try out.\\&quot;  The lip and eye colors are all neutral and compliment lots of skin tones. The mascara is a basic deep black, with a full sized applicator brush.  The Chubby Stick is a full size (in store you had the option of either Strawberry or Melon, but both leave a nice sheer pink tint)!  The larger cosmetic bag holds LOTS more stuff than the items included, great for a wide array of uses. The smaller bag doubles as a key ring for holding gloss, cards, etc. I actually use mine as a case for my smartphone (great protection against scratches)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, while this set was free with purchase, the items included probably aren&#x27;t worth more than twenty or thirty bucks (the balm alone retails for around sixteen).  Happy (smart) shopping!</li>
            <li> I got 3 of this CLINIQUE bags, 2 for gift &amp; one for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gift were a success, the bag brings a few basic cosmetic thigs you need and they are all amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love mine because I travel a lot and the cosmetic bag is big enough for me to keep all my stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> MUY BONITO EL ESTUCHE,MUY COMPLETO IDEAL PARA UN VIAJE O PARA LLEVARLO EN LA CARTERA CONTINUAMENTE,PUNTUALIDAD EN LA ENTREGA, MUCHAS GRACIAS...  EMPRESA RESPONSABLE... MUCHAS GRACIAS</li>
            <li> Bought this for a trip and it says its the nude kit, with black honey (the reason i bought it) but it really wasn&#x27;t the advertised kit--it is pinks and purples which aren&#x27;t really flattering for anybody I know-Too late to return so i&#x27;m stuck paying more money and more time to get something suitable for my trip. thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> Lots of different product here and because I dont use makeup every day, even these small samples will last me awhile.</li>
            <li> I missed the Clinique w/ purchase at the store so the next best place to check was Amazon!  The product was as described and the seller shipped very quickly.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> This Clinique product is great.  I purchased it for someone else, and now I want one for myself.  I like the fact that it comes with a smaller makeup back for your purse or travel</li>
            <li> Great products..traveling campions, I need my traveling stuff....you can never have enough either..keep it in one bag and you are ready to go</li>
            <li> I use several different products from Clinique.  I first began using it because my teenaged daughter had moderate acne.  Clinique offered a 3-step program as a promo one year and I bought it for her as a gift.  She began using a twice daily regimen and continues to this day.  I began using some of their products when I purchased her supplies and they came with one of the semi-annual Gift sets with purchase.  I was hooked!  Their moisturizers are light enough for my taste and not heavy with oils and perfumes.  Their colors are long lasting and subtle, the way I like them.  Most of my cosmetics are now Clinique products.  This gift set is an example of how I fell in love with this product line.  It came together with several pieces and two beautiful bags.  I use the larger bag as a travel knitting project bag and the smaller one in my purse for those little essentials you don&#x27;t leave home without!</li>
            <li> Im a fan of makeup and this set did it for me would love to order more from you later on</li>
            <li> I purchased this Clinique package for my 14 year old niece, she love&#x27;s the product and so do I.It helps her to take better care of her skin.I stared her about three years ago on Clinique and we both are satisfied with it.The cosmetic bags are always bright and nicely made.I think there should be larger containers for the price of the product.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I would purchase it again for a gift.</li>
            <li> my wife love it, but she thinks it was expensive, my wife love it, but she thinks it was expensive,</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my birthday (my uncle loves me).  I personally like bold and bright eye colors, but this is a great palette for a more natural look.  I keep this set in my purse just in case I run out of time to do my makeup at home.  This is a perfect set for on the go travel (minus the moisturizer and remover).  Clinique offers quality products and is good for my skin; my skin loves the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my fiancee and she love it!  She said she normally wouldn&#x27;t get a product this high end and loved it!</li>
