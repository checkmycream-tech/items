            <li>lol.  </li>
            <li>This product works great.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I just with this had a more pleasant scent to go along with it, but it does work.</li>
            <li>I already have a nice tan going</li>
            <li>and it is not orangy looking its just a nice tan.  </li>
            <li>I am fair complected and do not tan easily.  </li>
            <li>Gives a nice color, smells good, and works quickly.  </li>
            <li>Works better than the salon brands I have used and more cost effective.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and evenly its not greasy just a nice lotion and keeps you moisturized.</li>
            <li>I love that this product.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t love the results at all.</li>
            <li>Just ok.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this</li>
            <li>The lotion smells great and leaves my skin so, so soft after tanning.</li>
            <li>This stuff works awesome, i use it on my whole body and it really does tan ya pretty quick!</li>
            <li>but the other reason I like it is because it&#x27;s a nice rich color, and smells great.</li>
            <li>I have pretty easily tanned skin</li>
            <li>So just keep a mental note that it does have a nice warming sensation to your legs mostly on the thigh in the beginning.  </li>
            <li>Nice golden color after only a couple uses.</li>
            <li>The smell is kind of funky too, but it definitely works.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money,  </li>
            <li>Price is right</li>
            <li>, I have blonde hair, blue eyes, and am fair (when buying any kind of foundation, I take the lightest color, maaaaybe second lightest, depending).</li>
            <li>It was the first time I used it</li>
            <li>and it really work!</li>
            <li>Anyway...I wouldn&#x27;t call this a tingle, but I do feel a warming sensation at first when I put it on my legs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Hot Skinny legs for almost 3 weeks now</li>
            <li>It warms you as you tan but doesn&#x27;t give you a hot tingle.</li>
            <li>I paid $38.00 in the tanning salon, wish I would have looked here first.</li>
            <li>It can get a little warm.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I the real thing.</li>
            <li>I found out afterwards that you have to have a salon to legally sale these products and the graphics label on the bottle was inconspicuously peeling off when it arrived in the box</li>
            <li>I really liked this leg lotion for a few reason...</li>
            <li>I have a real nice color on my legs and does not look like its a fake tan.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting much more but was let down.</li>
            <li>and what does grow is fine and unnoticed.</li>
            <li>Its a deep golden tan not that red tan.  </li>
            <li>Your price is very affordable, because the other stores were very high.  </li>
            <li>For the first time I am actually getting tan on my legs, sadly I&#x27;m only up to 7 minutes in a 20 minute bed after 3 weeks....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not positive but I really don&#x27;t think this</li>
            <li>And as of right now, I am currently using this lotion, all over, and nothing other, no second tanner for my arms or anything, just this.</li>

            <li> After the first week it seemed to me that the warming sensation is not as bad when I first started using it.  </li>
            <li> the cap was loose.</li>
            <li> lotion is good but the packaging was awful 1/4 of the lotion was out of the tube.</li>
            <li> The bronzer made my tan a strange color that I usually don&#x27;t acquire and it rubbed off on my white cotton spa robe...still not able to get it out!</li>
            <li> but I still would suggest a lighter lotion for on the face, at least for me it stung a little bit around my eyes especially.</li>
            <li> I like this product as I have used it previously</li>
            <li> Now it does have a little bit of a warming sensation once you get it applied but do not worry it calms down after about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> and I burned a little with it in the bed.</li>
            <li> one it helps to firm and hide cellulite</li>
            <li> This lotion is also supposed to slow down the hair regrowth on your legs, which is an added bonus!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I usually buy all my tanning lotions on amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion because i have a hard time tanning my legs.</li>
            <li> Since is contains a hair inhibitor I use it even when not tanning, which means I shave my legs at least once a week</li>
            <li> The price isn&#x27;t bad either, I would buy again.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Unless you want extra bronzing, don&#x27;t use this.  I did not read anywhere in the product description that it also bronzes in addition to being an indoor tanning aid.  The bronzer made my tan a strange color that I usually don&#x27;t acquire and it rubbed off on my white cotton spa robe...still not able to get it out!</li>
            <li> It was the first time I used it and it really work! Your price is very affordable, because the other stores were very high.  Thanks</li>
            <li> This stuff works awesome, i use it on my whole body and it really does tan ya pretty quick! Love it!</li>
            <li> I like this product as I have used it previously, I feel it&#x27;s time for a change and some tingle effect which this does not have. Price is right</li>
            <li> Been tanning for about a week now with this and am starting to see color. Mind you, I have blonde hair, blue eyes, and am fair (when buying any kind of foundation, I take the lightest color, maaaaybe second lightest, depending). I just with this had a more pleasant scent to go along with it, but it does work. And as of right now, I am currently using this lotion, all over, and nothing other, no second tanner for my arms or anything, just this.</li>
            <li> Works better than the salon brands I have used and more cost effective. Nice golden color after only a couple uses.</li>
            <li> My legs are now the same color as my arms.  Its a deep golden tan not that red tan.  LOVE IT!!!  On my second bottle.</li>
            <li> I love that this product.  Since is contains a hair inhibitor I use it even when not tanning, which means I shave my legs at least once a week and what does grow is fine and unnoticed.</li>
            <li> A girl at my tanning salon convinced me to buy this, so I did, only because I had a discount on my account to use. Otherwise, I usually buy all my tanning lotions on amazon. Anyway...I wouldn&#x27;t call this a tingle, but I do feel a warming sensation at first when I put it on my legs. The girl at the salon also recommended putting it on my arms in addition to my legs and I have noticed a big difference in my color! The lotion smells great and leaves my skin so, so soft after tanning. This lotion is also supposed to slow down the hair regrowth on your legs, which is an added bonus! I will definitely be purchasing this again on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I would not buy again. Didn&#x27;t love the results at all. I was expecting much more but was let down. Just ok.</li>
            <li> I really liked this leg lotion for a few reason... one it helps to firm and hide cellulite but the other reason I like it is because it&#x27;s a nice rich color, and smells great. The price isn&#x27;t bad either, I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Works well, but it stung a bit on my face and I burned a little with it in the bed. The smell is kind of funky too, but it definitely works. I have pretty easily tanned skin but I still would suggest a lighter lotion for on the face, at least for me it stung a little bit around my eyes especially.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not positive but I really don&#x27;t think this I the real thing. I found out afterwards that you have to have a salon to legally sale these products and the graphics label on the bottle was inconspicuously peeling off when it arrived in the box and I never saw any change in my tan and I&#x27;m a daily tanning bed user. Seems like tinted lotion to me.</li>
            <li> lotion is good but the packaging was awful 1/4 of the lotion was out of the tube. bummer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the cap was loose.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I am fair complected and do not tan easily.  I&#x27;ve been using Hot Skinny legs for almost 3 weeks now and I can tell a big difference.  For the first time I am actually getting tan on my legs, sadly I&#x27;m only up to 7 minutes in a 20 minute bed after 3 weeks....lol.  I already have a nice tan going and it is not orangy looking its just a nice tan.  Now it does have a little bit of a warming sensation once you get it applied but do not worry it calms down after about 10 minutes.  After the first week it seemed to me that the warming sensation is not as bad when I first started using it.  So just keep a mental note that it does have a nice warming sensation to your legs mostly on the thigh in the beginning.  It is well worth the money,  After 3 weeks of use and even tho I&#x27;m only up to 7 minutes in the tanning bed I have a real nice color on my legs and does not look like its a fake tan.  It goes on easy and evenly its not greasy just a nice lotion and keeps you moisturized.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice color, smells good, and works quickly.  It warms you as you tan but doesn&#x27;t give you a hot tingle.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion because i have a hard time tanning my legs. This product works great. It can get a little warm. I didn&#x27;t buy it on this website, but when I&#x27;m finished with the bottle I will get it here. I paid $38.00 in the tanning salon, wish I would have looked here first.</li>
