            <li>Great product and works as stated.</li>

            <li>is also great, they added a thank you</li>
            <li>Great sample pack.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard great things about Skin79 and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li>However, it provides a great coverage.</li>
            <li>I liked the best.</li>
            <li>Beblesh Balm Bb Cream VIP Gold (Gold Label) 40g (Autheticity Label &amp; Perforations with Free VIP Gold Sample!!!)]]</li>
            <li>I bet it would be perfect for evenings or special occasions, though!  </li>
            <li>Also the pearl seems to be a really good brow/cheekbone highlighter.</li>
            <li>Everyone I gave it to loved it.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a product that was fairly inexpensive but that would not irritate my 13 year-old daughters already pimple prone skin.</li>
            <li>This is a good sample of Skin79&#x27;s BB creams.</li>
            <li>I am so very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I am very fair with yellow undertones and this is almost a perfect match on my skin.</li>
            <li>, boy am I glad I did!</li>
            <li>My favorite is the Gold one!</li>
            <li>I liked the \\&quot;hot pink\\&quot; formula the best.</li>
            <li>It looked healthy, bright, and even toned.</li>
            <li>I also noticed this worked well for video work and gave everyone a nice \\&quot;glow\\&quot; while softening lines.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked 2 out of the four.</li>
            <li>I liked all of the samples except the SHINee one.</li>
            <li>Nice set to try out \\&quot;oriental\\&quot; versions of BB cream.</li>
            <li>Makes a nice gift, too.</li>
            <li>I had any problems, which I thought was a nice touch.</li>
            <li>I loved this sample kit, it&#x27;s a great way to see which one is the right type for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;The seller</li>
            <li>I have acne prone, sensitive, combination skin and this worked perfectly for me.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea that BB cream is supposed to be more of a lighter foundation type, with all in one moisture, UV protection, etc.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call this full coverage, but surprisingly, it covers my age spots</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe these are better for white/asian skintones that are very light</li>
            <li>would give it a 5 if it did not make me itch :)</li>
            <li>This is what to buy when you aren&#x27;t sure which BB cream to use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I can read Korean.</li>
            <li>I did a medium to deep peel which means I am shedding like a snake lol!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love, this product.</li>
            <li>My skin looks dewy, healthy, and glowing.</li>
            <li>Did I mention I love this stuff?</li>
            <li>and this was the perfect way to go since you get 4 different samples to try.</li>
            <li>This BB Cream is so phenomenal.</li>
            <li>Some offer more coverage than others, some don&#x27;t work as well with oily t-zones.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>She has really enjoyed experimenting with the 4 types in the mini set and has yet to choose her favorite</li>
            <li>I love all of these except the one with glitter in it.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re just a nice light coverage for evening out your skin tone.</li>
            <li>It just kind of \\&quot;sat\\&quot; on my pores &amp; made them look huge.</li>
            <li>I am glad I kept it at any rate.</li>
            <li>I love the products in this package--there is something for everyone.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>If you want a more matte look</li>
            <li>I had seen a lot of reviewers rave about the hot pink SKIN79 BB cream, which is great and probably works wonderful for a lot of people.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty fair when it comes to skin tone</li>
            <li>can wear light foundation -like cream with sunscreen all day :)</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m going to say that rather than pigment, it contains some sort of magical light diffuser.</li>
            <li>I loved this set so much i purchased extras to give to friends.</li>
            <li>Good way to sample bb creams without investing too much money.</li>
            <li>I found that the light pink BB cream works best for me.</li>
            <li>The sunscreen in these works pretty amazingly.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure which cream to buy full size</li>
            <li>This product arrives fast so trying it out first is great.</li>
            <li>Though having said that, for some reason I like the gold bottle the best, but I can&#x27;t exactly say why because they&#x27;re all so similar.</li>
            <li>Each little trial tube is perfect when it comes to finding which one you like.</li>
            <li>Instead of a light peel</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable buying it online if I couldn&#x27;t see the color.</li>
            <li>If you enjoy light weight and great smelling products look no further.</li>
            <li>For the record, I have fair, combination skin and am in my early 30&#x27;s, so I&#x27;m beginning to get wrinkles and age spots.</li>
            <li>I decided on the Oriental Gold, but honestly the other two non-glitter ones were just as good.</li>
            <li>**Editorial Note: After I have been using these products for months &amp; taking better care of my skin, I decided to try my Oriental tube again &amp; it seemed to blend a lot better into my skin, so maybe my skin is in better condition now or there aren&#x27;t as many \\&quot;imperfections\\&quot; &amp; rough spots that need to be covered?</li>
            <li>The Diamond Cream is actually great as a highlighter - I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend putting it all over your face, but maybe on top of the cheekbone, on the upper eye area, etc.</li>
            <li>Even though it was a small amount it was the perfect size to see which one</li>
            <li>So glad that I got the samples first.</li>
            <li>Since each jar is $12 or more for a full size I wanted to sample them first.</li>
            <li>I am glad I got the sample first before investing in a full size bottle, however.</li>
            <li>for a special look on a night out.</li>
            <li>Pink Gelee is a great seller--they included a cute thanks you card and a face mask sample.</li>
            <li>In researching for something light and fun for her to use I found the SKIN70 BB Cream set.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mine even came with another BB cream sample which was cool.</li>
            <li>I love it THAT much.</li>
            <li>There are 3 main creams and the 4th is a shimmer cream better kept for just eye use or a night out.</li>
            <li>B004R6CAGU Skin79 Super+</li>
            <li>Be sure to blend, otherwise it will give you a very light grey tone.  </li>
            <li>(And I was none to happy due to the $40.00 a bottle cost!)</li>
            <li>so much of the time, make-up didn&#x27;t seem too important.  </li>
            <li>We had a lot of fun experimenting with it.  </li>
            <li>It feels hydrated and it doesn&#x27;t hurt or feel like my face is cracking when I smile.</li>
            <li>The coverage from this BB cream has stayed on all day looking fresh.</li>
            <li>Nice amount of product in each tube, enough for 2 or three applications in each.</li>
            <li>She has learned that more is not always best and all she needs is a small dab that will go a long way.</li>
            <li>After trying all the tubes on different days I ended up LOVING &amp; purchasing both the Hot Pink &amp; the Gold full size Creams &amp; mixing them together on the back of my hand &amp; that has been the perfect makeup for me.</li>
            <li>I took the products out of the box and began to use them right away.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing a full size BB from this kit and am glad I took the risk to try the products.</li>
            <li>I really liked the hot pink and plan on buying the full size.</li>
            <li>It is grey but blends out nicely.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, the shipping from the seller was very fast.</li>
            <li>product gives a bit more coverage than a tinted moisturizer but not as much as a regular medium coverage liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>I ended up purchasing a full size of the hot pink BB cream and love it.</li>
            <li>I prefer a lighter look, especially because I don&#x27;t have many skin concerns.</li>
            <li>The packaging is really pretty.</li>
            <li>Old product!!!!</li>
            <li>Item is nice but contains very little product and for the price I could of purchased a full sice one........</li>
            <li>first I really didn&#x27;t understand how it&#x27;s just one shade..</li>
            <li>first tried the gold tube which went on very white...but was supposed to adjust to my skin tone...</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend the sample before purchasing a full size bottle!</li>
            <li>I have decided to order the VIP Gold in the large size now that I have tried the samples.</li>
            <li>I love the Gold and The Pink.</li>
            <li>Skin79 BB cream has almost a grayish tone to it and once blended in seems to magically transform with my skin tone except without the dreaded orange or pink look.</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t a fan of the  Diamond Pearl, it has sparkle to it and didn&#x27;t match my skin very well</li>
            <li>very pale&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shimmery formula is very glittery.</li>
            <li>However, step away from the mirror and suddenly they all disappear and your skin looks dewy and spot free.  </li>
            <li>As a bonus, the Pearl formula makes a fantastic skin highlighter, although it would be too sparkly for all-over facial use during the day.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really made up my mind yet on this product.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really a fan of the sparkly diamond one though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend for anyone wanting to try out real BB creams.</li>
            <li>Of the two I love the pink tube.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference between the 4 creams.  </li>
            <li>The hot pink ended up being my favorite, comes out light but sinks into the skin and really evens out the texture.</li>
            <li>It also makes a nice smooth surface for powder make up, and I didn&#x27;t feel like I needed my usual green-tint primer with this to hide the red</li>
            <li>and I liked them all, but went with the Hot Pink when I ordered a larger size.</li>
            <li>Each sample lasted for about 5-6 tries, more than enough to really get to know the formula and see if it was right for me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Covers redness well&lt;br /&gt;Did not settle in fine lines, wrinkles or dry areas</li>
            <li>Not sure i&#x27;d use it all over, but it looks nice in those spots.</li>
            <li>The less fuss the better.</li>
            <li>I used this on my last trip as a facial sunblock and it worked better than my SPF 50 body sunblock.</li>
            <li>Decent selection of formulas.</li>
            <li>In the hopes that I might someday have some semblance of a normal life this sounded like a good product to help me ease back into giving a little care about my appearance.</li>
            <li>I really like the Super Plus Hot Pink one, the gold one and the light pink one.</li>
            <li>I avoid using this product when i know a high def camera with flash will be used.</li>
            <li>These are all high SPF and have blemish lightening ingredients and all have a dewy finish.</li>
            <li>I am red haired with very fair skin and a few freckles and my skin has a reddish undertone which I do not particularly like.</li>
            <li>The super plus was nice, but a little too greasy, and didn&#x27;t even out my skin like the other two.</li>
            <li>So I went for it and put on the bb cream in light pink.</li>
            <li>Every makeup I have tried from Cover girl to Chanel seems to have an orange or pink undertone to it, or it is so light it looks chalky.</li>
            <li>My favorite was the green tube</li>
            <li>They seem to be pretty much the same product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommend this set, especially for older women who need some line softening and light diffusing or younger people who don&#x27;t have a lot of acne or scarring to cover.</li>
            <li>I had heard that BBs were the new rage</li>
            <li>it was here in a week, even with the New Year&#x27;s holiday.</li>
            <li>They have such a light weight feel to the point of almost sheer.</li>
            <li>My favorite was the VIP gold one, second was the pink, and the oriental and the diamond I could do without.</li>
            <li>I was so excited about these bb creams because I would get to try 4 different ones for a very low price.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>because I&#x27;m east indian and although my skin is light typically I go for the medium tones in foundations/</li>
            <li>When i use this on clients with darker skin I tend to use Face Atelier&#x27;s Zero Plus Ultra Foundation mixer to make it dark enough for more pigmented skin.</li>
            <li>will definitely buy the full size the next time.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the facial whiteness on a non-professional camera though so some of this is the high def mixed with the powerful flash causing the whiteness.</li>
            <li>I really loved not having my face feel so oily or bogged down with pounds of cosmetics on my face.</li>
            <li>Less red near my nose and a little more smooth under my eyes.</li>
            <li>My skin actually looks better after having used them for a little over a month now.</li>
            <li>I have tried many western &amp; japanese BB creams, but this is the only  that seems to blend with my Asian skin .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also purchased a separate set for my professional makeup kit to use on clients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it seemed to be a complete sunblock.</li>
            <li>- maybe it does not too well on ethnic or sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It is marked that it was made on July 2011.</li>
            <li>Wow is all I can say.</li>
            <li>Covered up the red very well.</li>
            <li>I had to use powder to bring enough color back into my pale skin to look normal, and I always choose the most \\&quot;ivory\\&quot; of any foundation product.</li>
            <li>So the 3 main creams differ only with thickness, which will affect how they blend with your skin.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;white\\&quot; effect wasn&#x27;t any different than how mineral makeup will show up on high def still photography.</li>
            <li>so I can not wear full make up for too long without breaking out , so I would only put it on in the evenings or at night but with this products I only get a little itchy after a full day with it .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I got it because I wanted to try the hot pink and gold.</li>
            <li>I bought this sampler based on reviews of the hot pink and gold.</li>
            <li>facial skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li>I work in a major retailer and have also noticed that \\&quot;American\\&quot; mainstream companies are now touting BB Creams.</li>
            <li>Once applied I could see a major change in my complexion.</li>
            <li>So I decided to do a chemical peel and put too much on and left on for too long.</li>
            <li>I must admit I have only tried 2 kinds so far.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes, I put translucent powder over it and that definitely makes my skin completely matte.  </li>
            <li>The side with the Skin79 hot pink looks noticeably smoother and younger.</li>
            <li>then tried the pink which looked better on my skin tone but still felt sticky and wasn&#x27;t worth it to me to feel uncomfortable all day&lt;</li>
            <li>I Initially thought the Oriental Cream would be the one for me, (based on reviews &amp; youtube videos I saw,) but when I tried it, the color was right but the consistency was just not right for me</li>
            <li>I have a very pale/red skin tone and have never found a makeup that looks natural on me, this is not a full coverage but does blend out blotchy skin well</li>
            <li>not cause any reaction on my very sensitive dry skin</li>
            <li>I was glad that I got the sample set first though because I was skeptical that I would like this product, all 4 are slightly different (other than the pearl that has a shimmer)</li>
            <li>Totally worth it to try if you&#x27;re not sure what you want to muy.</li>
            <li>The gold was a close second--it was very thick and heavy, and actually evens out skin better than hot pink, but looks ashy after a while.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I loved this sample kit, it&#x27;s a great way to see which one is the right type for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;The seller</li>
            <li> I have acne prone, sensitive, combination skin and this worked perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea that BB cream is supposed to be more of a lighter foundation type, with all in one moisture, UV protection, etc.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call this full coverage, but surprisingly, it covers my age spots</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe these are better for white/asian skintones that are very light</li>
            <li> would give it a 5 if it did not make me itch :)</li>
            <li> This is what to buy when you aren&#x27;t sure which BB cream to use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I can read Korean.</li>
            <li> I did a medium to deep peel which means I am shedding like a snake lol!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love, this product.</li>
            <li> My skin looks dewy, healthy, and glowing.</li>
            <li> Did I mention I love this stuff?</li>
            <li> and this was the perfect way to go since you get 4 different samples to try.</li>
            <li> This BB Cream is so phenomenal.</li>
            <li> Some offer more coverage than others, some don&#x27;t work as well with oily t-zones.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> She has really enjoyed experimenting with the 4 types in the mini set and has yet to choose her favorite</li>
            <li> I love all of these except the one with glitter in it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re just a nice light coverage for evening out your skin tone.</li>
            <li> It just kind of \\&quot;sat\\&quot; on my pores &amp; made them look huge.</li>
            <li> I am glad I kept it at any rate.</li>
            <li> I love the products in this package--there is something for everyone.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> If you want a more matte look</li>
            <li> I had seen a lot of reviewers rave about the hot pink SKIN79 BB cream, which is great and probably works wonderful for a lot of people.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty fair when it comes to skin tone</li>
            <li> can wear light foundation -like cream with sunscreen all day :)</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m going to say that rather than pigment, it contains some sort of magical light diffuser.</li>
            <li> I loved this set so much i purchased extras to give to friends.</li>
            <li> Good way to sample bb creams without investing too much money.</li>
            <li> I found that the light pink BB cream works best for me.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen in these works pretty amazingly.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure which cream to buy full size</li>
            <li> This product arrives fast so trying it out first is great.</li>
            <li> Though having said that, for some reason I like the gold bottle the best, but I can&#x27;t exactly say why because they&#x27;re all so similar.</li>
            <li> Each little trial tube is perfect when it comes to finding which one you like.</li>
            <li> Instead of a light peel</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable buying it online if I couldn&#x27;t see the color.</li>
            <li> If you enjoy light weight and great smelling products look no further.</li>
            <li> For the record, I have fair, combination skin and am in my early 30&#x27;s, so I&#x27;m beginning to get wrinkles and age spots.</li>
            <li> I decided on the Oriental Gold, but honestly the other two non-glitter ones were just as good.</li>
            <li> **Editorial Note: After I have been using these products for months &amp; taking better care of my skin, I decided to try my Oriental tube again &amp; it seemed to blend a lot better into my skin, so maybe my skin is in better condition now or there aren&#x27;t as many \\&quot;imperfections\\&quot; &amp; rough spots that need to be covered?</li>
            <li> The Diamond Cream is actually great as a highlighter - I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend putting it all over your face, but maybe on top of the cheekbone, on the upper eye area, etc.</li>
            <li> Even though it was a small amount it was the perfect size to see which one</li>
            <li> So glad that I got the samples first.</li>
            <li> Since each jar is $12 or more for a full size I wanted to sample them first.</li>
            <li> I am glad I got the sample first before investing in a full size bottle, however.</li>
            <li> for a special look on a night out.</li>
            <li> Pink Gelee is a great seller--they included a cute thanks you card and a face mask sample.</li>
            <li> In researching for something light and fun for her to use I found the SKIN70 BB Cream set.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mine even came with another BB cream sample which was cool.</li>
            <li> I love it THAT much.</li>
            <li> There are 3 main creams and the 4th is a shimmer cream better kept for just eye use or a night out.</li>
            <li> B004R6CAGU Skin79 Super+</li>
            <li> Be sure to blend, otherwise it will give you a very light grey tone.  </li>
            <li> (And I was none to happy due to the $40.00 a bottle cost!)</li>
            <li> so much of the time, make-up didn&#x27;t seem too important.  </li>
            <li> We had a lot of fun experimenting with it.  </li>
            <li> It feels hydrated and it doesn&#x27;t hurt or feel like my face is cracking when I smile.</li>
            <li> The coverage from this BB cream has stayed on all day looking fresh.</li>
            <li> Nice amount of product in each tube, enough for 2 or three applications in each.</li>
            <li> She has learned that more is not always best and all she needs is a small dab that will go a long way.</li>
            <li> After trying all the tubes on different days I ended up LOVING &amp; purchasing both the Hot Pink &amp; the Gold full size Creams &amp; mixing them together on the back of my hand &amp; that has been the perfect makeup for me.</li>
            <li> I took the products out of the box and began to use them right away.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing a full size BB from this kit and am glad I took the risk to try the products.</li>
            <li> I really liked the hot pink and plan on buying the full size.</li>
            <li> It is grey but blends out nicely.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, the shipping from the seller was very fast.</li>
            <li> product gives a bit more coverage than a tinted moisturizer but not as much as a regular medium coverage liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> I ended up purchasing a full size of the hot pink BB cream and love it.</li>
            <li> I prefer a lighter look, especially because I don&#x27;t have many skin concerns.</li>
            <li> The packaging is really pretty.</li>
            <li> Old product!!!!</li>
            <li> Item is nice but contains very little product and for the price I could of purchased a full sice one........</li>
            <li> first I really didn&#x27;t understand how it&#x27;s just one shade..</li>
            <li> first tried the gold tube which went on very white...but was supposed to adjust to my skin tone...</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend the sample before purchasing a full size bottle!</li>
            <li> I have decided to order the VIP Gold in the large size now that I have tried the samples.</li>
            <li> I love the Gold and The Pink.</li>
            <li> Skin79 BB cream has almost a grayish tone to it and once blended in seems to magically transform with my skin tone except without the dreaded orange or pink look.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t a fan of the  Diamond Pearl, it has sparkle to it and didn&#x27;t match my skin very well</li>
            <li> very pale&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shimmery formula is very glittery.</li>
            <li> However, step away from the mirror and suddenly they all disappear and your skin looks dewy and spot free.  </li>
            <li> As a bonus, the Pearl formula makes a fantastic skin highlighter, although it would be too sparkly for all-over facial use during the day.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really made up my mind yet on this product.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really a fan of the sparkly diamond one though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend for anyone wanting to try out real BB creams.</li>
            <li> Of the two I love the pink tube.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference between the 4 creams.  </li>
            <li> The hot pink ended up being my favorite, comes out light but sinks into the skin and really evens out the texture.</li>
            <li> It also makes a nice smooth surface for powder make up, and I didn&#x27;t feel like I needed my usual green-tint primer with this to hide the red</li>
            <li> and I liked them all, but went with the Hot Pink when I ordered a larger size.</li>
            <li> Each sample lasted for about 5-6 tries, more than enough to really get to know the formula and see if it was right for me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Covers redness well&lt;br /&gt;Did not settle in fine lines, wrinkles or dry areas</li>
            <li> Not sure i&#x27;d use it all over, but it looks nice in those spots.</li>
            <li> The less fuss the better.</li>
            <li> I used this on my last trip as a facial sunblock and it worked better than my SPF 50 body sunblock.</li>
            <li> Decent selection of formulas.</li>
            <li> In the hopes that I might someday have some semblance of a normal life this sounded like a good product to help me ease back into giving a little care about my appearance.</li>
            <li> I really like the Super Plus Hot Pink one, the gold one and the light pink one.</li>
            <li> I avoid using this product when i know a high def camera with flash will be used.</li>
            <li> These are all high SPF and have blemish lightening ingredients and all have a dewy finish.</li>
            <li> I am red haired with very fair skin and a few freckles and my skin has a reddish undertone which I do not particularly like.</li>
            <li> The super plus was nice, but a little too greasy, and didn&#x27;t even out my skin like the other two.</li>
            <li> So I went for it and put on the bb cream in light pink.</li>
            <li> Every makeup I have tried from Cover girl to Chanel seems to have an orange or pink undertone to it, or it is so light it looks chalky.</li>
            <li> My favorite was the green tube</li>
            <li> They seem to be pretty much the same product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommend this set, especially for older women who need some line softening and light diffusing or younger people who don&#x27;t have a lot of acne or scarring to cover.</li>
            <li> I had heard that BBs were the new rage</li>
            <li> it was here in a week, even with the New Year&#x27;s holiday.</li>
            <li> They have such a light weight feel to the point of almost sheer.</li>
            <li> My favorite was the VIP gold one, second was the pink, and the oriental and the diamond I could do without.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about these bb creams because I would get to try 4 different ones for a very low price.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> because I&#x27;m east indian and although my skin is light typically I go for the medium tones in foundations/</li>
            <li> When i use this on clients with darker skin I tend to use Face Atelier&#x27;s Zero Plus Ultra Foundation mixer to make it dark enough for more pigmented skin.</li>
            <li> will definitely buy the full size the next time.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the facial whiteness on a non-professional camera though so some of this is the high def mixed with the powerful flash causing the whiteness.</li>
            <li> I really loved not having my face feel so oily or bogged down with pounds of cosmetics on my face.</li>
            <li> Less red near my nose and a little more smooth under my eyes.</li>
            <li> My skin actually looks better after having used them for a little over a month now.</li>
            <li> I have tried many western &amp; japanese BB creams, but this is the only  that seems to blend with my Asian skin .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also purchased a separate set for my professional makeup kit to use on clients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it seemed to be a complete sunblock.</li>
            <li> - maybe it does not too well on ethnic or sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It is marked that it was made on July 2011.</li>
            <li> Wow is all I can say.</li>
            <li> Covered up the red very well.</li>
            <li> I had to use powder to bring enough color back into my pale skin to look normal, and I always choose the most \\&quot;ivory\\&quot; of any foundation product.</li>
            <li> So the 3 main creams differ only with thickness, which will affect how they blend with your skin.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;white\\&quot; effect wasn&#x27;t any different than how mineral makeup will show up on high def still photography.</li>
            <li> so I can not wear full make up for too long without breaking out , so I would only put it on in the evenings or at night but with this products I only get a little itchy after a full day with it .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I got it because I wanted to try the hot pink and gold.</li>
            <li> I bought this sampler based on reviews of the hot pink and gold.</li>
            <li> facial skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li> I work in a major retailer and have also noticed that \\&quot;American\\&quot; mainstream companies are now touting BB Creams.</li>
            <li> Once applied I could see a major change in my complexion.</li>
            <li> So I decided to do a chemical peel and put too much on and left on for too long.</li>
            <li> I must admit I have only tried 2 kinds so far.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes, I put translucent powder over it and that definitely makes my skin completely matte.  </li>
            <li> The side with the Skin79 hot pink looks noticeably smoother and younger.</li>
            <li> then tried the pink which looked better on my skin tone but still felt sticky and wasn&#x27;t worth it to me to feel uncomfortable all day&lt;</li>
            <li> I Initially thought the Oriental Cream would be the one for me, (based on reviews &amp; youtube videos I saw,) but when I tried it, the color was right but the consistency was just not right for me</li>
            <li> I have a very pale/red skin tone and have never found a makeup that looks natural on me, this is not a full coverage but does blend out blotchy skin well</li>
            <li> not cause any reaction on my very sensitive dry skin</li>
            <li> I was glad that I got the sample set first though because I was skeptical that I would like this product, all 4 are slightly different (other than the pearl that has a shimmer)</li>
            <li> Totally worth it to try if you&#x27;re not sure what you want to muy.</li>
            <li> The gold was a close second--it was very thick and heavy, and actually evens out skin better than hot pink, but looks ashy after a while.</li>
            <li> but i did notice some clogged areas around my chin and nose after using the green tube so i switched to the hot pink one and the problem was gone.</li>
            <li> The gold is too thick and heavy, the silver too shimmery, and the hot pink has too much coverage for me.</li>
            <li> I put the hot pink on the left side of my face, and my usual Garnier BB cream on the other.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been debating between the Pink, VIP Gold, or Oriental Gold, and now I know the latter is the one for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(I have dry skin</li>
            <li> The size of these samples were big enough to try each a few times, and let a friend try.</li>
            <li> I am a very pale caucasian, and all of these formulas were very very whitening, too pale for me.</li>
            <li> Besides that, it&#x27;s moisturizer, sunscreen, wrinkle/spot reduction and foundation in a single step!</li>
            <li> If you need a little extra coverage you&#x27;ll need a concealer with this.</li>
            <li> Who couldn&#x27;t use that extra few minutes in the morning?</li>
            <li> They are all a similar product but very slightly thicker or thinner than each other.</li>
            <li> I do like how it keeps my oily skin on the matte side (not completely matte), but way less oily than any other makeup I put on my skin.  </li>
            <li> be scared that they might look a little grey to start with, once it starts drying</li>
            <li> For the price you get enough product in each to try out a few times, but I found that each of the tubes comes with varying amounts of product, some less than others.</li>
            <li> so Pink didn&#x27;t work well for me, and VIP Gold made me break out a little.</li>
            <li> I was afraid there was no way they could live up to the glowing reviews, but I&#x27;m glad to say I was SO wrong!</li>
            <li> The consistency is sort of thick, each sample has a slightly different thickness, the VIP Gold being the thickest.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nurse running around for 12-13 hour shifts, this cream did not let me down.</li>
            <li> Then there is the pearlescent diamond BB Cream in the silver tube which has a hint of sparkle in it if you are going out or like the slightly shimmery look.</li>
            <li> I received the black one</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve worn less and less make-up.</li>
            <li> They are like little trail sizes.</li>
            <li> Ounce for ounce, it&#x27;s really no more expensive than any of the drugstore brands, but works better than any expensive department store skin product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> In my experience in testing them I find them to be heavy, oily and orange in tone unlike the ones by SKIN79.</li>
            <li> You know that means bad for your skin, right?</li>
            <li> Honestly other than the glitter one it&#x27;s hard to tell them apart.</li>
            <li> Not sure</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was traveling and needed a small size to put in my carry on luggage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it uses to create the effect</li>
            <li> However, it will be difficult telling yourself you&#x27;ll only need one.</li>
            <li> so I was hoping at least one would work and</li>
            <li> Ridiculous!</li>
            <li> All very subtle.</li>
            <li> and I found the formula to be thick and sticky and it felt very uncomfortable on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Buying this kit helped me to realize that my hesitation over color was a silly concern.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong on this set for the price &amp; value.</li>
            <li> If you are tired of makeup, you need to try this BB Cream, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this a 4 because you don&#x27;t get alot, and pearl was absolutely horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this set allowed me to figure out which BB cream worked best with me skin. Also the pearl seems to be a really good brow/cheekbone highlighter. Not sure i&#x27;d use it all over, but it looks nice in those spots.</li>
            <li> I have a very pale/red skin tone and have never found a makeup that looks natural on me, this is not a full coverage but does blend out blotchy skin well and I&#x27;m hooked. The size of these samples were big enough to try each a few times, and let a friend try. These BB Creams (all of them) feel great on my skin and, it is a great option if you want a tinted moisturizer and SPF protection without feeling greasy. It also makes a nice smooth surface for powder make up, and I didn&#x27;t feel like I needed my usual green-tint primer with this to hide the red blotches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be scared that they might look a little grey to start with, once it starts drying/absorbing it evens out and blends in. I was glad that I got the sample set first though because I was skeptical that I would like this product, all 4 are slightly different (other than the pearl that has a shimmer) and I liked them all, but went with the Hot Pink when I ordered a larger size.</li>
            <li> I have tried many western &amp; japanese BB creams, but this is the only  that seems to blend with my Asian skin .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My facial skin is very sensitive so I can not wear full make up for too long without breaking out , so I would only put it on in the evenings or at night but with this products I only get a little itchy after a full day with it .&lt;br /&gt;I can wear light foundation -like cream with sunscreen all day :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the 40g bottles of 3 Skin79 BB after trying this sample .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it a 5 if it did not make me itch :)</li>
            <li> This is what to buy when you aren&#x27;t sure which BB cream to use.  We had a lot of fun experimenting with it.  Great product and works as stated.</li>
            <li> I loved this set so much i purchased extras to give to friends. Everyone I gave it to loved it. I also purchased a separate set for my professional makeup kit to use on clients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gives a bit more coverage than a tinted moisturizer but not as much as a regular medium coverage liquid foundation. I have acne prone, sensitive, combination skin and this worked perfectly for me. My favorite was the green tube but i did notice some clogged areas around my chin and nose after using the green tube so i switched to the hot pink one and the problem was gone. I ended up purchasing a full size of the hot pink BB cream and love it. The sunscreen in these works pretty amazingly. It only shows an spf of 27 but it seemed to be a complete sunblock. I used this on my last trip as a facial sunblock and it worked better than my SPF 50 body sunblock. My face didn&#x27;t get any color at all but all the areas I put the SPF 50 sunblock on burnt. Not to mention this product didn&#x27;t wash off while swimming but the \\&quot;waterproof\\&quot; sunblock i had purchased for my body did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say the color of this product isn&#x27;t for everyone. I am very fair with yellow undertones and this is almost a perfect match on my skin. When i use this on clients with darker skin I tend to use Face Atelier&#x27;s Zero Plus Ultra Foundation mixer to make it dark enough for more pigmented skin. Because this product (BB Cream) is zinc oxide based it can cause your face to look very white in flash photography. I avoid using this product when i know a high def camera with flash will be used. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the facial whiteness on a non-professional camera though so some of this is the high def mixed with the powerful flash causing the whiteness. The \\&quot;white\\&quot; effect wasn&#x27;t any different than how mineral makeup will show up on high def still photography. I also noticed this worked well for video work and gave everyone a nice \\&quot;glow\\&quot; while softening lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this set, especially for older women who need some line softening and light diffusing or younger people who don&#x27;t have a lot of acne or scarring to cover.</li>
            <li> Good way to sample bb creams without investing too much money. I really liked the hot pink and plan on buying the full size.</li>
            <li> Not sure but I got rashes, breakout and hives - maybe it does not too well on ethnic or sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Old product!!!! It is marked that it was made on July 2011. I&#x27;m glad I can read Korean. You know that means bad for your skin, right?</li>
            <li> So I decided to do a chemical peel and put too much on and left on for too long. Oops. Instead of a light peel I did a medium to deep peel which means I am shedding like a snake lol! I was upset because I ordered this bb cream set and now I was going to have to wait to use it. Well I had to go out of town and though how am I going to keep my head up looking like I did? So I went for it and put on the bb cream in light pink. Wow is all I can say. Covered up the red very well. It gave my skin a glowing look. No one is going to say anything about my peeling skin. Love, love, love, this product. My skin looks dewy, healthy, and glowing. It feels hydrated and it doesn&#x27;t hurt or feel like my face is cracking when I smile. I am so very pleased with this product. Did I mention I love this stuff? One very happy customer.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about these bb creams because I would get to try 4 different ones for a very low price.&lt;br /&gt;At first I really didn&#x27;t understand how it&#x27;s just one shade..because I&#x27;m east indian and although my skin is light typically I go for the medium tones in foundations/powders.&lt;br /&gt;I first tried the gold tube which went on very white...but was supposed to adjust to my skin tone...it did not..I looked like a mime..and I found the formula to be thick and sticky and it felt very uncomfortable on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I then tried the pink which looked better on my skin tone but still felt sticky and wasn&#x27;t worth it to me to feel uncomfortable all day&lt;br /&gt;Maybe these are better for white/asian skintones that are very light but it definitely isn&#x27;t for me</li>
            <li> Bought this on line and received it in a couple of days. Then my wife must of thrown it away because she can&#x27;t find it, so we don&#x27;t know if it works or not.</li>
            <li> Since each jar is $12 or more for a full size I wanted to sample them first. They are all a similar product but very slightly thicker or thinner than each other. There are 3 main creams and the 4th is a shimmer cream better kept for just eye use or a night out. So the 3 main creams differ only with thickness, which will affect how they blend with your skin. Which one you like will depend on your skin texture and oils. This product arrives fast so trying it out first is great. The tubes are sample size but with plenty for about 3-4 uses each one. I have oily skin that eats up American makeup throughout the day where I have to reapply several times. The coverage from this BB cream has stayed on all day looking fresh. I&#x27;m a nurse running around for 12-13 hour shifts, this cream did not let me down.</li>
            <li> I liked 2 out of the four. I wasted my money. But I didn&#x27;t know the others were so runny. I guess I should have read some reviews before I bought this item. I love the Gold and The Pink. I will keep buying them. I bought this because I was traveling and needed a small size to put in my carry on luggage.</li>
            <li> I liked all of the samples except the SHINee one. I decided on the Oriental Gold, but honestly the other two non-glitter ones were just as good.</li>
            <li> I had to try BB cream and this was the perfect way to go since you get 4 different samples to try. I am red haired with very fair skin and a few freckles and my skin has a reddish undertone which I do not particularly like. This BB Cream is so phenomenal. The shade matches my skin so perfectly. Every makeup I have tried from Cover girl to Chanel seems to have an orange or pink undertone to it, or it is so light it looks chalky. Skin79 BB cream has almost a grayish tone to it and once blended in seems to magically transform with my skin tone except without the dreaded orange or pink look. Then I can put on blusher if I choose for a rosy glow on my cheeks. The consistency is sort of thick, each sample has a slightly different thickness, the VIP Gold being the thickest. Then there is the pearlescent diamond BB Cream in the silver tube which has a hint of sparkle in it if you are going out or like the slightly shimmery look. It is a great moisturiser too and of course has the sun screen in it which is a must have. I have decided to order the VIP Gold in the large size now that I have tried the samples. If you are tired of makeup, you need to try this BB Cream, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.

            <li> I had seen a lot of reviewers rave about the hot pink SKIN79 BB cream, which is great and probably works wonderful for a lot of people. I am glad I got the sample first before investing in a full size bottle, however. I found that the light pink BB cream works best for me. The gold is too thick and heavy, the silver too shimmery, and the hot pink has too much coverage for me. I prefer a lighter look, especially because I don&#x27;t have many skin concerns. Definitely recommend the sample before purchasing a full size bottle!</li>
            <li> I loved this sample kit, it&#x27;s a great way to see which one is the right type for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;The seller is also great, they added a thank you card!&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of red in my cheeks so I was hoping at least one would work and 3 of them did which was great.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the  Diamond Pearl, it has sparkle to it and didn&#x27;t match my skin very well but the rest of them work great.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy the full size the next time.</li>
            <li> Nice set to try out \\&quot;oriental\\&quot; versions of BB cream. Decent selection of formulas. Nice amount of product in each tube, enough for 2 or three applications in each. Inexpensive. I liked the \\&quot;hot pink\\&quot; formula the best. I disliked the shimmery one, very glittery, could maybe use as an eye shadow primer or on decolletage. I am a very pale caucasian, and all of these formulas were very very whitening, too pale for me. It did however cover redness and imperfections well. I had to use powder to bring enough color back into my pale skin to look normal, and I always choose the most \\&quot;ivory\\&quot; of any foundation product. Does not photograph well, looks ghostly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Nice selection of formulas&lt;br /&gt;Enough in each tube for 2-3 uses&lt;br /&gt;Creamy, goes on smoothly&lt;br /&gt;Did not cause any reaction on my very sensitive dry skin&lt;br /&gt;Covers redness well&lt;br /&gt;Did not settle in fine lines, wrinkles or dry areas&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Very Whitening.&lt;br /&gt;Very very pale&lt;br /&gt;Does not photograph well.&lt;br /&gt;Shimmery formula is very glittery.</li>
            <li> I had heard that BBs were the new rage but my brain was stuck on the need to match my skintone to the makeup, so I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable buying it online if I couldn&#x27;t see the color. Buying this kit helped me to realize that my hesitation over color was a silly concern. While it does look like foundation, it does not behave like foundation. I&#x27;m not sure what it uses to create the effect but I&#x27;m going to say that rather than pigment, it contains some sort of magical light diffuser. Up close, you cannot tell you are wearing any makeup. You can still see your sunspots and tone issues. However, step away from the mirror and suddenly they all disappear and your skin looks dewy and spot free.  This is as revolutionary to makeup as Spanx was to the fashion world.  You&#x27;re wearing makeup but no one can tell. Brilliant!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the color is not something you need to worry about, the package does allow you to experiment with the different types of BBs that are out there.  Some offer more coverage than others, some don&#x27;t work as well with oily t-zones.  I will definitely be purchasing a full size BB from this kit and am glad I took the risk to try the products. Additionally, the shipping from the seller was very fast. I ordered another sample kit from the Mischa (sp?) brand and it&#x27;s been 2 weeks and I still haven&#x27;t received it. It must be coming by boat from Korea and then will be walked to DC from the west coast, as it is not slated to arrive for another 2 weeks. Ridiculous!</li>
            <li> El producto llego a tiempo y en un lindo empaque...me parece una buena idea tener una peque&amp;ntilde;a presentacion de cada una para saber cual se adapta mejor a la piel y comprar la presentacion mas grande de la que a uno le haya gustado. :)</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that was fairly inexpensive but that would not irritate my 13 year-old daughters already pimple prone skin. She is a beginner in the use of cosmetics and foundations and tried to use my Lancome and looked quite caked with it. (And I was none to happy due to the $40.00 a bottle cost!) In researching for something light and fun for her to use I found the SKIN70 BB Cream set.&lt;br /&gt;It is a blessing! She has learned that more is not always best and all she needs is a small dab that will go a long way. She has really enjoyed experimenting with the 4 types in the mini set and has yet to choose her favorite so I will probably be ordering another mini set soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I work in a major retailer and have also noticed that \\&quot;American\\&quot; mainstream companies are now touting BB Creams. In my experience in testing them I find them to be heavy, oily and orange in tone unlike the ones by SKIN79.</li>
            <li> Each sample lasted for about 5-6 tries, more than enough to really get to know the formula and see if it was right for me.  As a bonus, the Pearl formula makes a fantastic skin highlighter, although it would be too sparkly for all-over facial use during the day.  I bet it would be perfect for evenings or special occasions, though!  Or for photo shoots.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really made up my mind yet on this product.</li>
            <li> This is a good sample of Skin79&#x27;s BB creams. Mine even came with another BB cream sample which was cool. I really like the Super Plus Hot Pink one, the gold one and the light pink one. They all seemed to match my skin tone well and made my skin look even. I wasn&#x27;t really a fan of the sparkly diamond one though. Overall,  A+!</li>
            <li> I love all of these except the one with glitter in it. Honestly other than the glitter one it&#x27;s hard to tell them apart. They seem to be pretty much the same product. Though having said that, for some reason I like the gold bottle the best, but I can&#x27;t exactly say why because they&#x27;re all so similar. They&#x27;re just a nice light coverage for evening out your skin tone. They don&#x27;t cover blemishes. If you need a little extra coverage you&#x27;ll need a concealer with this. My skin actually looks better after having used them for a little over a month now. Less red near my nose and a little more smooth under my eyes. All very subtle. I am planning on purchasing again soon!</li>
            <li> Item is nice but contains very little product and for the price I could of purchased a full sice one........</li>
            <li> Great sample pack. I&#x27;d been debating between the Pink, VIP Gold, or Oriental Gold, and now I know the latter is the one for me. I&#x27;ll be letting a couple friends try the others.&lt;br /&gt;(I have dry skin so Pink didn&#x27;t work well for me, and VIP Gold made me break out a little. But Oriental Gold worked wonders. Didn&#x27;t try the sparkly one since I knew I wouldn&#x27;t like it.)</li>
            <li> This was a GREAT way for me to see which Skin79 BB Cream would be best for me. They are like little trail sizes. I Initially thought the Oriental Cream would be the one for me, (based on reviews &amp; youtube videos I saw,) but when I tried it, the color was right but the consistency was just not right for me - it didn&#x27;t blend in well to my skin type...It just kind of \\&quot;sat\\&quot; on my pores &amp; made them look huge.* After trying all the tubes on different days I ended up LOVING &amp; purchasing both the Hot Pink &amp; the Gold full size Creams &amp; mixing them together on the back of my hand &amp; that has been the perfect makeup for me. The Diamond Cream is actually great as a highlighter - I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend putting it all over your face, but maybe on top of the cheekbone, on the upper eye area, etc. for a special look on a night out. That&#x27;s where it looked best on me. You really can&#x27;t go wrong on this set for the price &amp; value. Makes a nice gift, too. ***Editorial Note: After I have been using these products for months &amp; taking better care of my skin, I decided to try my Oriental tube again &amp; it seemed to blend a lot better into my skin, so maybe my skin is in better condition now or there aren&#x27;t as many \\&quot;imperfections\\&quot; &amp; rough spots that need to be covered? I am glad I kept it at any rate.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I wanted to try something that wasn&#x27;t an American based BB cream. I&#x27;ve heard great things about Skin79 and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I&#x27;m pretty fair when it comes to skin tone so this was perfect for me. The packaging is really pretty. I received the black one but it didn&#x27;t matter since I wasn&#x27;t going to be keeping the box. I took the products out of the box and began to use them right away. They have such a light weight feel to the point of almost sheer. However, it provides a great coverage. If you enjoy light weight and great smelling products look no further. I really loved not having my face feel so oily or bogged down with pounds of cosmetics on my face. Once applied I could see a major change in my complexion. It looked healthy, bright, and even toned. Each little trial tube is perfect when it comes to finding which one you like. However, it will be difficult telling yourself you&#x27;ll only need one.</li>
            <li> Pink Gelee is a great seller--they included a cute thanks you card and a face mask sample. I love the products in this package--there is something for everyone. I got it because I wanted to try the hot pink and gold. The pearl is useless--too sparkly. For the price you get enough product in each to try out a few times, but I found that each of the tubes comes with varying amounts of product, some less than others. The hot pink ended up being my favorite, comes out light but sinks into the skin and really evens out the texture. The gold was a close second--it was very thick and heavy, and actually evens out skin better than hot pink, but looks ashy after a while. The super plus was nice, but a little too greasy, and didn&#x27;t even out my skin like the other two. I&#x27;m giving this a 4 because you don&#x27;t get alot, and pearl was absolutely horrible. I&#x27;d recommend for anyone wanting to try out real BB creams.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure which cream to buy full size so I found the sample, boy am I glad I did! My favorite was the VIP gold one, second was the pink, and the oriental and the diamond I could do without. Even though it was a small amount it was the perfect size to see which one I liked the best.</li>
            <li> I must admit I have only tried 2 kinds so far.  Of the two I love the pink tube.  Over the years I&#x27;ve worn less and less make-up. between 6 spine surgeries, physical therapy and living in pajamas so much of the time, make-up didn&#x27;t seem too important.  I liked the idea that BB cream is supposed to be more of a lighter foundation type, with all in one moisture, UV protection, etc.  The less fuss the better. In the hopes that I might someday have some semblance of a normal life this sounded like a good product to help me ease back into giving a little care about my appearance.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference between the 4 creams.  I do like how it keeps my oily skin on the matte side (not completely matte), but way less oily than any other makeup I put on my skin.  Sometimes, I put translucent powder over it and that definitely makes my skin completely matte.  It is grey but blends out nicely.  Be sure to blend, otherwise it will give you a very light grey tone.  The price is so great on this stuff too!  Totally worth it to try if you&#x27;re not sure what you want to muy.</li>
            <li> So glad that I got the samples first. It gave me a chance to find out which one I really loved! My favorite is the Gold one!</li>
            <li> I bought this sampler based on reviews of the hot pink and gold. I was afraid there was no way they could live up to the glowing reviews, but I&#x27;m glad to say I was SO wrong! I put the hot pink on the left side of my face, and my usual Garnier BB cream on the other. The side with the Skin79 hot pink looks noticeably smoother and younger. If I could post a before and after, I would. Ounce for ounce, it&#x27;s really no more expensive than any of the drugstore brands, but works better than any expensive department store skin product I&#x27;ve tried. Besides that, it&#x27;s moisturizer, sunscreen, wrinkle/spot reduction and foundation in a single step! Who couldn&#x27;t use that extra few minutes in the morning? I even recommended this to all my friends on Facebook. I love it THAT much. For the record, I have fair, combination skin and am in my early 30&#x27;s, so I&#x27;m beginning to get wrinkles and age spots. I wouldn&#x27;t call this full coverage, but surprisingly, it covers my age spots nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added bonus - the seller (Po Man Lau) shipped this from Hong Kong and it was here in a week, even with the New Year&#x27;s holiday. There was also a handwritten note with their contact info in case I had any problems, which I thought was a nice touch.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to try a BB cream get this and see how each type wears on your skin. These are all high SPF and have blemish lightening ingredients and all have a dewy finish. If you want a more matte look some translucent&lt;br /&gt;powder will do the trick.</li>
