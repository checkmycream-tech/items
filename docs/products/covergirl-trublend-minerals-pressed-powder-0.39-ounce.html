            <li>Great item!</li>
            <li>Service was superb!</li>
            <li>excellent</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Works wonderfully to set foundation</li>
            <li>This powder is excellent.</li>
            <li>very good quality.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s definitely a very good product.</li>
            <li>Blends beautifully with my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>works great on my face</li>
            <li>- Great coverage&lt;</li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>I have fair skin</li>
            <li>I keep it in my car now for emergency applications throughout the work day as it is still good for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems to cover fairly well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s the best for covering blemishes, but that&#x27;s not what I was looking for anyway - if you just want an anti-shine powder, this is a very good pick!</li>
            <li>Like many people, I&#x27;d love to see CoverGirl &amp; Procter and Gamble go cruelty-free!</li>
            <li>this is good and cheap</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years</li>
            <li>so I only use what I know and in this case CoverGirls work perfectly!</li>
            <li>I have tried powder I like better.</li>
            <li>This stuff is so light weight when you put it on!  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I realize now that covergirl is more of a Nice-On-The-Wallet brand</li>
            <li>Very fresh, nice color.</li>
            <li>Glad to find this item available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>No irritation, easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I prefer a light liquid concealer and then going over it with powder when I want solid coverage, but even without it this stuff still covers great.</li>
            <li>I use the light shade for the day and medium for the evening.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just a bit light for my skin.</li>
            <li>This powder minimizes pores and leaves a smooth finish to my skin.</li>
            <li>but it goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t cake.</li>
            <li>I will surely gonna order it again :) plus delivery is soo fast</li>
            <li>This one make me look si amazing, beaut y and cute; my face and skin look really increíble, si clear</li>
            <li>My hair is white and my skin is olive, but fair.</li>
            <li>I err on the side of too much and make sure I&#x27;m leaning over the sink when applying it</li>
            <li>This translucent light 2 is the right match for me.</li>
            <li>, it is gentle and light</li>
            <li>sitting right on the powder.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super light, so you can&#x27;t really tell I have anything on, and it works really well at keeping a matte look on my face throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I like the TruBlend powder very much.</li>
            <li>I would go a shade darker than your first inclination.</li>
            <li>I suppose that&#x27;s more of a personal preference than anything, I just don&#x27;t like my poof</li>
            <li>my makeup is good as new, not too heavy.  </li>
            <li>Light and keeps my skin dry.  </li>
            <li>Updating Review, original review can be found at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After being a long time covergirl user, I decided to switch up the routine.</li>
            <li>I do wish, though, that the poof it comes with had it&#x27;s own compartment or at least a separator.</li>
            <li>Nice, subtle product.</li>
            <li>Naturally, the powder is going to rub off.</li>
            <li>I am 70 years old, so my routines are simple.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, glides on smoothly, is not prone to creasing and has never caused breakouts or other problems.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little bit messy because it&#x27;s easy to get either too little or too much powder on the puff.</li>
            <li>Makes my face smooth and its just enough to cover the small blemishes I have and my dark circles.  </li>

            <li> For reasons of style, I suppose, they&#x27;ve inserted a mirror that is not the full circumference of the compact; it is a small 1.75-inch wide mirror set in a 2.25-inch space.</li>
            <li> Since I started using it my makeup last really long!</li>
            <li> This powder isn&#x27;t a big deal, doesn&#x27;t cover much, doesn&#x27;t last long, and it does feel a little heavy to me, if just need a powder to seal here</li>
            <li> No point to buy a more expensive brand, save that $ for other needs.</li>
            <li> and I should have moved up a long time ago.</li>
            <li> This is the third time I&#x27;ve bought this product, so it&#x27;s obviously not much of a problem to me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use it as long as they make it!</li>
            <li> I use it alone on my middle-aged, slightly ruddy skin and find it to be just enough to even out redness and imperfections.</li>
            <li> You can only see small areas of your face in the mirror when you&#x27;re applying the makeup, so you can&#x27;t see whether you&#x27;ve applied it evenly.</li>
            <li> A little lighter shade than I expected</li>
            <li> and I am satisfied that it acts as a base and powder in one.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time but the color is a little darker than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> When the day gets longer and my morning makeup starts to shine, just a little dab does it.&lt;br /&gt;Vola</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding it in stock in the store.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice, subtle product.</li>
            <li> Great item! Since I started using it my makeup last really long! Service was superb! Received it two days later.</li>
            <li> I have been using the TruBlend pressed powder for years, after reading that it was a Paula&#x27;s Pick on Paula Begoun&#x27;s web site, Beautypedia. I use it alone on my middle-aged, slightly ruddy skin and find it to be just enough to even out redness and imperfections. It&#x27;s light, glides on smoothly, is not prone to creasing and has never caused breakouts or other problems. I&#x27;ll continue to use it as long as they make it! The only reason I don&#x27;t give 5 stars is that the manufacturer tests on animals. Like many people, I&#x27;d love to see CoverGirl &amp; Procter and Gamble go cruelty-free!</li>
            <li> very good quality. excellent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years and it&#x27;s definitely a very good product. I don&#x27;t trust any make up brand so I only use what I know and in this case CoverGirls work perfectly!</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of Cover Girl makeup over the years. I like the TruBlend powder very much. I use the light shade for the day and medium for the evening. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this compact is the mirror. For reasons of style, I suppose, they&#x27;ve inserted a mirror that is not the full circumference of the compact; it is a small 1.75-inch wide mirror set in a 2.25-inch space. You can only see small areas of your face in the mirror when you&#x27;re applying the makeup, so you can&#x27;t see whether you&#x27;ve applied it evenly. I dislike products whose design detracts from its function, so I won&#x27;t be buying this makeup again.</li>
            <li> Very fresh, nice color.</li>
            <li> I would go a shade darker than your first inclination. Still, this worked well for me, it&#x27;s just a bit light for my skin. No irritation, easy to apply. Doesn&#x27;t cover as well as I would hope though</li>
            <li> I love it!! I will surely gonna order it again :) plus delivery is soo fast, it is gentle and light u cant even tell u put powder on!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time but the color is a little darker than I thought it would be.I have tried powder I like better.</li>
            <li> I like this powder a lot.  When the day gets longer and my morning makeup starts to shine, just a little dab does it.&lt;br /&gt;Vola my makeup is good as new, not too heavy.  Cover girl is the way to go for all of my makeup.  No point to buy a more expensive brand, save that $ for other needs.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so light weight when you put it on!  I love it.  Makes my face smooth and its just enough to cover the small blemishes I have and my dark circles.  I have fair skin so I ordered a 2</li>
            <li> Updating Review, original review can be found at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After being a long time covergirl user, I decided to switch up the routine. I ended up going for a completely different product line and the improvement can&#x27;t be ignored. I realize now that covergirl is more of a Nice-On-The-Wallet brand and I should have moved up a long time ago. It is still a product I would recommend, especially to those with clearer skin than myself. It just doesn&#x27;t do well to cover up the redness I get in my t-zone and anymore it just sits on my face and looks powdery. I keep it in my car now for emergency applications throughout the work day as it is still good for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review: 4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gets the job done! Powder coverup is something I have used since I started using make up so I am used to the way it applies, looks and feels, especially compared to liquids. I prefer a light liquid concealer and then going over it with powder when I want solid coverage, but even without it this stuff still covers great. I do wish, though, that the poof it comes with had it&#x27;s own compartment or at least a separator. I suppose that&#x27;s more of a personal preference than anything, I just don&#x27;t like my poof sitting right on the powder.</li>
            <li> Blends beautifully with my skin tone.  Light and keeps my skin dry.  Glad to find this item available on Amazon.  I have a hard time finding it in stock in the store.  Now I can subscribe and save!</li>
            <li> This one make me look si amazing, beaut y and cute; my face and skin look really increíble, si clear</li>
            <li> works as well as the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> This powder isn&#x27;t a big deal, doesn&#x27;t cover much, doesn&#x27;t last long, and it does feel a little heavy to me, if just need a powder to seal here and there some shine like me, this will do. I don&#x27;t recommend it because of the price and the package, you could get the same quality that you are getting with this with another powder.</li>
            <li> works great on my face</li>
            <li> This is my go to makeup. I am 70 years old, so my routines are simple. This pressed powder helps to cover redness and I am satisfied that it acts as a base and powder in one. My hair is white and my skin is olive, but fair. This translucent light 2 is the right match for me.</li>
            <li> - Great coverage&lt;br /&gt;- Works wonderfully to set foundation&lt;br /&gt;- Lasts an 8 hour workday&lt;br /&gt;- Does not look caked on&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t beat it for the price</li>
            <li> This powder minimizes pores and leaves a smooth finish to my skin. It has always been one of my faves.</li>
            <li> I said it needed to be applied occasionally only because I have a habit of resting my head on my hand or fist. Naturally, the powder is going to rub off. It&#x27;s a little bit messy because it&#x27;s easy to get either too little or too much powder on the puff. I err on the side of too much and make sure I&#x27;m leaning over the sink when applying it so I can just rinse away what falls. This is the third time I&#x27;ve bought this product, so it&#x27;s obviously not much of a problem to me or I&#x27;d switch. It seems to cover fairly well.</li>
            <li> This powder is excellent. I was just looking for something to put on in the morning that would help me from getting too shiny throughout the day, and this stuff works like a dream. It&#x27;s super light, so you can&#x27;t really tell I have anything on, and it works really well at keeping a matte look on my face throughout the day. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s the best for covering blemishes, but that&#x27;s not what I was looking for anyway - if you just want an anti-shine powder, this is a very good pick!</li>
            <li> A little lighter shade than I expected but it goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t cake.</li>
            <li> this is good and cheap</li>
    </ol>
