            <li>and I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>I really love it because it does not make my hair feel oily/greasy.</li>
            <li>and I love this one as well.</li>
            <li>I have many Kerastase products.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>,my hair is so smooth with nice smell</li>
            <li>I love Kerastase products.  </li>
            <li>Amazon is a great place to purchase this product for a decent price.</li>
            <li>Very light texture without greasiness.&lt;br /&gt;Bottle is very nice with the reflective back sticker and handy with the lock.</li>
            <li>I have fine, colored hair.  </li>
            <li>I have fine curly hair and this product makes it manageable and glossy.  </li>
            <li>Nice when hair is especially flat looking, but, probably a good idea to wash your hair if it is that blah.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it, if you want a light oil for your hair.</li>
            <li>This product does make my hair feel smooth but almost too smooth if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>Silky smooth....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for your hair and doesn&#x27;t make it oily like many other serums.</li>
            <li>Many uses later, it still performs great and consistent.</li>
            <li>Ok-- maybe not, but it will certainly change your hair!</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Well worth the $$$!</li>
            <li>I purchased this product the first time through my hairdresser and it was approximately $15 more.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this product but more importantly the product feels silky and applies nicely on my post chemo curly hair after I blow dry it straight.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for taming those pesky blonde fly-aways (my issue) and keeping ends nicely moisturized and healthy!</li>
            <li>Great price on amazon compared to other places!</li>
            <li>I feel there are other similar products with a much more pleasant smell and better effect on the hair.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice sent and makes my long hair feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Use very sparingly on fine hair.</li>
            <li>This is awesome for chemically treated, thin, blond hair.</li>
            <li>Makes hair super soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Does give a great shine, sometimes it looks excessively shiny.</li>
            <li>Good product, does not weigh the hair down.  </li>
            <li>Very lightweight!</li>
            <li>It can be used in many different ways.</li>
            <li>or when I blow it straight!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it will do and</li>
            <li>Ever been in a room with someone wearing to much perfume - or after shave?  </li>
            <li>I have a real problem with the smell, I just don&#x27;t care for it.  </li>
            <li>Many people like the smell in the other reviews</li>
            <li>Hair is soft, not frizzy, and very shiny!</li>
            <li>As an African-American with very thick and soft hair, this oil is great.</li>
            <li>I can purchase the Biolage serum for half the price and it seems to do a better job.  </li>
            <li>I use 2 pumps to put on my damp hair ends before I blow dry and style my hair and 1 pump to help with dry fly aways after I dry my hair.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and unlike other oils it does not make my hair flat,  it actually gives it great fullness.</li>
            <li>It gives my hair a smooth, sleek look without loosing volume or weighing hair down.  </li>
            <li>My hair was looking very dried out and had lost that bouncy, shiny look that I love -</li>
            <li>It immediately made my corse and curly hair manageable and soft.</li>
            <li>I use this elixir when I leave my hair naturally curly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the regular Kerastase serum, which I really like, and instead of replacing it, thought I&#x27;d try this instead.  </li>
            <li>(after seven years I doubt it will revert back to straight)</li>
            <li>keeps my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Like other high-quality hair products, you need to get professional advise to pick the right product for you.</li>
            <li>Probably not good for oily hair type but perfect for dry and dull hair</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s hard to comb thru wet and keep smooth after blowing.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love this product. It smooths out my hair nicely without making it look or feel greasy. A little goes a long way. It can be used in many different ways. I like to mix it with my leave-in conditioner, as a finishing product, or to refreshen my hair the next day. It has a nice sent and makes my long hair feel silky smooth. Amazon is a great place to purchase this product for a decent price.</li>
            <li> Love this item for my hair. I have fine, colored hair.  This product keeps it healthy.</li>
            <li> Smell was way too musky for me. Had to return it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It immediately made my corse and curly hair manageable and soft. In my opinion, it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>

            <li> This special Elixer saved my hair!!</li>
            <li> Great product! My hair is thick and unruly especially on humid days! I unfortunately have to die my hair often to cover up the grays...leaving my hair dry.  I use this elixir when I leave my hair naturally curly or when I blow it straight! Works great every time!  Great price on amazon compared to other places!</li>
            <li> Use very sparingly on fine hair.</li>
            <li> The three star is for the fragrance - not for the serum.  I&#x27;ve been using the regular Kerastase serum, which I really like, and instead of replacing it, thought I&#x27;d try this instead.  So sorry I did - can&#x27;t get past the strong, perfume scent.  Wish I knew how to tone down the smell.  I figure if I can&#x27;t handle it, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like to sit next to me.  Ever been in a room with someone wearing to much perfume - or after shave?  Individual sense of smell I guess.</li>
            <li> Showroom box, not a flaw</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying the oil. It smells divine and lasts forever. Makes hair super soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product the first time through my hairdresser and it was approximately $15 more. I love the scent of this product but more importantly the product feels silky and applies nicely on my post chemo curly hair after I blow dry it straight.

            <li> This serum will change your life!!!! Ok-- maybe not, but it will certainly change your hair! You will love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have very thick very straight hair and I love this product. I also own the gold one for damaged hair but this is a little lighter. What is does is make your hair soft and also tame the flyaway hairs. I think it makes my hair look like I blow dried it, but I didn&#x27;t have to make effort.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  I have fine curly hair and this product makes it manageable and glossy.  I can&#x27;t say enough about the product..... it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> Not very concentrated nor does it exhibit shine. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> As an African-American with very thick and soft hair, this oil is great. I really love it because it does not make my hair feel oily/greasy. I also use Moracan oil and I love this one as well. I would recommend it, if you want a light oil for your hair. Makes/keeps my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for your hair and doesn&#x27;t make it oily like many other serums. I use it every day!</li>
            <li> .  I have many Kerastase products. The great thing about this one is it covers more than one \\&quot;hair need\\&quot;. Like other high-quality hair products, you need to get professional advise to pick the right product for you. This is awesome for chemically treated, thin, blond hair. I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Hair is soft, not frizzy, and very shiny! Love this product!! Just takes a small amount before drying hair. I&#x27;ll buy it again!</li>
            <li> Does give a great shine, sometimes it looks excessively shiny. Nice when hair is especially flat looking, but, probably a good idea to wash your hair if it is that blah. It&#x27;s nice though.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  I have long, thick hair with highlights and use the serum as a finishing product. It controls the frizzies and makes your hair look like you just got it done at a salon.  The light scent is wonderful too.</li>
            <li> good smell and very good effect on my frizzy hair</li>
            <li> I like this product but for the price I don&#x27;t believe the value is there.  I can purchase the Biolage serum for half the price and it seems to do a better job.  This product does make my hair feel smooth but almost too smooth if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> i like the smell and i put on my wet hair and blow dry,my hair is so smooth with nice smell</li>
            <li> This oil is awesome.  It makes my hair so soft and unlike other oils it does not make my hair flat,  it actually gives it great fullness.</li>
            <li> Never thought my hair can be like Jennifer Anistons&#x27;!!! Silky smooth....a little goes a long way. Two pumps are sufficient for my long hair and after using a flat iron. And ooohhh...not to mention the attentions from strangers! This is a must have.</li>
            <li> I love Kerastase products.  This product I found to be ok performance wise.  I have a real problem with the smell, I just don&#x27;t care for it.  Many people like the smell in the other reviews it is just a personal thing.  I feel there are other similar products with a much more pleasant smell and better effect on the hair.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist and we carry this product at my salon. ANYONE with dry/damaged hair can benefit from this product. You only need about one pump on damp hair. Start at the ends and work it up. The smell is amazing to</li>
            <li> Product with recognized quality of Kerastase. My wife loves these products and recommend to all friends. They are really very good. The price is also excellent.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for those of us who color our hair often.  My hair was looking very dried out and had lost that bouncy, shiny look that I love - this product brought it back to life! It is now an essential part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> Worked out well, my wife enjoys</li>
            <li> Good product, does not weigh the hair down.  It does exactly what it says it will do and more, very satisfied, good seller also !!</li>
