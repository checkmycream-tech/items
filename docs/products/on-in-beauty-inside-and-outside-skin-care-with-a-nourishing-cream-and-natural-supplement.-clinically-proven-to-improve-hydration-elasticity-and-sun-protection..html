            <li>I still felt and hoped I could get better results than I had been getting and 2.</li>
            <li>Better yet</li>
            <li>Most of the systems out there are require quite an investment in time and money.</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love the idea of using a beauty supplement to help achieve desired results.</li>
            <li>I love the cream.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure what I&#x27;d think</li>
            <li>I feel my skin looks more plump and youthful with this product, and I have become a faithful on-in user.  </li>
            <li>I love the moisturizer-</li>
            <li>This cream does an excellent job moisturizing, leaving my skin moist all day long, even beneath my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited!</li>
            <li>The cream is a nice, light weight moisturizer (too light for Michigan winter), and is unscented.</li>
            <li>this is a great alternative and will make skin so supple and soft if regimen kept up with!</li>
            <li>and I get the benefits of the Lutein that gives me better skin all over and other great benefits!</li>
            <li>This is one product that actually does what it says it&#x27;s going do, and the lutein pills are also very good for the elasticity in your eyes.</li>
            <li>I am 43 years old and have always been proud of the fact that people have mistaken me for mid-late 20s.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost 50 years old &amp; have always tried to take really good care of my skin by living a healthy lifestyle &amp; keeping on top of skincare trends.</li>
            <li>As some of the other reviewers have said, the cream portion of this product is really wonderful.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s an easy</li>
            <li>The pill portion is about the size of an aspirin &amp; is easy to swallow.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>Taking the supplement is easy to remember because your skin feels &amp; looks so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>How about taking the wrinkles, or fine lines off of your face?  </li>
            <li>Having fair skin and red hair, UV protection is very important to me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve said goodbye to dry winter skin that goes along with enjoying winter sports, and am enjoying soft great feeling skin with amazing sun</li>
            <li>And the fact that I can get this product for a fraction of the price that I have paid for what must now be called \\&quot;inferior\\&quot; products is a huge bonus.  </li>
            <li>Well fortunately the correlation between price and quality didn&#x27;t fit with this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of this product for review purposes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been really happy with the results and am hoping to see this product on store shelves sooner than later.</li>
            <li>Stress and sun damage are the primary causes of skin aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have loved how soft my skin has felt since I started using my On In skin products.  </li>
            <li>I noticed right away that my skin felt much more hydrated.</li>
            <li>The cream is smooth, non greasy and has a clean smell.</li>
            <li>Its super easy to take, and I like that</li>
            <li>The ON-IN Beauty System has a nutrient rich cream and a dietary supplement that work together.</li>
            <li>my full experience with On-In, feel free to read my post:</li>
            <li>The moisturizer light perfumes did not cause any irritation to my sensitive skin, effectively managed my dry spots without clogging pores, and no breakouts and great feeling skin.  </li>
            <li>I decided that if it could reduce any fine lines and wrinkles then it was definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>In the last year I have been noticing more and more fine lines on my face and tried just about everything to get rid of them</li>
            <li>I have not been using the cream a full two weeks</li>
            <li>, can&#x27;t wait for the full two weeks to see what then.</li>
            <li>On-in allowed me to be able to use one cream for my whole face.</li>
            <li>I have always had to use a moisturizer that is oil free and lightweight along with a foundation primer to keep my make-up staying fresh</li>
            <li>I hope that you give it a try and love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>On-In Beauty Skin Care System is a great way to hydrate and smooth your skin in less than a month.  </li>
            <li>I highly suggest this for anyone wanting to improve fine lines and wrinkles!</li>
            <li>love trying new things!</li>
            <li>It also has not made my acne flare up since I&#x27;ve started using it, which I almost always worry about when I use a super moisturizing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, with no greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>It is super moisturizing, certainly provided me with adequate UV protection, and it has been shown to improve skin elasticity!</li>
            <li>I also love that it is all natural and works so quickly.</li>
            <li>The cream is light and non-greasy, but really delivers moisture wherever it is applied.</li>
            <li>The smell is really pleasing and it goes on quickly and cleanly.</li>
            <li>&quot; I love that they are all natural.  </li>
            <li>far as elasticity, I have noticed my skin feels more supple.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 50 year old working mom who exercizes, eats well and lives a healthy lifestyle</li>
            <li>I started taking the supplements right away then added the cream a day or two after.</li>
            <li>I definitely think beautiful skin is achieved from both the inside and outside, so taking the supplements to help complement what the cream was doing makes sense to</li>
            <li>I used to have problems with dry skin around my nose, but not any more!</li>
            <li>I must admit, that given the reasonable price, my expectations were modest since I have learned that some of the better products I have tried had a steeper price tag.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a simple system, and I&#x27;m really hopeful that I will get amazing results from using this.</li>
            <li>The first two weeks i noticed that my eyes we&#x27;re brighter and my skin was also clearing up.</li>
            <li>I just couldn&#x27;t believe it, each day was better than the last.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of taking care of my skin from the inside &amp; the outside.</li>
            <li>first two times I used the ON-</li>
            <li>it felt so soft and smooth on my face that I began using it morning and night.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and smooth, and plump, like baby</li>
            <li>For the youth of our skin, isn&#x27;t it worth that much?</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like creams that take a long time to rub in or that are opaque over the top of the skin.</li>
            <li>, it absorbs easily, it&#x27;s not too light or heavy and it has a really nice light, clean scent -</li>
            <li>LUTEIN is the secret to the beautiful skin you are looking for.  </li>
            <li>The supplements are tiny &amp; easy to swallow; they don&#x27;t make you feel nauseous like some vitamins.</li>
            <li>How smart to think of marrying a beauty cream with a supplement that works simultaneously inside and out.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many skin care products but often abandon them because they aren&#x27;t worth the trouble.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to spend too much time looking after my skin.  </li>
            <li>Along with the pills, I could really see a difference in my skin tone</li>
            <li>Lutein achieves fast absorption into skin cells.\\</li>
            <li>I really like that the products also provide SPF protection without the \\&quot;suntan lotion\\&quot; smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I look forward to continuous use of this to really reap the benefits.</li>
            <li>Not seeing much difference in my face, but then again - I&#x27;m almost 65.  </li>
            <li>Guess at my age, there&#x27;s not much a &#x27;skin care product&#x27; can really change.  :-)</li>
            <li>and I live in a dry climate on top of that, and it just so happens to be winter, so my skin is almost always flaky this time of year, but it hasn&#x27;t flaked at all since I began using the On In Beauty System.</li>
            <li>The pills are easy to swallow and did not upset my stomach even if I took them on an empty stomach.</li>
            <li>After having run the gamut on most expensive to most promoted and everything in between</li>
            <li>I am African American and some products don’t work on my skin, but I love this product.  </li>
            <li>would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have wrinkles before, but I do notice that my skin glows a little more now.</li>
            <li>This product has by far given me the most complete and significant results in the least amount of time.  </li>
            <li>Since using the product nearly continuously for about two weeks I have noticed that my skin feels very silky and hydrated.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t have my normal monthly breakout on my chin.</li>
            <li>I was \\&quot;window shopping\\&quot; online for a new moisturizer when I saw this.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I have less fine lines.</li>
            <li>Couple that with the other internal benefits provided by the supplement at a price point for most creams</li>
            <li>After one month of using this system, my skin is as soft and supple as hers!</li>
            <li>Love the lotion, is like all in one, the pill has a weird taste, but is small, thats good and is just one a day</li>
            <li>I have been using nourishing products for decades and feel I have a large database of knowledge regarding different products and their effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>but I like what I&#x27;ve seen thus far.  </li>
            <li>I like waking up in the morning with my face still feeling soft and moisturized after using the cream before going to bed.  </li>
            <li>I like it so far</li>
            <li>I do however like to look and feel young.  </li>
            <li>my skin is sensitive and prone to breakouts..</li>
            <li>On-In cream becomes transparent almost instantly, which I really like.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Lutein a natural antioxidant sourced from marigolds.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 27 years old.</li>
            <li>have a baby daughter who is about to turn 1 year old on the 27th this month.</li>
            <li>really like that this program believes in the importance of starting from the inside.</li>
            <li>Just take note that while it offers some UV protection, you still need to use a sunscreen with it (this info comes from the manufacturer).</li>
            <li>Heavy perfumes would cause my sensitive areas to sting upon application and if effective in dealing with the dryness, they caused breakouts in other areas.  </li>
            <li>The cream fills rich and creamy but not too heavy.</li>
            <li>It has a clean smell and isn&#x27;t heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>I just used my first months worth after spending time out in the sun and my skin feels so much softer and less dried out even after time at the beach this summer.  </li>
            <li>like it said, in about two weeks I had rid myself of about half the lines on my face-mostly smile lines and crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li>I see any major changes in my skin I will update my review.</li>
            <li>However, after just 2 weeks of using the On-In Beauty System, I had slightly less deep wrinkles on my forehead and far less wrinkles and fine lines around my eyes!</li>
            <li>I like to use natural beauty products whenever possible.</li>
            <li>The On-In Beauty system is a simple, 2 part process that uses natural antioxidant Lutein from marigolds to hydrate and improve skin:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have 41 year old skin that is often oily, sometimes with breakouts but overall \\&quot;normal\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Beauty - Inside and Outside Skin Care with a Nourishing Cream and Natural Supplement.</li>
            <li>Grab a few months worth because Fall and winter is on its way.</li>
            <li>The price was low enough for me to take the chance on something new, although I was hoping that it didn&#x27;t turn out to be \\&quot;just another fad\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin now and one side of my face is flaky where the other is not, crazy, but what I&#x27;ve noticed is the flaky side has not been as flaky.  </li>
            <li>I only have a few small wrinkles around the eye area so sometimes its hard to notice much improvement in elasticity, but I do love the way the On In Beauty System has made my skin feel since I started using it!</li>
            <li>skin is very dry, so the hydration and elasticity from this system definitely makes it well worth the less than $30 it costs.</li>
            <li>I was shocked, but thrilled to see those laugh lines around my eyes get less noticeable</li>
            <li>I naturally have very dry skin</li>
    </ol>

            <li> And the fact that I can get this product for a fraction of the price that I have paid for what must now be called \\&quot;inferior\\&quot; products is a huge bonus.  </li>
            <li> Well fortunately the correlation between price and quality didn&#x27;t fit with this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of this product for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really happy with the results and am hoping to see this product on store shelves sooner than later.</li>
            <li> Stress and sun damage are the primary causes of skin aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have loved how soft my skin has felt since I started using my On In skin products.  </li>
            <li> I noticed right away that my skin felt much more hydrated.</li>
            <li> The cream is smooth, non greasy and has a clean smell.</li>
            <li> Its super easy to take, and I like that</li>
            <li> The ON-IN Beauty System has a nutrient rich cream and a dietary supplement that work together.</li>
            <li> my full experience with On-In, feel free to read my post:</li>
            <li> The moisturizer light perfumes did not cause any irritation to my sensitive skin, effectively managed my dry spots without clogging pores, and no breakouts and great feeling skin.  </li>
            <li> I decided that if it could reduce any fine lines and wrinkles then it was definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> In the last year I have been noticing more and more fine lines on my face and tried just about everything to get rid of them</li>
            <li> I have not been using the cream a full two weeks</li>
            <li> , can&#x27;t wait for the full two weeks to see what then.</li>
            <li> On-in allowed me to be able to use one cream for my whole face.</li>
            <li> I have always had to use a moisturizer that is oil free and lightweight along with a foundation primer to keep my make-up staying fresh</li>
            <li> I hope that you give it a try and love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> On-In Beauty Skin Care System is a great way to hydrate and smooth your skin in less than a month.  </li>
            <li> I highly suggest this for anyone wanting to improve fine lines and wrinkles!</li>
            <li> love trying new things!</li>
            <li> It also has not made my acne flare up since I&#x27;ve started using it, which I almost always worry about when I use a super moisturizing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, with no greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> It is super moisturizing, certainly provided me with adequate UV protection, and it has been shown to improve skin elasticity!</li>
            <li> I also love that it is all natural and works so quickly.</li>
            <li> The cream is light and non-greasy, but really delivers moisture wherever it is applied.</li>
            <li> The smell is really pleasing and it goes on quickly and cleanly.</li>
            <li> &quot; I love that they are all natural.  </li>
            <li> far as elasticity, I have noticed my skin feels more supple.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 50 year old working mom who exercizes, eats well and lives a healthy lifestyle</li>
            <li> I started taking the supplements right away then added the cream a day or two after.</li>
            <li> I definitely think beautiful skin is achieved from both the inside and outside, so taking the supplements to help complement what the cream was doing makes sense to</li>
            <li> I used to have problems with dry skin around my nose, but not any more!</li>
            <li> I must admit, that given the reasonable price, my expectations were modest since I have learned that some of the better products I have tried had a steeper price tag.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple system, and I&#x27;m really hopeful that I will get amazing results from using this.</li>
            <li> The first two weeks i noticed that my eyes we&#x27;re brighter and my skin was also clearing up.</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t believe it, each day was better than the last.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of taking care of my skin from the inside &amp; the outside.</li>
            <li> first two times I used the ON-</li>
            <li> it felt so soft and smooth on my face that I began using it morning and night.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and smooth, and plump, like baby</li>
            <li> For the youth of our skin, isn&#x27;t it worth that much?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like creams that take a long time to rub in or that are opaque over the top of the skin.</li>
            <li> , it absorbs easily, it&#x27;s not too light or heavy and it has a really nice light, clean scent -</li>
            <li> LUTEIN is the secret to the beautiful skin you are looking for.  </li>
            <li> The supplements are tiny &amp; easy to swallow; they don&#x27;t make you feel nauseous like some vitamins.</li>
            <li> How smart to think of marrying a beauty cream with a supplement that works simultaneously inside and out.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many skin care products but often abandon them because they aren&#x27;t worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to spend too much time looking after my skin.  </li>
            <li> Along with the pills, I could really see a difference in my skin tone</li>
            <li> Lutein achieves fast absorption into skin cells.\\</li>
            <li> I really like that the products also provide SPF protection without the \\&quot;suntan lotion\\&quot; smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I look forward to continuous use of this to really reap the benefits.</li>
            <li> Not seeing much difference in my face, but then again - I&#x27;m almost 65.  </li>
            <li> Guess at my age, there&#x27;s not much a &#x27;skin care product&#x27; can really change.  :-)</li>
            <li> and I live in a dry climate on top of that, and it just so happens to be winter, so my skin is almost always flaky this time of year, but it hasn&#x27;t flaked at all since I began using the On In Beauty System.</li>
            <li> The pills are easy to swallow and did not upset my stomach even if I took them on an empty stomach.</li>
            <li> After having run the gamut on most expensive to most promoted and everything in between</li>
            <li> I am African American and some products don’t work on my skin, but I love this product.  </li>
            <li> would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have wrinkles before, but I do notice that my skin glows a little more now.</li>
            <li> This product has by far given me the most complete and significant results in the least amount of time.  </li>
            <li> Since using the product nearly continuously for about two weeks I have noticed that my skin feels very silky and hydrated.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have my normal monthly breakout on my chin.</li>
            <li> I was \\&quot;window shopping\\&quot; online for a new moisturizer when I saw this.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and I have less fine lines.</li>
            <li> Couple that with the other internal benefits provided by the supplement at a price point for most creams</li>
            <li> After one month of using this system, my skin is as soft and supple as hers!</li>
            <li> Love the lotion, is like all in one, the pill has a weird taste, but is small, thats good and is just one a day</li>
            <li> I have been using nourishing products for decades and feel I have a large database of knowledge regarding different products and their effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> but I like what I&#x27;ve seen thus far.  </li>
            <li> I like waking up in the morning with my face still feeling soft and moisturized after using the cream before going to bed.  </li>
            <li> I like it so far</li>
            <li> I do however like to look and feel young.  </li>
            <li> my skin is sensitive and prone to breakouts..</li>
            <li> On-In cream becomes transparent almost instantly, which I really like.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Lutein a natural antioxidant sourced from marigolds.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 years old.</li>
            <li> have a baby daughter who is about to turn 1 year old on the 27th this month.</li>
            <li> really like that this program believes in the importance of starting from the inside.</li>
            <li> Just take note that while it offers some UV protection, you still need to use a sunscreen with it (this info comes from the manufacturer).</li>
            <li> Heavy perfumes would cause my sensitive areas to sting upon application and if effective in dealing with the dryness, they caused breakouts in other areas.  </li>
            <li> The cream fills rich and creamy but not too heavy.</li>
            <li> It has a clean smell and isn&#x27;t heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I just used my first months worth after spending time out in the sun and my skin feels so much softer and less dried out even after time at the beach this summer.  </li>
            <li> like it said, in about two weeks I had rid myself of about half the lines on my face-mostly smile lines and crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li> I see any major changes in my skin I will update my review.</li>
            <li> However, after just 2 weeks of using the On-In Beauty System, I had slightly less deep wrinkles on my forehead and far less wrinkles and fine lines around my eyes!</li>
            <li> I like to use natural beauty products whenever possible.</li>
            <li> The On-In Beauty system is a simple, 2 part process that uses natural antioxidant Lutein from marigolds to hydrate and improve skin:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have 41 year old skin that is often oily, sometimes with breakouts but overall \\&quot;normal\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Beauty - Inside and Outside Skin Care with a Nourishing Cream and Natural Supplement.</li>
            <li> Grab a few months worth because Fall and winter is on its way.</li>
            <li> The price was low enough for me to take the chance on something new, although I was hoping that it didn&#x27;t turn out to be \\&quot;just another fad\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin now and one side of my face is flaky where the other is not, crazy, but what I&#x27;ve noticed is the flaky side has not been as flaky.  </li>
            <li> I only have a few small wrinkles around the eye area so sometimes its hard to notice much improvement in elasticity, but I do love the way the On In Beauty System has made my skin feel since I started using it!</li>
            <li> skin is very dry, so the hydration and elasticity from this system definitely makes it well worth the less than $30 it costs.</li>
            <li> I was shocked, but thrilled to see those laugh lines around my eyes get less noticeable</li>
            <li> I naturally have very dry skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been on several walks with my dog the last few weeks as well, and I haven&#x27;t used any other Sunblock, but found the On In beauty system to provide me with the UV protection I needed, so I&#x27;m very exited about that!&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I do have horribly dry patches of skin every winter and within 5 days of starting this skincare system I noticed a difference in my patches of dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I could not tell any difference in the use of this product i felt like it was a waste of money maybe it is not for mature skin like mine</li>
            <li> - I wish I had done a before &amp; after shot, because a few of the smallest lines are almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> and I am back here at Amazon to order my second round of On-In because I get elasticity and moisture, the feel of a make-up primer that saves me an extra step (and money too)</li>
            <li> so I have used a lot of different anti-aging products and spent a lot of money too.</li>
            <li> but I still had really dry senitive skin.</li>
            <li> Some left my face greasy, some could not be worn under makeup without clumping, some made my face break out, and some just flat out were a waste of money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin has a few oily areas, so I decided to only apply the cream to the drier spots on my skin to avoid breakouts.  </li>
            <li> The Lutein protects my skin against everyday stress and sun damage which is definitely something I need.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me as other reviewers described.</li>
            <li> Creams that worked on one type of skin resulted in adverse reactions to other areas.  </li>

            <li> In WI it isn&#x27;t the sun you have to worry about so much as the bitter cold, windy, and dry winters.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical of this product really working in just 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks I do notice that my lines are less noticeable-</li>
            <li> \\&quot;In\\&quot; is a dietary supplement (small pink tablet)</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what it claims, it says that you can see a change in as little as 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have to say, I was a little hesitant on taking a tablet for beauty.</li>
            <li> Who wants dangerous chemicals on their skin?</li>
            <li> I also started taking the Caplets everyday.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about this product because it&#x27;s so affordable, but have been so pleasantly surprised by the results that I won&#x27;t stop using it.</li>
            <li> Within just a few weeks I started to see an increase in hydration and elasticity.</li>

            <li> I have been using this for the past month</li>
            <li> , after a few days I realized that it acts like a make-up primer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never liked putting fragrance on my face!!!</li>
            <li> I too was a skeptical about this product, but wanted to force myself to start taking vitamins anyway.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed and won&#x27;t purchase again since I didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
            <li> Give it a try you will not be disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I could not tell any difference in the use of this product i felt like it was a waste of money maybe it is not for mature skin like mine</li>
            <li> I have not been using the cream a full two weeks yet but I like what I&#x27;ve seen thus far.  I like waking up in the morning with my face still feeling soft and moisturized after using the cream before going to bed.  I have very dry skin now and one side of my face is flaky where the other is not, crazy, but what I&#x27;ve noticed is the flaky side has not been as flaky.  I have noticed it is a perfect prep for powder makeup. I&#x27;ve always taken Lutein, anyway, but taking the supplement now because I am out of Lutein.  I like it so far, can&#x27;t wait for the full two weeks to see what then.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. The first two weeks i noticed that my eyes we&#x27;re brighter and my skin was also clearing up. The cream i like it&#x27;s silky and non greasy good for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a low maintenance girl.  I don&#x27;t like to spend too much time looking after my skin.  I do however like to look and feel young.  I have tried many skin care products but often abandon them because they aren&#x27;t worth the trouble. Not the case with On-in Beauty. I have taken the pills and used the cream for the past couple of weeks.  My skin already looks younger- plumped up and hydrated without being greasy.  Another happy side effect is that  my eyesight has improved.  I thought I was imagining my better eyesight but then found out that Lutein is known to improve eye health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line,I have already ordered another months supply.  Who wouldn&#x27;t pay 30.00 a month for younger, healthier skin and healthier eyes.</li>
            <li> I love this system. The topical cream did wonders for my skin. It has a clean smell and isn&#x27;t heavy or greasy. Along with the pills, I could really see a difference in my skin tone and I didn&#x27;t have my normal monthly breakout on my chin. Definitely ordering again</li>
            <li> I see no difference using this product......waste of money!!! the cream has no smell and the pills taste like dandelions..</li>
            <li> my skin is sensitive and prone to breakouts.. especially when i use spy. this is a great alternative and will make skin so supple and soft if regimen kept up with! If you have holy t-zone try not to apply on nose, will cause oiliness.</li>
            <li> As some of the other reviewers have said, the cream portion of this product is really wonderful. The smell is really pleasing and it goes on quickly and cleanly. I don&#x27;t like creams that take a long time to rub in or that are opaque over the top of the skin. On-In cream becomes transparent almost instantly, which I really like. It feels nice going on. I also like that I am getting added sun protection! As for the pills, they are also easy to take (if I can remember to do it!) and it makes sense to work on your skin from the inside as well. Since using the product nearly continuously for about two weeks I have noticed that my skin feels very silky and hydrated. I used to have problems with dry skin around my nose, but not any more! (It&#x27;s also not greasy at all.) I didn&#x27;t have wrinkles before, but I do notice that my skin glows a little more now.</li>
            <li> I hope this product reaches a store shelf soon because it works wonders.  How smart to think of marrying a beauty cream with a supplement that works simultaneously inside and out.  I just used my first months worth after spending time out in the sun and my skin feels so much softer and less dried out even after time at the beach this summer.  Grab a few months worth because Fall and winter is on its way.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple of weeks and I can see my skin is better hydrated and I have less fine lines. Along with eating a good healthy diet, On-In Beauty is helping to ensure my skin looks its best.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical of this product really working in just 2 weeks. That&#x27;s what it claims, it says that you can see a change in as little as 2 weeks. I wasn&#x27;t too sure of that. However, after just 2 weeks of using the On-In Beauty System, I had slightly less deep wrinkles on my forehead and far less wrinkles and fine lines around my eyes! It works! In just 2 weeks I DO see a difference.</li>
            <li> On-In Beauty Skin Care System is a great way to hydrate and smooth your skin in less than a month.  It works through a dietary supplement and a cream that you apply twice a day. The \\&quot;On\\&quot; is the cream you put on the \\&quot;outside\\&quot; of your skin.  The \\&quot;In\\&quot; is the caplet that you put \\&quot;inside\\&quot; your body to hydrate your skin.  I started using the cream in the morning after my shower and at night before bed about two weeks ago.  The cream is smooth, non greasy and has a clean smell. It even provides UV protection.  Having fair skin and red hair, UV protection is very important to me.  I really love the way the cream makes my skin feel.  It is softer and in only two weeks, my skin tone looks more even.  I haven&#x27;t had my usual breakouts around my chin like I usually do.   I also started taking the Caplets everyday.  They have the power of Marigolds in them.  \\&quot;Lutein a natural antioxidant sourced from marigolds.  Lutein achieves fast absorption into skin cells.\\&quot; I love that they are all natural.  The best way to care for your skin should always be with natural ingredients  By taking these caplets along with the cream, my skin has literally been transformed from the inside out.

            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me as other reviewers described. I was disappointed and won&#x27;t purchase again since I didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
            <li> After having run the gamut on most expensive to most promoted and everything in between I finally fell upon a product that truly works for my combination sensitive/normal skin.  Creams that worked on one type of skin resulted in adverse reactions to other areas.  Heavy perfumes would cause my sensitive areas to sting upon application and if effective in dealing with the dryness, they caused breakouts in other areas.  I had almost abandoned the thought of using just one product to treat it. On-in allowed me to be able to use one cream for my whole face. The moisturizer light perfumes did not cause any irritation to my sensitive skin, effectively managed my dry spots without clogging pores, and no breakouts and great feeling skin.  By addressing both problems areas with one solution I not only save myself money but time in my daily routine. Couple that with the other internal benefits provided by the supplement at a price point for most creams and it&#x27;s an easy answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve said goodbye to dry winter skin that goes along with enjoying winter sports, and am enjoying soft great feeling skin with amazing sun protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using nourishing products for decades and feel I have a large database of knowledge regarding different products and their effectiveness.  I tried this one for two reasons: 1. I still felt and hoped I could get better results than I had been getting and 2. the premise of this product just intuitively made sense.  I must admit, that given the reasonable price, my expectations were modest since I have learned that some of the better products I have tried had a steeper price tag.  Well fortunately the correlation between price and quality didn&#x27;t fit with this product.  This product has by far given me the most complete and significant results in the least amount of time.  And the fact that I can get this product for a fraction of the price that I have paid for what must now be called \\&quot;inferior\\&quot; products is a huge bonus.  So stop looking elsewhere on the shelves or online to find the best nourishing product out there because \\&quot;on-in\\&quot; is it!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the past month and I really love it!  I feel younger looking and I love how great my skin looks!</li>
            <li> I am 43 years old and have always been proud of the fact that people have mistaken me for mid-late 20s. In WI it isn&#x27;t the sun you have to worry about so much as the bitter cold, windy, and dry winters. In the last year I have been noticing more and more fine lines on my face and tried just about everything to get rid of them -Avon, Oil of Olay, Nutragena, Loreal, etc. Some left my face greasy, some could not be worn under makeup without clumping, some made my face break out, and some just flat out were a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;  I purchased the On In Beauty System and, like it said, in about two weeks I had rid myself of about half the lines on my face-mostly smile lines and crow&#x27;s feet. I just couldn&#x27;t believe it, each day was better than the last. My husband thought I lost my mind when I came out of the bathroom giggling that I was getting younger again. If I needed to were makeup it didn&#x27;t clump. I have very sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t give me hives, blisters, or pimples, and it actually soaked in and didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;  I love this product!! This is one product that actually does what it says it&#x27;s going do, and the lutein pills are also very good for the elasticity in your eyes.</li>
            <li> Love the lotion, is like all in one, the pill has a weird taste, but is small, thats good and is just one a day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 50 years old &amp; have always tried to take really good care of my skin by living a healthy lifestyle &amp; keeping on top of skincare trends. I heard about this product from a friend &amp; have been using it for almost a month now and can ACTUALLY SEE RESULTS! I was shocked, but thrilled to see those laugh lines around my eyes get less noticeable - I wish I had done a before &amp; after shot, because a few of the smallest lines are almost completely gone. I had a stranger tell me what beautiful skin I had yesterday when I was getting a manicure (not bad for someone my age). About the product...the moisturizer feels great, it absorbs easily, it&#x27;s not too light or heavy and it has a really nice light, clean scent - I&#x27;ve never liked putting fragrance on my face!!! The supplements are tiny &amp; easy to swallow; they don&#x27;t make you feel nauseous like some vitamins. I love the idea of taking care of my skin from the inside &amp; the outside. I was a bit skeptical about this product because it&#x27;s so affordable, but have been so pleasantly surprised by the results that I won&#x27;t stop using it.</li>
            <li> I like to use natural beauty products whenever possible. Who wants dangerous chemicals on their skin? Not me! The On-In Beauty system is a simple, 2 part process that uses natural antioxidant Lutein from marigolds to hydrate and improve skin:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;On\\&quot; is a cream you use daily on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;In\\&quot; is a dietary supplement (small pink tablet) you take once daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream and supplement work together to hydrate your skin from the inside and out. I really like that the products also provide SPF protection without the \\&quot;suntan lotion\\&quot; smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the On-In Beauty system and saw instant hydration results. The cream is light and non-greasy, but really delivers moisture wherever it is applied. My skin has a few oily areas, so I decided to only apply the cream to the drier spots on my skin to avoid breakouts.  I definitely think beautiful skin is achieved from both the inside and outside, so taking the supplements to help complement what the cream was doing makes sense to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of this product for review purposes.</li>
            <li> After trying On-In Beauty System every day for a month, I recommend this product 100%. Here&#x27;s why.&lt;br /&gt;I love trying new things! I was \\&quot;window shopping\\&quot; online for a new moisturizer when I saw this. The Lutein supplements of course are good to take for vision and skin, so I decided to give it a try. The price was low enough for me to take the chance on something new, although I was hoping that it didn&#x27;t turn out to be \\&quot;just another fad\\&quot; product. I have 41 year old skin that is often oily, sometimes with breakouts but overall \\&quot;normal\\&quot;. I wear mineral make-up every day. I have always had to use a moisturizer that is oil free and lightweight along with a foundation primer to keep my make-up staying fresh looking.&lt;br /&gt;The first two times I used the ON-IN Nourishing Cream it felt so soft and smooth on my face that I began using it morning and night.  Better yet, after a few days I realized that it acts like a make-up primer! It has been about a month now and I am back here at Amazon to order my second round of On-In because I get elasticity and moisture, the feel of a make-up primer that saves me an extra step (and money too) and I get the benefits of the Lutein that gives me better skin all over and other great benefits! I hope that you give it a try and love it as much as I do.</li>

            <li> Love this product!!!  No greasy residue and the idea of a supplement to work along with the cream is genius.  I am African American and some products don’t work on my skin, but I love this product.  Hope it makes it to a store soon!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 years old. I&#x27;m big on prevention so I have used a lot of different anti-aging products and spent a lot of money too. Most of the systems out there are require quite an investment in time and money. I say that because a lot of them have multiple steps. You have to buy the cleanser, the eye cream, the wrinkle corrector, the day cream, night cream, and so on! That all adds up! How overwhelming!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On-In Beauty System is so simple. It&#x27;s one cream that you apply in the morning and at night. It&#x27;s a supplement that you take daily to boost the benefits from within. What more can you ask for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a baby daughter who is about to turn 1 year old on the 27th this month. After one month of using this system, my skin is as soft and supple as hers! I look forward to continuous use of this to really reap the benefits. I&#x27;ve already shared this to my mom and dad. They&#x27;re looking forward to using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my full experience with On-In, feel free to read my post: [...]</li>
            <li> Product arrived when I was told it would arrive.  Have been using off and on.  Not seeing much difference in my face, but then again - I&#x27;m almost 65.  Guess at my age, there&#x27;s not much a &#x27;skin care product&#x27; can really change.  :-)</li>
            <li> I started taking the supplements right away then added the cream a day or two after. I noticed right away that my skin felt much more hydrated. I naturally have very dry skin and I live in a dry climate on top of that, and it just so happens to be winter, so my skin is almost always flaky this time of year, but it hasn&#x27;t flaked at all since I began using the On In Beauty System. My skin has been incredibly moisturized! I have loved how soft my skin has felt since I started using my On In skin products.  The cream fills rich and creamy but not too heavy. It also has not made my acne flare up since I&#x27;ve started using it, which I almost always worry about when I use a super moisturizing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been on several walks with my dog the last few weeks as well, and I haven&#x27;t used any other Sunblock, but found the On In beauty system to provide me with the UV protection I needed, so I&#x27;m very exited about that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as elasticity, I have noticed my skin feels more supple. I only have a few small wrinkles around the eye area so sometimes its hard to notice much improvement in elasticity, but I do love the way the On In Beauty System has made my skin feel since I started using it! My skin feels so soft and smooth, and plump, like baby skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like that this program believes in the importance of starting from the inside. I couldn&#x27;t agree more! I love the idea of using a beauty supplement to help achieve desired results. Its super easy to take, and I like that I don&#x27;t have to layer on the creams, which tend to flare up my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is a great product to use to help improve skin. It is super moisturizing, certainly provided me with adequate UV protection, and it has been shown to improve skin elasticity!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the On-In system for about a month now- I love the cream. I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles (yet) but I do have horribly dry patches of skin every winter and within 5 days of starting this skincare system I noticed a difference in my patches of dry skin.  I&#x27;ve never done caplets or any dietary supplement for skincare before so I wasn&#x27;t sure what I&#x27;d think but it does make sense to hydrate the skin from the inside and from the outside!  I&#x27;ve been really happy with the results and am hoping to see this product on store shelves sooner than later. (I received a sample for my review but opinions are my own)</li>
            <li> I have to say, I was a little hesitant on taking a tablet for beauty. I decided that if it could reduce any fine lines and wrinkles then it was definitely worth a try. Within just a few weeks I started to see an increase in hydration and elasticity. The Lutein protects my skin against everyday stress and sun damage which is definitely something I need. Stress and sun damage are the primary causes of skin aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very dry, so the hydration and elasticity from this system definitely makes it well worth the less than $30 it costs. For the youth of our skin, isn&#x27;t it worth that much? I also love that it is all natural and works so quickly. Some products that over a month to see results. I highly suggest this for anyone wanting to improve fine lines and wrinkles!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this on a whim based on all the great reviews. While I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in my skin, I haven&#x27;t had any additional problems occur from using this either. It&#x27;s a simple system, and I&#x27;m really hopeful that I will get amazing results from using this. The cream is a nice, light weight moisturizer (too light for Michigan winter), and is unscented. The pill portion is about the size of an aspirin &amp; is easy to swallow.&lt;br /&gt;If I see any major changes in my skin I will update my review.</li>
            <li> This cream does an excellent job moisturizing, leaving my skin moist all day long, even beneath my eyes.  It has no fragrance, and spreads wonderfully.  It absorbs quickly, with no greasy feeling.  I feel my skin looks more plump and youthful with this product, and I have become a faithful on-in user.  Just take note that while it offers some UV protection, you still need to use a sunscreen with it (this info comes from the manufacturer).</li>
            <li> I too was a skeptical about this product, but wanted to force myself to start taking vitamins anyway. After 2 weeks I do notice that my lines are less noticeable- I wish I had taken a \\&quot;before\\&quot; shot. I love the moisturizer- very light and not greasy feeling at all. The pills are easy to swallow and did not upset my stomach even if I took them on an empty stomach. As i continue to use the system I continue to see improvements in my skin. Can&#x27;t wait to see how I look after month two! Give it a try you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B008BTE7KQ On-in Beauty - Inside and Outside Skin Care with a Nourishing Cream and Natural Supplement.

This is one cream that you can keep to erase wrinkles, keep  skin moist and create a younger look. Taking the supplement is easy to remember because your skin feels &amp; looks so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 50 year old working mom who exercizes, eats well and lives a healthy lifestyle but I still had really dry senitive skin. I&#x27;ve tried much more expensive creams that stung as I applied them and incresed my skin&#x27;s irritation. ON IN cream soothes my skin as I apply it. The mild fragrance is pleasant &amp; adds to the experiece of using the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ON IN system is simple. One cream does it all. Makes skin care at home, at the gym or on the go portalbe &amp; affordable. Thank you for creating this amazing skin care must have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not only allergic to everything, but of the few things I&#x27;ve tried, nothing worked very well.  Finally, after trying this product I found results with no allergy problems!  This cleared my skin up immediately.  I&#x27;m so excited!</li>
            <li> I have not found a  way to not have a rating and get it removed from Amazon&#x27;s &amp;#34;to do&amp;#34; rating list.  As such, I only gave it a 3.  I bought this for a friend and she has not had time to use it yet.</li>
