            <li>It would be great if it would just stay on!  </li>
            <li>It tastes pleasant, too!!</li>
            <li>Otherwise excellent!!</li>
            <li>I find that amazing!  </li>
            <li>This color did not look good on me at all and made my lips look like blood</li>
            <li>I love Amazon!</li>
            <li>Color looks nice with my attire.  </li>
            <li>and then it drys up, so you will need some kind of conditioner .</li>
            <li>I actually LOVE this product and the colors are vibrant and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it (wold rate as 4 star).</li>
            <li>I think people aren&#x27;t sure how to use this product and therefore don&#x27;t get the most out of it.  </li>
            <li>almost...wouldnt buy unless you like that color and no for sure.</li>
            <li>With coffee drinking and stops at the water fountain during my day this lasted for me two hours which is better than most glosses or lipsticks.  </li>
            <li>color was very nice (Blissful Brown)--I normally wear brownish tones.  </li>
            <li>the fuchsia is beautiful, berry is awesome if you like something vibrant but don&#x27;t quite want to go for red, the mauve is pretty and natural looking, this brown is also great.  </li>
            <li>otherwise the lip stain was fine.</li>
            <li>And the price was right!</li>
            <li>The color is good but the brush didn&#x27;t last through 2 uses.</li>
            <li>I apply it very carefully...barely touching my lips.  </li>
            <li>They make a product called super stay 24 hr color.</li>
            <li>Good product however its wet when you apply it</li>
            <li>I would give it a good 5 minutes and put on your other makeup.  </li>
            <li>I have nearly the whole line of colors, I love how they go on and</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care very much for the applicator tip</li>
            <li>I actually have had great success with this product despite some of the other reviews.  </li>
            <li>It gets slightly dry looking by the end of the day, but touching up with the gloss that comes with it works.  </li>
            <li>and I speak before large audiences, my appearance matters.  </li>
            <li>and it came in a real timely manner.</li>
            <li>Works ok, but I don&#x27;t get the reason for the shape, and it makes it a bit harder to apply the product evenly, I&#x27;d</li>
            <li>it is very pigmented and comes with a balm.</li>
            <li>Not as advertised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applicator very unwieldy - cannot define lip line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also fades nicely and evenly, no areas of color randomly missing.  </li>
            <li>Does not stay on long at all but try their super stay 24 color because it lasts a lot longer!</li>
            <li>So the main reason I bought</li>
            <li>but for such a blissful stain gloss, its worth reapplying.</li>
            <li>(I just use the normal primer for your face and put some on my lips).  </li>
            <li>I was hoping this new product would eliminate the need for the touchups--wishful thinking--</li>
            <li>I keep hoping someone will make a long lasting lipstick that actually lasts more than an hour or two.  </li>
            <li>A really light weight gloss, not even a little sticky that lasts quite some time.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, but it is hard to find in any stores by my house.</li>
            <li>But 3 hours after I applied the product, it was completely and totally gone from my lips.  </li>
            <li>I like several colors so far:  </li>
            <li>I love the colors that i purchased  but the wand has broken on two, already....</li>

            <li> but it goes on flat and doesn&#x27;t look glossy at all.</li>
            <li> That flat tip just bothered me.</li>
            <li> It is actually a stain that will not move for a long time (even with makeup remover</li>
            <li> I guess it might last for 10 hours if you do nothing with your mouth for that long.  </li>
            <li> not cake or flake or dry your lips.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Feels sticky when applied - takes 10 minutes to dry - then it feels pasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color</li>

            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Poor design as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>

            <li> I have purchased at least a dozen of these stains, approximately 10 at the same time.  </li>
            <li> What you want to do:  don&#x27;t treat it like a traditional stain where you want one very thin coat.  </li>
            <li> As you ladies know lipstick will fade and look dull, if you have something to eat/</li>
            <li> it is hard to take off)</li>
            <li> At least make it like a lip liner brush.  </li>
            <li> Flat, boring color.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I keep hoping someone will make a long lasting lipstick that actually lasts more than an hour or two.  This isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> I love the colors that i purchased  but the wand has broken on two, already....i see why they stopped making them....</li>
            <li> I like this product. and it came in a real timely manner.</li>
            <li> Flat, boring color. It is supposed to be a gloss but it goes on flat and doesn&#x27;t look glossy at all.</li>
            <li> I have purchased at least a dozen of these stains, approximately 10 at the same time.  Little did I know that the stain does not last 10 hours as stated. Matter of fact, it does not last two hours.  I travel a lot and I speak before large audiences, my appearance matters.  Ahhhh, I thought this would be a solution to the problem.  As you ladies know lipstick will fade and look dull, if you have something to eat/drink you have to re-apply constantly.  I cannot always rush to the powder room to do so.  Well, this was not the solution.  Color looks nice with my attire.  I am giving it three stars because of the numerous compliments I received while wearing it.</li>
            <li> Horrible never gonna buy it again</li>
            <li> Does not stay on long at all but try their super stay 24 color because it lasts a lot longer!</li>
            <li> This product claims to be a 10 hour product--states so in its name, even.  But 3 hours after I applied the product, it was completely and totally gone from my lips.  So the main reason I bought it was a wash.&lt;br /&gt;The wand for application is a bit funky.  Works ok, but I don&#x27;t get the reason for the shape, and it makes it a bit harder to apply the product evenly, I&#x27;d say.&lt;br /&gt;The color was very nice (Blissful Brown)--I normally wear brownish tones.  This one is not as deep as it looks in the tube because it&#x27;s a stain--goes on sheer.  It would be great if it would just stay on!  I have used Maybelline&#x27;s 24 hour color stay, and it does indeed stay on all day--until you take it off at night.  It gets slightly dry looking by the end of the day, but touching up with the gloss that comes with it works.  I was hoping this new product would eliminate the need for the touchups--wishful thinking--But it doesn&#x27;t hold a candle for staying power to the 24 Color Stay product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and now a word about AMAZON----AMAZING!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went through the refund process--Amazon will be refunding the purchase price without asking me to return the item.  I find that amazing!  I love Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have nearly the whole line of colors, I love how they go on and how well they stay. This is not a flat brown color, it has a very small hint of spice, even though it doesn&#x27;t appear to. I will order this color again when this runs out.</li>
            <li> The color is good but the brush didn&#x27;t last through 2 uses.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care very much for the applicator tip otherwise the lip stain was fine. That flat tip just bothered me.</li>
            <li> Such a shame these are getting discontinued!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not cake or flake or dry your lips. A really light weight gloss, not even a little sticky that lasts quite some time. Definnitely not 10 hours... but for such a blissful stain gloss, its worth reapplying. It tastes pleasant, too!!</li>
            <li> They make a product called super stay 24 hr color. It is actually a stain that will not move for a long time (even with makeup remover it is hard to take off) although it obviously won&#x27;t stay for 24 hrs. it is very pigmented and comes with a balm. I love it (wold rate as 4 star). To everyone who doesn&#x27;t like the 10 hr gloss, try the 24 hr color.</li>
            <li> The color is darker than I was hoping and frankly it just doesn&#x27;t stay. Put it on with makeup and by the time I get dressed and brush teeth - maybe 20 min - its gone. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, but it is hard to find in any stores by my house. And the price was right!</li>
            <li> Good product however its wet when you apply it and then it drys up, so you will need some kind of conditioner . Like lipgloss or something to put over that will still show the color. Otherwise excellent!!</li>
            <li> I actually have had great success with this product despite some of the other reviews.  I like several colors so far:  the fuchsia is beautiful, berry is awesome if you like something vibrant but don&#x27;t quite want to go for red, the mauve is pretty and natural looking, this brown is also great.  I think people aren&#x27;t sure how to use this product and therefore don&#x27;t get the most out of it.  It was recommended by an Ulta rep to me so I gave it a go.  What you want to do:  don&#x27;t treat it like a traditional stain where you want one very thin coat.  Put on 1 coat, then layer on another.  Let it dry a loooong time.  I would give it a good 5 minutes and put on your other makeup.  It is also advisable to use a primer under it (I just use the normal primer for your face and put some on my lips).  After letting it fully dry I use a little Philosophy lip gloss over it.  I apply it very carefully...barely touching my lips.  But this gives my lips moisture so the color isn&#x27;t drying and I have had a lot of luck with this product lasting all day when I follow this process.  It also fades nicely and evenly, no areas of color randomly missing.  I actually LOVE this product and the colors are vibrant and beautiful.  Give it a go!</li>
            <li> This color did not look good on me at all and made my lips look like blood almost...wouldnt buy unless you like that color and no for sure.</li>
            <li> I guess it might last for 10 hours if you do nothing with your mouth for that long.  With coffee drinking and stops at the water fountain during my day this lasted for me two hours which is better than most glosses or lipsticks.  One thing they can improve on is the applicator.  It&#x27;s made like a spatula ugh.  At least make it like a lip liner brush.  Poor design as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> Says gloss, no shine. I don&#x27;t find that it stays on any longer than a regular lipstick. Would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Not as advertised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applicator very unwieldy - cannot define lip line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels sticky when applied - takes 10 minutes to dry - then it feels pasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color does not last 0ne hour let alone 10!</li>
