            <li>It doesn&#x27;t solve all your problems but over time it greatly improves your skin.</li>
            <li>great product.  </li>
            <li>The Mia 2 is great because of the timer which indicates when to move on to another part of the face.</li>
            <li>I have loved my Mia and bought this as a gift for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>I love my clarisonic!</li>

            <li>I love it so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>One of my top purchases.</li>
            <li>I never realized how clean my skin could be until I got the Mia!</li>
            <li>No comparison, Clarisonic is by far a better product and my face feels amazing after I use it!</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I bought my daughter</li>
            <li>For a good gentle clean, I recommend using a Mia2.</li>
            <li>I especially love the case, and so glad I got the lime green!</li>
            <li>My face feels so smooth after using it.  </li>
            <li>works fantastic</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t see why a Clarisonic would be worth more money...until I tried it.</li>
            <li>but enclosure case is very useful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been a week, but so far, I&#x27;m impressed.  </li>
            <li>I am a Very satisfy and glad I did not pay mall prices.</li>
            <li>My skins feels fresh, awakened, revived, and glows just after one use.</li>
            <li>I have been sharing a clarisonic with my sister and have finally decided to get my own cause</li>
            <li>Totally worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This product really makes your face feel clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, doesn&#x27;t require frequent charging, and convenient to take on trips.  </li>
            <li>Works great with cleansers, even cleansing cream - and using a scrub makes the cleaning extra deep.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>the cleansing foam is larger would be better.</li>
            <li>Love it holds it charge and is simple to use and helps in keeping your skin clean and health and looking young.</li>
            <li>This was delivered quickly, and it was brand new in a sealed box.</li>
            <li>Wow, my skin has never been clean until now.</li>
            <li>Clasonic Mia@ is a nice little machine that really does the job.</li>
            <li>Only comes with one head, there are others available.</li>
            <li>It is very unflattering.</li>
            <li>The Key Lime color is so fun!</li>
            <li>This was purchased for my daughter to replace an older version that stopped working.</li>
            <li>one &amp; highly recommend for any teenager or for anyone with acne problems.  </li>
            <li>I use it everyday, and love it.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price since my skins feels luscious long after use.</li>
            <li>and my skin is so clear.  </li>
            <li>It is much more like a fluorescent yellow green, more yellow than green.</li>
            <li>Users who have sensitive skin may notice the same problem, but it fades.</li>
            <li>Within the first few times of using it I noticed a drastic difference in my skin.</li>

            <li> I was a skeptical hold out, but a colleague finally convinced me to give Clarisonic a try after telling me how much she loves hers.  </li>
            <li> My skin is a bit pink after usage.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, this particular color is terrible and is quite different in real life comparing to the picture.</li>

            <li> No more blemishes.  </li>
            <li> A bit disappointing overall - matte plastic finish looks like a child&#x27;s toy, and it dries my skin out.</li>
            <li> I still breakout but not as bad as I usually do.</li>
            <li> I had always wondered about how my troubled skin would react to this cleansing process.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I had a facial and they used a Clarisonic at the spa.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d get the same results at home since I also had micro dermabrasion, but thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.  Lo and behold, the feel is the same after just one use.  I&#x27;ve started to use it on my neck and even the back of my hands from time to time.  It truly makes a difference.  We&#x27;ll see how long the brush head lasts!</li>
            <li> This product really makes your face feel clean.  It&#x27;s easy to use, doesn&#x27;t require frequent charging, and convenient to take on trips.  I really enjoy using my Mia2!  I have roseacea, and the gentle brush head isn&#x27;t too harsh on my skin.  For a good gentle clean, I recommend using a Mia2.</li>
            <li> A bit disappointing overall - matte plastic finish looks like a child&#x27;s toy, and it dries my skin out. but enclosure case is very useful.</li>
            <li> Wow, my skin has never been clean until now. Clasonic Mia@ is a nice little machine that really does the job. I notice that wrinkles are minimized!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Very fast shipping. I am a Very satisfy and glad I did not pay mall prices.I  Willl recommend this product</li>
            <li> I left my mia 2 at a hotel, and i needed a replacement. This was delivered quickly, and it was brand new in a sealed box. The Key Lime color is so fun! Overall a great purchase!</li>
            <li> Visible difference with one use.  This was recommended because I had clogged pores.  I loved it so much I bought my daughter one &amp; highly recommend for any teenager or for anyone with acne problems.  Clears clogged pores, clears up acne &amp; reduces the size of pores.... with daily use.</li>
            <li> love this color，if the cleansing foam is larger would be better. some flaws on the surface, i can ignore those</li>
            <li> I love my clarisonic! I still breakout but not as bad as I usually do. It doesn&#x27;t solve all your problems but over time it greatly improves your skin. I love mine and I&#x27;m so happy I bought it!</li>
            <li> Love it holds it charge and is simple to use and helps in keeping your skin clean and health and looking young.</li>
            <li> My face feels so smooth after using it.  I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day for 3 weeks now and my skin is so clear.  No more blemishes.  Love it!</li>
            <li> great product.  works fantastic</li>
            <li> yes me and my daughter have one each&lt;br /&gt;we love it&lt;br /&gt;cleans my skin like anything&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> I was a skeptical hold out, but a colleague finally convinced me to give Clarisonic a try after telling me how much she loves hers.  It&#x27;s only been a week, but so far, I&#x27;m impressed.  My skin does indeed look better...not unlike the results I get from having a facial.  My skin is a bit pink after usage.  Users who have sensitive skin may notice the same problem, but it fades.</li>
            <li> Was a Mother&#x27;s Day gift and mother likes it. Nuff said. Only comes with one head, there are others available.</li>
            <li> This would have been brilliant had my ex bf not thrown it out when it arrived because we&#x27;d had a fight.</li>
            <li> I had had a knock off Clarisonic that I got at Bed Bath and Beyond a few years ago that cost around $60 and I didn&#x27;t see why a Clarisonic would be worth more money...until I tried it. No comparison, Clarisonic is by far a better product and my face feels amazing after I use it!</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my daughter to replace an older version that stopped working. It looks great! She also likes the way it lights up as it charges. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I have loved my Mia and bought this as a gift for my daughter.  We are all hooked now.  Works great with cleansers, even cleansing cream - and using a scrub makes the cleaning extra deep.</li>
            <li> I had always wondered about how my troubled skin would react to this cleansing process. It feels wonderful.  I use it everyday, and love it. I especially love the case, and so glad I got the lime green!</li>
            <li> It is a phenomenal device that truly does what it claims! My skins feels fresh, awakened, revived, and glows just after one use. It is worth the price since my skins feels luscious long after use.</li>
            <li> I am so thankful I purchased this! Within the first few times of using it I noticed a drastic difference in my skin. The acne I was getting was said to be hormonal (pregnancy) starting going away after the second use. I didn&#x27;t change cleansers, so I know it&#x27;s the actual clarisonic making all the difference. I love it!</li>
            <li> I have been sharing a clarisonic with my sister and have finally decided to get my own cause I love it so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this particular color is terrible and is quite different in real life comparing to the picture. It is much more like a fluorescent yellow green, more yellow than green. It is very unflattering.</li>
            <li> I never realized how clean my skin could be until I got the Mia! Amazing results, even my husband noticed. Totally worth every penny. The Mia 2 is great because of the timer which indicates when to move on to another part of the face. One of my top purchases.</li>
