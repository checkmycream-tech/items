            <li>Love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it seemed to be fine,</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t seem to be the original medicated formula</li>
            <li>It had a nice tingly feeling on the scalp and stops most itching literally instantly.  </li>
            <li>With my type of skin, those think greasy products just irritate my scalp, but this product is so light and fresh</li>
            <li>Once I see alil better locking after a couple months I&#x27;ll really start using this like it should be used</li>
            <li>Works almost instantly and smells good.</li>
            <li>I never suffered from dry scalp either, but I will continue to use this product because it moisturizes the scalp and makes if feel good.</li>
            <li>After using this for just a few days I cant begin to describe how great the product it.</li>
            <li>but after spraying it in it&#x27;s not nearly as strong, so i am happy with that.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased a small bottle of this spray in my local area and loved it so much I wanted more.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really does the trick!</li>
            <li>and it is a GREAT product for someone with dry scalp, especially with locks!</li>
            <li>&quot; thing and mixing my own hair products from natural essential oils and what not.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t spray as much as I should or all over cus</li>
            <li>but it really does.</li>
            <li>I appreciated the timeliness in which I received the product, but I did not want the medicated version.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing the product has natural nutrients that keep your scalp moisturized and completely gets rid of the itching sensation almost instantly.</li>
            <li>This hair mango spray it really works well</li>

            <li>One other thing i didn&#x27;t quite like was the strong candy like smell...</li>
            <li>This is a definite must have if you interlock or if you have fresh braids.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have locs, but I wear my hair in a natural state without any straighteners.  </li>
            <li>When I took my braids out, my hair was so soft.</li>
            <li>Amazon is way too high..used it twice too early to say If it stops itching or enhances growth.</li>
            <li>.I don&#x27;t have dreads but natural hair(twist styles).</li>
            <li>No More\\&quot; it completely takes care of it.</li>
            <li>It is a must have in the natural hair collection.</li>
            <li>, spray a little ( kinda like a liquid) on the spot and rub it in gently.</li>

            <li> The menthol really feels like it opens up my follicles and makes my newly locked dreads feel less tight.</li>
            <li> the itching also stopped and decreased significantly.</li>
            <li> and i would definitely recommend it to anyone with a dry itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I have to say the smell goes all day long too!  </li>
            <li> For weeks when I was growing my dreads after using some of the products provided by the same company (Jamaican Twists)I continued to scratch my head due to the drying sensation it was giving my scalp..if you use the cactus gro with the \\&quot;Itch</li>

            <li> Helps a little</li>
            <li> I spray this everyday (morning and night) on my box braids.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to mess up my 3 week old baby dreads</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this actually working</li>
            <li> No More Itch Gro Spray Maximum 16 Oz.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to see if it could alleviate the extreme itching i had been having as a result of using the wrong products on my scalp.</li>
            <li> The spray nozzle didn&#x27;t work, which rendered it useless after a day.</li>

            <li> Make sure you read what your buying, the picture says medicated but the listing is Unmedicated.</li>
            <li> I bought this to see if it could alleviate the extreme itching i had been having as a result of using the wrong products on my scalp. I have very sensitive skin and I had been trying the \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; thing and mixing my own hair products from natural essential oils and what not. But I still kept having alot of itching and discomfort. After using this for just a few days I cant begin to describe how great the product it. With my type of skin, those think greasy products just irritate my scalp, but this product is so light and fresh it doesn&#x27;t irritate me at all. It had a nice tingly feeling on the scalp and stops most itching literally instantly.  the only down side  if I could call it that) is that if you have been scratching alot, you probably have lots of cuts in your head, that will burn alot when you spray this on, but they heal in a day or so when using this anyway. One other thing i didn&#x27;t quite like was the strong candy like smell... but after spraying it in it&#x27;s not nearly as strong, so i am happy with that.  All in all a great product and i would definitely recommend it to anyone with a dry itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> Helps a little but I still itch some. I don&#x27;t spray as much as I should or all over cus I&#x27;m afraid to mess up my 3 week old baby dreads so I seperate some, spray a little ( kinda like a liquid) on the spot and rub it in gently. Once I see alil better locking after a couple months I&#x27;ll really start using this like it should be used but for now its gpod enough!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product since it has been sold at Sally&#x27;s and it is a GREAT product for someone with dry scalp, especially with locks! The 16oz is the best buy and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy another product since this one is so great!</li>
            <li> The medicated kind smells like a cough drop until the menthol dissipates, but it feels so nice on my scalp. I have psoriasis of the scalp and a very dry scalp as well and it feels so nice. Just be prepared to buy a spray bottle for it, the sprayer doesn&#x27;t spray</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this actually working but it really does. The menthol really feels like it opens up my follicles and makes my newly locked dreads feel less tight. Plus the menthol adds a cooling effect. This is a definite must have if you interlock or if you have fresh braids.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have locs, but I wear my hair in a natural state without any straighteners.  I bought this product because it smells absolutely wonderful. I have to say the smell goes all day long too!  I never suffered from dry scalp either, but I will continue to use this product because it moisturizes the scalp and makes if feel good.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does the trick! Works almost instantly and smells good. The only problem I have is the ingredients it contains which is why I give it 4 stars, But &amp;#34;If you can&#x27;t take the itch then get this s***.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I appreciated the timeliness in which I received the product, but I did not want the medicated version. I see now that it is labeled as medicated, but I didn&#x27;t see it in the title and thought it was the non-medicated product that I was searching for.</li>
            <li> I spray this everyday (morning and night) on my box braids. It has a great, non overbearing smell. the itching also stopped and decreased significantly. When I took my braids out, my hair was so soft.</li>
            <li> my bottle doesn&#x27;t say medicated but says on front of product mango lime, this non medicated doesn&#x27;t list mango lime.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair and scalp moisturized and has the best fragrance.</li>
            <li> Bought mine from Walmart for 5 bucks..Amazon is way too high..used it twice too early to say If it stops itching or enhances growth. .I don&#x27;t have dreads but natural hair(twist styles). I will update later..</li>
            <li> For weeks when I was growing my dreads after using some of the products provided by the same company (Jamaican Twists)I continued to scratch my head due to the drying sensation it was giving my scalp..if you use the cactus gro with the \\&quot;Itch No More\\&quot; it completely takes care of it. This product is amazing the product has natural nutrients that keep your scalp moisturized and completely gets rid of the itching sensation almost instantly.</li>
            <li> Did not come as described. Not medicated. On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being most effective and 1 being no change, I give this products a 7. It helped with the itch but after a few hours came back.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased a small bottle of this spray in my local area and loved it so much I wanted more.  Found the larger size here on Amazon.  Great value!  My locs love it!</li>
            <li> Love the tingly feeling!</li>
            <li> PROS&lt;br /&gt;Smells nice&lt;br /&gt;Helps hair feel fresh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t spray properly&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t seem to be the original medicated formula&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t get rid of itching</li>
            <li> The spray nozzle didn&#x27;t work, which rendered it useless after a day. Otherwise it seemed to be fine, Better packaging please!</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it. I have box braids and this spray works wonders. My scalp doesn&#x27;t itch, my hair smells delicious and I love how soft my hair feels. I am looking forward to trying other Jamaican Mango &amp; Lime products :) . It is a must have in the natural hair collection.</li>
            <li> I order this product think i would receive Medicated Jamaican Mango &amp; Lime No More Itch Gro Spray Maximum 16 Oz.  But didn&#x27;t receive what is in the sells photo, i received the non medicated version. The different between the two version being the medicated one contains menthol.</li>
            <li> It gets down to where the itch starts</li>
            <li> This hair mango spray it really works well</li>
            <li> Love this product feels amazing on the head once u spray it in like a tingly feeling</li>
